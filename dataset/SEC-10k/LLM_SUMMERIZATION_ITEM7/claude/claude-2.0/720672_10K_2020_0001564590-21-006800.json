MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe following discussion of the financial condition and results of operations of our company should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes thereto included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2020.\nUnless otherwise indicated, the terms we,\u201d us,\u201d our,\u201d or our company\u201d in this report refer to Stifel Financial Corp. and its wholly owned subsidiaries.\nExecutive Summary\nWe operate as a financial services and bank holding company. We have built a diversified business serving private clients, institutional investors, and investment banking clients located across the country. Our principal activities are: (i) private client services, including securities transaction and financial planning services; (ii) institutional equity and fixed income sales, trading, and research, and municipal finance; (iii) investment banking services, including mergers and acquisitions, public offerings, and private placements; and (iv) retail and commercial banking, including personal and commercial lending programs.\nOur core philosophy is based upon a tradition of trust, understanding, and studied advice. We attract and retain experienced professionals by fostering a culture of entrepreneurial, long-term thinking. We provide our private, institutional, and corporate clients quality, personalized service, with the theory that if we place clients' needs first, both our clients and our company will prosper. Our unwavering client and associate focus have earned us a reputation as one of the nation's leading wealth management and investment banking firms. We have grown our business both organically and through opportunistic acquisitions.\nWe plan to maintain our focus on revenue growth with a continued appreciation for the development of quality client relationships. Within our private client business, our efforts will be focused on recruiting experienced financial advisors with established client relationships. Within our capital markets business, our focus continues to be on providing quality client management and product diversification. In executing our growth strategy, we will continue to seek out opportunities that allow us to take advantage of the consolidation among middle-market firms, whereby allowing us to increase market share in our private client and institutional group businesses.\nStifel Financial Corp., through its wholly owned subsidiaries, is principally engaged in retail brokerage; securities trading; investment banking; investment advisory; retail, consumer, and commercial banking; and related financial services. Our major geographic area of concentration is throughout the United States, with a growing presence in the United Kingdom, Europe, and Canada. Our principal customers are individual investors, corporations, municipalities, and institutions.\nOur ability to attract and retain highly skilled and productive associates is critical to the success of our business. Accordingly, compensation and benefits comprise the largest component of our expenses, and our performance is dependent upon our ability to attract, develop, and retain highly skilled associates who are motivated and committed to providing the highest quality of service and guidance to our clients.\nOn May 19, 2020, the Company completed an underwritten registered public offering of $225 million 6.125% Non-Cumulative Perpetual Preferred Stock, Series C ( Series C Preferred), which included the sale of $25.0 million of Series C Preferred pursuant to an over-allotment option.\nOn May 20, 2020, we sold in a registered underwritten public offering, $400.0 million in aggregate principal amount of 4.00% senior notes due May 2030.\nOn November 11, 2020, our Board approved a 50% stock dividend, in the form of a three-for-two stock split, of our common stock payable on December 16, 2020, to shareholders of record as of December 2, 2020. All share and per share information has been retroactively adjusted to reflect the stock split.\nCOVID-19 Pandemic\nIn the first quarter of 2020, the World Health Organization declared the outbreak of a novel strand of the coronavirus ( COVID-19\u201d) a pandemic. Since that time, authorities have implemented numerous measures attempting to contain the spread and impact of COVID-19, such as travel bans and restrictions, quarantines, shelter-in-place orders, and limitations on business activity, including closures. Certain jurisdictions have begun reopening only to return to restrictions in the face of increases in new COVID-19 cases. Recent developments include the phased reopening of domestic and global markets and other economic activity to varying degrees. These measures have severely restricted global economic activity, which is disrupting global supply chains, lowering asset valuations, significantly increasing unemployment and underemployment levels, decreasing liquidity in markets for certain securities, and causing significant volatility and disruptions in the financial, energy, and commodity markets. Recent outbreaks in various states indicate that COVID-19, and related measures to address the pandemic, will continue to impact and disrupt the global and domestic economy and, by extension, our business, well into 2021.\nTo address the economic impact in the U.S., in March and April 2020, the President signed into law various stimulus packages to provide relief to businesses and individuals. In addition, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System ( Federal Reserve\u201d) has taken additional steps to bolster the economy by providing additional funding sources for small and mid-sized businesses as well as for state and local governments as they work through cash flow stresses caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as reducing the federal funds rate and the interest rate on the Federal Reserve's discount window, and implementing programs to promote liquidity in certain securities markets.\nSubsequently, in light of the foregoing government actions and more clarity from the U.S. Federal Reserve Bank on future interest rate policy, the equity markets experienced a strong rebound, and a supportive trading environment for investors has emerged along with renewed activity in the equity and debt new issue capital markets. We have experienced strong market volumes and increased client activity across our capital markets business with considerably improved performance.\nIn response to the pandemic, we implemented protocols and processes to help protect our associates and clients. These measures include:\nTable 33: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> Operating our businesses from remote locations, leveraging our business continuity plans and capabilities that include having the majority of associates work from home, and other associates operating using pre-planned contingency strategies for critical site-based operations. These capabilities have allowed us to continue to service our clients.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 34: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> Providing support to our associates during the pandemic through expanded access to wellness and healthcare remotely.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 35: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> Our information technology group has deployed remote technologies that allow associates to effectively work remotely.

In addition, we continue to provide frequent communications to our clients, employees, and regulators.\nWe test goodwill for impairment on an annual basis and on an interim basis when certain events or circumstances exist. We performed our annual impairment testing on October 1, 2020, with no impairment charges resulting from the annual impairment test. In addition, in light of the pandemic, we evaluated our assets, including goodwill and other intangibles, for potential impairment and reviewed fair values of financial instruments that are carried at fair value. Based upon our review as of December 31, 2020, no impairments have been recorded and there have been no significant changes in fair value hierarchy classifications.\nResults for the year ended December 31, 2020\nFor the year ended December 31, 2020, net revenues increased 12.4% to a record $3.8 billion compared to $3.3 billion during the comparable period in 2019. This represents our 25th consecutive year of record net revenues. Net income available to common shareholders for the year ended December 31, 2020, increased 10.5% to $476.2 million, or $4.16 per diluted common share, compared to $431.1 million, or $3.66 per diluted common share, in 2019. For the year ended December 31, 2020, our Global Wealth Management and Institutional Group segments posted record net revenues. For the year ended December 31, 2020, our Institutional Group recorded record pre-tax income.\nOur revenue growth for the year ended December 31, 2020, was primarily attributable to an increase in brokerage revenues, increased capital-raising revenues, and asset management and service fees, partially offset by lower net interest income and advisory fee revenues.\nExternal Factors Impacting Our Business\nPerformance in the financial services industry in which we operate is highly correlated to the overall strength of economic conditions and financial market activity. Overall market conditions are a product of many factors, which are beyond our control and mostly unpredictable. These factors may affect the financial decisions made by investors, including their level of participation in the financial markets. In turn, these decisions may affect our business results. With respect to financial market activity, our profitability is sensitive to a variety of factors, including the demand for investment banking services as reflected by the number and size of equity and debt financings and merger and acquisition transactions, the volatility of the equity and fixed income markets, the level and shape of various yield curves, the volume and value of trading in securities, and the value of our customers' assets under management.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has severely impacted, and will likely continue to severely impact, global economic conditions, resulting in substantial volatility in the global financial markets, increased unemployment, and operational challenges such as the temporary closures of businesses, sheltering-in-place directives, and increased remote work protocols. Governments and central banks around the world have reacted to the economic crisis caused by the pandemic by implementing stimulus and liquidity programs and cutting interest rates, though it is unclear whether these or future actions will be successful in countering the economic disruption. If the\npandemic is prolonged or the actions of governments and central banks are unsuccessful, the adverse impact on the global economy will deepen, and our results of operations and financial condition in future quarters will be adversely affected.\nEffective January 1, 2020, we adopted the new accounting standard on current expected credit losses ( CECL\u201d), under which the allowance is measured based on management's best estimate of lifetime expected credit losses. Upon adoption of the new accounting standard, we recorded a $10.4 million, or a 10.7% increase to the allowance for credit losses. In addition, during the twelve months ended December 31, 2020, we recorded additional net credit loss reserves reflecting the impact of changes in our company's outlook on estimated lifetime expected credit losses under the CECL standard due to the COVID-19 pandemic.\nOur overall financial results continue to be highly and directly correlated to the direction and activity levels of the United States equity and fixed income markets. At December 31, 2020, the key indicators of the markets' performance, the NASDAQ, the S&P 500, and Dow Jones Industrial Average closed 43.6%, 16.3%, and 7.2% higher than their December 31, 2019, closing prices, respectively.\nAs a participant in the financial services industry, we are subject to complicated and extensive regulation of our business. The recent economic and political environment has led to legislative and regulatory initiatives, both enacted and proposed, that could substantially intensify the regulation of the financial services industry and may significantly impact us.\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe following table presents consolidated financial information for the periods indicated (in thousands, except percentages):\nTable

year ended December 31, 2020, net revenues increased 12.4% to a record $3.8 billion from $3.3 billion in 2019. This represents our 25th consecutive year of record net revenues. The increase was primarily attributable to an increase in brokerage revenues, increased capital-raising revenues, and asset management and service fees, partially offset by lower net interest income and advisory fee revenues.\nCommissions - Commission revenues are primarily generated from agency transactions in OTC and listed equity securities, insurance products, and options. In addition, commission revenues also include distribution fees for promoting and distributing mutual funds.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2020, commission revenues increased 14.0% to $760.6 million from $667.5 million in 2019. The increase is primarily attributable to an increase in equities trading and private placement commissions over 2019. The increase in trading volumes during 2020 was primarily due to market volatility caused by the economic uncertainty created by the COVID-19 pandemic.\nPrincipal transactions - Principal transaction revenues are gains and losses on secondary trading, principally fixed income brokerage revenues.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2020, principal transactions revenues increased 45.3% to $588.3 million from $404.8 million in 2019. The increase is primarily attributable to strong client engagement and market volatility, as well as an increase in trading gains over 2019.\nInvestment banking - Investment banking revenues include: (i) capital-raising revenues representing fees earned from the underwriting of debt and equity securities, and (ii) advisory fees related to corporate debt and equity offerings, municipal debt offerings, merger and acquisitions, private placements, and other investment banking advisory fees.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2020, investment banking revenues increased 16.5% to a record $952.3 million from $817.4 million in 2019. The increase is primarily attributable to the growth of equity and fixed income capital-raising revenues, partially offset by lower advisory fee revenue.\nCapital-raising revenues increased 41.9% to $524.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, from $369.4 million in 2019. For the year ended December 31, 2020, equity capital-raising revenues increased 51.8% to $343.3 million from $226.2 million in 2019. For the year ended December 31, 2020, fixed income capital-raising revenues increased 26.3% to $180.9 million from $143.2 million in 2019.\nAdvisory fees decreased 4.4% to $428.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, from $448.0 million in 2019. Advisory fee revenues were negatively impacted by the decrease in industry-wide completed mergers and acquisitions transactions, which was driven by an increase in market volatility and the economic slow-down in 2020.\nAsset management and service fees - Asset management and service fees include fees for asset-based financial services provided to individuals and institutional clients. Investment advisory fees are charged based on the value of assets in fee-based accounts. Asset management and service fees are affected by changes in the balances of client assets due to market fluctuations and levels of net new client assets.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2020, asset management and service fee revenues increased 8.2% to a record $917.4 million from $848.0 million in 2019. The increase is primarily attributable to higher asset values and strong fee-based asset flows. Please refer to Asset management and service fees\u201d in the Global Wealth Management segment discussion for information on the changes in asset management and service fees revenues.\nOther income - For the year ended December 31, 2020, other income increased 43.8% to $75.3 million from $52.4 million during 2019. The increase is primarily attributable to the gain recognized on the sale of Ziegler Capital Management, LLC in the first quarter of 2020 and an increase in loan origination fees, partially offset by investment losses.\nYear Ended December 31, 2019, Compared With Year Ended December 31, 2018\nFor the year ended December 31, 2019, net revenues increased 10.3% to $3.3 billion from $3.0 billion in 2018. The increase is primarily attributable to an increase in investment banking revenues, higher net interest income as a result of an increase in interest-earning assets at Stifel Bancorp, an increase in brokerage revenues, and the growth in asset management and service fees as a result of increased assets under management.\nCommissions - For the year ended December 31, 2019, commission revenues increased 1.5% to $667.5 million from $657.7 million in 2018. The increase is primarily attributable to an increase in trading volumes.\nPrincipal transactions - For the year ended December 31, 2019, principal transactions revenues increased 15.2% to $404.8 million from $351.4 million in 2018. The increase is primarily attributable to higher institutional fixed income brokerage revenues, as well as the contribution from the First Empire acquisition that closed during the first quarter of 2019.\nInvestment banking - For the year ended December 31, 2019, investment banking revenues increased 15.5% to $817.4 million from $707.7 million in 2018. The increase is primarily attributable to the growth of advisory fee revenue and fixed income capital-raising revenues, partially offset by lower equity capital-raising revenues.\nAdvisory fees increased 20.6% to $448.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, from $371.5 million in 2018. The increase is primarily attributable to an increase in the number of completed advisory transactions during 2019, including growth in our fund placement business.\nCapital-raising revenues increased 9.9% to $369.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, from $336.2 million in 2018. For the year ended December 31, 2019, equity capital-raising revenues decreased 0.1% to $226.2 million from $226.5 million in 2018. For the year ended December 31, 2019, fixed income capital-raising revenues increased 30.5% to $143.2 million from $109.7 million in 2018.\nAsset management and service fees - For the year ended December 31, 2019, asset management and service fee revenues increased 5.2% to $848.0 million from $806.2 million in 2018. The increase is primarily a result of an increase in the number and value of fee-based accounts, an increase in fees earned on client cash balances, and an increase of interest rates on fees earned on client cash. See Asset management and service fees\u201d in the Global Wealth Management segment discussion for information on the changes in asset management and service fees revenues.\nOther income - For the year ended December 31, 2019, other income increased 105.0% to $52.4 million from $25.6 million in 2018. The increase is primarily attributable to an increase in loan origination fees and a decline in investment losses from 2018.\nNET INTEREST INCOME\nThe following tables present average balance data and

</tr>\n</table>\nYear Ended December 31, 2020, Compared With Year Ended December 31, 2019\nNet interest income - Net interest income is the difference between interest earned on interest-earning assets and interest paid on funding sources. Net interest income is affected by changes in the volume and mix of these assets and liabilities, as well as by fluctuations in interest rates and portfolio management strategies. For the year ended December 31, 2020, net interest income decreased 16.3% to $458.1 million from $547.0 million in 2019. Decreases in short-term interest rates have had a negative impact on our results, in particular on our net interest income. The Federal Reserve significantly further lowered interest rates in response to COVID-19 pandemic concerns.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2020, interest revenue decreased 27.7% to $523.8 million from $724.9 million in 2019, principally as a result of a decrease in interest revenue generated from interest-earning assets of Stifel Bancorp due to lower interest rates. The average interest-earning assets of Stifel Bancorp increased to $18.0 billion during the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to $16.5 billion during 2019 at average interest rates of 2.70% and 3.78%, respectively.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2020, interest expense decreased 63.0% to $65.8 million from $177.9 million in 2019. The decrease is primarily driven by the impact of lower interest rates, partially offset by the increase interest expense on our senior notes. In May 2020, we sold in a registered underwritten public offering, $400.0 million in aggregate principal amount of 4.00% senior notes due May 2030. In December 2020, our $300.0 million notes matured.\nYear Ended December 31, 2019, Compared With Year Ended December 31, 2018\nNet interest income - For the year ended December 31, 2019, net interest income increased 14.8% to $547.0 million from $476.4 million in 2018.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2019, interest revenue increased 12.1% to $724.9 million from $646.4 million in 2018, principally as a result of a $66.4 million increase in interest revenue generated from the growth in interest-earning assets of Stifel Bancorp and higher margin interest income. The average interest-earning assets of Stifel Bancorp increased to $16.5 billion during the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to $15.8 billion in 2018 at average interest rates of 3.78% and 3.52%, respectively.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2019, interest expense increased 4.6% to $177.9 million from $170.1 million in 2018. The increase is primarily attributable to an increase in interest-bearing liabilities (deposits) at Stifel Bancorp, partially offset by a decrease in Federal Home Loan Bank advances.\nNON-INTEREST EXPENSES\nThe following table presents consolidated non-interest expenses for the periods indicated (in thousands, except percentages):\nTable 42: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> For the Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Percentage Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2020 vs. 2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2019 vs. 2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Non-interest expenses:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Compensation and benefits\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 2,279,335\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,978,116\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,770,762\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 15.2\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 11.7\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Occupancy and equipment rental\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 274,664\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 242,893\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 222,384\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 13.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 9.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Communications and office supplies\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 164,736\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 147,428\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 140,254\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 11.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 5.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Commissions and floor brokerage\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 55,960\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 44,011\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 41,967\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 27.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 4.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Provision for credit losses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 33,925\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 9,977\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 18,366\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 240.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (45.7\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other operating expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 292,281\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 315,467\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 296,786\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (7.3\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 6.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total non-interest expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 3,100,901\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 2,737,892\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 2,490,519\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 13.3\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 9.9\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nYear Ended December 31, 2020, Compared With Year Ended December 31, 2019\nCompensation and benefits - Compensation and benefits expenses, which are the largest component of our expenses, include salaries, bonuses, transition pay, benefits, amortization of stock-based compensation, employment taxes, and other associate-related costs. A significant portion of compensation expense is comprised of production-based variable compensation, including discretionary bonuses, which fluctuates in proportion to the level of business activity, increasing with higher revenues and operating profits. Other compensation costs, including base salaries, stock-based compensation amortization, and benefits, are more fixed in nature.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2020, compensation and benefits expense increased 15.2% to $2.3 billion from $2.0 billion in 2019. The increase is primarily attributable to higher variable compensation expense as a result of strong revenue growth over 2019. Compensation and benefits expense as a percentage of net revenues was 60.7% for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to 59.3% for the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase was primarily attributable to the change in the composition of revenues as compared to 2019.\nOccupancy and equipment rental - For the year ended December 31, 2020, occupancy and equipment rental expense increased 13.1% to $274.7 million from $242.9 million in 2019. The increase is primarily attributable to higher occupancy costs as a result of an increase in locations and higher data processing costs associated with an increase in business activity.\nCommunications and office supplies - Communications expense includes costs for telecommunication and data transmission, primarily for obtaining third-party market data information. For the year ended December 31, 2020, communications and office supplies expense increased 11.7% to $164.7 million from $147.4 million in 2019. The increase is primarily attributable to higher communication and quote equipment expenses and shipping costs associated with the continued growth of our business.\nCommissions and floor brokerage - For the year ended December 31, 2020, commissions and floor brokerage expense increased 27.2% to $56.0 million from $44.0 million in 2019. The increase is primarily attributable to higher volume-related expenses, including brokerage trading costs, reflecting an increase in activity levels.\nProvision for credit losses - For the year ended December 31, 2020, provision for credit losses increased 240.0% to $33.9 million from $10.0 million in 2019. The provision for credit losses was impacted by growth in the loan portfolio and the impact of accounting for credit losses under the CECL standard, which was heightened by the impact of COVID-19 on the broader economic environment.\nOther operating expenses - Other operating expenses primarily include license and registration fees, litigation-related expenses, which consist of amounts we reserve and/or payout for legal and regulatory matters, travel and entertainment, promotional, investment banking deal costs, and professional service expenses.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2020, other operating expenses decreased 7.3% to $292.3 million from $315.5 million in 2019. The decrease is primarily attributable to significantly lower travel, entertainment, and conference-related expenses. In addition, net provisions for litigation matters were lower. These decreases were partially offset by higher taxes and licensing fees, professional fees, investment banking transaction expenses, reflecting an increase in activity levels, and insurance costs.\nProvision for income taxes - For the year ended December 31, 2020, our provision for income taxes was $147.7 million, representing an effective tax rate of 22.7%, compared to $149.2 million in 2019, representing an effective tax rate of 25.0%.\nYear Ended December 31, 2019, Compared With Year Ended December 31, 2018\nExcept as noted in the following discussion of variances, the underlying reasons for the increase in non-interest expenses can be attributed principally to our continued expansion, both organically and through our acquisitions, and increased administrative overhead to support the growth in our segments.\nCompensation and benefits - For the year ended December 31, 2019, compensation and benefits expense increased 11.7% to $2.0 billion from $1.8 billion in 2018. The increase is primarily attributable to higher compensation costs associated with the current year acquisitions.\nCompensation and benefits expense as a percentage of net revenues was 59.3% for the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to 58.5% for the year ended December 31, 2018.\nOccupancy and equipment rental - For the year ended December 31, 2019, occupancy and equipment rental expense increased 9.2% to $242.9 million from $222.4 million in 2018. The increase is primarily attributable to an increase in depreciation expense as a result of the expansion of our aircraft engine leasing business, an increase in data processing costs associated with the growth of our business, and higher rent expense as a result of an increase in locations.\nCommunications and office supplies - For the year ended December 31, 2019, communications and office supplies expense increased 5.1% to $147.4 million from $140.3 million in 2018. The increase is primarily attributable to higher communication and quote equipment expenses associated with the continued growth of our business.\nCommissions and floor brokerage - For the year ended December 31, 2019, commissions and floor brokerage expense increased 4.9% to $44.0 million from $42.0 million in 2018. The increase is primarily attributable to an increase in institutional fixed income brokerage trading volumes.\nProvision for credit losses - For the year ended December 31, 2019, provision for credit losses decreased 45.7% to $10.0 million from $18.4 million in 2018.\nOther operating expenses - For the year ended December 31, 2019, other operating expenses increased 6.3% to $315.5 million from $296.8 million in 2018. The increase is primarily attributable to higher investment banking deal costs, travel costs, litigation expense, dues and assessments, and subscription costs.\nProvision for income taxes - For the year ended December 31, 2019, our provision for income taxes was $149.2 million, representing an effective tax rate of 25.0%, compared to $140.4 million in 2018, representing an effective tax rate of 26.3%.\nSEGMENT PERFORMANCE FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS\nOur reportable segments include Global Wealth Management, Institutional Group, and Other.\nOur Global Wealth Management segment consists of two businesses, the Private Client Group and Stifel Bancorp. The Private Client Group includes branch offices and independent contractor offices of our broker-dealer subsidiaries located throughout the United States. These branches provide securities brokerage services, including the sale of equities, mutual funds, fixed income products, and insurance, as well as offering banking products to their private clients through our bank subsidiaries, which provide residential, consumer, and commercial lending, as well as FDIC-insured deposit accounts to customers of our broker-dealer subsidiaries and to the general public.\nThe success of our Global Wealth Management segment is dependent upon the quality of our products, services, financial advisors, and support personnel, including our ability to attract, retain, and motivate a sufficient number of these associates. We face competition for qualified associates from major financial services companies, including other brokerage firms, insurance companies, banking institutions, and discount brokerage firms. Segment revenue growth, operating income, and segment pre-tax operating margin are used to evaluate and measure segment performance by our management team in deciding how to allocate resources and in assessing performance.\nThe Institutional Group segment includes institutional sales and trading. It provides securities brokerage, trading, and research services to institutions with an emphasis on the sale of equity and fixed income products. This segment also includes the management of and participation in underwritings for both corporate and public finance (exclusive of sales credits generated through the Private Client Group, which are included in the Global Wealth Management segment), merger and acquisition, and financial advisory services.\nThe success of our Institutional Group segment is dependent upon the quality of our personnel, the quality and selection of our investment products and services, pricing (such as execution pricing and fee levels), and reputation. Segment operating income and segment pre-tax operating margin are used to evaluate and measure segment performance by our management team in deciding how to allocate resources and in assessing performance.\nThe Other segment includes interest income from stock borrow activities, unallocated interest expense, interest income and gains and losses from investments held, amortization of stock-based awards, and all unallocated overhead cost associated with the execution of orders; processing of securities transactions; custody of client securities; receipt, identification, and delivery of funds and securities; compliance with regulatory and legal requirements; internal financial accounting and controls; and general administration and acquisition charges.\nResults of

The increase in net revenues for the year ended December 31, 2020, over 2019, is primarily attributable to the growth in asset management and service fee revenues and higher brokerage revenues and other income, partially offset by a decrease in net interest income and investment banking.\nCommissions - For the year ended December 31, 2020, commission revenues increased 7.5% to $513.2 million from $477.4 million in 2019. The increase is primarily attributable to an increase in equities trading and private placement commissions over 2019.\nPrincipal transactions - For the year ended December 31, 2020, principal transactions revenues increased 1.0% to $174.1 million from $172.3 million in 2019. The increase is primarily attributable to strong client engagement and market volatility.\nBrokerage revenues - For the year ended December 31, 2020, brokerage revenues increased 5.8% to $687.3 million from $649.7 million in the comparable period in 2019. The increase is primarily attributable to higher trading volumes during 2020, driven by market volatility, as a result of the economic uncertainty created by the COVID-19 pandemic.\nAsset management and service fees - For the year ended December 31, 2020, asset management and service fees increased 8.2% to $917.4 million from $848.0 million in 2019. Asset management revenues increased from 2019, reflecting higher asset levels and strong fee-based asset flows. Fee-based account revenues are primarily billed based on asset values at the end the prior quarter.\nClient asset metrics as of the periods indicated (in thousands):\nTable 46: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Percentage Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2020 vs. 2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2019 vs. 2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Client assets\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 357,429,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 329,495,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 269,862,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 8.5\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 22.1\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Fee-based client assets\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 129,372,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 117,189,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 90,174,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 10.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 30.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Number of client accounts\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,075,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,020,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 983,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 5.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Number of fee-based client accounts\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 262,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 229,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 208,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 14.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 10.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe increase in the value of our client assets and fee-based assets was primarily attributable to the rise in the markets, as well as asset growth resulting from strong recruiting efforts. The growth of our client assets was negatively impacted by the sale of Ziegler Capital Management LLC during the first quarter of 2020.\nInterest revenue - For the year ended December 31, 2020, interest revenue decreased 24.3% to $516.9 million from $682.7 million in 2019.

Compensation and benefits expense as a percentage of net revenues was 52.0% for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to 49.1% in 2019. The increase was primarily attributable to the change in the composition of revenues as compared to 2019.\nOccupancy and equipment rental - For the year ended December 31, 2020, occupancy and equipment rental expense increased 2.5% to $122.9 million from $119.9 million in 2019. The increase is primarily attributable to higher occupancy costs as a result of an increase in locations and higher data processing costs associated with an increase in business activity.\nCommunications and office supplies - For the year ended December 31, 2020, communications and office supplies expense increased 1.7% to $58.2 million from $57.2 million in 2019.

The provision for credit losses was impacted by growth in the loan portfolio and the impact of accounting for credit losses under the CECL standard, which was heightened by the impact of COVID-19 on the broader economic environment.\nOther operating expenses - For the year ended December 31, 2020, other operating expenses decreased 1.7% to $89.5 million from $91.1 million in 2019.

Profit margins (income before income taxes as a percent of net revenues) have decreased to 33.1% for the year ended December 31, 2020, from 36.9% in 2019. Profit margins were negatively impacted by the composition of net revenues compared to 2019.

The increase is primarily a result of continued migration to fee-based accounts and our continued expansion in the asset management business. Fee-based account revenues are primarily billed based on values as of the prior quarter end.\nThe value of assets in fee-based accounts at December 31, 2019, increased 30.0% to $117.2 billion from $90.2 billion at December 31, 2018.\nInterest revenue- For the year ended December 31, 2019, interest revenue increased 11.1% to $682.7 million from $614.7 million in 2018.

Net interest income is affected by changes in the volume and mix of these assets and liabilities, as well as by fluctuations in interest rates and portfolio management strategies.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2020, interest revenue for Stifel Bancorp of $485.3 million was generated from weighted-average interest-earning assets of $18.0 billion at a weighted-average interest rate of 2.70%. For the year ended December 31, 2019, interest revenue for Stifel Bancorp of $624.2 million was generated from weighted-average interest-earning assets of $16.5 billion at a weighted-average interest rate of 3.78%. For the year ended December 31, 2018, interest revenue for Stifel Bancorp of $557.8 million was generated from weighted-average interest-earning assets of $15.8 billion at a weighted-average interest rate of 3.52%. Interest-\nearning assets principally consist of commercial and industrial, residential, and securities-based loans, investment securities, and interest-bearing cash and federal funds sold.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2020, interest expense for Stifel Bancorp of $18.3 million was incurred from weighted-average interest-bearing liabilities of $16.5 billion at a weighted-average interest rate of 0.11%. For the year ended December 31, 2019, interest expense for Stifel Bancorp of $103.8 million was incurred from weighted-average interest-bearing liabilities of $15.4 billion at a weighted-average interest rate of 0.68%. For the year ended December 31, 2018, interest expense for Stifel Bancorp of $98.2 million was incurred from weighted-average interest-bearing liabilities of $14.8 billion at a weighted-average interest rate of 0.67%. Interest expense represents interest on customer money market accounts, time deposits, Federal Home Loan Bank advances, and other borrowings.\nDecreases in short-term interest rates have had a negative impact on our results, in particular on our net interest income. The Federal Reserve significantly further lowered interest rates in response to COVID-19 pandemic concerns.\nThe following table sets forth an analysis of the effect on net interest income of volume

If our company intends to sell or believes it is more likely than not that it will be required to sell the debt security, it is written down to fair value through earnings. For available-for-sale debt securities our company intends to hold, we evaluate the debt securities for expected credit losses except for debt securities that are guaranteed by the U.S. Treasury or U.S. government agencies where we apply a zero credit loss assumption. For the remaining available-for-sale debt securities, we consider qualitative parameters such as internal and external credit ratings and the value of underlying collateral. If an available-for-sale debt security fails any of the qualitative parameters, a discounted cash flow analysis is used by our company to determine if a portion of the unrealized loss is a result of a credit loss. Any credit losses determined are recognized as an increase to the allowance for credit losses through provision expense recorded in the consolidated statement of operations in provision for credit losses. Cash flows expected to be collected are estimated using all relevant information available, such as remaining payment terms, prepayment speeds, the financial condition of the issuer, expected defaults, and the value of the underlying collateral. If any of the decline in fair value is related to market factors, that amount is recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income. In certain instances, the credit loss may exceed the total decline in fair value, in which case, the allowance recorded is limited to the difference between the amortized cost and the fair value of the asset. We separately evaluate our held-to-maturity debt securities for any credit losses. We perform a discounted cash flow analysis to estimate any credit losses, which are then recognized as part of the allowance for credit losses. For available-for-sale and held-to-maturity debt securities, we have established a nonaccrual policy that results in timely write-off of accrued interest.\nThe maturities and related weighted-average

At the time a loan is determined to be impaired, the accrual of interest and amortization of deferred loan origination fees is discontinued ( non-accrual status\u201d) and any accrued and unpaid interest income is reversed. At December 31, 2020, we had $13.8 million of impaired loans, net of discounts, which included $0.2 million in troubled debt restructurings.

net revenues increased 30.4% to a record $1.6 billion from $1.2 billion in 2019.

Total assets of $26.6 billion at December 31, 2020, were up 8.1% over December 31, 2019. Our broker-dealer subsidiary's gross assets and liabilities, including financial instruments owned, stock loan/borrow, receivables and payables from/to brokers, dealers, and clearing organizations and clients, fluctuate with our business levels and overall market conditions.\nAs of December 31, 2020, our liabilities were comprised primarily of deposits of $17.4 billion at Stifel Bancorp, accounts payable and accrued expenses of $1.2 billion, senior notes, net of debt issuance costs, of $1.1 billion, payables to customers of $1.1 billion at our broker-dealer subsidiaries, and accrued employee compensation of $638.3 million. To meet our obligations to clients and operating needs, we had $2.3 billion in cash and cash equivalents at December 31, 2020. We also had highly liquid assets consisting of held-to-maturity securities of $4.1 billion, available-for-sale securities of $2.2 billion, client brokerage receivables of $936.5 million, and financial instruments of $694.0 million.\nCash Flow\nCash and cash equivalents increased $1.1 billion to $2.3 billion at December 31, 2020, from $1.1 billion at December 31, 2019. Operating activities provided cash of $1.7 billion primarily due to net income recognized in 2020 adjusted for non-cash activities. Investing activities used cash of $1.7 billion due to the growth of the loan portfolio, investment securities purchases, and fixed asset purchases, partially offset by proceeds from the sale and maturity of securities in our investment portfolio and the proceeds received from the sale of ZCM. Financing activities provided cash of $1.2 billion primarily due to an increase in bank deposits and proceeds received from the issuance of senior notes and preferred stock, partially offset by a decrease in securities loaned, repayments of senior notes and Federal Home Loan Bank advances, dividends paid on our common and preferred stock, and share repurchases.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nThe Company's senior management establishes the liquidity and capital policies of our company. The Company's senior management reviews business performance relative to these policies, monitors the availability of alternative sources of financing, and oversees the liquidity and interest rate sensitivity of our company's asset and liability position.\nOur assets, consisting mainly of cash or assets readily convertible into cash, are our principal source of liquidity. The liquid nature of these assets provides for flexibility in managing and financing the projected operating needs of the business. These assets are financed primarily by our equity capital, corporate debt, debentures to trusts, client credit balances, short-term bank loans, proceeds from securities lending, repurchase agreements, and other payables. We currently finance our client accounts and firm trading positions through ordinary course borrowings at floating interest rates from various banks on a demand basis, securities lending, and repurchase agreements, with company-owned and client securities pledged as collateral. Changes in securities market volumes, related client borrowing demands, underwriting activity, and levels of securities inventory affect the amount of our financing requirements.\nOur bank assets consist principally of available-for-sale and held-to-maturity securities, retained loans, and cash and cash equivalents. Stifel Bancorp's current liquidity needs are generally met through deposits from brokerage clients and equity capital. We monitor the liquidity of our bank subsidiaries daily to ensure their ability to meet customer deposit withdrawals, maintain reserve requirements, and support asset growth.\nAs of December 31, 2020, we had $26.6 billion in assets, $10.1 billion of which consisted of cash or assets readily convertible into cash as follows (in thousands, except average days to conversion):\nTable 90: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Average\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Conversion\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Cash and cash equivalents\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 2,279,274\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,142,596\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Receivables from brokers, dealers, and clearing organizations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 549,492\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 627,790\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 5 days\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Securities purchased under agreements to resell\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 217,930\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 385,008\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1 day\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Financial instruments owned at fair value\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 682,744\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 963,606\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3 days\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Available-for-sale securities at fair value\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,230,297\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3,254,737\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3 days\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Held-to-maturity securities at amortized cost\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 4,117,384\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,856,219\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 4 days\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Investments\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 42,429\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 49,980\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 10 days\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total cash and assets readily convertible to cash\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 10,119,550\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 9,279,936\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nAs of December 31, 2020 and 2019, the amount of collateral by asset class is as follows (in thousands):\nTable 91: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> December 31, 2020\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> December 31, 2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Contractual\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Contingent\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Contractual\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Contingent\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Cash and cash equivalents\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 155,081\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 98,250\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Financial instruments owned at fair value\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 190,955\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 190,955\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 391,634\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 391,634\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Investment portfolio (AFS & HTM)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,764,421\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,617,688\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 346,036\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,955,376\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 489,884\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 2,009,322\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nLiquidity Available From Subsidiaries\nLiquidity is principally available to our company from Stifel and Stifel Bancorp.\nStifel is required to maintain net capital equal to the greater of $1 million or two percent of aggregate debit items arising from client transactions. Covenants in the Company's committed financing facilities require the excess net capital of Stifel, our principal broker-dealer subsidiary, to be above a defined amount. At December 31, 2020, Stifel's excess net capital exceeded the minimum requirement, as defined. There are also limitations on the amount of dividends that may be declared by a broker-dealer without FINRA approval. See Note 18 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for more information on the capital restrictions placed on our broker-dealer subsidiaries.\nStifel Bancorp may pay dividends to the parent company without prior approval by its regulator as long as the dividend does not exceed the sum of Stifel Bancorp's current calendar year and the previous two calendar years' retained net income and Stifel Bancorp maintains its targeted capital to risk-weighted assets ratios.\nAlthough we have liquidity available to us from our other subsidiaries, the available amounts are not as significant as the amounts described above and, in certain instances, may be subject to regulatory requirements.\nCapital Management\nWe have an ongoing authorization from the Board of Directors to repurchase our common stock in the open market or in negotiated transactions. At December 31, 2020, the maximum number of shares that may yet be purchased under this plan was 13.3 million. We utilize the share repurchase program to manage our equity capital relative to the growth of our business and help to meet obligations under our employee benefit plans.\nLiquidity Risk Management\nOur businesses are diverse, and our liquidity needs are determined by many factors, including market movements, collateral requirements, and client commitments, all of which can change dramatically in a difficult funding environment. During a liquidity crisis, credit-sensitive funding, including unsecured debt and some types of secured financing agreements, may be unavailable, and the terms (e.g., interest rates, collateral provisions, and tenor) or availability of other types of secured financing may change. We manage liquidity risk by diversifying our funding sources across products and among individual counterparties within those products. These liquidity risk management practices have allowed us to effectively manage the market stress from the COVID-19 pandemic. For more information on the effects of the pandemic, see Executive Summary - COVID-19 Pandemic on page 31.\nAs a holding company, whereby all of our operations are conducted through our subsidiaries, our cash flow and our ability to service our debt, including the notes, depend upon the earnings of our subsidiaries. Our subsidiaries are separate and distinct legal entities. Our subsidiaries have no obligation to pay any amounts due on the notes or to provide us with funds to pay our obligations, whether by dividends, distributions, loans, or other payments.\nOur liquidity requirements may change in the event we need to raise more funds than anticipated to increase inventory positions, support more rapid expansion, develop new or enhanced services and products, acquire technologies, respond to acquisition opportunities, expand our recruiting efforts, or respond to other unanticipated liquidity requirements. We primarily rely on financing activities and distributions from our subsidiaries for funds to implement our business and growth strategies and repurchase our shares. Net capital rules, restrictions under our borrowing arrangements of our subsidiaries, as well as the earnings, financial condition, and cash requirements of our subsidiaries, may each limit distributions to us from our subsidiaries.\nThe availability of outside financing, including access to the capital markets and bank lending, depends on a variety of factors, such as market conditions, the general availability of credit, the volume of trading activities, the overall availability of credit to the financial services sector, and our credit rating. Our cost and availability of funding may be adversely affected by illiquid credit markets and wider credit spreads. As a result of any future concerns about the stability of the markets generally and the strength of counterparties specifically, lenders may from time to time curtail, or even cease to provide, funding to borrowers.\nOur liquidity management policies are designed to mitigate the potential risk that we may be unable to access adequate financing to service our financial obligations without material business impact. The principal elements of our liquidity management framework are: (a) daily monitoring of our liquidity needs at the holding company and significant subsidiary level, (b) stress testing the liquidity positions of Stifel and our bank subsidiaries, and (c) diversification of our funding sources.\nMonitoring of liquidity - Senior management establishes our liquidity and capital policies. These policies include senior management's review of short- and long-term cash flow forecasts, review of monthly capital expenditures, the monitoring of the availability of alternative sources of financing, and the daily monitoring of liquidity in our significant subsidiaries. Our decisions on the allocation of capital to our business units consider, among other factors, projected profitability and cash flow, risk, and impact on future liquidity needs. Our treasury department assists in evaluating, monitoring, and controlling the impact that our business activities have on our financial condition, liquidity, and capital structure, as well as maintains our relationships with various lenders. The objectives of these policies are to support the successful execution of our business strategies while ensuring ongoing and sufficient liquidity.\nLiquidity stress testing (Firmwide) - A liquidity stress test model is maintained by the Company that measures liquidity outflows across multiple scenarios at the major operating subsidiaries and details the corresponding impact to our holding company and the overall consolidated firm. Liquidity stress tests are utilized to ensure that current exposures are consistent with the Company's established liquidity risk tolerance and, more specifically, to identify and quantify sources of potential liquidity strain. Further, the stress tests are utilized to analyze possible impacts on the Company's cash flows and liquidity position. The outflows are modeled over a 30-day liquidity stress timeframe and include the impact of idiosyncratic and macro-economic stress events.\nThe assumptions utilized in the Company's liquidity stress tests include, but are not limited to, the following:\nTable 92: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> No government support\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 93: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> No access to equity and unsecured debt markets within the stress horizon\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 94: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> Higher haircuts and significantly lower availability of secured funding\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 95: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> Additional collateral that would be required by trading counter-parties, certain exchanges, and clearing organizations related to credit rating downgrades\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 96: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> Client cash withdrawals and inability to accept new deposits\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 97: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> Increased demand from customers on the funding of loans and lines of credit\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nAt December 31, 2020, the Company maintained sufficient liquidity to meet current and contingent funding obligations as modeled in its liquidity stress test model.\nLiquidity stress testing (Stifel Bancorp) - Our bank subsidiaries perform three primary stress tests on its liquidity position. These stress tests are based on the following company-specific stresses: (1) the amount of deposit run-off that they could withstand over a one-month period of time based on their on-balance sheet liquidity and available credit, (2) the ability to fund operations if all available credit were to be drawn immediately, with no additional available credit, and (3) the ability to fund operations under a regulatory prompt corrective action. The goal of these stress tests is to determine their ability to fund continuing operations under significant pressures on both assets and liabilities.\nUnder all stress tests, our bank subsidiaries consider cash and highly liquid investments as available to meet liquidity needs. In its analysis, our bank subsidiaries consider agency mortgage-backed securities, corporate bonds, and commercial mortgage-backed securities as highly liquid. In addition to being able to be readily financed at modest haircut levels, our bank subsidiaries estimate that each of the individual securities within each of the asset classes described above could be sold into the market and converted into cash within three business days under normal market conditions, assuming that the entire portfolio of a given asset class was not simultaneously liquidated. At December 31, 2020, available cash and highly liquid investments comprised approximately 18% of Stifel Bancorp's assets, which was well in excess of its internal target.\nIn addition to these stress tests, management performs a daily liquidity review. The daily analysis provides management with all major fluctuations in liquidity. The analysis also tracks the proportion of deposits that Stifel Bancorp is sweeping from its affiliated broker-dealer, Stifel. On a monthly basis, liquidity key performance indicators and compliance with liquidity policy limits are reported to the Board of Directors. Our bank subsidiaries have not violated any internal liquidity policy limits.\nFunding Sources\nThe Company pursues a strategy of diversification of secured and unsecured funding sources (by product and by investor) and attempts to ensure that the tenor of the Company's liabilities equals or exceeds the expected holding period of the assets being financed. The Company funds its balance sheet through diverse sources. These sources may include the Company's equity capital, long-term debt, repurchase agreements, securities lending, deposits, committed and uncommitted credit facilities, Federal Home Loan Bank advances, and federal funds agreements.\nCash and Cash Equivalents - We held $2.3 billion of cash and cash equivalents at December 31, 2020, compared to $1.1 billion at December 31, 2019. Cash and cash equivalents provide immediate sources of funds to meet our liquidity needs.\nSecurities Available-for-Sale - We held $2.2 billion in available-for-sale investment securities at December 31, 2020, compared to $3.3 billion at December 31, 2019. As of December 31, 2020, the weighted-average life of the investment securities portfolio was approximately 0.9 years. These investment securities provide increased liquidity and flexibility to support our company's funding requirements.\nWe monitor the available-for-sale investment portfolio for other-than-temporary impairment based on a number of criteria, including the size of the unrealized loss position, the duration for which the security has been in a loss position, credit rating, the nature of the investments, and current market conditions. For debt securities, we also consider any intent to sell the security and the likelihood we will be required to sell the security before its anticipated recovery. We continually monitor the ratings of our security holdings and conduct regular reviews of our credit-sensitive assets.\nDeposits - Deposits have become our largest funding source. Deposits provide a stable, low-cost source of funds that we utilize to fund asset growth and to diversify funding sources. We have continued to expand our deposit-gathering efforts through our existing private client network and through expansion. These channels offer a broad set of deposit products that include demand deposits, money market deposits, and certificates of deposit ( CDs\u201d).\nAs of December 31, 2020, we had $17.4 billion in deposits compared to $15.3 billion at December 31, 2019. Our core deposits are primarily comprised of money market deposit accounts, non-interest-bearing deposits, and CDs.\nShort-term borrowings - Our short-term financing is generally obtained through short-term bank line financing on an uncommitted, secured basis, securities lending arrangements, repurchase agreements, advances from the Federal Home Loan Bank, term loans, and committed bank line financing on an unsecured basis. We borrow from various banks on a demand basis with company-owned and customer securities pledged as collateral. The value of customer-owned securities used as collateral is not reflected in the consolidated statements of financial condition. We also have an unsecured, committed bank line available.\nOur uncommitted secured lines of credit at December 31, 2020, totaled $1.0 billion with five banks and are dependent on having appropriate collateral, as determined by the bank agreements, to secure an advance under the line. The availability of our uncommitted lines is subject to approval by the individual banks each time an advance is requested and may be denied. Our peak daily borrowing on our uncommitted secured lines was $490.0 million during the year ended December 31, 2020. There are no compensating balance requirements under these arrangements. Any borrowings on secured lines of credit are day-to-day and are generally utilized to finance certain fixed income securities. At December 31, 2020, we had no outstanding balances on our uncommitted secured lines of credit.\nFederal Home Loan advances are floating-rate advances. The weighted average interest rates during the year ended December 31, 2020, on these advances was 1.30%. The advances are secured by Stifel Bancorp's residential mortgage loan portfolio and investment portfolio. The interest rates reset on a daily basis. Stifel Bancorp has the option to prepay these advances without penalty on the interest reset date. At December 31, 2020, there were no Federal Home Loan advances.\nUnsecured borrowings - On March 5, 2019, we amended our existing Credit Agreement, which now expires in March 2024. The applicable interest rate under the revolving credit facility is calculated as a per annum rate equal to LIBOR plus 1.75%, as defined.\nWe can draw upon this line as long as certain restrictive covenants are maintained. Under our amended and restatement Credit Agreement, we are required to maintain compliance with a minimum consolidated tangible net worth covenant, as defined, and a maximum consolidated total capitalization ratio covenant, as defined. In addition, Stifel, our broker-dealer subsidiary, is required to maintain compliance with a minimum regulatory excess net capital covenant, as defined, and our bank subsidiaries are required to maintain its status as well-capitalized, as defined.\nOur revolving credit facility contains customary events of default, including, without limitation, payment defaults, breaches of representations and warranties, covenant defaults, cross-defaults to similar obligations, certain events of bankruptcy and insolvency, and judgment defaults. At December 31, 2020, we had no advances on the $200.0 million revolving credit facility and were in compliance with all covenants and currently do not expect any covenant violations due to the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic.\nStifel, our broker-dealer subsidiary, has a 364-day Credit Agreement ( Stifel Credit Facility\u201d) with a maturity date of June 2021 in which the lenders are a number of financial institutions. This committed unsecured borrowing facility provides for maximum borrowings of up to $300.0 million at variable rates of interest.\nUnder the Stifel Credit Facility, Stifel is required to maintain compliance with a minimum consolidated tangible net worth covenant, as defined, and to maintain compliance with a minimum regulatory excess net capital covenant, as defined.\nThe Stifel Credit Facility contains customary events of default, including, without limitation, payment defaults, breaches of representations and warranties, covenant defaults, cross-defaults to similar obligations, certain events of bankruptcy and insolvency, and judgment defaults. At December 31, 2020, there were no advances on the Stifel Credit Facility and we were in compliance with all covenants and currently do not expect any covenant violations due to the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic.\nFederal Home Loan Bank Advances and other secured financing - Stifel Bancorp has borrowing capacity with the Federal Home Loan Bank of $3.1 billion at December 31, 2020 and $59.5 million in federal funds agreements for the purpose of purchasing short-term funds should additional liquidity be needed. At December 31, 2020, there were no outstanding Federal Home Loan Bank advances. Stifel Bancorp is eligible to participate in the Federal Reserve's discount window program; however, Stifel Bancorp does not view borrowings from the Federal Reserve as a primary means of funding. The credit available in this program is subject to periodic review, may be terminated or reduced at the discretion of the Federal Reserve, and is secured by securities. Stifel Bancorp has borrowing capacity of $1.4 billion with the Federal Reserve's discount window at December 31, 2020. Stifel Bancorp receives overnight funds from excess cash held in Stifel brokerage accounts, which are deposited into a money market account. These balances totaled $16.0 billion at December 31, 2020. At December 31, 2020, there was $22.8 billion in client money market and FDIC-insured product balances.\nPublic Offering of Senior Notes - On July 15, 2014, we sold in a registered underwritten public offering, $300.0 million in aggregate principal amount of 4.25% senior notes due July 2024 (the 2014 Notes\u201d). Interest on the 2014 Notes is payable semi-annually in arrears. We may redeem the 2014 Notes in whole or in part, at our option, at a redemption price equal to 100% of their principal amount, plus a make-whole\u201d premium and accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the date of redemption. In July 2016, we issued an additional $200.0 million in aggregate principal amount of 4.25% senior notes due 2024. In July 2014, we received a BBB- rating on the 2014 Notes.\nOn December 1, 2015, we sold in a registered underwritten public offering, $300.0 million in aggregate principal amount of 3.50% senior notes due December 2020 (the 2015 Notes\u201d). Interest on the 2015 Notes is payable semi-annually in arrears. We may redeem the 2015 Notes in whole or in part, at our option, at a redemption price equal to 100% of their principal amount, plus a make-whole\u201d premium and accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the date of redemption. In December 2015, we received a BBB- rating on the 2015 Notes. The 2015 Notes matured in December 2020.\nOn October 4, 2017, we completed the pricing of a registered underwritten public offering of $200.0 million in aggregate principal amount of 5.20% senior notes due October 2047. Interest on the senior notes is payable quarterly in arrears in January, April, July, and October. On or after October 15, 2022, we may redeem some or all of the senior notes at any time at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the notes being redeemed plus accrued interest thereon to the redemption date. On October 27, 2017, we completed the sale of an additional $25.0 million aggregate principal amount of Notes pursuant to the over-allotment option. In October 2017, we received a BBB- rating on the notes.\nOn May 20, 2020, we sold in a registered underwritten public offering, $400.0 million in aggregate principal amount of 4.00% senior notes due May 2030. Interest on these senior notes is payable semi-annually in arrears in May and November. We may redeem the notes in whole or in part, at our option, at a redemption price equal to the greater of a) 100% of their principal amount or b) discounted present value at Treasury rate plus 50 basis points prior to February 15, 2030, and on or after February 15, 2030, at 100% of their principal amount, and accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the date of redemption. In May 2020, we received a BBB- rating on the notes.\nPublic Offering of Preferred Stock - In July 2016, the Company completed an underwritten registered public offering of $150 million perpetual 6.25% Non-Cumulative Perpetual Preferred Stock, Series A.\nIn February 2019, the Company completed an underwritten registered public offering of $150 million 6.25% Non-Cumulative Perpetual Preferred Stock, Series B ( Series B Preferred\u201d). In March 2019, we completed a public offering of an additional $10.0 million of Series B Preferred, pursuant to the over-allotment option.\nOn May 19, 2020, the Company completed an underwritten registered public offering of $225 million 6.125% Non-Cumulative Perpetual Preferred Stock, Series C ( Series C Preferred), which included the sale of $25.0 million of Series C Preferred pursuant to an over-allotment option.\nCredit Rating\nWe believe our current rating depends upon a number of factors, including industry dynamics, operating and economic environment, operating results, operating margins, earnings trends and volatility, balance sheet composition, liquidity and liquidity management, our capital structure, our overall risk management, business diversification, and our market share and competitive position in the markets in which we operate. Deteriorations in any of these factors could impact our credit rating. A reduction in our credit rating could adversely affect our liquidity and competitive position, increase our incremental borrowing costs, limit our access to the capital markets, or trigger our obligations under certain financial agreements. As such, we may not be able to successfully obtain additional outside financing to fund our operations on favorable terms, or at all.\nWe believe our existing assets, a significant portion of which are liquid in nature, together with the funds from operations, available informal short-term credit arrangements, and our ability to raise additional capital will provide sufficient resources to meet our present and anticipated financing needs.\nUse of Capital Resources\nOn December 2, 2020, our $300.0 million senior notes matured.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2020, we repurchased $58.3 million, or 1.7 million shares, at an average price of $33.35 per share.\nThe following table summarizes the activity related to our company's note receivable from January 1, 2019 to December 31, 2020 (in thousands):\nTable 98: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Beginning balance - January 1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 525,332\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 408,436\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Notes issued - organic growth\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 179,698\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 209,178\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Notes issued - acquisitions (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 4,065\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Amortization\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (103,983\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (95,053\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (4,054\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (1,294\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Ending balance - December 31\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 596,993\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 525,332\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 99: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> (1)\n</td> <td> Notes issued in conjunction with the acquisition of First Empire in 2019.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe have paid $179.7 million in the form of upfront notes to financial advisors for transition pay during the year ended December 31, 2020. As we continue to take advantage of the opportunities created by market displacement and as competition for skilled professionals in the industry increases, we may decide to devote more significant resources to attracting and retaining qualified personnel.\nWe utilize transition pay, principally in the form of upfront demand notes, to aid financial advisors, who have elected to join our firm, to supplement their lost compensation while transitioning their customers' accounts to the Stifel platform. The initial value of the notes is determined primarily by the financial advisors' trailing production and assets under management. These notes are generally forgiven over a five- to ten-year period based on production. The future estimated amortization expense of the upfront notes, assuming current-year production levels and static growth for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2022, 2023, 2024, 2025, and thereafter, is $123.5 million, $97.0 million, $86.3 million, $73.0 million, $54.1 million, and $163.1 million, respectively. These estimates could change if we continue to grow our business through expansion or experience increased production levels.\nWe maintain an incentive stock plan and a wealth accumulation plan that provides for the granting of stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock, performance awards, stock units, and debentures (collectively, deferred awards\u201d) to our associates. Historically, we have granted stock units to our associates as part of our retention program. A restricted stock unit or restricted stock award represents the right to receive a share of the Company's common stock at a designated time in the future without cash payment by the associate and is issued in lieu of cash incentive, principally for deferred compensation and employee retention plans. The restricted stock units or restricted stock awards generally vest over the next one to ten years after issuance and are distributed at predetermined future payable dates once vesting occurs. Restricted stock awards are restricted as to sale or disposition. These restrictions lapse over the next one to five years.\nAt December 31, 2020, the total number of restricted stock units, Performance-based Restricted Stock Units ( PRSUs\u201d), and restricted stock awards outstanding was 20.9 million, of which 17.9 million were unvested. At December 31, 2020, there was approximately $491.1 million of unrecognized compensation cost for deferred awards, which is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 2.7 years.\nThe future estimated compensation expense of the deferred awards, assuming current year forfeiture levels and static growth for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2022, 2023, 2024, 2025, and thereafter, is $142.9 million, $127.1 million, $95.6 million, $66.9 million, $28.3 million, and $30.3 million, respectively. These estimates could change if our forfeitures change from historical levels.\nNet Capital Requirements - We operate in a highly regulated environment and are subject to capital requirements, which may limit distributions to our company from our subsidiaries. Distributions from our broker-dealer subsidiaries are subject to net capital rules. These subsidiaries have historically operated in excess of minimum net capital requirements. However, if distributions were to be limited in the future due to the failure of our subsidiaries to comply with the net capital rules or a change in the net capital rules, it could have a material and adverse effect to our company by limiting our operations that require intensive use of capital, such as underwriting or trading activities, or limit our ability to implement our business and growth strategies, pay interest on and repay the principal of our debt, and/or repurchase our common stock. Our non-broker-dealer subsidiaries, Stifel Bank & Trust, Stifel Bank, Stifel Trust Company, N.A., and Stifel Trust Company Delaware, N.A., are also subject to various regulatory capital requirements administered by the federal banking agencies. Our broker-dealer subsidiaries and our bank subsidiaries have consistently operated in excess of their capital adequacy requirements. Our Canadian subsidiary, SNC, is subject to the regulatory supervision and requirements of IIROC.\nAt December 31, 2020, Stifel had net capital of $487.7 million, which was 40.0% of aggregate debit items and $463.3 million in excess of its minimum required net capital. At December 31, 2020, all of our broker-dealer subsidiaries' net capital exceeded the minimum net capital required under the SEC rule. At December 31, 2020, SNEL's capital and reserves were in excess of the financial resources requirement under the rules of the FCA. At December 31, 2020, our banking subsidiaries were considered well capitalized under the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action. At December 31, 2020, SNC's net capital and reserves were in excess of the financial resources requirement under the rules of the IIROC. See Note 18 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for details of our regulatory capital requirements.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nIn preparing our consolidated financial statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles and pursuant to the rules and regulations of the SEC, we make assumptions, judgments, and estimates that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, and expenses, and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. We base our assumptions, judgments, and estimates on historical experience and various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results could differ materially from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. On a regular basis, we evaluate our assumptions, judgments, and estimates. We also discuss our critical accounting policies and estimates with the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors.\nWe believe that the assumptions, judgments, and estimates involved in the accounting policies described below have the greatest potential impact on our consolidated financial statements. These areas are key components of our results of operations and are based on complex rules that require us to make assumptions, judgments, and estimates, so we consider these to be our critical accounting policies. Historically, our assumptions, judgments, and estimates relative to our critical accounting policies and estimates have not differed materially from actual results.\nFor a full description of these and other accounting policies, see Note 2 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nValuation of Financial Instruments\nWe measure certain financial assets and liabilities at fair value on a recurring basis, including trading securities owned, available-for-sale securities, investments, trading securities sold, but not yet purchased, and derivatives.\nTrading securities owned and pledged and trading securities sold, but not yet purchased, are carried at fair value on the consolidated statements of financial condition, with unrealized gains and losses reflected on the consolidated statements of operations.\nThe fair value of a financial instrument is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date, or an exit price. The degree of judgment used in measuring the fair value of financial instruments generally correlates to the level of pricing observability. Financial instruments with readily available active quoted prices or for which fair value can be measured from actively quoted prices in active markets generally have more pricing observability and less judgment used in measuring fair value. Conversely, financial instruments rarely traded or not quoted have less pricing observability and are measured at fair value using valuation models that require more judgment. Pricing observability is impacted by a number of factors, including the type of financial instrument, whether the financial instrument is new to the market and not yet established, the characteristics specific to the transaction, and overall market conditions generally.\nWhen available, we use observable market prices, observable market parameters, or broker or dealer quotes (bid and ask prices) to derive the fair value of financial instruments. In the case of financial instruments transacted on recognized exchanges, the observable market prices represent quotations for completed transactions from the exchange on which the financial instrument is principally traded.\nA substantial percentage of the fair value of our trading securities and other investments owned, trading securities pledged as collateral, and trading securities sold, but not yet purchased, are based on observable market prices, observable market parameters, or derived from broker or dealer prices. The availability of observable market prices and pricing parameters can vary from product to product. Where available, observable market prices and pricing or market parameters in a product may be used to derive a price without requiring significant judgment. In certain markets, observable market prices or market parameters are not available for all products, and fair value is determined using techniques appropriate for each particular product. These techniques involve some degree of judgment.\nFor investments in illiquid or privately held securities that do not have readily determinable fair values, the determination of fair value requires us to estimate the value of the securities using the best information available. Among the factors we consider in determining the fair value of investments are the cost of the investment, terms and liquidity, developments since the acquisition of the investment, the sales price of recently issued securities, the financial condition and operating results of the issuer, earnings trends and consistency of operating cash flows, the long-term business potential of the issuer, the quoted market price of securities with similar quality and yield that are publicly traded, and other factors generally pertinent to the valuation of investments. In instances where a security is subject to transfer restrictions, the value of the security is based primarily on the quoted price of a similar security without restriction but may be reduced by an amount estimated to reflect such restrictions. The fair value of these investments is subject to a high degree of volatility and may be susceptible to significant fluctuation in the near term, and the differences could be material.\nWe have categorized our financial instruments measured at fair value into a three-level classification in accordance with Topic 820, Fair Value Measurement and Disclosures.\u201d Fair value measurements of financial instruments that use quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities are generally categorized as Level 1, and fair value measurements of financial instruments that have no direct observable levels are generally categorized as Level 3. All other fair value measurements of financial instruments that do not fall within the Level 1 or Level 3 classification are considered Level 2. The lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement of a financial instrument is used to categorize the instrument and reflects the judgment of management.\nLevel 3 financial instruments have little to no pricing observability as of the report date. These financial instruments do not have active two-way markets and are measured using management's best estimate of fair value, where the inputs into the determination of fair value require significant management judgment or estimation. We have identified Level 3 financial instruments to include certain asset-backed securities, consisting of collateral loan obligation securities, that have experienced low volumes of executed transactions, certain corporate bonds and equity securities where there was less frequent or nominal market activity, investments in private equity funds, and auction rate securities for which the market has been dislocated and largely ceased to function. Our Level 3 asset-backed securities are valued using cash flow models that utilize unobservable inputs. Level 3 corporate bonds are valued using prices from comparable securities. Equity securities with unobservable inputs are valued using management's best estimate of fair value, where the inputs require significant management judgment. Auction rate securities are valued based upon our expectations of issuer redemptions and using internal models.\nContingencies\nWe are involved in various pending and potential legal proceedings related to our business, including litigation, arbitration, and regulatory proceedings. Some of these matters involve claims for substantial amounts, including claims for punitive damages. We have, after consultation with outside legal counsel and consideration of facts currently known by management, recorded estimated losses in accordance with Topic 450 ( Topic 450\u201d), Contingencies,\u201d to the extent that claims are probable of loss and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. The determination of these reserve amounts requires us to use significant judgment, and our final liabilities may ultimately be materially different. This determination is inherently subjective, as it requires estimates that are subject to potentially significant revision as more information becomes available and due to subsequent events. In making these determinations, we consider many factors, including, but not limited to, the loss and damages sought by the plaintiff or claimant, the basis and validity of the claim, the likelihood of a successful defense against the claim, and the potential for, and magnitude of, damages or settlements from such pending and potential litigation and arbitration proceedings, and fines and penalties or orders from regulatory agencies. See Item 3, Legal Proceedings,\u201d in Part I of this report for information on our legal, regulatory, and arbitration proceedings.\nAllowance for Credit Losses\nOn January 1, 2020, we adopted the new accounting standard that requires the measurement of the allowance for credit losses, which includes the allowance for loan losses and the reserve for unfunded lending commitments, to be based on management's best estimate of lifetime expected credit losses inherent in the Company's relevant financial assets.\nThe expected credit losses on our loan portfolio are referred to as the allowance for loan losses and are reported separately as a contra-asset to loans on the consolidated statement of financial condition. The expected credit losses for unfunded lending commitments, including standby letters of credit and binding unfunded loan commitments, are reported on the consolidated statement of financial condition in accounts payable and accrued expenses. The provision for loan losses related to the loan portfolio and the provision for unfunded lending commitments are reported in the consolidated statement of operations in provision for credit losses.\nFor loans, the expected credit loss is typically estimated using quantitative methods that consider a variety of factors, such as historical loss experience derived from proxy data, the current credit quality of the portfolio, as well as an economic outlook over the life of the loan. The life of the loan for closed-ended products is based on the contractual maturity of the loan adjusted for any expected prepayments. The contractual maturity includes any extension options that are at the sole discretion of the borrower. For open-ended products, the expected credit loss is determined based on the maximum repayment term associated with future draws from credit lines.\nIn our loss forecasting framework, we incorporate forward-looking information through the use of macroeconomic scenarios applied over the forecasted life of the assets. These macroeconomic scenarios include variables that have historically been key drivers of increases and decreases in credit losses. These variables include, but are not limited to, unemployment rates, real estate prices, gross domestic product levels, corporate bond spreads, and long-term interest rate forecasts. To estimate losses for contractual periods that extend beyond the forecast horizon, we revert to an average historical loss experience. As any one economic outlook is inherently uncertain, we leverage multiple scenarios. The scenarios that are chosen each quarter and the amount of weighting given to each scenario depend on a variety of factors, including recent economic events, leading economic indicators, and industry trends. The reserve for unfunded lending commitments is estimated using the same scenarios, models, and economic data as the loan portfolio.\nThe allowance for loan losses includes adjustments for qualitative reserves based on our company's assessment that may not be adequately represented in the quantitative methods or the economic assumptions described above. For example, factors that we consider include changes in lending policies and procedures, business conditions, the nature and size of the portfolio, portfolio concentrations, the volume and severity of past due loans and nonaccrual loans, the effect of external factors such as competition, and legal and regulatory requirements, among others. Further, we consider the inherent uncertainty in quantitative models that are built on historical data. As a result of the uncertainty inherent in the quantitative models, other quantitative and qualitative factors are considered in adjusting allowance amounts, including, but not limited to, the following: model imprecision, imprecision in macroeconomic scenario forecasts, or changes in the economic environment affecting specific portfolio segments that deviate from the macroeconomic forecasts. The evaluation is inherently subjective, as it requires estimates that are susceptible to significant revision as more information becomes available. Depending on changes in circumstances, future assessments of credit risk may yield materially different results from the prior estimates, which may require an increase or a decrease in the allowance for loan losses.\nThe allowance for credit losses can also be impacted by unanticipated changes in asset quality of the portfolio. In addition, while we have incorporated our estimated impact of the coronavirus ( COVID-19\u201d) pandemic on the economy into our allowance for credit losses, the ultimate impact of COVID-19 is still unknown, including how long economic activities will be impacted and what effect the unprecedented levels of government fiscal and monetary actions will have on the economy and our credit losses.\nAs described above, the process to determine the allowance for credit losses requires numerous estimates and assumptions, some of which require a high degree of judgment and are often interrelated. Changes in the estimates and assumptions can result in significant changes in the allowance for credit losses. Our process for determining the allowance for credit losses is further discussed in Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nIncome Taxes\nThe provision for income taxes and related tax reserves is based on our consideration of known liabilities and tax contingencies for multiple taxing authorities. Known liabilities are amounts that will appear on current tax returns, amounts that have been agreed to in revenue agent revisions as the result of examinations by the taxing authorities, and amounts that will follow from such examinations but affect years other than those being examined. Tax contingencies are liabilities that might arise from a successful challenge by the taxing authorities taking a contrary position or interpretation regarding the application of tax law to our tax return filings. Factors considered in estimating our liability are results of tax audits, historical experience, and consultation with tax attorneys and other experts.\nAccounting Standards Codification ( ASC\u201d) Topic 740 ( Topic 740\u201d), Income Taxes,\u201d clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an entity's financial statements and prescribed recognition threshold and measurement attributes for financial statement disclosure of tax positions taken or expected to be taken on a tax return. The impact of an uncertain income tax position on the income tax return must be recognized at the largest amount that is more likely than not to be sustained upon audit by the relevant taxing authority. An uncertain income tax position will not be recognized if it has less than a 50% likelihood of being sustained. Additionally, Topic 740 provides guidance on derecognition, classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods, disclosure, and transition.\nGoodwill and Intangible Assets\nUnder the provisions of ASC Topic 805, Business Combinations,\u201d we record all assets and liabilities acquired in purchase acquisitions, including goodwill and other intangible assets, at fair value. Determining the fair value of assets and liabilities requires certain estimates.\nGoodwill for certain acquisitions is deductible for tax purposes. The amortization of goodwill for tax purposes creates a cash tax savings due to a reduction in the current taxes payable. We have recorded cash tax savings for the year ending December 31, 2020, of $7.5 million and anticipate cumulative future cash savings of $61.0 million as of result of the tax amortization of goodwill.\nIn accordance with ASC Topic 350, Intangibles - Goodwill and Other,\u201d indefinite-life intangible assets and goodwill are not amortized. Rather, they are subject to impairment testing on an annual basis, or more often if events or circumstances indicate there may be impairment. This test involves assigning tangible assets and liabilities as well as identified intangible assets and goodwill to reporting units and comparing the fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying amount. If the fair value is less than the carrying amount, a further test is required to measure the amount of the impairment.\nWe test goodwill for impairment on an annual basis and on an interim basis when certain events or circumstances exist. We test for impairment at the reporting unit level, which is generally at the level of or one level below our company's business segments. For both the annual and interim tests, we have the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether the existence of events or circumstances leads to a determination that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. If, after assessing the totality of events or circumstances, we determine it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is greater than its carrying amount, then performing the two-step impairment test is not required. However, if we conclude otherwise, we are then required to perform the first step of the two-step impairment test. Goodwill impairment is determined by comparing the estimated fair value of a reporting unit with its respective carrying value. If the estimated fair value exceeds the carrying value, goodwill at the reporting unit level is not deemed to be impaired. If the estimated fair value is below carrying value, however, further analysis is required to determine the amount of the impairment. Additionally, if the carrying value of a reporting unit is zero or a negative value and it is determined that it is more likely than not the goodwill is impaired, further analysis is required. The estimated fair values of the reporting units are derived based on valuation techniques we believe market participants would use for each of the reporting units. Our annual goodwill impairment testing was completed as of October 1, 2020, with no impairment charges resulting from the annual impairment tests.\nThe goodwill impairment test requires us to make judgments in determining what assumptions to use in the calculation. Assumptions, judgments, and estimates about future cash flows and discount rates are complex and often subjective. They can be affected by a variety of factors, including, among others, economic trends and market conditions, changes in revenue growth trends or business strategies, unanticipated competition, discount rates, technology, or government regulations. In assessing the fair value of our reporting units, the volatile nature of the securities markets and industry requires us to consider the business and market cycle and assess the stage of the cycle in estimating the timing and extent of future cash flows. In addition to discounted cash flows, we consider\nother information, such as public market comparables and multiples of recent mergers and acquisitions of similar businesses. Although we believe the assumptions, judgments, and estimates we have made in the past have been reasonable and appropriate, different assumptions, judgments, and estimates could materially affect our reported financial results.\nIdentifiable intangible assets, which are amortized over their estimated useful lives, are tested for potential impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances suggest that the carrying value of an asset or asset group may not be fully recoverable.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nSee Note 2 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding the effect of new accounting pronouncements on our consolidated financial statements.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nInformation concerning our off-balance sheet arrangements is included in Note 23 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Such information is hereby incorporated by reference.\nDilution\nAs of December 31, 2020, there were 20,908,412 outstanding restricted stock units, PRSUs, and restricted stock awards. A restricted stock unit represents the right to receive a share of the Company's common stock at a designated time in the future without cash payment by the associate and is issued in lieu of cash incentive, principally for deferred compensation and employee retention plans. The restricted stock units vest on an annual basis over the next one to ten years and are distributable, if vested, at future specified dates. Restricted stock awards are restricted as to sale or disposition. These restrictions lapse over the next one to five years. Of the outstanding restricted stock units, PRSUs, and restricted stock awards, 2,978,980 shares are currently vested and 17,929,432 are unvested. Assuming vesting requirements are met, the Company anticipates that 4,290,447 shares under these awards will be distributed in 2021, 3,637,251 will vest in 2022, 3,026,662 will vest in 2023, and the balance of 6,975,072 will be distributed thereafter.\nAn associate will realize income as a result of an award of stock units at the time shares are distributed in an amount equal to the fair market value of the shares at that time, and we are entitled to a corresponding tax deduction in the year of vesting in some instances, or delivery in other instances. Unless an associate elects to satisfy the withholding in another manner, either by paying the amount in cash or by delivering shares of Stifel Financial Corp. common stock already owned by the individual for at least six months, we may satisfy tax withholding obligations on income associated with the grants by reducing the number of shares otherwise deliverable in connection with the awards. The reduction will be calculated based on a current market price of our common stock. Based on current tax law, we anticipate that the shares issued when the awards are paid to the associates will be reduced by approximately 35% to satisfy the maximum withholding obligations, so that approximately 65% of the total restricted stock units that are distributable in any particular year will be converted into issued and outstanding shares.\nIt has been our practice historically to satisfy almost all tax withholding obligations on income associated with the grants by reducing the number of shares otherwise deliverable in connection with the awards. We anticipate that practice will continue, as recently our Compensation Committee made a determination to satisfy tax withholding obligations through the cancellation of shares subject to an award. In addition, the plan pursuant to which we issue restricted stock units and restricted stock awards permits us to elect to settle certain awards entirely in cash, and we may elect to do so as those awards vest and become deliverable.\nContractual Obligations\nThe following table sets forth our contractual obligations to make future payments as of December 31, 2020 (in thousands):\nTable 100: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Thereafter\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Senior notes (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,125,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 500,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 625,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Interest on senior notes\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 540,763\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 48,950\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 48,950\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 48,950\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 40,096\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 27,700\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 326,117\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Debenture to Stifel Financial Capital Trusts (2)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 60,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 60,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Interest on debenture\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 23,942\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,500\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,500\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,500\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,500\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,500\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 16,442\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Operating leases\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,084,403\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 93,544\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 96,278\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 95,359\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 94,249\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 93,040\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 611,933\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Commitments to extend credit -

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe following discussion of the financial condition and results of operations of our company should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes thereto included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2020.\nUnless otherwise indicated, the terms we,\u201d us,\u201d our,\u201d or our company\u201d in this report refer to Stifel Financial Corp. and its wholly owned subsidiaries.\nExecutive Summary\nWe operate as a financial services and bank holding company. We have built a diversified business serving private clients, institutional investors, and investment banking clients located across the country. Our principal activities are: (i) private client services, including securities transaction and financial planning services; (ii) institutional equity and fixed income sales, trading, and research, and municipal finance; (iii) investment banking services, including mergers and acquisitions, public offerings, and private placements; and (iv) retail and commercial banking, including personal and commercial lending programs.\nOur core philosophy is based upon a tradition of trust, understanding, and studied advice.

Our principal customers are individual investors, corporations, municipalities, and institutions.\nOur ability to attract and retain highly skilled and productive associates is critical to the success of our business. Accordingly, compensation and benefits comprise the largest component of our expenses, and our performance is dependent upon our ability to attract, develop, and retain highly skilled associates who are motivated and committed to providing the highest quality of service and guidance to our clients.\nOn May 19, 2020, the Company completed an underwritten registered public offering of $225 million 6.125% Non-Cumulative Perpetual Preferred Stock, Series C ( Series C Preferred), which included the sale of $25.0 million of Series C Preferred pursuant to an over-allotment option.\nOn May 20, 2020, we sold in a registered underwritten public offering, $400.0 million in aggregate principal amount of 4.00% senior notes due May 2030.\nOn November 11, 2020, our Board approved a 50% stock dividend, in the form of a three-for-two stock split, of our common stock payable on December 16, 2020, to shareholders of record as of December 2, 2020. All share and per share information has been retroactively adjusted to reflect the stock split.\nCOVID-19 Pandemic\nIn the first quarter of 2020, the World Health Organization declared the outbreak of a novel strand of the coronavirus ( COVID-19\u201d) a pandemic. Since that time, authorities have implemented numerous measures attempting to contain the spread and impact of COVID-19, such as travel bans and restrictions, quarantines, shelter-in-place orders, and limitations on business activity, including closures. Certain jurisdictions have begun reopening only to return to restrictions in the face of increases in new COVID-19 cases. Recent developments include the phased reopening of domestic and global markets and other economic activity to varying degrees. These measures have severely restricted global economic activity, which is disrupting global supply chains, lowering asset valuations, significantly increasing unemployment and underemployment levels, decreasing liquidity in markets for certain securities, and causing significant volatility and disruptions in the financial, energy, and commodity markets. Recent outbreaks in various states indicate that COVID-19, and related measures to address the pandemic, will continue to impact and disrupt the global and domestic economy and, by extension, our business, well into 2021.\nTo address the economic impact in the U.S., in March and April 2020, the President signed into law various stimulus packages to provide relief to businesses and individuals. In addition, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System ( Federal Reserve\u201d) has taken additional steps to bolster the economy by providing additional funding sources for small and mid-sized businesses as well as for state and local governments as they work through cash flow stresses caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as reducing the federal funds rate and the interest rate on the Federal Reserve's discount window, and implementing programs to promote liquidity in certain securities markets.\nSubsequently, in light of the foregoing government actions and more clarity from the U.S. Federal Reserve Bank on future interest rate policy, the equity markets experienced a strong rebound, and a supportive trading environment for investors has emerged along with renewed activity in the equity and debt new issue capital markets. We have experienced strong market volumes and increased client activity across our capital markets business with considerably improved performance.\nIn response to the pandemic, we implemented protocols and processes to help protect our associates and clients. These measures include:\n \u2022 Operating our businesses from remote locations, leveraging our business continuity plans and capabilities that include having the majority of associates work from home, and other associates operating using pre-planned contingency strategies for critical site-based operations. These capabilities have allowed us to continue to service our clients. \n \u2022 Providing support to our associates during the pandemic through expanded access to wellness and healthcare remotely. \n \u2022 Our information technology group has deployed remote technologies that allow associates to effectively work remotely. Since March, the technology team has made a number of upgrades and changes to these systems to ensure optimal performance. \n \u2022 Our information security team is focused on protecting data by continuously reviewing, monitoring, and training associates. \n \u2022 Participating in the CARES Act and Federal Reserve lending programs for businesses, including the SBA PPP, and continuing to provide access to the important financial services to our clients. \nWe continue to monitor the effects of the pandemic, both on a national level as well as regionally and locally, and are responding accordingly. In addition, we continue to provide frequent communications to our clients, employees, and regulators.\nWe test goodwill for impairment on an annual basis and on an interim basis when certain events or circumstances exist. We performed our annual impairment testing on October 1, 2020, with no impairment charges resulting from the annual impairment test. In addition, in light of the pandemic, we evaluated our assets, including goodwill and other intangibles, for potential impairment and reviewed fair values of financial instruments that are carried at fair value. Based upon our review as of December 31, 2020, no impairments have been recorded and there have been no significant changes in fair value hierarchy classifications.\nResults for the year ended December 31, 2020\nFor the year ended December 31, 2020, net revenues increased 12.4% to a record $3.8 billion compared to $3.3 billion during the comparable period in 2019. This represents our 25th consecutive year of record net revenues. Net income available to common shareholders for the year ended December 31, 2020, increased 10.5% to $476.2 million, or $4.16 per diluted common share, compared to $431.1 million, or $3.66 per diluted common share, in 2019. For the year ended December 31, 2020, our Global Wealth Management and Institutional Group segments posted record net revenues. For the year ended December 31, 2020, our Institutional Group recorded record pre-tax income.\nOur revenue growth for the year ended December 31, 2020, was primarily attributable to an increase in brokerage revenues, increased capital-raising revenues, and asset management and service fees, partially offset by lower net interest income and advisory fee revenues.\nExternal Factors Impacting Our Business\nPerformance in the financial services industry in which we operate is highly correlated to the overall strength of economic conditions and financial market activity. Overall market conditions are a product of many factors, which are beyond our control and mostly unpredictable. These factors may affect the financial decisions made by investors, including their level of participation in the financial markets. In turn, these decisions may affect our business results. With respect to financial market activity, our profitability is sensitive to a variety of factors, including the demand for investment banking services as reflected by the number and size of equity and debt financings and merger and acquisition transactions, the volatility of the equity and fixed income markets, the level and shape of various yield curves, the volume and value of trading in securities, and the value of our customers' assets under management.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has severely impacted, and will likely continue to severely impact, global economic conditions, resulting in substantial volatility in the global financial markets, increased unemployment, and operational challenges such as the temporary closures of businesses, sheltering-in-place directives, and increased remote work protocols. Governments and central banks around the world have reacted to the economic crisis caused by the pandemic by implementing stimulus and liquidity programs and cutting interest rates, though it is unclear whether these or future actions will be successful in countering the economic disruption. If the\npandemic is prolonged or the actions of governments and central banks are unsuccessful, the adverse impact on the global economy will deepen, and our results of operations and financial condition in future quarters will be adversely affected.\nEffective January 1, 2020, we adopted the new accounting standard on current expected credit losses ( CECL\u201d), under which the allowance is measured based on management's best estimate of lifetime expected credit losses. Upon adoption of the new accounting standard, we recorded a $10.4 million, or a 10.7% increase to the allowance for credit losses. In addition, during the twelve months ended December 31, 2020, we recorded additional net credit loss reserves reflecting the impact of changes in our company's outlook on estimated lifetime expected credit losses under the CECL standard due to the COVID-19 pandemic.\nOur overall financial results continue to be highly and directly correlated to the direction and activity levels of the United States equity and fixed income markets. At December 31, 2020, the key indicators of the markets' performance, the NASDAQ, the S&P 500, and Dow Jones Industrial Average closed 43.6%, 16.3%, and 7.2% higher than their December 31, 2019, closing prices, respectively.\nAs a participant in the financial services industry, we are subject to complicated and extensive regulation of our business. The recent economic and political environment has led to legislative and regulatory initiatives, both enacted and proposed, that could substantially intensify the regulation of the financial services industry and may significantly impact us.\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe following table presents consolidated financial information for the periods indicated (in thousands, except percentages):\nTable

year ended December 31, 2020, net revenues increased 12.4% to a record $3.8 billion from $3.3 billion in 2019. This represents our 25th consecutive year of record net revenues. The increase was primarily attributable to an increase in brokerage revenues, increased capital-raising revenues, and asset management and service fees, partially offset by lower net interest income and advisory fee revenues.\nCommissions - Commission revenues are primarily generated from agency transactions in OTC and listed equity securities, insurance products, and options. In addition, commission revenues also include distribution fees for promoting and distributing mutual funds.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2020, commission revenues increased 14.0% to $760.6 million from $667.5 million in 2019. The increase is primarily attributable to an increase in equities trading and private placement commissions over 2019. The increase in trading volumes during 2020 was primarily due to market volatility caused by the economic uncertainty created by the COVID-19 pandemic.\nPrincipal transactions - Principal transaction revenues are gains and losses on secondary trading, principally fixed income brokerage revenues.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2020, principal transactions revenues increased 45.3% to $588.3 million from $404.8 million in 2019. The increase is primarily attributable to strong client engagement and market volatility, as well as an increase in trading gains over 2019.\nInvestment banking - Investment banking revenues include: (i) capital-raising revenues representing fees earned from the underwriting of debt and equity securities, and (ii) advisory fees related to corporate debt and equity offerings, municipal debt offerings, merger and acquisitions, private placements, and other investment banking advisory fees.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2020, investment banking revenues increased 16.5% to a record $952.3 million from $817.4 million in 2019. The increase is primarily attributable to the growth of equity and fixed income capital-raising revenues, partially offset by lower advisory fee revenue.\nCapital-raising revenues increased 41.9% to $524.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, from $369.4 million in 2019. For the year ended December 31, 2020, equity capital-raising revenues increased 51.8% to $343.3 million from $226.2 million in 2019. For the year ended December 31, 2020, fixed income capital-raising revenues increased 26.3% to $180.9 million from $143.2 million in 2019.\nAdvisory fees decreased 4.4% to $428.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, from $448.0 million in 2019. Advisory fee revenues were negatively impacted by the decrease in industry-wide completed mergers and acquisitions transactions, which was driven by an increase in market volatility and the economic slow-down in 2020.\nAsset management and service fees - Asset management and service fees include fees for asset-based financial services provided to individuals and institutional clients. Investment advisory fees are charged based on the value of assets in fee-based accounts. Asset management and service fees are affected by changes in the balances of client assets due to market fluctuations and levels of net new client assets.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2020, asset management and service fee revenues increased 8.2% to a record $917.4 million from $848.0 million in 2019. The increase is primarily attributable to higher asset values and strong fee-based asset flows. Please refer to Asset management and service fees\u201d in the Global Wealth Management segment discussion for information on the changes in asset management and service fees revenues.\nOther income - For the year ended December 31, 2020, other income increased 43.8% to $75.3 million from $52.4 million during 2019. The increase is primarily attributable to the gain recognized on the sale of Ziegler Capital Management, LLC in the first quarter of 2020 and an increase in loan origination fees, partially offset by investment losses.\nYear Ended December 31, 2019, Compared With Year Ended December 31, 2018\nFor the year ended December 31, 2019, net revenues increased 10.3% to $3.3 billion from $3.0 billion in 2018. The increase is primarily attributable to an increase in investment banking revenues, higher net interest income as a result of an increase in interest-earning assets at Stifel Bancorp, an increase in brokerage revenues, and the growth in asset management and service fees as a result of increased assets under management.\nCommissions - For the year ended December 31, 2019, commission revenues increased 1.5% to $667.5 million from $657.7 million in 2018. The increase is primarily attributable to an increase in trading volumes.\nPrincipal transactions - For the year ended December 31, 2019, principal transactions revenues increased 15.2% to $404.8 million from $351.4 million in 2018. The increase is primarily attributable to higher institutional fixed income brokerage revenues, as well as the contribution from the First Empire acquisition that closed during the first quarter of 2019.\nInvestment banking - For the year ended December 31, 2019, investment banking revenues increased 15.5% to $817.4 million from $707.7 million in 2018. The increase is primarily attributable to the growth of advisory fee revenue and fixed income capital-raising revenues, partially offset by lower equity capital-raising revenues.\nAdvisory fees increased 20.6% to $448.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, from $371.5 million in 2018. The increase is primarily attributable to an increase in the number of completed advisory transactions during 2019, including growth in our fund placement business.\nCapital-raising revenues increased 9.9% to $369.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, from $336.2 million in 2018. For the year ended December 31, 2019, equity capital-raising revenues decreased 0.1% to $226.2 million from $226.5 million in 2018. For the year ended December 31, 2019, fixed income capital-raising revenues increased 30.5% to $143.2 million from $109.7 million in 2018.\nAsset management and service fees - For the year ended December 31, 2019, asset management and service fee revenues increased 5.2% to $848.0 million from $806.2 million in 2018. The increase is primarily a result of an increase in the number and value of fee-based accounts, an increase in fees earned on client cash balances, and an increase of interest rates on fees earned on client cash. See Asset management and service fees\u201d in the Global Wealth Management segment discussion for information on the changes in asset management and service fees revenues.\nOther income - For the year ended December 31, 2019, other income increased 105.0% to $52.4 million from $25.6 million in 2018. The increase is primarily attributable to an increase in loan origination fees and a decline in investment losses from 2018.\nNET INTEREST INCOME\nThe following tables present average balance data and

Results of Operations - Global Wealth Management\u201d for additional information on Stifel Bancorp's average balances and interest income and expense. \nYear Ended December 31, 2020, Compared With Year Ended December 31, 2019\nNet interest income - Net interest income is the difference between interest earned on interest-earning assets and interest paid on funding sources. Net interest income is affected by changes in the volume and mix of these assets and liabilities, as well as by fluctuations in interest rates and portfolio management strategies. For the year ended December 31, 2020, net interest income decreased 16.3% to $458.1 million from $547.0 million in 2019. Decreases in short-term interest rates have had a negative impact on our results, in particular on our net interest income. The Federal Reserve significantly further lowered interest rates in response to COVID-19 pandemic concerns.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2020, interest revenue decreased 27.7% to $523.8 million from $724.9 million in 2019, principally as a result of a decrease in interest revenue generated from interest-earning assets of Stifel Bancorp due to lower interest rates. The average interest-earning assets of Stifel Bancorp increased to $18.0 billion during the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to $16.5 billion during 2019 at average interest rates of 2.70% and 3.78%, respectively.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2020, interest expense decreased 63.0% to $65.8 million from $177.9 million in 2019. The decrease is primarily driven by the impact of lower interest rates, partially offset by the increase interest expense on our senior notes. In May 2020, we sold in a registered underwritten public offering, $400.0 million in aggregate principal amount of 4.00% senior notes due May 2030. In December 2020, our $300.0 million notes matured.\nYear Ended December 31, 2019, Compared With Year Ended December 31, 2018\nNet interest income - For the year ended December 31, 2019, net interest income increased 14.8% to $547.0 million from $476.4 million in 2018.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2019, interest revenue increased 12.1% to $724.9 million from $646.4 million in 2018, principally as a result of a $66.4 million increase in interest revenue generated from the growth in interest-earning assets of Stifel Bancorp and higher margin interest income. The average interest-earning assets of Stifel Bancorp increased to $16.5 billion during the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to $15.8 billion in 2018 at average interest rates of 3.78% and 3.52%, respectively.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2019, interest expense increased 4.6% to $177.9 million from $170.1 million in 2018. The increase is primarily attributable to an increase in interest-bearing liabilities (deposits) at Stifel Bancorp, partially offset by a decrease in Federal Home Loan Bank advances.\nNON-INTEREST EXPENSES\nThe following table presents consolidated non-interest expenses for the periods indicated (in thousands, except percentages):\nTable 42: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> For the Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Percentage Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2020 vs. 2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2019 vs. 2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Non-interest expenses:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Compensation and benefits\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 2,279,335\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,978,116\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,770,762\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 15.2\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 11.7\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Occupancy and equipment rental\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 274,664\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 242,893\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 222,384\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 13.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 9.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Communications and office supplies\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 164,736\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 147,428\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 140,254\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 11.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 5.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Commissions and floor brokerage\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 55,960\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 44,011\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 41,967\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 27.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 4.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Provision for credit losses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 33,925\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 9,977\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 18,366\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 240.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (45.7\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other operating expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 292,281\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 315,467\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 296,786\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (7.3\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 6.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total non-interest expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 3,100,901\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 2,737,892\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 2,490,519\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 13.3\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 9.9\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nYear Ended December 31, 2020, Compared With Year Ended December 31, 2019\nCompensation and benefits - Compensation and benefits expenses, which are the largest component of our expenses, include salaries, bonuses, transition pay, benefits, amortization of stock-based compensation, employment taxes, and other associate-related costs. A significant portion of compensation expense is comprised of production-based variable compensation, including discretionary bonuses, which fluctuates in proportion to the level of business activity, increasing with higher revenues and operating profits. Other compensation costs, including base salaries, stock-based compensation amortization, and benefits, are more fixed in nature.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2020, compensation and benefits expense increased 15.2% to $2.3 billion from $2.0 billion in 2019. The increase is primarily attributable to higher variable compensation expense as a result of strong revenue growth over 2019. Compensation and benefits expense as a percentage of net revenues was 60.7% for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to 59.3% for the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase was primarily attributable to the change in the composition of revenues as compared to 2019.\nOccupancy and equipment rental - For the year ended December 31, 2020, occupancy and equipment rental expense increased 13.1% to $274.7 million from $242.9 million in 2019. The increase is primarily attributable to higher occupancy costs as a result of an increase in locations and higher data processing costs associated with an increase in business activity.\nCommunications and office supplies - Communications expense includes costs for telecommunication and data transmission, primarily for obtaining third-party market data information. For the year ended December 31, 2020, communications and office supplies expense increased 11.7% to $164.7 million from $147.4 million in 2019. The increase is primarily attributable to higher communication and quote equipment expenses and shipping costs associated with the continued growth of our business.\nCommissions and floor brokerage - For the year ended December 31, 2020, commissions and floor brokerage expense increased 27.2% to $56.0 million from $44.0 million in 2019. The increase is primarily attributable to higher volume-related expenses, including brokerage trading costs, reflecting an increase in activity levels.\nProvision for credit losses - For the year ended December 31, 2020, provision for credit losses increased 240.0% to $33.9 million from $10.0 million in 2019. The provision for credit losses was impacted by growth in the loan portfolio and the impact of accounting for credit losses under the CECL standard, which was heightened by the impact of COVID-19 on the broader economic environment.\nOther operating expenses - Other operating expenses primarily include license and registration fees, litigation-related expenses, which consist of amounts we reserve and/or payout for legal and regulatory matters, travel and entertainment, promotional, investment banking deal costs, and professional service expenses.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2020, other operating expenses decreased 7.3% to $292.3 million from $315.5 million in 2019. The decrease is primarily attributable to significantly lower travel, entertainment, and conference-related expenses. In addition, net provisions for litigation matters were lower. These decreases were partially offset by higher taxes and licensing fees, professional fees, investment banking transaction expenses, reflecting an increase in activity levels, and insurance costs.\nProvision for income taxes - For the year ended December 31, 2020, our provision for income taxes was $147.7 million, representing an effective tax rate of 22.7%, compared to $149.2 million in 2019, representing an effective tax rate of 25.0%.\nYear Ended December 31, 2019, Compared With Year Ended December 31, 2018\nExcept as noted in the following discussion of variances, the underlying reasons for the increase in non-interest expenses can be attributed principally to our continued expansion, both organically and through our acquisitions, and increased administrative overhead to support the growth in our segments.\nCompensation and benefits - For the year ended December 31, 2019, compensation and benefits expense increased 11.7% to $2.0 billion from $1.8 billion in 2018. The increase is primarily attributable to higher compensation costs associated with the current year acquisitions.\nCompensation and benefits expense as a percentage of net revenues was 59.3% for the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to 58.5% for the year ended December 31, 2018.\nOccupancy and equipment rental - For the year ended December 31, 2019, occupancy and equipment rental expense increased 9.2% to $242.9 million from $222.4 million in 2018. The increase is primarily attributable to an increase in depreciation expense as a result of the expansion of our aircraft engine leasing business, an increase in data processing costs associated with the growth of our business, and higher rent expense as a result of an increase in locations.\nCommunications and office supplies - For the year ended December 31, 2019, communications and office supplies expense increased 5.1% to $147.4 million from $140.3 million in 2018. The increase is primarily attributable to higher communication and quote equipment expenses associated with the continued growth of our business.\nCommissions and floor brokerage - For the year ended December 31, 2019, commissions and floor brokerage expense increased 4.9% to $44.0 million from $42.0 million in 2018. The increase is primarily attributable to an increase in institutional fixed income brokerage trading volumes.\nProvision for credit losses - For the year ended December 31, 2019, provision for credit losses decreased 45.7% to $10.0 million from $18.4 million in 2018.\nOther operating expenses - For the year ended December 31, 2019, other operating expenses increased 6.3% to $315.5 million from $296.8 million in 2018. The increase is primarily attributable to higher investment banking deal costs, travel costs, litigation expense, dues and assessments, and subscription costs.\nProvision for income taxes - For the year ended December 31, 2019, our provision for income taxes was $149.2 million, representing an effective tax rate of 25.0%, compared to $140.4 million in 2018, representing an effective tax rate of 26.3%.\nSEGMENT PERFORMANCE FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS\nOur reportable segments include Global Wealth Management, Institutional Group, and Other.\nOur Global Wealth Management segment consists of two businesses, the Private Client Group and Stifel Bancorp. The Private Client Group includes branch offices and independent contractor offices of our broker-dealer subsidiaries located throughout the United States. These branches provide securities brokerage services, including the sale of equities, mutual funds, fixed income products, and insurance, as well as offering banking products to their private clients through our bank subsidiaries, which provide residential, consumer, and commercial lending, as well as FDIC-insured deposit accounts to customers of our broker-dealer subsidiaries and to the general public.\nThe success of our Global Wealth Management segment is dependent upon the quality of our products, services, financial advisors, and support personnel, including our ability to attract, retain, and motivate a sufficient number of these associates. We face competition for qualified associates from major financial services companies, including other brokerage firms, insurance companies, banking institutions, and discount brokerage firms.

It provides securities brokerage, trading, and research services to institutions with an emphasis on the sale of equity and fixed income products. This segment also includes the management of and participation in underwritings for both corporate and public finance (exclusive of sales credits generated through the Private Client Group, which are included in the Global Wealth Management segment), merger and acquisition, and financial advisory services.\nThe success of our Institutional Group segment is dependent upon the quality of our personnel, the quality and selection of our investment products and services, pricing (such as execution pricing and fee levels), and reputation. Segment operating income and segment pre-tax operating margin are used to evaluate and measure segment performance by our management team in deciding how to allocate resources and in assessing performance.\nThe Other segment includes interest income from stock borrow activities, unallocated interest expense, interest income and gains and losses from investments held, amortization of stock-based awards, and all unallocated overhead cost associated with the execution of orders; processing of securities transactions; custody of client securities; receipt, identification, and delivery of funds and securities; compliance with regulatory and legal requirements; internal financial accounting and controls; and general administration and acquisition charges.\nResults of

1, 2019. Prior period amounts have been restated to conform with the current period presentation. \nYear Ended December 31, 2020, Compared With Year Ended December 31, 2019\nNET REVENUES\nFor the year ended December 31, 2020, Global Wealth Management net revenues increased 2.8% to a record $2.2 billion from $2.1 billion in 2019. The increase in net revenues for the year ended December 31, 2020, over 2019, is primarily attributable to the growth in asset management and service fee revenues and higher brokerage revenues and other income, partially offset by a decrease in net interest income and investment banking.\nCommissions - For the year ended December 31, 2020, commission revenues increased 7.5% to $513.2 million from $477.4 million in 2019. The increase is primarily attributable to an increase in equities trading and private placement commissions over 2019.\nPrincipal transactions - For the year ended December 31, 2020, principal transactions revenues increased 1.0% to $174.1 million from $172.3 million in 2019. The increase is primarily attributable to strong client engagement and market volatility.\nBrokerage revenues - For the year ended December 31, 2020, brokerage revenues increased 5.8% to $687.3 million from $649.7 million in the comparable period in 2019. The increase is primarily attributable to higher trading volumes during 2020, driven by market volatility, as a result of the economic uncertainty created by the COVID-19 pandemic.\nAsset management and service fees - For the year ended December 31, 2020, asset management and service fees increased 8.2% to $917.4 million from $848.0 million in 2019. Asset management revenues increased from 2019, reflecting higher asset levels and strong fee-based asset flows. Fee-based account revenues are primarily billed based on asset values at the end the prior quarter.\nClient asset metrics as of the periods indicated (in thousands):\nTable 46: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Percentage Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2020 vs. 2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2019 vs. 2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Client assets\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 357,429,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 329,495,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 269,862,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 8.5\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 22.1\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Fee-based client assets\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 129,372,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 117,189,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 90,174,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 10.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 30.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Number of client accounts\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,075,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,020,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 983,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 5.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Number of fee-based client accounts\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 262,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 229,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 208,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 14.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 10.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe increase in the value of our client assets and fee-based assets was primarily attributable to the rise in the markets, as well as asset growth resulting from strong recruiting efforts. The growth of our client assets was negatively impacted by the sale of Ziegler Capital Management LLC during the first quarter of 2020.\nInterest revenue - For the year ended December 31, 2020, interest revenue decreased 24.3% to $516.9 million from $682.7 million in 2019. The decrease is primarily driven by the impact of lower interest rates. Please refer to Net Interest Income - Stifel Bancorp\u201d below for a further discussion of the changes in net interest income.\nInvestment banking - Investment banking, which represents sales credits for investment banking underwritings, decreased 5.0% to $36.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, from $37.9 million in 2019. See Investment banking\u201d in the Institutional Group segment discussion for information on the changes in investment banking revenues.\nOther income - For the year ended December 31, 2020, other income increased 97.2% to $71.2 million from $36.1 million in 2019. The increase is primarily attributable to the gain recognized on the sale of Ziegler Capital Management, LLC in the first quarter of 2020 and an increase in loan origination fees, partially offset by investment losses.\nInterest expense - For the year ended December 31, 2020, interest expense decreased 69.3% to $38.0 million from $123.8 million in 2019. The decrease is primarily driven by the impact of lower interest rates. Please refer to Net Interest Income - Stifel Bancorp\u201d below for a further discussion of the changes in net interest income.\nNON-INTEREST EXPENSES\nFor the year ended December 31, 2020, Global Wealth Management non-interest expenses increased 9.0% to $1.5 billion from $1.3 billion in 2019.\nCompensation and benefits - For the year ended December 31, 2020, compensation and benefits expense increased 8.8% to $1.1 billion from $1.0 billion in 2019. The increase is primarily attributable to higher variable compensation expense as a result of strong revenue growth over 2019. Compensation and benefits expense as a percentage of net revenues was 52.0% for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to 49.1% in 2019. The increase was primarily attributable to the change in the composition of revenues as compared to 2019.\nOccupancy and equipment rental - For the year ended December 31, 2020, occupancy and equipment rental expense increased 2.5% to $122.9 million from $119.9 million in 2019. The increase is primarily attributable to higher occupancy costs as a result of an increase in locations and higher data processing costs associated with an increase in business activity.\nCommunications and office supplies - For the year ended December 31, 2020, communications and office supplies expense increased 1.7% to $58.2 million from $57.2 million in 2019. The increase is primarily attributable to higher communication and quote equipment expenses and shipping costs associated with the continued growth of our business.\nCommissions and floor brokerage - For the year ended December 31, 2020, commissions and floor brokerage expense increased 11.7% to $22.3 million from $19.9 million in 2019. The increase is primarily attributable to higher volume-related expenses, including brokerage trading costs, reflecting an increase in activity levels.\nProvision for credit losses - For the year ended December 31, 2020, provision for credit losses increased 236.2% to $33.5 million from $10.0 million in 2019. The provision for credit losses was impacted by growth in the loan portfolio and the impact of accounting for credit losses under the CECL standard, which was heightened by the impact of COVID-19 on the broader economic environment.\nOther operating expenses - For the year ended December 31, 2020, other operating expenses decreased 1.7% to $89.5 million from $91.1 million in 2019. The decrease is primarily attributable to significantly lower travel, entertainment, and conference-related expenses. The decrease was partially offset by higher professional fees and insurance costs.\nINCOME BEFORE INCOME TAXES\nFor the year ended December 31, 2020, income before income taxes decreased 7.6% to $725.9 million from $786.0 million in 2019. Profit margins (income before income taxes as a percent of net revenues) have decreased to 33.1% for the year ended December 31, 2020, from 36.9% in 2019. Profit margins were negatively impacted by the composition of net revenues compared to 2019. The impact caused by lower net interest income was partially offset by the growth of our asset management and service fee revenues and brokerage revenues.\nYear Ended December 31, 2019, Compared With Year Ended December 31, 2018\nNET REVENUES\nFor the year ended December 31, 2019, Global Wealth Management net revenues increased 7.0% to $2.1 billion from $2.0 billion in 2018. The increase in net revenues for the year ended December 31, 2019, over 2018, is primarily attributable to an increase in net interest income, as a result of the growth of interest-earning assets at Stifel Bancorp; the growth in asset management and service fees; an increase in other income, brokerage revenues, and investment banking revenues.\nCommissions - For the year ended December 31, 2019, commission revenues increased 1.1% to $477.4 million from $472.1 million in 2018.\nPrincipal transactions - For the year ended December 31, 2019, principal transactions revenues increased 3.8% to $172.3 million from $166.0 million in 2018.\nBrokerage revenues - For the year ended December 31, 2019, brokerage revenues increased 1.8% to $649.7 million from $638.2 million in the comparable period in 2018.\nAsset management and service fees - For the year ended December 31, 2019, asset management and service fees increased 5.2% to $848.0 million from $806.1 million in 2018. The increase is primarily a result of continued migration to fee-based accounts and our continued expansion in the asset management business. Fee-based account revenues are primarily billed based on values as of the prior quarter end.\nThe value of assets in fee-based accounts at December 31, 2019, increased 30.0% to $117.2 billion from $90.2 billion at December 31, 2018.\nInterest revenue- For the year ended December 31, 2019, interest revenue increased 11.1% to $682.7 million from $614.7 million in 2018. The increase is primarily due to the growth of the interest-earning assets of Stifel Bancorp and an increase in the weighted-average yield. See Net Interest Income - Stifel Bancorp\u201d below for a further discussion of the changes in net interest income.\nInvestment banking - Investment banking increased 20.8% to $37.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, from $31.4 million in 2018.

The increase is primarily attributable to an increase in loan origination fees and the rental income generated from our aircraft engine leasing business.\nInterest expense - For the year ended December 31, 2019, interest expense increased 11.0% to $123.8 million from $111.5 million in 2018. The increase is primarily attributable to an increase in interest-earning liabilities at Stifel Bancorp.

Results of Operations\u201d for additional information on our company's average balances and operating interest and expenses. \nNet interest income - Net interest income is the difference between interest earned on interest-earning assets and interest paid on funding sources. Net interest income is affected by changes in the volume and mix of these assets and liabilities, as well as by fluctuations in interest rates and portfolio management strategies.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2020, interest revenue for Stifel Bancorp of $485.3 million was generated from weighted-average interest-earning assets of $18.0 billion at a weighted-average interest rate of 2.70%. For the year ended December 31, 2019, interest revenue for Stifel Bancorp of $624.2 million was generated from weighted-average interest-earning assets of $16.5 billion at a weighted-average interest rate of 3.78%. For the year ended December 31, 2018, interest revenue for Stifel Bancorp of $557.8 million was generated from weighted-average interest-earning assets of $15.8 billion at a weighted-average interest rate of 3.52%. Interest-\nearning assets principally consist of commercial and industrial, residential, and securities-based loans, investment securities, and interest-bearing cash and federal funds sold.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2020, interest expense for Stifel Bancorp of $18.3 million was incurred from weighted-average interest-bearing liabilities of $16.5 billion at a weighted-average interest rate of 0.11%. For the year ended December 31, 2019, interest expense for Stifel Bancorp of $103.8 million was incurred from weighted-average interest-bearing liabilities of $15.4 billion at a weighted-average interest rate of 0.68%.

comprehensive loss. \n (2) Held-to-maturity securities are carried on the consolidated statements of financial condition at amortized cost, and the changes in the value of these securities, other than impairment charges, are not reported on the consolidated financial statements. \nWe evaluate each available-for-sale security where the value has declined below amortized cost. If our company intends to sell or believes it is more likely than not that it will be required to sell the debt security, it is written down to fair value through earnings. For available-for-sale debt securities our company intends to hold, we evaluate the debt securities for expected credit losses except for debt securities that are guaranteed by the U.S. Treasury or U.S. government agencies where we apply a zero credit loss assumption. For the remaining available-for-sale debt securities, we consider qualitative parameters such as internal and external credit ratings and the value of underlying collateral. If an available-for-sale debt security fails any of the qualitative parameters, a discounted cash flow analysis is used by our company to determine if a portion of the unrealized loss is a result of a credit loss. Any credit losses determined are recognized as an increase to the allowance for credit losses through provision expense recorded in the consolidated statement of operations in provision for credit losses. Cash flows expected to be collected are estimated using all relevant information available, such as remaining payment terms, prepayment speeds, the financial condition of the issuer, expected defaults, and the value of the underlying collateral. If any of the decline in fair value is related to market factors, that amount is recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income. In certain instances, the credit loss may exceed the total decline in fair value, in which case, the allowance recorded is limited to the difference between the amortized cost and the fair value of the asset. We separately evaluate our held-to-maturity debt securities for any credit losses. We perform a discounted cash flow analysis to estimate any credit losses, which are then recognized as part of the allowance for credit losses. For available-for-sale and held-to-maturity debt securities, we have established a nonaccrual policy that results in timely write-off of accrued interest.\nThe maturities and related weighted-average

becomes uncertain. At the time a loan is determined to be impaired, the accrual of interest and amortization of deferred loan origination fees is discontinued ( non-accrual status\u201d) and any accrued and unpaid interest income is reversed. At December 31, 2020, we had $13.8 million of impaired loans, net of discounts, which included $0.2 million in troubled debt restructurings. At December 31, 2019, 2018, 2017, and 2016, we had $14.6 million, $24.4 million, $29.2 million, and $26.9 million of impaired loans, respectively, which included $0.2 million, $9.1 million, $9.1 million, and $9.7 million of trouble debt restructurings, respectively. The specific allowance on impaired loans at December 31, 2020, 2019, 2018, 2017, and 2016 was $8.2 million, $8.2 million, $8.7 million, $9.1 million, and $3.4 million, respectively.\nThe gross interest income related to impaired loans, which would have been recorded had these loans been current in accordance with their original terms, and the interest income recognized on these loans during the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019, 2018, 2017, and 2016, were insignificant to the consolidated financial statements.\nPlease refer to the section entitled Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates\u201d herein regarding our policies for establishing loan loss reserves, including placing loans on non-accrual status.\n IV.

31, 2020, Compared With Year Ended December 31, 2019\nNET REVENUES\nFor the year ended December 31, 2020, Institutional Group net revenues increased 30.4% to a record $1.6 billion from $1.2 billion in 2019. The increase in net revenues for the year ended December 31, 2020, was primarily attributable to an increase in brokerage revenues and capital-raising revenues, partially offset by a decrease in advisory fees and other income.\nCommissions - For the year ended December 31, 2020, commission revenues increased 30.1% to $247.4 million from $190.1 million in 2019. The increase is primarily attributable to the growth in equities commissions from 2019.\nPrincipal transactions - For the year ended December 31, 2020, principal transactions revenues increased 78.2% to $414.2 million from $232.5 million in 2019. The increase is primarily attributable to strong client engagement and market volatility, as well as an increase in trading gains over 2019.\nBrokerage revenues - For the year ended December 31, 2020, institutional brokerage revenues increased 56.6% to $661.6 million from $422.5 million in 2019.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2020, fixed income brokerage revenues increased 58.1% to $404.8 million from $256.0 million in 2019. For the year ended December 31, 2020, equity brokerage revenues increased 54.2% to $256.8 million from $166.6 million in 2019. The increases are primarily attributable to higher trading volumes during 2020, driven by market volatility, as a result of the economic uncertainty created by the COVID-19 pandemic and an increase in trading gains.\nInvestment banking - For the year ended December 31, 2020, investment banking revenues increased 17.5% to $916.3 million from $779.5 million in 2019. The increase is primarily attributable to an increase in capital-raising revenues, partially offset by a decrease in advisory fees.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2020, capital-raising revenues increased 47.2% to $488.2 million from $331.5 million in 2019.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2020, equity capital markets capital-raising revenues increased 49.7% to $306.0 million from $204.4 million in 2019. The increase in equity capital-raising revenues is primarily attributable to an increase in deals compared to 2019.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2020, fixed income capital markets capital-raising revenues increased 43.3% to $182.1 million from $127.1 million in 2019. The increase is primarily attributable to an increase in the municipal bond origination business. Fixed income capital-raising revenues increased from a year ago as clients accessed the market to benefit from the lower rate environment and to raise additional liquidity.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2020, advisory fees decreased 4.4% to $428.1 million from $448.0 million in 2019. Advisory fee revenues were negatively impacted by the decrease in industry-wide completed mergers and acquisitions transactions, which was driven by an increase in market volatility and the economic slow-down in 2020.\nInterest income - For the year ended December 31, 2020, interest income decreased 30.2% to $16.8 million from $24.1 million in 2019. The decrease is primarily driven by the impact of lower interest rates and lower inventory levels.\nOther income - For the year ended December 31, 2020, other income decreased 96.9% to $0.4 million from $12.1 million in 2019.\nInterest expense - For the year ended December 31, 2020, interest expense decreased 50.8% to $11.9 million from $24.3 million in 2019. The decrease is primarily driven by the impact of lower interest rates and lower inventory levels.\nNON-INTEREST EXPENSES\nFor the year ended December 31, 2020, Institutional Group non-interest expenses increased 21.1% to $1.3 billion from $1.0 billion in 2019.\nCompensation and benefits - For the year ended December 31, 2020, compensation and benefits expense increased 28.0% to $942.8 million from $736.3 million in 2019. The increase is primarily attributable to higher variable compensation expense as a result of strong revenue growth over 2019. Compensation and benefits expense as a percentage of net revenues was 59.6% for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to 60.6% in 2019.\nOccupancy and equipment rental - For the year ended December 31, 2020, occupancy and equipment rental expense increased 27.9% to $68.5 million from $53.5 million in 2019. The increase is primarily attributable to higher occupancy costs as a result of an increase in locations and higher data processing costs associated with an increase in business activity.\nCommunications and office supplies - For the year ended December 31, 2020, communications and office supplies expense increased 18.8% to $88.1 million from $74.1 million in 2019. The increase is primarily attributable to higher communication and quote equipment expenses associated with the continued growth of our business.\nCommissions and floor brokerage - For the year ended December 31, 2020, commissions and floor brokerage expense increased 39.9% to $33.7 million from $24.1 million in 2019. The increase is primarily attributable to higher volume-related expenses, including brokerage trading costs, reflecting an increase in activity levels.\nOther operating expenses - For the year ended December 31, 2020, other operating expenses decreased 16.9% to $124.9 million from $150.3 million in 2019. The decrease is primarily attributable to significantly lower travel, entertainment, and conference-related expenses. These decreases were partially offset by an increase in net provisions for litigation matters, higher investment banking transaction expenses, reflecting an increase in activity levels, and an increase in professional fees.\nINCOME BEFORE INCOME TAXES\nFor the year ended December 31, 2020, income before income taxes for the Institutional Group segment increased 85.2% to $325.3 million from $175.7 million in 2019. Profit margins (income before income taxes as a percentage of net revenues) have increased to 20.5% for the year ended December 31, 2020, from 14.5% in 2019 as a result of strong revenue growth and our continued expense discipline.\nYear Ended December 31, 2019, Compared With Year Ended December 31, 2018\nNET REVENUES\nFor the year ended December 31, 2019, Institutional Group net revenues increased 15.0% to $1.2 billion from $1.1 billion in 2018. The increase in net revenues for the year ended December 31, 2019, was primarily attributable to an increase in advisory fees, fixed income institutional brokerage revenues, and fixed income capital-raising revenues, partially offset by a decrease in equity brokerage and equity capital-raising revenues.\nCommissions - For the year ended December 31, 2019, commission revenues increased 2.4% to $190.1 million from $185.6 million in 2018.\nPrincipal transactions - For the year ended December 31, 2019, principal transactions revenues increased 25.4% to $232.5 million from $185.3 million in 2018.\nBrokerage revenues - For the year ended December 31, 2019, institutional brokerage revenues increased 13.9% to $422.5 million from $370.9 million in 2018.

The increase is primarily attributable to higher fixed income trading volumes and, to a lesser extent, from the contribution of our acquisition of First Empire, which closed during the first quarter of 2019.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2019, equity brokerage revenues decreased 10.4% to $166.6 million from $186.0 million in 2018.

The increase is primarily attributable to an increase in advisory fees and fixed income capital-raising revenues, partially offset by a decrease in equity capital-raising revenues. Investment banking revenues benefited from the contribution of our acquisition of Mooreland, which closed in the third quarter of 2019.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2019, advisory fees increased 20.6% to $448.0 million from $371.4 million in 2018.

The increase is primarily attributable to an increase in the municipal bond origination business.\nInterest income - For the year ended December 31, 2019, interest income increased 25.5% to $24.1 million from $19.2 million in 2018. The increase is primarily attributable to an increase in inventory levels.\nOther income - For the year ended December 31, 2019, other income increased 41.8% to $12.1 million from $8.5 million in 2018.\nInterest expense - For the year ended December 31, 2019, interest expense increased 24.4% to $24.3 million from $19.5 million in 2018.

The increase is primarily attributable to higher rent expense.\nCommunications and office supplies - For the year ended December 31, 2019, communications and office supplies expense increased 9.6% to $74.1 million from $67.6 million in 2018. The increase is primarily attributable to an increase in communication and quote equipment expenses associated with the continued growth of our business.\nCommissions and floor brokerage - For the year ended December 31, 2019, commissions and floor brokerage expense increased 3.6% to $24.1 million from $23.2 million in 2018.

The increase is primarily attributable to an increase in investment banking deal costs, dues and assessments, and conference and travel costs.\nINCOME BEFORE INCOME TAXES\nFor the year ended December 31, 2019, income before income taxes for the Institutional Group segment increased 11.9% to $175.7 million from $157.1 million in 2018. Profit margins (income before income taxes as a percentage of net revenues) have decreased to 14.5% for the year ended December 31, 2019, from 14.9% in 2018 as a result of an increase in expenses, partially offset by higher revenues.\nResults of Operations - Other Segment\nThe following table presents consolidated financial information for the Other segment for the periods presented (in thousands, except percentages):\nTable 87: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> For the Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Percentage Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2020 vs. 2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2019 vs. 2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net revenues\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (21,912\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (7,546\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (20,933\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (190.4\n</td> <td> )%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 64.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Non-interest expenses:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Compensation and benefits\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 198,041\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 195,389\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 169,364\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 15.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other operating expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 180,056\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 159,557\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 169,395\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 12.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (5.8\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total non-interest expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 378,097\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 354,946\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 338,759\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 6.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 4.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Loss before income taxes\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (400,009\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (362,492\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (359,692\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 10.3\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 0.8\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe other segment includes expenses related to the Company's acquisition strategy and the investments made in the Company's infrastructure and control environment.\nThe expenses relating to the Company's acquisition strategy, which are included in the other segment, consists of stock-based compensation and operating costs from our various acquisitions.

Total assets of $26.6 billion at December 31, 2020, were up 8.1% over December 31, 2019. Our broker-dealer subsidiary's gross assets and liabilities, including financial instruments owned, stock loan/borrow, receivables and payables from/to brokers, dealers, and clearing organizations and clients, fluctuate with our business levels and overall market conditions.\nAs of December 31, 2020, our liabilities were comprised primarily of deposits of $17.4 billion at Stifel Bancorp, accounts payable and accrued expenses of $1.2 billion, senior notes, net of debt issuance costs, of $1.1 billion, payables to customers of $1.1 billion at our broker-dealer subsidiaries, and accrued employee compensation of $638.3 million. To meet our obligations to clients and operating needs, we had $2.3 billion in cash and cash equivalents at December 31, 2020. We also had highly liquid assets consisting of held-to-maturity securities of $4.1 billion, available-for-sale securities of $2.2 billion, client brokerage receivables of $936.5 million, and financial instruments of $694.0 million.\nCash Flow\nCash and cash equivalents increased $1.1 billion to $2.3 billion at December 31, 2020, from $1.1 billion at December 31, 2019. Operating activities provided cash of $1.7 billion primarily due to net income recognized in 2020 adjusted for non-cash activities. Investing activities used cash of $1.7 billion due to the growth of the loan portfolio, investment securities purchases, and fixed asset purchases, partially offset by proceeds from the sale and maturity of securities in our investment portfolio and the proceeds received from the sale of ZCM. Financing activities provided cash of $1.2 billion primarily due to an increase in bank deposits and proceeds received from the issuance of senior notes and preferred stock, partially offset by a decrease in securities loaned, repayments of senior notes and Federal Home Loan Bank advances, dividends paid on our common and preferred stock, and share repurchases.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nThe Company's senior management establishes the liquidity and capital policies of our company. The Company's senior management reviews business performance relative to these policies, monitors the availability of alternative sources of financing, and oversees the liquidity and interest rate sensitivity of our company's asset and liability position.\nOur assets, consisting mainly of cash or assets readily convertible into cash, are our principal source of liquidity. The liquid nature of these assets provides for flexibility in managing and financing the projected operating needs of the business. These assets are financed primarily by our equity capital, corporate debt, debentures to trusts, client credit balances, short-term bank loans, proceeds from securities lending, repurchase agreements, and other payables. We currently finance our client accounts and firm trading positions through ordinary course borrowings at floating interest rates from various banks on a demand basis, securities lending, and repurchase agreements, with company-owned and client securities pledged as collateral. Changes in securities market volumes, related client borrowing demands, underwriting activity, and levels of securities inventory affect the amount of our financing requirements.\nOur bank assets consist principally of available-for-sale and held-to-maturity securities, retained loans, and cash and cash equivalents. Stifel Bancorp's current liquidity needs are generally met through deposits from brokerage clients and equity capital. We monitor the liquidity of our bank subsidiaries daily to ensure their ability to meet customer deposit withdrawals, maintain reserve requirements, and support asset growth.\nAs of December 31, 2020, we had $26.6 billion in assets, $10.1 billion of which consisted of cash or assets readily convertible into cash as follows (in thousands, except average days to conversion):\nTable 90: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Average\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Conversion\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Cash and cash equivalents\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 2,279,274\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,142,596\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Receivables from brokers, dealers, and clearing organizations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 549,492\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 627,790\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 5 days\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Securities purchased under agreements to resell\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 217,930\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 385,008\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1 day\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Financial instruments owned at fair value\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 682,744\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 963,606\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3 days\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Available-for-sale securities at fair value\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,230,297\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3,254,737\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3 days\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Held-to-maturity securities at amortized cost\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 4,117,384\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,856,219\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 4 days\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Investments\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 42,429\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 49,980\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 10 days\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total cash and assets readily convertible to cash\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 10,119,550\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 9,279,936\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nAs of December 31, 2020 and 2019, the amount of collateral by asset class is as follows (in thousands):\nTable 91: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> December 31, 2020\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> December 31, 2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Contractual\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Contingent\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Contractual\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Contingent\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Cash and cash equivalents\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 155,081\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 98,250\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Financial instruments owned at fair value\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 190,955\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 190,955\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 391,634\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 391,634\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Investment portfolio (AFS & HTM)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,764,421\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,617,688\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 346,036\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,955,376\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 489,884\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 2,009,322\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nLiquidity Available From Subsidiaries\nLiquidity is principally available to our company from Stifel and Stifel Bancorp.\nStifel is required to maintain net capital equal to the greater of $1 million or two percent of aggregate debit items arising from client transactions. Covenants in the Company's committed financing facilities require the excess net capital of Stifel, our principal broker-dealer subsidiary, to be above a defined amount. At December 31, 2020, Stifel's excess net capital exceeded the minimum requirement, as defined. There are also limitations on the amount of dividends that may be declared by a broker-dealer without FINRA approval. See Note 18 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for more information on the capital restrictions placed on our broker-dealer subsidiaries.\nStifel Bancorp may pay dividends to the parent company without prior approval by its regulator as long as the dividend does not exceed the sum of Stifel Bancorp's current calendar year and the previous two calendar years' retained net income and Stifel Bancorp maintains its targeted capital to risk-weighted assets ratios.\nAlthough we have liquidity available to us from our other subsidiaries, the available amounts are not as significant as the amounts described above and, in certain instances, may be subject to regulatory requirements.\nCapital Management\nWe have an ongoing authorization from the Board of Directors to repurchase our common stock in the open market or in negotiated transactions. At December 31, 2020, the maximum number of shares that may yet be purchased under this plan was 13.3 million. We utilize the share repurchase program to manage our equity capital relative to the growth of our business and help to meet obligations under our employee benefit plans.\nLiquidity Risk Management\nOur businesses are diverse, and our liquidity needs are determined by many factors, including market movements, collateral requirements, and client commitments, all of which can change dramatically in a difficult funding environment. During a liquidity crisis, credit-sensitive funding, including unsecured debt and some types of secured financing agreements, may be unavailable, and the terms (e.g., interest rates, collateral provisions, and tenor) or availability of other types of secured financing may change. We manage liquidity risk by diversifying our funding sources across products and among individual counterparties within those products. These liquidity risk management practices have allowed us to effectively manage the market stress from the COVID-19 pandemic. For more information on the effects of the pandemic, see Executive Summary - COVID-19 Pandemic on page 31.\nAs a holding company, whereby all of our operations are conducted through our subsidiaries, our cash flow and our ability to service our debt, including the notes, depend upon the earnings of our subsidiaries. Our subsidiaries are separate and distinct legal entities. Our subsidiaries have no obligation to pay any amounts due on the notes or to provide us with funds to pay our obligations, whether by dividends, distributions, loans, or other payments.\nOur liquidity requirements may change in the event we need to raise more funds than anticipated to increase inventory positions, support more rapid expansion, develop new or enhanced services and products, acquire technologies, respond to acquisition opportunities, expand our recruiting efforts, or respond to other unanticipated liquidity requirements. We primarily rely on financing activities and distributions from our subsidiaries for funds to implement our business and growth strategies and repurchase our shares. Net capital rules, restrictions under our borrowing arrangements of our subsidiaries, as well as the earnings, financial condition, and cash requirements of our subsidiaries, may each limit distributions to us from our subsidiaries.\nThe availability of outside financing, including access to the capital markets and bank lending, depends on a variety of factors, such as market conditions, the general availability of credit, the volume of trading activities, the overall availability of credit to the financial services sector, and our credit rating. Our cost and availability of funding may be adversely affected by illiquid credit markets and wider credit spreads. As a result of any future concerns about the stability of the markets generally and the strength of counterparties specifically, lenders may from time to time curtail, or even cease to provide, funding to borrowers.\nOur liquidity management policies are designed to mitigate the potential risk that we may be unable to access adequate financing to service our financial obligations without material business impact. The principal elements of our liquidity management framework are: (a) daily monitoring of our liquidity needs at the holding company and significant subsidiary level, (b) stress testing the liquidity positions of Stifel and our bank subsidiaries, and (c) diversification of our funding sources.\nMonitoring of liquidity - Senior management establishes our liquidity and capital policies. These policies include senior management's review of short- and long-term cash flow forecasts, review of monthly capital expenditures, the monitoring of the availability of alternative sources of financing, and the daily monitoring of liquidity in our significant subsidiaries. Our decisions on the allocation of capital to our business units consider, among other factors, projected profitability and cash flow, risk, and impact on future liquidity needs. Our treasury department assists in evaluating, monitoring, and controlling the impact that our business activities have on our financial condition, liquidity, and capital structure, as well as maintains our relationships with various lenders. The objectives of these policies are to support the successful execution of our business strategies while ensuring ongoing and sufficient liquidity.\nLiquidity stress testing (Firmwide) - A liquidity stress test model is maintained by the Company that measures liquidity outflows across multiple scenarios at the major operating subsidiaries and details the corresponding impact to our holding company and the overall consolidated firm. Liquidity stress tests are utilized to ensure that current exposures are consistent with the Company's established liquidity risk tolerance and, more specifically, to identify and quantify sources of potential liquidity strain. Further, the stress tests are utilized to analyze possible impacts on the Company's cash flows and liquidity position. The outflows are modeled over a 30-day liquidity stress timeframe and include the impact of idiosyncratic and macro-economic stress events.\nThe assumptions utilized in the Company's liquidity stress tests include, but are not limited to, the following:\n \u2022 No government support \n \u2022 No access to equity and unsecured debt markets within the stress horizon \n \u2022 Higher haircuts and significantly lower availability of secured funding \n \u2022 Additional collateral that would be required by trading counter-parties, certain exchanges, and clearing organizations related to credit rating downgrades \n \u2022 Client cash withdrawals and inability to accept new deposits \n \u2022 Increased demand from customers on the funding of loans and lines of credit \nAt December 31, 2020, the Company maintained sufficient liquidity to meet current and contingent funding obligations as modeled in its liquidity stress test model.\nLiquidity stress testing (Stifel Bancorp) - Our bank subsidiaries perform three primary stress tests on its liquidity position. These stress tests are based on the following company-specific stresses: (1) the amount of deposit run-off that they could withstand over a one-month period of time based on their on-balance sheet liquidity and available credit, (2) the ability to fund operations if all available credit were to be drawn immediately, with no additional available credit, and (3) the ability to fund operations under a regulatory prompt corrective action. The goal of these stress tests is to determine their ability to fund continuing operations under significant pressures on both assets and liabilities.\nUnder all stress tests, our bank subsidiaries consider cash and highly liquid investments as available to meet liquidity needs. In its analysis, our bank subsidiaries consider agency mortgage-backed securities, corporate bonds, and commercial mortgage-backed securities as highly liquid. In addition to being able to be readily financed at modest haircut levels, our bank subsidiaries estimate that each of the individual securities within each of the asset classes described above could be sold into the market and converted into cash within three business days under normal market conditions, assuming that the entire portfolio of a given asset class was not simultaneously liquidated. At December 31, 2020, available cash and highly liquid investments comprised approximately 18% of Stifel Bancorp's assets, which was well in excess of its internal target.\nIn addition to these stress tests, management performs a daily liquidity review. The daily analysis provides management with all major fluctuations in liquidity. The analysis also tracks the proportion of deposits that Stifel Bancorp is sweeping from its affiliated broker-dealer, Stifel. On a monthly basis, liquidity key performance indicators and compliance with liquidity policy limits are reported to the Board of Directors. Our bank subsidiaries have not violated any internal liquidity policy limits.\nFunding Sources\nThe Company pursues a strategy of diversification of secured and unsecured funding sources (by product and by investor) and attempts to ensure that the tenor of the Company's liabilities equals or exceeds the expected holding period of the assets being financed. The Company funds its balance sheet through diverse sources. These sources may include the Company's equity capital, long-term debt, repurchase agreements, securities lending, deposits, committed and uncommitted credit facilities, Federal Home Loan Bank advances, and federal funds agreements.\nCash and Cash Equivalents - We held $2.3 billion of cash and cash equivalents at December 31, 2020, compared to $1.1 billion at December 31, 2019. Cash and cash equivalents provide immediate sources of funds to meet our liquidity needs.\nSecurities Available-for-Sale - We held $2.2 billion in available-for-sale investment securities at December 31, 2020, compared to $3.3 billion at December 31, 2019. As of December 31, 2020, the weighted-average life of the investment securities portfolio was approximately 0.9 years. These investment securities provide increased liquidity and flexibility to support our company's funding requirements.\nWe monitor the available-for-sale investment portfolio for other-than-temporary impairment based on a number of criteria, including the size of the unrealized loss position, the duration for which the security has been in a loss position, credit rating, the nature of the investments, and current market conditions. For debt securities, we also consider any intent to sell the security and the likelihood we will be required to sell the security before its anticipated recovery. We continually monitor the ratings of our security holdings and conduct regular reviews of our credit-sensitive assets.\nDeposits - Deposits have become our largest funding source. Deposits provide a stable, low-cost source of funds that we utilize to fund asset growth and to diversify funding sources. We have continued to expand our deposit-gathering efforts through our existing private client network and through expansion. These channels offer a broad set of deposit products that include demand deposits, money market deposits, and certificates of deposit ( CDs\u201d).\nAs of December 31, 2020, we had $17.4 billion in deposits compared to $15.3 billion at December 31, 2019. Our core deposits are primarily comprised of money market deposit accounts, non-interest-bearing deposits, and CDs.\nShort-term borrowings - Our short-term financing is generally obtained through short-term bank line financing on an uncommitted, secured basis, securities lending arrangements, repurchase agreements, advances from the Federal Home Loan Bank, term loans, and committed bank line financing on an unsecured basis. We borrow from various banks on a demand basis with company-owned and customer securities pledged as collateral. The value of customer-owned securities used as collateral is not reflected in the consolidated statements of financial condition. We also have an unsecured, committed bank line available.\nOur uncommitted secured lines of credit at December 31, 2020, totaled $1.0 billion with five banks and are dependent on having appropriate collateral, as determined by the bank agreements, to secure an advance under the line. The availability of our uncommitted lines is subject to approval by the individual banks each time an advance is requested and may be denied. Our peak daily borrowing on our uncommitted secured lines was $490.0 million during the year ended December 31, 2020. There are no compensating balance requirements under these arrangements. Any borrowings on secured lines of credit are day-to-day and are generally utilized to finance certain fixed income securities. At December 31, 2020, we had no outstanding balances on our uncommitted secured lines of credit.\nFederal Home Loan advances are floating-rate advances. The weighted average interest rates during the year ended December 31, 2020, on these advances was 1.30%. The advances are secured by Stifel Bancorp's residential mortgage loan portfolio and investment portfolio. The interest rates reset on a daily basis. Stifel Bancorp has the option to prepay these advances without penalty on the interest reset date. At December 31, 2020, there were no Federal Home Loan advances.\nUnsecured borrowings - On March 5, 2019, we amended our existing Credit Agreement, which now expires in March 2024. The applicable interest rate under the revolving credit facility is calculated as a per annum rate equal to LIBOR plus 1.75%, as defined.\nWe can draw upon this line as long as certain restrictive covenants are maintained. Under our amended and restatement Credit Agreement, we are required to maintain compliance with a minimum consolidated tangible net worth covenant, as defined, and a maximum consolidated total capitalization ratio covenant, as defined. In addition, Stifel, our broker-dealer subsidiary, is required to maintain compliance with a minimum regulatory excess net capital covenant, as defined, and our bank subsidiaries are required to maintain its status as well-capitalized, as defined.\nOur revolving credit facility contains customary events of default, including, without limitation, payment defaults, breaches of representations and warranties, covenant defaults, cross-defaults to similar obligations, certain events of bankruptcy and insolvency, and judgment defaults. At December 31, 2020, we had no advances on the $200.0 million revolving credit facility and were in compliance with all covenants and currently do not expect any covenant violations due to the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic.\nStifel, our broker-dealer subsidiary, has a 364-day Credit Agreement ( Stifel Credit Facility\u201d) with a maturity date of June 2021 in which the lenders are a number of financial institutions. This committed unsecured borrowing facility provides for maximum borrowings of up to $300.0 million at variable rates of interest.\nUnder the Stifel Credit Facility, Stifel is required to maintain compliance with a minimum consolidated tangible net worth covenant, as defined, and to maintain compliance with a minimum regulatory excess net capital covenant, as defined.\nThe Stifel Credit Facility contains customary events of default, including, without limitation, payment defaults, breaches of representations and warranties, covenant defaults, cross-defaults to similar obligations, certain events of bankruptcy and insolvency, and judgment defaults. At December 31, 2020, there were no advances on the Stifel Credit Facility and we were in compliance with all covenants and currently do not expect any covenant violations due to the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic.\nFederal Home Loan Bank Advances and other secured financing - Stifel Bancorp has borrowing capacity with the Federal Home Loan Bank of $3.1 billion at December 31, 2020 and $59.5 million in federal funds agreements for the purpose of purchasing short-term funds should additional liquidity be needed. At December 31, 2020, there were no outstanding Federal Home Loan Bank advances. Stifel Bancorp is eligible to participate in the Federal Reserve's discount window program; however, Stifel Bancorp does not view borrowings from the Federal Reserve as a primary means of funding. The credit available in this program is subject to periodic review, may be terminated or reduced at the discretion of the Federal Reserve, and is secured by securities. Stifel Bancorp has borrowing capacity of $1.4 billion with the Federal Reserve's discount window at December 31, 2020. Stifel Bancorp receives overnight funds from excess cash held in Stifel brokerage accounts, which are deposited into a money market account. These balances totaled $16.0 billion at December 31, 2020. At December 31, 2020, there was $22.8 billion in client money market and FDIC-insured product balances.\nPublic Offering of Senior Notes - On July 15, 2014, we sold in a registered underwritten public offering, $300.0 million in aggregate principal amount of 4.25% senior notes due July 2024 (the 2014 Notes\u201d). Interest on the 2014 Notes is payable semi-annually in arrears. We may redeem the 2014 Notes in whole or in part, at our option, at a redemption price equal to 100% of their principal amount, plus a make-whole\u201d premium and accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the date of redemption. In July 2016, we issued an additional $200.0 million in aggregate principal amount of 4.25% senior notes due 2024. In July 2014, we received a BBB- rating on the 2014 Notes.\nOn December 1, 2015, we sold in a registered underwritten public offering, $300.0 million in aggregate principal amount of 3.50% senior notes due December 2020 (the 2015 Notes\u201d). Interest on the 2015 Notes is payable semi-annually in arrears. We may redeem the 2015 Notes in whole or in part, at our option, at a redemption price equal to 100% of their principal amount, plus a make-whole\u201d premium and accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the date of redemption. In December 2015, we received a BBB- rating on the 2015 Notes. The 2015 Notes matured in December 2020.\nOn October 4, 2017, we completed the pricing of a registered underwritten public offering of $200.0 million in aggregate principal amount of 5.20% senior notes due October 2047. Interest on the senior notes is payable quarterly in arrears in January, April, July, and October. On or after October 15, 2022, we may redeem some or all of the senior notes at any time at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the notes being redeemed plus accrued interest thereon to the redemption date. On October 27, 2017, we completed the sale of an additional $25.0 million aggregate principal amount of Notes pursuant to the over-allotment option. In October 2017, we received a BBB- rating on the notes.\nOn May 20, 2020, we sold in a registered underwritten public offering, $400.0 million in aggregate principal amount of 4.00% senior notes due May 2030. Interest on these senior notes is payable semi-annually in arrears in May and November. We may redeem the notes in whole or in part, at our option, at a redemption price equal to the greater of a) 100% of their principal amount or b) discounted present value at Treasury rate plus 50 basis points prior to February 15, 2030, and on or after February 15, 2030, at 100% of their principal amount, and accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the date of redemption. In May 2020, we received a BBB- rating on the notes.\nPublic Offering of Preferred Stock - In July 2016, the Company completed an underwritten registered public offering of $150 million perpetual 6.25% Non-Cumulative Perpetual Preferred Stock, Series A.\nIn February 2019, the Company completed an underwritten registered public offering of $150 million 6.25% Non-Cumulative Perpetual Preferred Stock, Series B ( Series B Preferred\u201d). In March 2019, we completed a public offering of an additional $10.0 million of Series B Preferred, pursuant to the over-allotment option.\nOn May 19, 2020, the Company completed an underwritten registered public offering of $225 million 6.125% Non-Cumulative Perpetual Preferred Stock, Series C ( Series C Preferred), which included the sale of $25.0 million of Series C Preferred pursuant to an over-allotment option.\nCredit Rating\nWe believe our current rating depends upon a number of factors, including industry dynamics, operating and economic environment, operating results, operating margins, earnings trends and volatility, balance sheet composition, liquidity and liquidity management, our capital structure, our overall risk management, business diversification, and our market share and competitive position in the markets in which we operate. Deteriorations in any of these factors could impact our credit rating. A reduction in our credit rating could adversely affect our liquidity and competitive position, increase our incremental borrowing costs, limit our access to the capital markets, or trigger our obligations under certain financial agreements. As such, we may not be able to successfully obtain additional outside financing to fund our operations on favorable terms, or at all.\nWe believe our existing assets, a significant portion of which are liquid in nature, together with the funds from operations, available informal short-term credit arrangements, and our ability to raise additional capital will provide sufficient resources to meet our present and anticipated financing needs.\nUse of Capital Resources\nOn December 2, 2020, our $300.0 million senior notes matured.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2020, we repurchased $58.3 million, or 1.7 million shares, at an average price of $33.35 per share.\nThe following table summarizes the activity related to our company's note receivable from January 1, 2019 to December 31, 2020 (in thousands):\nTable 98: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Beginning balance - January 1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 525,332\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 408,436\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Notes issued - organic growth\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 179,698\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 209,178\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Notes issued - acquisitions (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 4,065\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Amortization\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (103,983\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (95,053\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (4,054\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (1,294\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Ending balance - December 31\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 596,993\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 525,332\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n (1) Notes issued in conjunction with the acquisition of First Empire in 2019. \nWe have paid $179.7 million in the form of upfront notes to financial advisors for transition pay during the year ended December 31, 2020. As we continue to take advantage of the opportunities created by market displacement and as competition for skilled professionals in the industry increases, we may decide to devote more significant resources to attracting and retaining qualified personnel.\nWe utilize transition pay, principally in the form of upfront demand notes, to aid financial advisors, who have elected to join our firm, to supplement their lost compensation while transitioning their customers' accounts to the Stifel platform. The initial value of the notes is determined primarily by the financial advisors' trailing production and assets under management. These notes are generally forgiven over a five- to ten-year period based on production. The future estimated amortization expense of the upfront notes, assuming current-year production levels and static growth for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2022, 2023, 2024, 2025, and thereafter, is $123.5 million, $97.0 million, $86.3 million, $73.0 million, $54.1 million, and $163.1 million, respectively. These estimates could change if we continue to grow our business through expansion or experience increased production levels.\nWe maintain an incentive stock plan and a wealth accumulation plan that provides for the granting of stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock, performance awards, stock units, and debentures (collectively, deferred awards\u201d) to our associates. Historically, we have granted stock units to our associates as part of our retention program. A restricted stock unit or restricted stock award represents the right to receive a share of the Company's common stock at a designated time in the future without cash payment by the associate and is issued in lieu of cash incentive, principally for deferred compensation and employee retention plans. The restricted stock units or restricted stock awards generally vest over the next one to ten years after issuance and are distributed at predetermined future payable dates once vesting occurs. Restricted stock awards are restricted as to sale or disposition. These restrictions lapse over the next one to five years.\nAt December 31, 2020, the total number of restricted stock units, Performance-based Restricted Stock Units ( PRSUs\u201d), and restricted stock awards outstanding was 20.9 million, of which 17.9 million were unvested. At December 31, 2020, there was approximately $491.1 million of unrecognized compensation cost for deferred awards, which is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 2.7 years.\nThe future estimated compensation expense of the deferred awards, assuming current year forfeiture levels and static growth for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2022, 2023, 2024, 2025, and thereafter, is $142.9 million, $127.1 million, $95.6 million, $66.9 million, $28.3 million, and $30.3 million, respectively. These estimates could change if our forfeitures change from historical levels.\nNet Capital Requirements - We operate in a highly regulated environment and are subject to capital requirements, which may limit distributions to our company from our subsidiaries. Distributions from our broker-dealer subsidiaries are subject to net capital rules. These subsidiaries have historically operated in excess of minimum net capital requirements. However, if distributions were to be limited in the future due to the failure of our subsidiaries to comply with the net capital rules or a change in the net capital rules, it could have a material and adverse effect to our company by limiting our operations that require intensive use of capital, such as underwriting or trading activities, or limit our ability to implement our business and growth strategies, pay interest on and repay the principal of our debt, and/or repurchase our common stock. Our non-broker-dealer subsidiaries, Stifel Bank & Trust, Stifel Bank, Stifel Trust Company, N.A., and Stifel Trust Company Delaware, N.A., are also subject to various regulatory capital requirements administered by the federal banking agencies. Our broker-dealer subsidiaries and our bank subsidiaries have consistently operated in excess of their capital adequacy requirements. Our Canadian subsidiary, SNC, is subject to the regulatory supervision and requirements of IIROC.\nAt December 31, 2020, Stifel had net capital of $487.7 million, which was 40.0% of aggregate debit items and $463.3 million in excess of its minimum required net capital. At December 31, 2020, all of our broker-dealer subsidiaries' net capital exceeded the minimum net capital required under the SEC rule. At December 31, 2020, SNEL's capital and reserves were in excess of the financial resources requirement under the rules of the FCA. At December 31, 2020, our banking subsidiaries were considered well capitalized under the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action. At December 31, 2020, SNC's net capital and reserves were in excess of the financial resources requirement under the rules of the IIROC. See Note 18 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for details of our regulatory capital requirements.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nIn preparing our consolidated financial statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles and pursuant to the rules and regulations of the SEC, we make assumptions, judgments, and estimates that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, and expenses, and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. We base our assumptions, judgments, and estimates on historical experience and various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results could differ materially from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. On a regular basis, we evaluate our assumptions, judgments, and estimates. We also discuss our critical accounting policies and estimates with the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors.\nWe believe that the assumptions, judgments, and estimates involved in the accounting policies described below have the greatest potential impact on our consolidated financial statements. These areas are key components of our results of operations and are based on complex rules that require us to make assumptions, judgments, and estimates, so we consider these to be our critical accounting policies. Historically, our assumptions, judgments, and estimates relative to our critical accounting policies and estimates have not differed materially from actual results.\nFor a full description of these and other accounting policies, see Note 2 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nValuation of Financial Instruments\nWe measure certain financial assets and liabilities at fair value on a recurring basis, including trading securities owned, available-for-sale securities, investments, trading securities sold, but not yet purchased, and derivatives.\nTrading securities owned and pledged and trading securities sold, but not yet purchased, are carried at fair value on the consolidated statements of financial condition, with unrealized gains and losses reflected on the consolidated statements of operations.\nThe fair value of a financial instrument is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date, or an exit price. The degree of judgment used in measuring the fair value of financial instruments generally correlates to the level of pricing observability. Financial instruments with readily available active quoted prices or for which fair value can be measured from actively quoted prices in active markets generally have more pricing observability and less judgment used in measuring fair value. Conversely, financial instruments rarely traded or not quoted have less pricing observability and are measured at fair value using valuation models that require more judgment. Pricing observability is impacted by a number of factors, including the type of financial instrument, whether the financial instrument is new to the market and not yet established, the characteristics specific to the transaction, and overall market conditions generally.\nWhen available, we use observable market prices, observable market parameters, or broker or dealer quotes (bid and ask prices) to derive the fair value of financial instruments. In the case of financial instruments transacted on recognized exchanges, the observable market prices represent quotations for completed transactions from the exchange on which the financial instrument is principally traded.\nA substantial percentage of the fair value of our trading securities and other investments owned, trading securities pledged as collateral, and trading securities sold, but not yet purchased, are based on observable market prices, observable market parameters, or derived from broker or dealer prices. The availability of observable market prices and pricing parameters can vary from product to product. Where available, observable market prices and pricing or market parameters in a product may be used to derive a price without requiring significant judgment. In certain markets, observable market prices or market parameters are not available for all products, and fair value is determined using techniques appropriate for each particular product. These techniques involve some degree of judgment.\nFor investments in illiquid or privately held securities that do not have readily determinable fair values, the determination of fair value requires us to estimate the value of the securities using the best information available. Among the factors we consider in determining the fair value of investments are the cost of the investment, terms and liquidity, developments since the acquisition of the investment, the sales price of recently issued securities, the financial condition and operating results of the issuer, earnings trends and consistency of operating cash flows, the long-term business potential of the issuer, the quoted market price of securities with similar quality and yield that are publicly traded, and other factors generally pertinent to the valuation of investments. In instances where a security is subject to transfer restrictions, the value of the security is based primarily on the quoted price of a similar security without restriction but may be reduced by an amount estimated to reflect such restrictions. The fair value of these investments is subject to a high degree of volatility and may be susceptible to significant fluctuation in the near term, and the differences could be material.\nWe have categorized our financial instruments measured at fair value into a three-level classification in accordance with Topic 820, Fair Value Measurement and Disclosures.\u201d Fair value measurements of financial instruments that use quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities are generally categorized as Level 1, and fair value measurements of financial instruments that have no direct observable levels are generally categorized as Level 3. All other fair value measurements of financial instruments that do not fall within the Level 1 or Level 3 classification are considered Level 2. The lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement of a financial instrument is used to categorize the instrument and reflects the judgment of management.\nLevel 3 financial instruments have little to no pricing observability as of the report date. These financial instruments do not have active two-way markets and are measured using management's best estimate of fair value, where the inputs into the determination of fair value require significant management judgment or estimation. We have identified Level 3 financial instruments to include certain asset-backed securities, consisting of collateral loan obligation securities, that have experienced low volumes of executed transactions, certain corporate bonds and equity securities where there was less frequent or nominal market activity, investments in private equity funds, and auction rate securities for which the market has been dislocated and largely ceased to function. Our Level 3 asset-backed securities are valued using cash flow models that utilize unobservable inputs. Level 3 corporate bonds are valued using prices from comparable securities. Equity securities with unobservable inputs are valued using management's best estimate of fair value, where the inputs require significant management judgment. Auction rate securities are valued based upon our expectations of issuer redemptions and using internal models.\nContingencies\nWe are involved in various pending and potential legal proceedings related to our business, including litigation, arbitration, and regulatory proceedings. Some of these matters involve claims for substantial amounts, including claims for punitive damages. We have, after consultation with outside legal counsel and consideration of facts currently known by management, recorded estimated losses in accordance with Topic 450 ( Topic 450\u201d), Contingencies,\u201d to the extent that claims are probable of loss and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. The determination of these reserve amounts requires us to use significant judgment, and our final liabilities may ultimately be materially different. This determination is inherently subjective, as it requires estimates that are subject to potentially significant revision as more information becomes available and due to subsequent events. In making these determinations, we consider many factors, including, but not limited to, the loss and damages sought by the plaintiff or claimant, the basis and validity of the claim, the likelihood of a successful defense against the claim, and the potential for, and magnitude of, damages or settlements from such pending and potential litigation and arbitration proceedings, and fines and penalties or orders from regulatory agencies. See Item 3, Legal Proceedings,\u201d in Part I of this report for information on our legal, regulatory, and arbitration proceedings.\nAllowance for Credit Losses\nOn January 1, 2020, we adopted the new accounting standard that requires the measurement of the allowance for credit losses, which includes the allowance for loan losses and the reserve for unfunded lending commitments, to be based on management's best estimate of lifetime expected credit losses inherent in the Company's relevant financial assets.\nThe expected credit losses on our loan portfolio are referred to as the allowance for loan losses and are reported separately as a contra-asset to loans on the consolidated statement of financial condition. The expected credit losses for unfunded lending commitments, including standby letters of credit and binding unfunded loan commitments, are reported on the consolidated statement of financial condition in accounts payable and accrued expenses. The provision for loan losses related to the loan portfolio and the provision for unfunded lending commitments are reported in the consolidated statement of operations in provision for credit losses.\nFor loans, the expected credit loss is typically estimated using quantitative methods that consider a variety of factors, such as historical loss experience derived from proxy data, the current credit quality of the portfolio, as well as an economic outlook over the life of the loan. The life of the loan for closed-ended products is based on the contractual maturity of the loan adjusted for any expected prepayments. The contractual maturity includes any extension options that are at the sole discretion of the borrower. For open-ended products, the expected credit loss is determined based on the maximum repayment term associated with future draws from credit lines.\nIn our loss forecasting framework, we incorporate forward-looking information through the use of macroeconomic scenarios applied over the forecasted life of the assets. These macroeconomic scenarios include variables that have historically been key drivers of increases and decreases in credit losses. These variables include, but are not limited to, unemployment rates, real estate prices, gross domestic product levels, corporate bond spreads, and long-term interest rate forecasts. To estimate losses for contractual periods that extend beyond the forecast horizon, we revert to an average historical loss experience. As any one economic outlook is inherently uncertain, we leverage multiple scenarios. The scenarios that are chosen each quarter and the amount of weighting given to each scenario depend on a variety of factors, including recent economic events, leading economic indicators, and industry trends. The reserve for unfunded lending commitments is estimated using the same scenarios, models, and economic data as the loan portfolio.\nThe allowance for loan losses includes adjustments for qualitative reserves based on our company's assessment that may not be adequately represented in the quantitative methods or the economic assumptions described above. For example, factors that we consider include changes in lending policies and procedures, business conditions, the nature and size of the portfolio, portfolio concentrations, the volume and severity of past due loans and nonaccrual loans, the effect of external factors such as competition, and legal and regulatory requirements, among others. Further, we consider the inherent uncertainty in quantitative models that are built on historical data. As a result of the uncertainty inherent in the quantitative models, other quantitative and qualitative factors are considered in adjusting allowance amounts, including, but not limited to, the following: model imprecision, imprecision in macroeconomic scenario forecasts, or changes in the economic environment affecting specific portfolio segments that deviate from the macroeconomic forecasts. The evaluation is inherently subjective, as it requires estimates that are susceptible to significant revision as more information becomes available. Depending on changes in circumstances, future assessments of credit risk may yield materially different results from the prior estimates, which may require an increase or a decrease in the allowance for loan losses.\nThe allowance for credit losses can also be impacted by unanticipated changes in asset quality of the portfolio. In addition, while we have incorporated our estimated impact of the coronavirus ( COVID-19\u201d) pandemic on the economy into our allowance for credit losses, the ultimate impact of COVID-19 is still unknown, including how long economic activities will be impacted and what effect the unprecedented levels of government fiscal and monetary actions will have on the economy and our credit losses.\nAs described above, the process to determine the allowance for credit losses requires numerous estimates and assumptions, some of which require a high degree of judgment and are often interrelated. Changes in the estimates and assumptions can result in significant changes in the allowance for credit losses. Our process for determining the allowance for credit losses is further discussed in Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nIncome Taxes\nThe provision for income taxes and related tax reserves is based on our consideration of known liabilities and tax contingencies for multiple taxing authorities. Known liabilities are amounts that will appear on current tax returns, amounts that have been agreed to in revenue agent revisions as the result of examinations by the taxing authorities, and amounts that will follow from such examinations but affect years other than those being examined. Tax contingencies are liabilities that might arise from a successful challenge by the taxing authorities taking a contrary position or interpretation regarding the application of tax law to our tax return filings. Factors considered in estimating our liability are results of tax audits, historical experience, and consultation with tax attorneys and other experts.\nAccounting Standards Codification ( ASC\u201d) Topic 740 ( Topic 740\u201d), Income Taxes,\u201d clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an entity's financial statements and prescribed recognition threshold and measurement attributes for financial statement disclosure of tax positions taken or expected to be taken on a tax return. The impact of an uncertain income tax position on the income tax return must be recognized at the largest amount that is more likely than not to be sustained upon audit by the relevant taxing authority. An uncertain income tax position will not be recognized if it has less than a 50% likelihood of being sustained. Additionally, Topic 740 provides guidance on derecognition, classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods, disclosure, and transition.\nGoodwill and Intangible Assets\nUnder the provisions of ASC Topic 805, Business Combinations,\u201d we record all assets and liabilities acquired in purchase acquisitions, including goodwill and other intangible assets, at fair value. Determining the fair value of assets and liabilities requires certain estimates.\nGoodwill for certain acquisitions is deductible for tax purposes. The amortization of goodwill for tax purposes creates a cash tax savings due to a reduction in the current taxes payable. We have recorded cash tax savings for the year ending December 31, 2020, of $7.5 million and anticipate cumulative future cash savings of $61.0 million as of result of the tax amortization of goodwill.\nIn accordance with ASC Topic 350, Intangibles - Goodwill and Other,\u201d indefinite-life intangible assets and goodwill are not amortized. Rather, they are subject to impairment testing on an annual basis, or more often if events or circumstances indicate there may be impairment. This test involves assigning tangible assets and liabilities as well as identified intangible assets and goodwill to reporting units and comparing the fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying amount. If the fair value is less than the carrying amount, a further test is required to measure the amount of the impairment.\nWe test goodwill for impairment on an annual basis and on an interim basis when certain events or circumstances exist. We test for impairment at the reporting unit level, which is generally at the level of or one level below our company's business segments. For both the annual and interim tests, we have the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether the existence of events or circumstances leads to a determination that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. If, after assessing the totality of events or circumstances, we determine it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is greater than its carrying amount, then performing the two-step impairment test is not required. However, if we conclude otherwise, we are then required to perform the first step of the two-step impairment test. Goodwill impairment is determined by comparing the estimated fair value of a reporting unit with its respective carrying value. If the estimated fair value exceeds the carrying value, goodwill at the reporting unit level is not deemed to be impaired. If the estimated fair value is below carrying value, however, further analysis is required to determine the amount of the impairment. Additionally, if the carrying value of a reporting unit is zero or a negative value and it is determined that it is more likely than not the goodwill is impaired, further analysis is required. The estimated fair values of the reporting units are derived based on valuation techniques we believe market participants would use for each of the reporting units. Our annual goodwill impairment testing was completed as of October 1, 2020, with no impairment charges resulting from the annual impairment tests.\nThe goodwill impairment test requires us to make judgments in determining what assumptions to use in the calculation. Assumptions, judgments, and estimates about future cash flows and discount rates are complex and often subjective. They can be affected", "item_7_text": "ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe following discussion of the financial condition and results of operations of our company should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes thereto included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2020.\nUnless otherwise indicated, the terms we,\u201d us,\u201d our,\u201d or our company\u201d in this report refer to Stifel Financial Corp. and its wholly owned subsidiaries.\nExecutive Summary\nWe operate as a financial services and bank holding company. We have built a diversified business serving private clients, institutional investors, and investment banking clients located across the country. Our principal activities are: (i) private client services, including securities transaction and financial planning services; (ii) institutional equity and fixed income sales, trading, and research, and municipal finance; (iii) investment banking services, including mergers and acquisitions, public offerings, and private placements; and (iv) retail and commercial banking, including personal and commercial lending programs.\nOur core philosophy is based upon a tradition of trust, understanding, and studied advice. We attract and retain experienced professionals by fostering a culture of entrepreneurial, long-term thinking. We provide our private, institutional, and corporate clients quality, personalized service, with the theory that if we place clients' needs first, both our clients and our company will prosper. Our unwavering client and associate focus have earned us a reputation as one of the nation's leading wealth management and investment banking firms. We have grown our business both organically and through opportunistic acquisitions.\nWe plan to maintain our focus on revenue growth with a continued appreciation for the development of quality client relationships. Within our private client business, our efforts will be focused on recruiting experienced financial advisors with established client relationships. Within our capital markets business, our focus continues to be on providing quality client management and product diversification. In executing our growth strategy, we will continue to seek out opportunities that allow us to take advantage of the consolidation among middle-market firms, whereby allowing us to increase market share in our private client and institutional group businesses.\nStifel Financial Corp., through its wholly owned subsidiaries, is principally engaged in retail brokerage; securities trading; investment banking; investment advisory; retail, consumer, and commercial banking; and related financial services. Our major geographic area of concentration is throughout the United States, with a growing presence in the United Kingdom, Europe, and Canada. Our principal customers are individual investors, corporations, municipalities, and institutions.\nOur ability to attract and retain highly skilled and productive associates is critical to the success of our business. Accordingly, compensation and benefits comprise the largest component of our expenses, and our performance is dependent upon our ability to attract, develop, and retain highly skilled associates who are motivated and committed to providing the highest quality of service and guidance to our clients.\nOn May 19, 2020, the Company completed an underwritten registered public offering of $225 million 6.125% Non-Cumulative Perpetual Preferred Stock, Series C ( Series C Preferred), which included the sale of $25.0 million of Series C Preferred pursuant to an over-allotment option.\nOn May 20, 2020, we sold in a registered underwritten public offering, $400.0 million in aggregate principal amount of 4.00% senior notes due May 2030.\nOn November 11, 2020, our Board approved a 50% stock dividend, in the form of a three-for-two stock split, of our common stock payable on December 16, 2020, to shareholders of record as of December 2, 2020. All share and per share information has been retroactively adjusted to reflect the stock split.\nCOVID-19 Pandemic\nIn the first quarter of 2020, the World Health Organization declared the outbreak of a novel strand of the coronavirus ( COVID-19\u201d) a pandemic. Since that time, authorities have implemented numerous measures attempting to contain the spread and impact of COVID-19, such as travel bans and restrictions, quarantines, shelter-in-place orders, and limitations on business activity, including closures. Certain jurisdictions have begun reopening only to return to restrictions in the face of increases in new COVID-19 cases. Recent developments include the phased reopening of domestic and global markets and other economic activity to varying degrees. These measures have severely restricted global economic activity, which is disrupting global supply chains, lowering asset valuations, significantly increasing unemployment and underemployment levels, decreasing liquidity in markets for certain securities, and causing significant volatility and disruptions in the financial, energy, and commodity markets. Recent outbreaks in various states indicate that COVID-19, and related measures to address the pandemic, will continue to impact and disrupt the global and domestic economy and, by extension, our business, well into 2021.\nTo address the economic impact in the U.S., in March and April 2020, the President signed into law various stimulus packages to provide relief to businesses and individuals. In addition, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System ( Federal Reserve\u201d) has taken additional steps to bolster the economy by providing additional funding sources for small and mid-sized businesses as well as for state and local governments as they work through cash flow stresses caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as reducing the federal funds rate and the interest rate on the Federal Reserve's discount window, and implementing programs to promote liquidity in certain securities markets.\nSubsequently, in light of the foregoing government actions and more clarity from the U.S. Federal Reserve Bank on future interest rate policy, the equity markets experienced a strong rebound, and a supportive trading environment for investors has emerged along with renewed activity in the equity and debt new issue capital markets. We have experienced strong market volumes and increased client activity across our capital markets business with considerably improved performance.\nIn response to the pandemic, we implemented protocols and processes to help protect our associates and clients. These measures include:\n \u2022 Operating our businesses from remote locations, leveraging our business continuity plans and capabilities that include having the majority of associates work from home, and other associates operating using pre-planned contingency strategies for critical site-based operations. These capabilities have allowed us to continue to service our clients. \n \u2022 Providing support to our associates during the pandemic through expanded access to wellness and healthcare remotely. \n \u2022 Our information technology group has deployed remote technologies that allow associates to effectively work remotely. Since March, the technology team has made a number of upgrades and changes to these systems to ensure optimal performance. \n \u2022 Our information security team is focused on protecting data by continuously reviewing, monitoring, and training associates. \n \u2022 Participating in the CARES Act and Federal Reserve lending programs for businesses, including the SBA PPP, and continuing to provide access to the important financial services to our clients. \nWe continue to monitor the effects of the pandemic, both on a national level as well as regionally and locally, and are responding accordingly. In addition, we continue to provide frequent communications to our clients, employees, and regulators.\nWe test goodwill for impairment on an annual basis and on an interim basis when certain events or circumstances exist. We performed our annual impairment testing on October 1, 2020, with no impairment charges resulting from the annual impairment test. In addition, in light of the pandemic, we evaluated our assets, including goodwill and other intangibles, for potential impairment and reviewed fair values of financial instruments that are carried at fair value. Based upon our review as of December 31, 2020, no impairments have been recorded and there have been no significant changes in fair value hierarchy classifications.\nResults for the year ended December 31, 2020\nFor the year ended December 31, 2020, net revenues increased 12.4% to a record $3.8 billion compared to $3.3 billion during the comparable period in 2019. This represents our 25th consecutive year of record net revenues. Net income available to common shareholders for the year ended December 31, 2020, increased 10.5% to $476.2 million, or $4.16 per diluted common share, compared to $431.1 million, or $3.66 per diluted common share, in 2019. For the year ended December 31, 2020, our Global Wealth Management and Institutional Group segments posted record net revenues. For the year ended December 31, 2020, our Institutional Group recorded record pre-tax income.\nOur revenue growth for the year ended December 31, 2020, was primarily attributable to an increase in brokerage revenues, increased capital-raising revenues, and asset management and service fees, partially offset by lower net interest income and advisory fee revenues.\nExternal Factors Impacting Our Business\nPerformance in the financial services industry in which we operate is highly correlated to the overall strength of economic conditions and financial market activity. Overall market conditions are a product of many factors, which are beyond our control and mostly unpredictable. These factors may affect the financial decisions made by investors, including their level of participation in the financial markets. In turn, these decisions may affect our business results. With respect to financial market activity, our profitability is sensitive to a variety of factors, including the demand for investment banking services as reflected by the number and size of equity and debt financings and merger and acquisition transactions, the volatility of the equity and fixed income markets, the level and shape of various yield curves, the volume and value of trading in securities, and the value of our customers' assets under management.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has severely impacted, and will likely continue to severely impact, global economic conditions, resulting in substantial volatility in the global financial markets, increased unemployment, and operational challenges such as the temporary closures of businesses, sheltering-in-place directives, and increased remote work protocols. Governments and central banks around the world have reacted to the economic crisis caused by the pandemic by implementing stimulus and liquidity programs and cutting interest rates, though it is unclear whether these or future actions will be successful in countering the economic disruption. If the\npandemic is prolonged or the actions of governments and central banks are unsuccessful, the adverse impact on the global economy will deepen, and our results of operations and financial condition in future quarters will be adversely affected.\nEffective January 1, 2020, we adopted the new accounting standard on current expected credit losses ( CECL\u201d), under which the allowance is measured based on management's best estimate of lifetime expected credit losses. Upon adoption of the new accounting standard, we recorded a $10.4 million, or a 10.7% increase to the allowance for credit losses. In addition, during the twelve months ended December 31, 2020, we recorded additional net credit loss reserves reflecting the impact of changes in our company's outlook on estimated lifetime expected credit losses under the CECL standard due to the COVID-19 pandemic.\nOur overall financial results continue to be highly and directly correlated to the direction and activity levels of the United States equity and fixed income markets. At December 31, 2020, the key indicators of the markets' performance, the NASDAQ, the S&P 500, and Dow Jones Industrial Average closed 43.6%, 16.3%, and 7.2% higher than their December 31, 2019, closing prices, respectively.\nAs a participant in the financial services industry, we are subject to complicated and extensive regulation of our business. The recent economic and political environment has led to legislative and regulatory initiatives, both enacted and proposed, that could substantially intensify the regulation of the financial services industry and may significantly impact us.\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe following table presents consolidated financial information for the periods indicated (in thousands, except percentages):\n\nNET REVENUES\nThe following table presents consolidated net revenues for the periods indicated (in thousands, except percentages):\n\nYear Ended December 31, 2020, Compared With Year Ended December 31, 2019\nFor the year ended December 31, 2020, net revenues increased 12.4% to a record $3.8 billion from $3.3 billion in 2019. This represents our 25th consecutive year of record net revenues. The increase was primarily attributable to an increase in brokerage revenues, increased capital-raising revenues, and asset management and service fees, partially offset by lower net interest income and advisory fee revenues.\nCommissions - Commission revenues are primarily generated from agency transactions in OTC and listed equity securities, insurance products, and options. In addition, commission revenues also include distribution fees for promoting and distributing mutual funds.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2020, commission revenues increased 14.0% to $760.6 million from $667.5 million in 2019. The increase is primarily attributable to an increase in equities trading and private placement commissions over 2019. The increase in trading volumes during 2020 was primarily due to market volatility caused by the economic uncertainty created by the COVID-19 pandemic.\nPrincipal transactions - Principal transaction revenues are gains and losses on secondary trading, principally fixed income brokerage revenues.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2020, principal transactions revenues increased 45.3% to $588.3 million from $404.8 million in 2019. The increase is primarily attributable to strong client engagement and market volatility, as well as an increase in trading gains over 2019.\nInvestment banking - Investment banking revenues include: (i) capital-raising revenues representing fees earned from the underwriting of debt and equity securities, and (ii) advisory fees related to corporate debt and equity offerings, municipal debt offerings, merger and acquisitions, private placements, and other investment banking advisory fees.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2020, investment banking revenues increased 16.5% to a record $952.3 million from $817.4 million in 2019. The increase is primarily attributable to the growth of equity and fixed income capital-raising revenues, partially offset by lower advisory fee revenue.\nCapital-raising revenues increased 41.9% to $524.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, from $369.4 million in 2019. For the year ended December 31, 2020, equity capital-raising revenues increased 51.8% to $343.3 million from $226.2 million in 2019. For the year ended December 31, 2020, fixed income capital-raising revenues increased 26.3% to $180.9 million from $143.2 million in 2019.\nAdvisory fees decreased 4.4% to $428.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, from $448.0 million in 2019. Advisory fee revenues were negatively impacted by the decrease in industry-wide completed mergers and acquisitions transactions, which was driven by an increase in market volatility and the economic slow-down in 2020.\nAsset management and service fees - Asset management and service fees include fees for asset-based financial services provided to individuals and institutional clients. Investment advisory fees are charged based on the value of assets in fee-based accounts. Asset management and service fees are affected by changes in the balances of client assets due to market fluctuations and levels of net new client assets.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2020, asset management and service fee revenues increased 8.2% to a record $917.4 million from $848.0 million in 2019. The increase is primarily attributable to higher asset values and strong fee-based asset flows. Please refer to Asset management and service fees\u201d in the Global Wealth Management segment discussion for information on the changes in asset management and service fees revenues.\nOther income - For the year ended December 31, 2020, other income increased 43.8% to $75.3 million from $52.4 million during 2019. The increase is primarily attributable to the gain recognized on the sale of Ziegler Capital Management, LLC in the first quarter of 2020 and an increase in loan origination fees, partially offset by investment losses.\nYear Ended December 31, 2019, Compared With Year Ended December 31, 2018\nFor the year ended December 31, 2019, net revenues increased 10.3% to $3.3 billion from $3.0 billion in 2018. The increase is primarily attributable to an increase in investment banking revenues, higher net interest income as a result of an increase in interest-earning assets at Stifel Bancorp, an increase in brokerage revenues, and the growth in asset management and service fees as a result of increased assets under management.\nCommissions - For the year ended December 31, 2019, commission revenues increased 1.5% to $667.5 million from $657.7 million in 2018. The increase is primarily attributable to an increase in trading volumes.\nPrincipal transactions - For the year ended December 31, 2019, principal transactions revenues increased 15.2% to $404.8 million from $351.4 million in 2018. The increase is primarily attributable to higher institutional fixed income brokerage revenues, as well as the contribution from the First Empire acquisition that closed during the first quarter of 2019.\nInvestment banking - For the year ended December 31, 2019, investment banking revenues increased 15.5% to $817.4 million from $707.7 million in 2018. The increase is primarily attributable to the growth of advisory fee revenue and fixed income capital-raising revenues, partially offset by lower equity capital-raising revenues.\nAdvisory fees increased 20.6% to $448.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, from $371.5 million in 2018. The increase is primarily attributable to an increase in the number of completed advisory transactions during 2019, including growth in our fund placement business.\nCapital-raising revenues increased 9.9% to $369.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, from $336.2 million in 2018. For the year ended December 31, 2019, equity capital-raising revenues decreased 0.1% to $226.2 million from $226.5 million in 2018. For the year ended December 31, 2019, fixed income capital-raising revenues increased 30.5% to $143.2 million from $109.7 million in 2018.\nAsset management and service fees - For the year ended December 31, 2019, asset management and service fee revenues increased 5.2% to $848.0 million from $806.2 million in 2018. The increase is primarily a result of an increase in the number and value of fee-based accounts, an increase in fees earned on client cash balances, and an increase of interest rates on fees earned on client cash. See Asset management and service fees\u201d in the Global Wealth Management segment discussion for information on the changes in asset management and service fees revenues.\nOther income - For the year ended December 31, 2019, other income increased 105.0% to $52.4 million from $25.6 million in 2018. The increase is primarily attributable to an increase in loan origination fees and a decline in investment losses from 2018.\nNET INTEREST INCOME\nThe following tables present average balance data and operating interest revenue and expense data, as well as related interest yields for the periods indicated (in thousands, except rates):\n\n * Please refer to Distribution of Assets, Liabilities, and Shareholders' Equity; Interest Rates and Interest Rate Differential table included in Results of Operations - Global Wealth Management\u201d for additional information on Stifel Bancorp's average balances and interest income and expense. \nYear Ended December 31, 2020, Compared With Year Ended December 31, 2019\nNet interest income - Net interest income is the difference between interest earned on interest-earning assets and interest paid on funding sources. Net interest income is affected by changes in the volume and mix of these assets and liabilities, as well as by fluctuations in interest rates and portfolio management strategies. For the year ended December 31, 2020, net interest income decreased 16.3% to $458.1 million from $547.0 million in 2019. Decreases in short-term interest rates have had a negative impact on our results, in particular on our net interest income. The Federal Reserve significantly further lowered interest rates in response to COVID-19 pandemic concerns.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2020, interest revenue decreased 27.7% to $523.8 million from $724.9 million in 2019, principally as a result of a decrease in interest revenue generated from interest-earning assets of Stifel Bancorp due to lower interest rates. The average interest-earning assets of Stifel Bancorp increased to $18.0 billion during the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to $16.5 billion during 2019 at average interest rates of 2.70% and 3.78%, respectively.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2020, interest expense decreased 63.0% to $65.8 million from $177.9 million in 2019. The decrease is primarily driven by the impact of lower interest rates, partially offset by the increase interest expense on our senior notes. In May 2020, we sold in a registered underwritten public offering, $400.0 million in aggregate principal amount of 4.00% senior notes due May 2030. In December 2020, our $300.0 million notes matured.\nYear Ended December 31, 2019, Compared With Year Ended December 31, 2018\nNet interest income - For the year ended December 31, 2019, net interest income increased 14.8% to $547.0 million from $476.4 million in 2018.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2019, interest revenue increased 12.1% to $724.9 million from $646.4 million in 2018, principally as a result of a $66.4 million increase in interest revenue generated from the growth in interest-earning assets of Stifel Bancorp and higher margin interest income. The average interest-earning assets of Stifel Bancorp increased to $16.5 billion during the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to $15.8 billion in 2018 at average interest rates of 3.78% and 3.52%, respectively.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2019, interest expense increased 4.6% to $177.9 million from $170.1 million in 2018. The increase is primarily attributable to an increase in interest-bearing liabilities (deposits) at Stifel Bancorp, partially offset by a decrease in Federal Home Loan Bank advances.\nNON-INTEREST EXPENSES\nThe following table presents consolidated non-interest expenses for the periods indicated (in thousands, except percentages):\n\nYear Ended December 31, 2020, Compared With Year Ended December 31, 2019\nCompensation and benefits - Compensation and benefits expenses, which are the largest component of our expenses, include salaries, bonuses, transition pay, benefits, amortization of stock-based compensation, employment taxes, and other associate-related costs. A significant portion of compensation expense is comprised of production-based variable compensation, including discretionary bonuses, which fluctuates in proportion to the level of business activity, increasing with higher revenues and operating profits. Other compensation costs, including base salaries, stock-based compensation amortization, and benefits, are more fixed in nature.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2020, compensation and benefits expense increased 15.2% to $2.3 billion from $2.0 billion in 2019. The increase is primarily attributable to higher variable compensation expense as a result of strong revenue growth over 2019. Compensation and benefits expense as a percentage of net revenues was 60.7% for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to 59.3% for the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase was primarily attributable to the change in the composition of revenues as compared to 2019.\nOccupancy and equipment rental - For the year ended December 31, 2020, occupancy and equipment rental expense increased 13.1% to $274.7 million from $242.9 million in 2019.

For the year ended December 31, 2020, communications and office supplies expense increased 11.7% to $164.7 million from $147.4 million in 2019. The increase is primarily attributable to higher communication and quote equipment expenses and shipping costs associated with the continued growth of our business.\nCommissions and floor brokerage - For the year ended December 31, 2020, commissions and floor brokerage expense increased 27.2% to $56.0 million from $44.0 million in 2019.

The provision for credit losses was impacted by growth in the loan portfolio and the impact of accounting for credit losses under the CECL standard, which was heightened by the impact of COVID-19 on the broader economic environment.\nOther operating expenses - Other operating expenses primarily include license and registration fees, litigation-related expenses, which consist of amounts we reserve and/or payout for legal and regulatory matters, travel and entertainment, promotional, investment banking deal costs, and professional service expenses.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2020, other operating expenses decreased 7.3% to $292.3 million from $315.5 million in 2019. The decrease is primarily attributable to significantly lower travel, entertainment, and conference-related expenses. In addition, net provisions for litigation matters were lower. These decreases were partially offset by higher taxes and licensing fees, professional fees, investment banking transaction expenses, reflecting an increase in activity levels, and insurance costs.\nProvision for income taxes - For the year ended December 31, 2020, our provision for income taxes was $147.7 million, representing an effective tax rate of 22.7%, compared to $149.2 million in 2019, representing an effective tax rate of 25.0%.\nYear Ended December 31, 2019, Compared With Year Ended December 31, 2018\nExcept as noted in the following discussion of variances, the underlying reasons for the increase in non-interest expenses can be attributed principally to our continued expansion, both organically and through our acquisitions, and increased administrative overhead to support the growth in our segments.\nCompensation and benefits - For the year ended December 31, 2019, compensation and benefits expense increased 11.7% to $2.0 billion from $1.8 billion in 2018. The increase is primarily attributable to higher compensation costs associated with the current year acquisitions.\nCompensation and benefits expense as a percentage of net revenues was 59.3% for the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to 58.5% for the year ended December 31, 2018.\nOccupancy and equipment rental - For the year ended December 31, 2019, occupancy and equipment rental expense increased 9.2% to $242.9 million from $222.4 million in 2018. The increase is primarily attributable to an increase in depreciation expense as a result of the expansion of our aircraft engine leasing business, an increase in data processing costs associated with the growth of our business, and higher rent expense as a result of an increase in locations.\nCommunications and office supplies - For the year ended December 31, 2019, communications and office supplies expense increased 5.1% to $147.4 million from $140.3 million in 2018. The increase is primarily attributable to higher communication and quote equipment expenses associated with the continued growth of our business.\nCommissions and floor brokerage - For the year ended December 31, 2019, commissions and floor brokerage expense increased 4.9% to $44.0 million from $42.0 million in 2018. The increase is primarily attributable to an increase in institutional fixed income brokerage trading volumes.\nProvision for credit losses - For the year ended December 31, 2019, provision for credit losses decreased 45.7% to $10.0 million from $18.4 million in 2018.\nOther operating expenses - For the year ended December 31, 2019, other operating expenses increased 6.3% to $315.5 million from $296.8 million in 2018. The increase is primarily attributable to higher investment banking deal costs, travel costs, litigation expense, dues and assessments, and subscription costs.\nProvision for income taxes - For the year ended December 31, 2019, our provision for income taxes was $149.2 million, representing an effective tax rate of 25.0%, compared to $140.4 million in 2018, representing an effective tax rate of 26.3%.\nSEGMENT PERFORMANCE FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS\nOur reportable segments include Global Wealth Management, Institutional Group, and Other.\nOur Global Wealth Management segment consists of two businesses, the Private Client Group and Stifel Bancorp. The Private Client Group includes branch offices and independent contractor offices of our broker-dealer subsidiaries located throughout the United States. These branches provide securities brokerage services, including the sale of equities, mutual funds, fixed income products, and insurance, as well as offering banking products to their private clients through our bank subsidiaries, which provide residential, consumer, and commercial lending, as well as FDIC-insured deposit accounts to customers of our broker-dealer subsidiaries and to the general public.\nThe success of our Global Wealth Management segment is dependent upon the quality of our products, services, financial advisors, and support personnel, including our ability to attract, retain, and motivate a sufficient number of these associates. We face competition for qualified associates from major financial services companies, including other brokerage firms, insurance companies, banking institutions, and discount brokerage firms. Segment revenue growth, operating income, and segment pre-tax operating margin are used to evaluate and measure segment performance by our management team in deciding how to allocate resources and in assessing performance.\nThe Institutional Group segment includes institutional sales and trading. It provides securities brokerage, trading, and research services to institutions with an emphasis on the sale of equity and fixed income products. This segment also includes the management of and participation in underwritings for both corporate and public finance (exclusive of sales credits generated through the Private Client Group, which are included in the Global Wealth Management segment), merger and acquisition, and financial advisory services.\nThe success of our Institutional Group segment is dependent upon the quality of our personnel, the quality and selection of our investment products and services, pricing (such as execution pricing and fee levels), and reputation. Segment operating income and segment pre-tax operating margin are used to evaluate and measure segment performance by our management team in deciding how to allocate resources and in assessing performance.\nThe Other segment includes interest income from stock borrow activities, unallocated interest expense, interest income and gains and losses from investments held, amortization of stock-based awards, and all unallocated overhead cost associated with the execution of orders; processing of securities transactions; custody of client securities; receipt, identification, and delivery of funds and securities; compliance with regulatory and legal requirements; internal financial accounting and controls; and general administration and acquisition charges.\nResults of Operations - Global Wealth Management\nThe following table presents consolidated financial information for the Global Wealth Management segment for the periods indicated (in thousands, except percentages):\n\n\n (1) Reflects change in the definition of producing brokers as of January 1, 2019.

The increase in net revenues for the year ended December 31, 2020, over 2019, is primarily attributable to the growth in asset management and service fee revenues and higher brokerage revenues and other income, partially offset by a decrease in net interest income and investment banking.\nCommissions - For the year ended December 31, 2020, commission revenues increased 7.5% to $513.2 million from $477.4 million in 2019. The increase is primarily attributable to an increase in equities trading and private placement commissions over 2019.\nPrincipal transactions - For the year ended December 31, 2020, principal transactions revenues increased 1.0% to $174.1 million from $172.3 million in 2019.

The increase is primarily attributable to higher trading volumes during 2020, driven by market volatility, as a result of the economic uncertainty created by the COVID-19 pandemic.\nAsset management and service fees - For the year ended December 31, 2020, asset management and service fees increased 8.2% to $917.4 million from $848.0 million in 2019. Asset management revenues increased from 2019, reflecting higher asset levels and strong fee-based asset flows. Fee-based account revenues are primarily billed based on asset values at the end the prior quarter.\nClient asset metrics as of the periods indicated (in thousands):\n\nThe increase in the value of our client assets and fee-based assets was primarily attributable to the rise in the markets, as well as asset growth resulting from strong recruiting efforts. The growth of our client assets was negatively impacted by the sale of Ziegler Capital Management LLC during the first quarter of 2020.\nInterest revenue - For the year ended December 31, 2020, interest revenue decreased 24.3% to $516.9 million from $682.7 million in 2019. The decrease is primarily driven by the impact of lower interest rates.

The decrease is primarily driven by the impact of lower interest rates.

The increase is primarily attributable to higher variable compensation expense as a result of strong revenue growth over 2019. Compensation and benefits expense as a percentage of net revenues was 52.0% for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to 49.1% in 2019. The increase was primarily attributable to the change in the composition of revenues as compared to 2019.\nOccupancy and equipment rental - For the year ended December 31, 2020, occupancy and equipment rental expense increased 2.5% to $122.9 million from $119.9 million in 2019.

The provision for credit losses was impacted by growth in the loan portfolio and the impact of accounting for credit losses under the CECL standard, which was heightened by the impact of COVID-19 on the broader economic environment.\nOther operating expenses - For the year ended December 31, 2020, other operating expenses decreased 1.7% to $89.5 million from $91.1 million in 2019. The decrease is primarily attributable to significantly lower travel, entertainment, and conference-related expenses. The decrease was partially offset by higher professional fees and insurance costs.\nINCOME BEFORE INCOME TAXES\nFor the year ended December 31, 2020, income before income taxes decreased 7.6% to $725.9 million from $786.0 million in 2019. Profit margins (income before income taxes as a percent of net revenues) have decreased to 33.1% for the year ended December 31, 2020, from 36.9% in 2019. Profit margins were negatively impacted by the composition of net revenues compared to 2019.

The increase is primarily a result of continued migration to fee-based accounts and our continued expansion in the asset management business. Fee-based account revenues are primarily billed based on values as of the prior quarter end.\nThe value of assets in fee-based accounts at December 31, 2019, increased 30.0% to $117.2 billion from $90.2 billion at December 31, 2018.\nInterest revenue- For the year ended December 31, 2019, interest revenue increased 11.1% to $682.7 million from $614.7 million in 2018.

Distribution of Assets, Liabilities, and Shareholders' Equity; Interest Rates and Interest Rate Differential \nThe following tables present average balance data and operating interest revenue and expense data for Stifel Bancorp, as well as related interest yields for the periods indicated (in thousands, except rates):\n\n (1) Due to immaterial amount of income recognized on tax-exempt securities, yields were not calculated on a tax-equivalent basis. \n (2) Loans on non-accrual status are included in average balances. \n (3) Please refer to the Net Interest Income table included in Results of Operations\u201d for additional information on our company's average balances and operating interest and expenses. \n\n (1) Due to immaterial amount of income recognized on tax-exempt securities, yields were not calculated on a tax-equivalent basis. \n (2) Loans on non-accrual status are included in average balances. \n (3) Please refer to the Net Interest Income table included in Results of Operations\u201d for additional information on our company's average balances and operating interest and expenses. \nNet interest income - Net interest income is the difference between interest earned on interest-earning assets and interest paid on funding sources. Net interest income is affected by changes in the volume and mix of these assets and liabilities, as well as by fluctuations in interest rates and portfolio management strategies.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2020, interest revenue for Stifel Bancorp of $485.3 million was generated from weighted-average interest-earning assets of $18.0 billion at a weighted-average interest rate of 2.70%. For the year ended December 31, 2019, interest revenue for Stifel Bancorp of $624.2 million was generated from weighted-average interest-earning assets of $16.5 billion at a weighted-average interest rate of 3.78%. For the year ended December 31, 2018, interest revenue for Stifel Bancorp of $557.8 million was generated from weighted-average interest-earning assets of $15.8 billion at a weighted-average interest rate of 3.52%. Interest-\nearning assets principally consist of commercial and industrial, residential, and securities-based loans, investment securities, and interest-bearing cash and federal funds sold.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2020, interest expense for Stifel Bancorp of $18.3 million was incurred from weighted-average interest-bearing liabilities of $16.5 billion at a weighted-average interest rate of 0.11%. For the year ended December 31, 2019, interest expense for Stifel Bancorp of $103.8 million was incurred from weighted-average interest-bearing liabilities of $15.4 billion at a weighted-average interest rate of 0.68%. For the year ended December 31, 2018, interest expense for Stifel Bancorp of $98.2 million was incurred from weighted-average interest-bearing liabilities of $14.8 billion at a weighted-average interest rate of 0.67%. Interest expense represents interest on customer money market accounts, time deposits, Federal Home Loan Bank advances, and other borrowings.\nDecreases in short-term interest rates have had a negative impact on our results, in particular on our net interest income. The Federal Reserve significantly further lowered interest rates in response to COVID-19 pandemic concerns.\nThe following table sets forth an analysis of the effect on net interest income of volume and rate changes for the periods indicated (in thousands):\n\nIncreases and decreases in interest revenue and interest expense result from changes in average balances (volume) of interest-earning bank assets and liabilities, as well as changes in average interest rates. The effect of changes in volume is determined by multiplying the change in volume by the previous year's average yield/cost. Similarly, the effect of rate changes is calculated by multiplying the change in average yield/cost by the previous year's volume. Changes applicable to both volume and rate have been allocated proportionately.\n II. Investment Portfolio \nThe following tables provide a summary of the amortized cost and fair values of the available-for-sale and held-to-maturity securities for the periods indicated (in thousands):\n\n\n (1) Unrealized gains/(losses) related to available-for-sale securities are reported in other comprehensive loss. \n (2) Held-to-maturity securities are carried on the consolidated statements of financial condition at amortized cost, and the changes in the value of these securities, other than impairment charges, are not reported on the consolidated financial statements. \n\n (1) Unrealized gains/(losses) related to available-for-sale securities are reported in other comprehensive loss. \n (2) Held-to-maturity securities are carried on the consolidated statements of financial condition at amortized cost, and the changes in the value of these securities, other than impairment charges, are not reported on the consolidated financial statements. \nWe evaluate each available-for-sale security where the value has declined below amortized cost. If our company intends to sell or believes it is more likely than not that it will be required to sell the debt security, it is written down to fair value through earnings. For available-for-sale debt securities our company intends to hold, we evaluate the debt securities for expected credit losses except for debt securities that are guaranteed by the U.S. Treasury or U.S. government agencies where we apply a zero credit loss assumption. For the remaining available-for-sale debt securities, we consider qualitative parameters such as internal and external credit ratings and the value of underlying collateral. If an available-for-sale debt security fails any of the qualitative parameters, a discounted cash flow analysis is used by our company to determine if a portion of the unrealized loss is a result of a credit loss. Any credit losses determined are recognized as an increase to the allowance for credit losses through provision expense recorded in the consolidated statement of operations in provision for credit losses. Cash flows expected to be collected are estimated using all relevant information available, such as remaining payment terms, prepayment speeds, the financial condition of the issuer, expected defaults, and the value of the underlying collateral. If any of the decline in fair value is related to market factors, that amount is recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income. In certain instances, the credit loss may exceed the total decline in fair value, in which case, the allowance recorded is limited to the difference between the amortized cost and the fair value of the asset. We separately evaluate our held-to-maturity debt securities for any credit losses. We perform a discounted cash flow analysis to estimate any credit losses, which are then recognized as part of the allowance for credit losses. For available-for-sale and held-to-maturity debt securities, we have established a nonaccrual policy that results in timely write-off of accrued interest.\nThe maturities and related weighted-average yields of available-for-sale and held-to-maturity securities at December 31, 2020, are as follows (in thousands, except rates):\n\n (1) Due to the immaterial amount of income recognized on tax-exempt securities, yields were not calculated on a tax equivalent basis. \n (2) The weighted-average yield is computed using the expected maturity of each security weighted based on the amortized cost of each security. \nWe did not hold securities from any single issuer that exceeded ten percent of our shareholders' equity at December 31, 2020.\n III. Loan Portfolio \nThe following table presents the balance and associated percentage of each major loan category in Stifel Bancorp's loan portfolio held for investment for the periods indicated (in thousands):\n\nThe maturities of the loan portfolio at December 31, 2020, are as follows (in thousands):\n\nThe sensitivity of loans with maturities in excess of one year at December 31, 2020, is as follows (in thousands):\n\nChanges in the allowance for loan losses at Stifel Bancorp were as follows (in thousands):\n\nThe following is a breakdown of the allowance for loan losses by type for the periods indicated (in thousands, except rates):\n\n\n (1) Loan category as a percentage of total loan portfolio. \n\n (1) Loan category as a percentage of total loan portfolio. \nA loan is determined to be impaired usually when principal or interest becomes 90 days past due or when collection becomes uncertain. At the time a loan is determined to be impaired, the accrual of interest and amortization of deferred loan origination fees is discontinued ( non-accrual status\u201d) and any accrued and unpaid interest income is reversed. At December 31, 2020, we had $13.8 million of impaired loans, net of discounts, which included $0.2 million in troubled debt restructurings. At December 31, 2019, 2018, 2017, and 2016, we had $14.6 million, $24.4 million, $29.2 million, and $26.9 million of impaired loans, respectively, which included $0.2 million, $9.1 million, $9.1 million, and $9.7 million of trouble debt restructurings, respectively. The specific allowance on impaired loans at December 31, 2020, 2019, 2018, 2017, and 2016 was $8.2 million, $8.2 million, $8.7 million, $9.1 million, and $3.4 million, respectively.\nThe gross interest income related to impaired loans, which would have been recorded had these loans been current in accordance with their original terms, and the interest income recognized on these loans during the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019, 2018, 2017, and 2016, were insignificant to the consolidated financial statements.\nPlease refer to the section entitled Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates\u201d herein regarding our policies for establishing loan loss reserves, including placing loans on non-accrual status.\n IV.

The increase is primarily attributable to an increase in the municipal bond origination business. Fixed income capital-raising revenues increased from a year ago as clients accessed the market to benefit from the lower rate environment and to raise additional liquidity.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2020, advisory fees decreased 4.4% to $428.1 million from $448.0 million in 2019. Advisory fee revenues were negatively impacted by the decrease in industry-wide completed mergers and acquisitions transactions, which was driven by an increase in market volatility and the economic slow-down in 2020.\nInterest income - For the year ended December 31, 2020, interest income decreased 30.2% to $16.8 million from $24.1 million in 2019. The decrease is primarily driven by the impact of lower interest rates and lower inventory levels.\nOther income - For the year ended December 31, 2020, other income decreased 96.9% to $0.4 million from $12.1 million in 2019.\nInterest expense - For the year ended December 31, 2020, interest expense decreased 50.8% to $11.9 million from $24.3 million in 2019.

The increase is primarily attributable to an increase in advisory fees and fixed income capital-raising revenues, partially offset by a decrease in equity capital-raising revenues. Investment banking revenues benefited from the contribution of our acquisition of Mooreland, which closed in the third quarter of 2019.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2019, advisory fees increased 20.6% to $448.0 million from $371.4 million in 2018. The increase is primarily attributable to an increase in the number of advisory transactions over 2018, including growth in our fund placement business.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2019, capital-raising revenues increased 8.7% to $331.5 million from $304.9 million in 2018.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2019, equity capital markets capital-raising revenues decreased 4.3% to $204.4 million from $213.6 million in 2018.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2019, fixed income capital markets capital-raising revenues increased 39.3% to $127.1 million from $91.3 million in 2018.

The increase is primarily attributable to higher rent expense.\nCommunications and office supplies - For the year ended December 31, 2019, communications and office supplies expense increased 9.6% to $74.1 million from $67.6 million in 2018. The increase is primarily attributable to an increase in communication and quote equipment expenses associated with the continued growth of our business.\nCommissions and floor brokerage - For the year ended December 31, 2019, commissions and floor brokerage expense increased 3.6% to $24.1 million from $23.2 million in 2018. The increase is primarily attributable to increased fixed income brokerage volumes.\nOther operating expenses - For the year ended December 31, 2019, other operating expenses increased 18.8% to $150.3 million from $126.5 million in 2018. The increase is primarily attributable to an increase in investment banking deal costs, dues and assessments, and conference and travel costs.\nINCOME BEFORE INCOME TAXES\nFor the year ended December 31, 2019, income before income taxes for the Institutional Group segment increased 11.9% to $175.7 million from $157.1 million in 2018. Profit margins (income before income taxes as a percentage of net revenues) have decreased to 14.5% for the year ended December 31, 2019, from 14.9% in 2018 as a result of an increase in expenses, partially offset by higher revenues.\nResults of Operations - Other Segment\nThe following table presents consolidated financial information for the Other segment for the periods presented (in thousands, except percentages):\n\nThe other segment includes expenses related to the Company's acquisition strategy and the investments made in the Company's infrastructure and control environment.\nThe expenses relating to the Company's acquisition strategy, which are included in the other segment, consists of stock-based compensation and operating costs from our various acquisitions. The following shows the expenses that are part of the other segment related to acquisitions.\n\nFor the year ended December 31, 2020, compensation and benefits expense decreased 6.5% to $30.3 million from $32.4 million in 2019.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2020, other operating expenses decreased 6.6% to $30.1 million from $32.2 million in 2019.\nThe expenses not associated with the activities described above in the other segment are as follows:\n\nFor the year ended December 31, 2020, compensation and benefits expense increased 2.9% to $167.8 million from $163.0 million in 2019.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2020, other operating expenses increased 17.8% to $150.0 million from $127.4 million in 2019.\nAnalysis of Financial Condition\nOur company's consolidated statements of financial condition consist primarily of cash and cash equivalents, receivables, financial instruments owned, bank loans, investments, goodwill, loans and advances to financial advisors, bank deposits, and payables. Total assets of $26.6 billion at December 31, 2020, were up 8.1% over December 31, 2019. Our broker-dealer subsidiary's gross assets and liabilities, including financial instruments owned, stock loan/borrow, receivables and payables from/to brokers, dealers, and clearing organizations and clients, fluctuate with our business levels and overall market conditions.\nAs of December 31, 2020, our liabilities were comprised primarily of deposits of $17.4 billion at Stifel Bancorp, accounts payable and accrued expenses of $1.2 billion, senior notes, net of debt issuance costs, of $1.1 billion, payables to customers of $1.1 billion at our broker-dealer subsidiaries, and accrued employee compensation of $638.3 million. To meet our obligations to clients and operating needs, we had $2.3 billion in cash and cash equivalents at December 31, 2020. We also had highly liquid assets consisting of held-to-maturity securities of $4.1 billion, available-for-sale securities of $2.2 billion, client brokerage receivables of $936.5 million, and financial instruments of $694.0 million.\nCash Flow\nCash and cash equivalents increased $1.1 billion to $2.3 billion at December 31, 2020, from $1.1 billion at December 31, 2019. Operating activities provided cash of $1.7 billion primarily due to net income recognized in 2020 adjusted for non-cash activities. Investing activities used cash of $1.7 billion due to the growth of the loan portfolio, investment securities purchases, and fixed asset purchases, partially offset by proceeds from the sale and maturity of securities in our investment portfolio and the proceeds received from the sale of ZCM. Financing activities provided cash of $1.2 billion primarily due to an increase in bank deposits and proceeds received from the issuance of senior notes and preferred stock, partially offset by a decrease in securities loaned, repayments of senior notes and Federal Home Loan Bank advances, dividends paid on our common and preferred stock, and share repurchases.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nThe Company's senior management establishes the liquidity and capital policies of our company. The Company's senior management reviews business performance relative to these policies, monitors the availability of alternative sources of financing, and oversees the liquidity and interest rate sensitivity of our company's asset and liability position.\nOur assets, consisting mainly of cash or assets readily convertible into cash, are our principal source of liquidity. The liquid nature of these assets provides for flexibility in managing and financing the projected operating needs of the business. These assets are financed primarily by our equity capital, corporate debt, debentures to trusts, client credit balances, short-term bank loans, proceeds from securities lending, repurchase agreements, and other payables. We currently finance our client accounts and firm trading positions through ordinary course borrowings at floating interest rates from various banks on a demand basis, securities lending, and repurchase agreements, with company-owned and client securities pledged as collateral. Changes in securities market volumes, related client borrowing demands, underwriting activity, and levels of securities inventory affect the amount of our financing requirements.\nOur bank assets consist principally of available-for-sale and held-to-maturity securities, retained loans, and cash and cash equivalents. Stifel Bancorp's current liquidity needs are generally met through deposits from brokerage clients and equity capital. We monitor the liquidity of our bank subsidiaries daily to ensure their ability to meet customer deposit withdrawals, maintain reserve requirements, and support asset growth.\nAs of December 31, 2020, we had $26.6 billion in assets, $10.1 billion of which consisted of cash or assets readily convertible into cash as follows (in thousands, except average days to conversion):\n\nAs of December 31, 2020 and 2019, the amount of collateral by asset class is as follows (in thousands):\n\nLiquidity Available From Subsidiaries\nLiquidity is principally available to our company from Stifel and Stifel Bancorp.\nStifel is required to maintain net capital equal to the greater of $1 million or two percent of aggregate debit items arising from client transactions. Covenants in the Company's committed financing facilities require the excess net capital of Stifel, our principal broker-dealer subsidiary, to be above a defined amount. At December 31, 2020, Stifel's excess net capital exceeded the minimum requirement, as defined. There are also limitations on the amount of dividends that may be declared by a broker-dealer without FINRA approval. See Note 18 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for more information on the capital restrictions placed on our broker-dealer subsidiaries.\nStifel Bancorp may pay dividends to the parent company without prior approval by its regulator as long as the dividend does not exceed the sum of Stifel Bancorp's current calendar year and the previous two calendar years' retained net income and Stifel Bancorp maintains its targeted capital to risk-weighted assets ratios.\nAlthough we have liquidity available to us from our other subsidiaries, the available amounts are not as significant as the amounts described above and, in certain instances, may be subject to regulatory requirements.\nCapital Management\nWe have an ongoing authorization from the Board of Directors to repurchase our common stock in the open market or in negotiated transactions. At December 31, 2020, the maximum number of shares that may yet be purchased under this plan was 13.3 million. We utilize the share repurchase program to manage our equity capital relative to the growth of our business and help to meet obligations under our employee benefit plans.\nLiquidity Risk Management\nOur businesses are diverse, and our liquidity needs are determined by many factors, including market movements, collateral requirements, and client commitments, all of which can change dramatically in a difficult funding environment. During a liquidity crisis, credit-sensitive funding, including unsecured debt and some types of secured financing agreements, may be unavailable, and the terms (e.g., interest rates, collateral provisions, and tenor) or availability of other types of secured financing may change. We manage liquidity risk by diversifying our funding sources across products and among individual counterparties within those products. These liquidity risk management practices have allowed us to effectively manage the market stress from the COVID-19 pandemic. For more information on the effects of the pandemic, see Executive Summary - COVID-19 Pandemic on page 31.\nAs a holding company, whereby all of our operations are conducted through our subsidiaries, our cash flow and our ability to service our debt, including the notes, depend upon the earnings of our subsidiaries. Our subsidiaries are separate and distinct legal entities. Our subsidiaries have no obligation to pay any amounts due on the notes or to provide us with funds to pay our obligations, whether by dividends, distributions, loans, or other payments.\nOur liquidity requirements may change in the event we need to raise more funds than anticipated to increase inventory positions, support more rapid expansion, develop new or enhanced services and products, acquire technologies, respond to acquisition opportunities, expand our recruiting efforts, or respond to other unanticipated liquidity requirements. We primarily rely on financing activities and distributions from our subsidiaries for funds to implement our business and growth strategies and repurchase our shares. Net capital rules, restrictions under our borrowing arrangements of our subsidiaries, as well as the earnings, financial condition, and cash requirements of our subsidiaries, may each limit distributions to us from our subsidiaries.\nThe availability of outside financing, including access to the capital markets and bank lending, depends on a variety of factors, such as market conditions, the general availability of credit, the volume of trading activities, the overall availability of credit to the financial services sector, and our credit rating. Our cost and availability of funding may be adversely affected by illiquid credit markets and wider credit spreads. As a result of any future concerns about the stability of the markets generally and the strength of counterparties specifically, lenders may from time to time curtail, or even cease to provide, funding to borrowers.\nOur liquidity management policies are designed to mitigate the potential risk that we may be unable to access adequate financing to service our financial obligations without material business impact. The principal elements of our liquidity management framework are: (a) daily monitoring of our liquidity needs at the holding company and significant subsidiary level, (b) stress testing the liquidity positions of Stifel and our bank subsidiaries, and (c) diversification of our funding sources.\nMonitoring of liquidity - Senior management establishes our liquidity and capital policies. These policies include senior management's review of short- and long-term cash flow forecasts, review of monthly capital expenditures, the monitoring of the availability of alternative sources of financing, and the daily monitoring of liquidity in our significant subsidiaries. Our decisions on the allocation of capital to our business units consider, among other factors, projected profitability and cash flow, risk, and impact on future liquidity needs. Our treasury department assists in evaluating, monitoring, and controlling the impact that our business activities have on our financial condition, liquidity, and capital structure, as well as maintains our relationships with various lenders. The objectives of these policies are to support the successful execution of our business strategies while ensuring ongoing and sufficient liquidity.\nLiquidity stress testing (Firmwide) - A liquidity stress test model is maintained by the Company that measures liquidity outflows across multiple scenarios at the major operating subsidiaries and details the corresponding impact to our holding company and the overall consolidated firm. Liquidity stress tests are utilized to ensure that current exposures are consistent with the Company's established liquidity risk tolerance and, more specifically, to identify and quantify sources of potential liquidity strain. Further, the stress tests are utilized to analyze possible impacts on the Company's cash flows and liquidity position. The outflows are modeled over a 30-day liquidity stress timeframe and include the impact of idiosyncratic and macro-economic stress events.\nThe assumptions utilized in the Company's liquidity stress tests include, but are not limited to, the following:\n \u2022 No government support \n \u2022 No access to equity and unsecured debt markets within the stress horizon \n \u2022 Higher haircuts and significantly lower availability of secured funding \n \u2022 Additional collateral that would be required by trading counter-parties, certain exchanges, and clearing organizations related to credit rating downgrades \n \u2022 Client cash withdrawals and inability to accept new deposits \n \u2022 Increased demand from customers on the funding of loans and lines of credit \nAt December 31, 2020, the Company maintained sufficient liquidity to meet current and contingent funding obligations as modeled in its liquidity stress test model.\nLiquidity stress testing (Stifel Bancorp) - Our bank subsidiaries perform three primary stress tests on its liquidity position. These stress tests are based on the following company-specific stresses: (1) the amount of deposit run-off that they could withstand over a one-month period of time based on their on-balance sheet liquidity and available credit, (2) the ability to fund operations if all available credit were to be drawn immediately, with no additional available credit, and (3) the ability to fund operations under a regulatory prompt corrective action. The goal of these stress tests is to determine their ability to fund continuing operations under significant pressures on both assets and liabilities.\nUnder all stress tests, our bank subsidiaries consider cash and highly liquid investments as available to meet liquidity needs. In its analysis, our bank subsidiaries consider agency mortgage-backed securities, corporate bonds, and commercial mortgage-backed securities as highly liquid. In addition to being able to be readily financed at modest haircut levels, our bank subsidiaries estimate that each of the individual securities within each of the asset classes described above could be sold into the market and converted into cash within three business days under normal market conditions, assuming that the entire portfolio of a given asset class was not simultaneously liquidated. At December 31, 2020, available cash and highly liquid investments comprised approximately 18% of Stifel Bancorp's assets, which was well in excess of its internal target.\nIn addition to these stress tests, management performs a daily liquidity review. The daily analysis provides management with all major fluctuations in liquidity. The analysis also tracks the proportion of deposits that Stifel Bancorp is sweeping from its affiliated broker-dealer, Stifel. On a monthly basis, liquidity key performance indicators and compliance with liquidity policy limits are reported to the Board of Directors. Our bank subsidiaries have not violated any internal liquidity policy limits.\nFunding Sources\nThe Company pursues a strategy of diversification of secured and unsecured funding sources (by product and by investor) and attempts to ensure that the tenor of the Company's liabilities equals or exceeds the expected holding period of the assets being financed. The Company funds its balance sheet through diverse sources. These sources may include the Company's equity capital, long-term debt, repurchase agreements, securities lending, deposits, committed and uncommitted credit facilities, Federal Home Loan Bank advances, and federal funds agreements.\nCash and Cash Equivalents - We held $2.3 billion of cash and cash equivalents at December 31, 2020, compared to $1.1 billion at December 31, 2019. Cash and cash equivalents provide immediate sources of funds to meet our liquidity needs.\nSecurities Available-for-Sale - We held $2.2 billion in available-for-sale investment securities at December 31, 2020, compared to $3.3 billion at December 31, 2019. As of December 31, 2020, the weighted-average life of the investment securities portfolio was approximately 0.9 years. These investment securities provide increased liquidity and flexibility to support our company's funding requirements.\nWe monitor the available-for-sale investment portfolio for other-than-temporary impairment based on a number of criteria, including the size of the unrealized loss position, the duration for which the security has been in a loss position, credit rating, the nature of the investments, and current market conditions. For debt securities, we also consider any intent to sell the security and the likelihood we will be required to sell the security before its anticipated recovery. We continually monitor the ratings of our security holdings and conduct regular reviews of our credit-sensitive assets.\nDeposits - Deposits have become our largest funding source. Deposits provide a stable, low-cost source of funds that we utilize to fund asset growth and to diversify funding sources. We have continued to expand our deposit-gathering efforts through our existing private client network and through expansion. These channels offer a broad set of deposit products that include demand deposits, money market deposits, and certificates of deposit ( CDs\u201d).\nAs of December 31, 2020, we had $17.4 billion in deposits compared to $15.3 billion at December 31, 2019. Our core deposits are primarily comprised of money market deposit accounts, non-interest-bearing deposits, and CDs.\nShort-term borrowings - Our short-term financing is generally obtained through short-term bank line financing on an uncommitted, secured basis, securities lending arrangements, repurchase agreements, advances from the Federal Home Loan Bank, term loans, and committed bank line financing on an unsecured basis. We borrow from various banks on a demand basis with company-owned and customer securities pledged as collateral. The value of customer-owned securities used as collateral is not reflected in the consolidated statements of financial condition. We also have an unsecured, committed bank line available.\nOur uncommitted secured lines of credit at December 31, 2020, totaled $1.0 billion with five banks and are dependent on having appropriate collateral, as determined by the bank agreements, to secure an advance under the line. The availability of our uncommitted lines is subject to approval by the individual banks each time an advance is requested and may be denied. Our peak daily borrowing on our uncommitted secured lines was $490.0 million during the year ended December 31, 2020. There are no compensating balance requirements under these arrangements. Any borrowings on secured lines of credit are day-to-day and are generally utilized to finance certain fixed income securities. At December 31, 2020, we had no outstanding balances on our uncommitted secured lines of credit.\nFederal Home Loan advances are floating-rate advances. The weighted average interest rates during the year ended December 31, 2020, on these advances was 1.30%. The advances are secured by Stifel Bancorp's residential mortgage loan portfolio and investment portfolio. The interest rates reset on a daily basis. Stifel Bancorp has the option to prepay these advances without penalty on the interest reset date. At December 31, 2020, there were no Federal Home Loan advances.\nUnsecured borrowings - On March 5, 2019, we amended our existing Credit Agreement, which now expires in March 2024. The applicable interest rate under the revolving credit facility is calculated as a per annum rate equal to LIBOR plus 1.75%, as defined.\nWe can draw upon this line as long as certain restrictive covenants are maintained. Under our amended and restatement Credit Agreement, we are required to maintain compliance with a minimum consolidated tangible net worth covenant, as defined, and a maximum consolidated total capitalization ratio covenant, as defined. In addition, Stifel, our broker-dealer subsidiary, is required to maintain compliance with a minimum regulatory excess net capital covenant, as defined, and our bank subsidiaries are required to maintain its status as well-capitalized, as defined.\nOur revolving credit facility contains customary events of default, including, without limitation, payment defaults, breaches of representations and warranties, covenant defaults, cross-defaults to similar obligations, certain events of bankruptcy and insolvency, and judgment defaults. At December 31, 2020, we had no advances on the $200.0 million revolving credit facility and were in compliance with all covenants and currently do not expect any covenant violations due to the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic.\nStifel, our broker-dealer subsidiary, has a 364-day Credit Agreement ( Stifel Credit Facility\u201d) with a maturity date of June 2021 in which the lenders are a number of financial institutions. This committed unsecured borrowing facility provides for maximum borrowings of up to $300.0 million at variable rates of interest.\nUnder the Stifel Credit Facility, Stifel is required to maintain compliance with a minimum consolidated tangible net worth covenant, as defined, and to maintain compliance with a minimum regulatory excess net capital covenant, as defined.\nThe Stifel Credit Facility contains customary events of default, including, without limitation, payment defaults, breaches of representations and warranties, covenant defaults, cross-defaults to similar obligations, certain events of bankruptcy and insolvency, and judgment defaults. At December 31, 2020, there were no advances on the Stifel Credit Facility and we were in compliance with all covenants and currently do not expect any covenant violations due to the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic.\nFederal Home Loan Bank Advances and other secured financing - Stifel Bancorp has borrowing capacity with the Federal Home Loan Bank of $3.1 billion at December 31, 2020 and $59.5 million in federal funds agreements for the purpose of purchasing short-term funds should additional liquidity be needed. At December 31, 2020, there were no outstanding Federal Home Loan Bank advances. Stifel Bancorp is eligible to participate in the Federal Reserve's discount window program; however, Stifel Bancorp does not view borrowings from the Federal Reserve as a primary means of funding. The credit available in this program is subject to periodic review, may be terminated or reduced at the discretion of the Federal Reserve, and is secured by securities. Stifel Bancorp has borrowing capacity of $1.4 billion with the Federal Reserve's discount window at December 31, 2020. Stifel Bancorp receives overnight funds from excess cash held in Stifel brokerage accounts, which are deposited into a money market account. These balances totaled $16.0 billion at December 31, 2020. At December 31, 2020, there was $22.8 billion in client money market and FDIC-insured product balances.\nPublic Offering of Senior Notes - On July 15, 2014, we sold in a registered underwritten public offering, $300.0 million in aggregate principal amount of 4.25% senior notes due July 2024 (the 2014 Notes\u201d). Interest on the 2014 Notes is payable semi-annually in arrears. We may redeem the 2014 Notes in whole or in part, at our option, at a redemption price equal to 100% of their principal amount, plus a make-whole\u201d premium and accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the date of redemption. In July 2016, we issued an additional $200.0 million in aggregate principal amount of 4.25% senior notes due 2024. In July 2014, we received a BBB- rating on the 2014 Notes.\nOn December 1, 2015, we sold in a registered underwritten public offering, $300.0 million in aggregate principal amount of 3.50% senior notes due December 2020 (the 2015 Notes\u201d). Interest on the 2015 Notes is payable semi-annually in arrears. We may redeem the 2015 Notes in whole or in part, at our option, at a redemption price equal to 100% of their principal amount, plus a make-whole\u201d premium and accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the date of redemption. In December 2015, we received a BBB- rating on the 2015 Notes. The 2015 Notes matured in December 2020.\nOn October 4, 2017, we completed the pricing of a registered underwritten public offering of $200.0 million in aggregate principal amount of 5.20% senior notes due October 2047. Interest on the senior notes is payable quarterly in arrears in January, April, July, and October. On or after October 15, 2022, we may redeem some or all of the senior notes at any time at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the notes being redeemed plus accrued interest thereon to the redemption date. On October 27, 2017, we completed the sale of an additional $25.0 million aggregate principal amount of Notes pursuant to the over-allotment option. In October 2017, we received a BBB- rating on the notes.\nOn May 20, 2020, we sold in a registered underwritten public offering, $400.0 million in aggregate principal amount of 4.00% senior notes due May 2030. Interest on these senior notes is payable semi-annually in arrears in May and November. We may redeem the notes in whole or in part, at our option, at a redemption price equal to the greater of a) 100% of their principal amount or b) discounted present value at Treasury rate plus 50 basis points prior to February 15, 2030, and on or after February 15, 2030, at 100% of their principal amount, and accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the date of redemption. In May 2020, we received a BBB- rating on the notes.\nPublic Offering of Preferred Stock - In July 2016, the Company completed an underwritten registered public offering of $150 million perpetual 6.25% Non-Cumulative Perpetual Preferred Stock, Series A.\nIn February 2019, the Company completed an underwritten registered public offering of $150 million 6.25% Non-Cumulative Perpetual Preferred Stock, Series B ( Series B Preferred\u201d). In March 2019, we completed a public offering of an additional $10.0 million of Series B Preferred, pursuant to the over-allotment option.\nOn May 19, 2020, the Company completed an underwritten registered public offering of $225 million 6.125% Non-Cumulative Perpetual Preferred Stock, Series C ( Series C Preferred), which included the sale of $25.0 million of Series C Preferred pursuant to an over-allotment option.\nCredit Rating\nWe believe our current rating depends upon a number of factors, including industry dynamics, operating and economic environment, operating results, operating margins, earnings trends and volatility, balance sheet composition, liquidity and liquidity management, our capital structure, our overall risk management, business diversification, and our market share and competitive position in the markets in which we operate. Deteriorations in any of these factors could impact our credit rating. A reduction in our credit rating could adversely affect our liquidity and competitive position, increase our incremental borrowing costs, limit our access to the capital markets, or trigger our obligations under certain financial agreements. As such, we may not be able to successfully obtain additional outside financing to fund our operations on favorable terms, or at all.\nWe believe our existing assets, a significant portion of which are liquid in nature, together with the funds from operations, available informal short-term credit arrangements, and our ability to raise additional capital will provide sufficient resources to meet our present and anticipated financing needs.\nUse of Capital Resources\nOn December 2, 2020, our $300.0 million senior notes matured.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2020, we repurchased $58.3 million, or 1.7 million shares, at an average price of $33.35 per share.\nThe following table summarizes the activity related to our company's note receivable from January 1, 2019 to December 31, 2020 (in thousands):\n\n (1) Notes issued in conjunction with the acquisition of First Empire in 2019. \nWe have paid $179.7 million in the form of upfront notes to financial advisors for transition pay during the year ended December 31, 2020. As we continue to take advantage of the opportunities created by market displacement and as competition for skilled professionals in the industry increases, we may decide to devote more significant resources to attracting and retaining qualified personnel.\nWe utilize transition pay, principally in the form of upfront demand notes, to aid financial advisors, who have elected to join our firm, to supplement their lost compensation while transitioning their customers' accounts to the Stifel platform. The initial value of the notes is determined primarily by the financial advisors' trailing production and assets under management. These notes are generally forgiven over a five- to ten-year period based on production. The future estimated amortization expense of the upfront notes, assuming current-year production levels and static growth for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2022, 2023, 2024, 2025, and thereafter, is $123.5 million, $97.0 million, $86.3 million, $73.0 million, $54.1 million, and $163.1 million, respectively. These estimates could change if we continue to grow our business through expansion or experience increased production levels.\nWe maintain an incentive stock plan and a wealth accumulation plan that provides for the granting of stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock, performance awards, stock units, and debentures (collectively, deferred awards\u201d) to our associates. Historically, we have granted stock units to our associates as part of our retention program. A restricted stock unit or restricted stock award represents the right to receive a share of the Company's common stock at a designated time in the future without cash payment by the associate and is issued in lieu of cash incentive, principally for deferred compensation and employee retention plans. The restricted stock units or restricted stock awards generally vest over the next one to ten years after issuance and are distributed at predetermined future payable dates once vesting occurs. Restricted stock awards are restricted as to sale or disposition. These restrictions lapse over the next one to five years.\nAt December 31, 2020, the total number of restricted stock units, Performance-based Restricted Stock Units ( PRSUs\u201d), and restricted stock awards outstanding was 20.9 million, of which 17.9 million were unvested. At December 31, 2020, there was approximately $491.1 million of unrecognized compensation cost for deferred awards, which is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 2.7 years.\nThe future estimated compensation expense of the deferred awards, assuming current year forfeiture levels and static growth for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2022, 2023, 2024, 2025, and thereafter, is $142.9 million, $127.1 million, $95.6 million, $66.9 million, $28.3 million, and $30.3 million, respectively. These estimates could change if our forfeitures change from historical levels.\nNet Capital Requirements - We operate in a highly regulated environment and are subject to capital requirements, which may limit distributions to our company from our subsidiaries. Distributions from our broker-dealer subsidiaries are subject to net capital rules. These subsidiaries have historically operated in excess of minimum net capital requirements. However, if distributions were to be limited in the future due to the failure of our subsidiaries to comply with the net capital rules or a change in the net capital rules, it could have a material and adverse effect to our company by limiting our operations that require intensive use of capital, such as underwriting or trading activities, or limit our ability to implement our business and growth strategies, pay interest on and repay the principal of our debt, and/or repurchase our common stock. Our non-broker-dealer subsidiaries, Stifel Bank & Trust, Stifel Bank, Stifel Trust Company, N.A., and Stifel Trust Company Delaware, N.A., are also subject to various regulatory capital requirements administered by the federal banking agencies. Our broker-dealer subsidiaries and our bank subsidiaries have consistently operated in excess of their capital adequacy requirements. Our Canadian subsidiary, SNC, is subject to the regulatory supervision and requirements of IIROC.\nAt December 31, 2020, Stifel had net capital of $487.7 million, which was 40.0% of aggregate debit items and $463.3 million in excess of its minimum required net capital. At December 31, 2020, all of our broker-dealer subsidiaries' net capital exceeded the minimum net capital required under the SEC rule. At December 31, 2020, SNEL's capital and reserves were in excess of the financial resources requirement under the rules of the FCA. At December 31, 2020, our banking subsidiaries were considered well capitalized under the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action. At December 31, 2020, SNC's net capital and reserves were in excess of the financial resources requirement under the rules of the IIROC. See Note 18 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for details of our regulatory capital requirements.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nIn preparing our consolidated financial statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles and pursuant to the rules and regulations of the SEC, we make assumptions, judgments, and estimates that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, and expenses, and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. We base our assumptions, judgments, and estimates on historical experience and various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results could differ materially from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. On a regular basis, we evaluate our assumptions, judgments, and estimates. We also discuss our critical accounting policies and estimates with the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors.\nWe believe that the assumptions, judgments, and estimates involved in the accounting policies described below have the greatest potential impact on our consolidated financial statements. These areas are key components of our results of operations and are based on complex rules that require us to make assumptions, judgments, and estimates, so we consider these to be our critical accounting policies. Historically, our assumptions, judgments, and estimates relative to our critical accounting policies and estimates have not differed materially from actual results.\nFor a full description of these and other accounting policies, see Note 2 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nValuation of Financial Instruments\nWe measure certain financial assets and liabilities at fair value on a recurring basis, including trading securities owned, available-for-sale securities, investments, trading securities sold, but not yet purchased, and derivatives.\nTrading securities owned and pledged and trading securities sold, but not yet purchased, are carried at fair value on the consolidated statements of financial condition, with unrealized gains and losses reflected on the consolidated statements of operations.\nThe fair value of a financial instrument is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date, or an exit price. The degree of judgment used in measuring the fair value of financial instruments generally correlates to the level of pricing observability. Financial instruments with readily available active quoted prices or for which fair value can be measured from actively quoted prices in active markets generally have more pricing observability and less judgment used in measuring fair value. Conversely, financial instruments rarely traded or not quoted have less pricing observability and are measured at fair value using valuation models that require more judgment. Pricing observability is impacted by a number of factors, including the type of financial instrument, whether the financial instrument is new to the market and not yet established, the characteristics specific to the transaction, and overall market conditions generally.\nWhen available, we use observable market prices, observable market parameters, or broker or dealer quotes (bid and ask prices) to derive the fair value of financial instruments. In the case of financial instruments transacted on recognized exchanges, the observable market prices represent quotations for completed transactions from the exchange on which the financial instrument is principally traded.\nA substantial percentage of the fair value of our trading securities and other investments owned, trading securities pledged as collateral, and trading securities sold, but not yet purchased, are based on observable market prices, observable market parameters, or derived from broker or dealer prices. The availability of observable market prices and pricing parameters can vary from product to product. Where available, observable market prices and pricing or market parameters in a product may be used to derive a price without requiring significant judgment. In certain markets, observable market prices or market parameters are not available for all products, and fair value is determined using techniques appropriate for each particular product. These techniques involve some degree of judgment.\nFor investments in illiquid or privately held securities that do not have readily determinable fair values, the determination of fair value requires us to estimate the value of the securities using the best information available. Among the factors we consider in determining the fair value of investments are the cost of the investment, terms and liquidity, developments since the acquisition of the investment, the sales price of recently issued securities, the financial condition and operating results of the issuer, earnings trends and consistency of operating cash flows, the long-term business potential of the issuer, the quoted market price of securities with similar quality and yield that are publicly traded, and other factors generally pertinent to the valuation of investments. In instances where a security is subject to transfer restrictions, the value of the security is based primarily on the quoted price of a similar security without restriction but may be reduced by an amount estimated to reflect such restrictions. The fair value of these investments is subject to a high degree of volatility and may be susceptible to significant fluctuation in the near term, and the differences could be material.\nWe have categorized our financial instruments measured at fair value into a three-level classification in accordance with Topic 820, Fair Value Measurement and Disclosures.\u201d Fair value measurements of financial instruments that use quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities are generally categorized as Level 1, and fair value measurements of financial instruments that have no direct observable levels are generally categorized as Level 3. All other fair value measurements of financial instruments that do not fall within the Level 1 or Level 3 classification are considered Level 2. The lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement of a financial instrument is used to categorize the instrument and reflects the judgment of management.\nLevel 3 financial instruments have little to no pricing observability as of the report date. These financial instruments do not have active two-way markets and are measured using management's best estimate of fair value, where the inputs into the determination of fair value require significant management judgment or estimation. We have identified Level 3 financial instruments to include certain asset-backed securities, consisting of collateral loan obligation securities, that have experienced low volumes of executed transactions, certain corporate bonds and equity securities where there was less frequent or nominal market activity, investments in private equity funds, and auction rate securities for which the market has been dislocated and largely ceased to function. Our Level 3 asset-backed securities are valued using cash flow models that utilize unobservable inputs. Level 3 corporate bonds are valued using prices from comparable securities. Equity securities with unobservable inputs are valued using management's best estimate of fair value, where the inputs require significant management judgment. Auction rate securities are valued based upon our expectations of issuer redemptions and using internal models.\nContingencies\nWe are involved in various pending and potential legal proceedings related to our business, including litigation, arbitration, and regulatory proceedings. Some of these matters involve claims for substantial amounts, including claims for punitive damages. We have, after consultation with outside legal counsel and consideration of facts currently known by management, recorded estimated losses in accordance with Topic 450 ( Topic 450\u201d), Contingencies,\u201d to the extent that claims are probable of loss and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. The determination of these reserve amounts requires us to use significant judgment, and our final liabilities may ultimately be materially different. This determination is inherently subjective, as it requires estimates that are subject to potentially significant revision as more information becomes available and due to subsequent events. In making these determinations, we consider many factors, including, but not limited to, the loss and damages sought by the plaintiff or claimant, the basis and validity of the claim, the likelihood of a successful defense against the claim, and the potential for, and magnitude of, damages or settlements from such pending and potential litigation and arbitration proceedings, and fines and penalties or orders from regulatory agencies. See Item 3, Legal Proceedings,\u201d in Part I of this report for information on our legal, regulatory, and arbitration proceedings.\nAllowance for Credit Losses\nOn January 1, 2020, we adopted the new accounting standard that requires the measurement of the allowance for credit losses, which includes the allowance for loan losses and the reserve for unfunded lending commitments, to be based on management's best estimate of lifetime expected credit losses inherent in the Company's relevant financial assets.\nThe expected credit losses on our loan portfolio are referred to as the allowance for loan losses and are reported separately as a contra-asset to loans on the consolidated statement of financial condition. The expected credit losses for unfunded lending commitments, including standby letters of credit and binding unfunded loan commitments, are reported on the consolidated statement of financial condition in accounts payable and accrued expenses. The provision for loan losses related to the loan portfolio and the provision for unfunded lending commitments are reported in the consolidated statement of operations in provision for credit losses.\nFor loans, the expected credit loss is typically estimated using quantitative methods that consider a variety of factors, such as historical loss experience derived from proxy data, the current credit quality of the portfolio, as well as an economic outlook over the life of the loan. The life of the loan for closed-ended products is based on the contractual maturity of the loan adjusted for any expected prepayments. The contractual maturity includes any extension options that are at the sole discretion of the borrower. For open-ended products, the expected credit loss is determined based on the maximum repayment term associated with future draws from credit lines.\nIn our loss forecasting framework, we incorporate forward-looking information through the use of macroeconomic scenarios applied over the forecasted life of the assets. These macroeconomic scenarios include variables that have historically been key drivers of increases and decreases in credit losses. These variables include, but are not limited to, unemployment rates, real estate prices, gross domestic product levels, corporate bond spreads, and long-term interest rate forecasts. To estimate losses for contractual periods that extend beyond the forecast horizon, we revert to an average historical loss experience. As any one economic outlook is inherently uncertain, we leverage multiple scenarios. The scenarios that are chosen each quarter and the amount of weighting given to each scenario depend on a variety of factors, including recent economic events, leading economic indicators, and industry trends. The reserve for unfunded lending commitments is estimated using the same scenarios, models, and economic data as the loan portfolio.\nThe allowance for loan losses includes adjustments for qualitative reserves based on our company's assessment that may not be adequately represented in the quantitative methods or the economic assumptions described above. For example, factors that we consider include changes in lending policies and procedures, business conditions, the nature and size of the portfolio, portfolio concentrations, the volume and severity of past due loans and nonaccrual loans, the effect of external factors such as competition, and legal and regulatory requirements, among others. Further, we consider the inherent uncertainty in quantitative models that are built on historical data. As a result of the uncertainty inherent in the quantitative models, other quantitative and qualitative factors are considered in adjusting allowance amounts, including, but not limited to, the following: model imprecision, imprecision in macroeconomic scenario forecasts, or changes in the economic environment affecting specific portfolio segments that deviate from the macroeconomic forecasts. The evaluation is inherently subjective, as it requires estimates that are susceptible to significant revision as more information becomes available. Depending on changes in circumstances, future assessments of credit risk may yield materially different results from the prior estimates, which may require an increase or a decrease in the allowance for loan losses.\nThe allowance for credit losses can also be impacted by unanticipated changes in asset quality of the portfolio. In addition, while we have incorporated our estimated impact of the coronavirus ( COVID-19\u201d) pandemic on the economy into our allowance for credit losses, the ultimate impact of COVID-19 is still unknown, including how long economic activities will be impacted and what effect the unprecedented levels of government fiscal and monetary actions will have on the economy and our credit losses.\nAs described above, the process to determine the allowance for credit losses requires numerous estimates and assumptions, some of which require a high degree of judgment and are often interrelated. Changes in the estimates and assumptions can result in significant changes in the allowance for credit losses. Our process for determining the allowance for credit losses is further discussed in Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nIncome Taxes\nThe provision for income taxes and related tax reserves is based on our consideration of known liabilities and tax contingencies for multiple taxing authorities. Known liabilities are amounts that will appear on current tax returns, amounts that have been agreed to in revenue agent revisions as the result of examinations by the taxing authorities, and amounts that will follow from such examinations but affect years other than those being examined. Tax contingencies are liabilities that might arise from a successful challenge by the taxing authorities taking a contrary position or interpretation regarding the application of tax law to our tax return filings. Factors considered in estimating our liability are results of tax audits, historical experience, and consultation with tax attorneys and other experts.\nAccounting Standards Codification ( ASC\u201d) Topic 740 ( Topic 740\u201d), Income Taxes,\u201d clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an entity's financial statements and prescribed recognition threshold and measurement attributes for financial statement disclosure of tax positions taken or expected to be taken on a tax return. The impact of an uncertain income tax position on the income tax return must be recognized at the largest amount that is more likely than not to be sustained upon audit by the relevant taxing authority. An uncertain income tax position will not be recognized if it has less than a 50% likelihood of being sustained. Additionally, Topic 740 provides guidance on derecognition, classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods, disclosure, and transition.\nGoodwill and Intangible Assets\nUnder the provisions of ASC Topic 805, Business Combinations,\u201d we record all assets and liabilities acquired in purchase acquisitions, including goodwill and other intangible assets, at fair value. Determining the fair value of assets and liabilities requires certain estimates.\nGoodwill for certain acquisitions is deductible for tax purposes. The amortization of goodwill for tax purposes creates a cash tax savings due to a reduction in the current taxes payable. We have recorded cash tax savings for the year ending December 31, 2020, of $7.5 million and anticipate cumulative future cash savings of $61.0 million as of result of the tax amortization of goodwill.\nIn accordance with ASC Topic 350, Intangibles - Goodwill and Other,\u201d indefinite-life intangible assets and goodwill are not amortized. Rather, they are subject to impairment testing on an annual basis, or more often if events or circumstances indicate there may be impairment. This test involves assigning tangible assets and liabilities as well as identified intangible assets and goodwill to reporting units and comparing the fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying amount. If the fair value is less than the carrying amount, a further test is required to measure the amount of the impairment.\nWe test goodwill for impairment on an annual basis and on an interim basis when certain events or circumstances exist. We test for impairment at the reporting unit level, which is generally at the level of or one level below our company's business segments. For both the annual and interim tests, we have the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether the existence of events or circumstances leads to a determination that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. If, after assessing the totality of events or circumstances, we determine it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is greater than its carrying amount, then performing the two-step impairment test is not required. However, if we conclude otherwise, we are then required to perform the first step of the two-step impairment test. Goodwill impairment is determined by comparing the estimated fair value of a reporting unit with its respective carrying value. If the estimated fair value exceeds the carrying value, goodwill at the reporting unit level is not deemed to be impaired. If the estimated fair value is below carrying value, however, further analysis is required to determine the amount of the impairment. Additionally, if the carrying value of a reporting unit is zero or a negative value and it is determined that it is more likely than not the goodwill is impaired, further analysis is required. The estimated fair values of the reporting units are derived based on valuation techniques we believe market participants would use for each of the reporting units. Our annual goodwill impairment testing was completed as of October 1, 2020, with no impairment charges resulting from the annual impairment tests.\nThe goodwill impairment test requires us to make judgments in determining what assumptions to use in the calculation. Assumptions, judgments, and estimates about future cash flows and discount rates are complex and often subjective. They can be affected", "item_7_tables": "Table 38: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> For the Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Percentage\nChange\n</td> <td>\n</td>
