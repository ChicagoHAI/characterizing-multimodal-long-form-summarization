Specifically, on loans of $2,500 or more but less than $10,000, AB 539 caps interest rates at 36% plus the federal funds rate and requires loan terms to be at least 12 months. On loans of at least $3,000 but less than $10,000, AB 539 prohibits loan terms from exceeding 60 months and 15 days. The law became effective on January 1, 2020.\nBrazil General Data Privacy Law\nOn August 14, 2018, Brazil adopted the General Data Privacy Law (Lei Geral de Prote\u00e7\u00e3o de Dados Pessoais or LGPD\u201d). The key provisions of LGPD are quite similar to the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation in that it grants certain rights to data subjects, imposes obligations on companies with regard to the processing of data, and allows authorities to impose substantial fines on companies that violate the law. LGPD was originally anticipated to go into effect on February 15, 2020; however, several amendments to LGPD have been proposed, one of which could delay the effective date of the legislation to August 2020. Compliance with LGPD may increase the cost of conducting business in Brazil, and we could see regulatory compliance costs and enforcement activity once the law goes into effect.\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nOur financial results for the year ended December 31, 2019 ( 2019\u201d) are summarized below.\nTable 110: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> Revenue increased $202.2 million, or 20.8%, to $1,174.8 million in 2019 compared to $972.6 million in the year ended December 31, 2018 ( 2018\u201d).\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 111: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> Gross Profit increased $102.7 million, or 21.9%, to $571.9 million in 2019 compared to $469.2 million in 2018.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 112: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> Income from Operations increased $72.7 million, or 41.4%, to $248.2 million in 2019, compared to $175.5 million in 2018.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 113: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> Net Income was $36.6 million in 2019, compared to $70.1 million in 2018.

non-GAAP financial information. We believe that presentation of non-GAAP financial information is meaningful and useful in understanding the activities and business metrics of our operations. We believe that these non-GAAP financial measures reflect an additional way of viewing aspects of our business that, when viewed with our GAAP results, provide a more complete understanding of factors and trends affecting our business.\nWe provide non-GAAP financial information for informational purposes and to enhance understanding of our GAAP consolidated financial statements. Readers should consider the information in addition to, but not instead of or superior to, our consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP. This non-GAAP financial information may be determined or calculated differently by other companies, limiting the usefulness of those measures for comparative purposes.\nAdjusted Earnings Measures\nIn addition to reporting financial results in accordance with GAAP, we have provided adjusted earnings and adjusted earnings per share, or, collectively, the Adjusted Earnings Measures, which are non-GAAP measures. We believe that the presentation of these measures provides investors with greater transparency and facilitates comparison of operating results across a broad spectrum of companies with varying capital structures, compensation strategies, derivative instruments and amortization methods, which provides a more complete understanding of our financial performance, competitive position and prospects for the future. We also believe that investors regularly rely on non-GAAP financial measures, such as the Adjusted Earnings Measures, to assess operating performance and that such measures may highlight trends in our business that may not otherwise be apparent when relying on financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. In addition, we believe that the adjustments shown below are useful to investors in order to allow them to compare our financial results during the periods shown without the effect of each of these income or expense items.\nThe following table provides reconciliations between net income and diluted earnings per share calculated in accordance with GAAP to the Adjusted Earnings Measures, which are shown net of tax (in thousands, except per share data):\nTable 115: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td>

Adjusted EBITDA is also useful to investors to help assess our estimated enterprise value.

Outside of the United States, we currently operate in Brazil. During 2019, 2018 and 2017, 1.8%, 2.7% and 2.7% of our revenue, respectively, originated in currencies other than the U.S. Dollar, principally the Brazilian Real. As a result, changes in our reported revenue and profits include the impacts of changes in foreign currency exchange rates. We provide constant currency assessments in the following discussion and analysis to isolate the impact of the fluctuation in foreign exchange rates and utilize constant currency results in our analysis of performance. Our constant currency assessment assumes foreign exchange rates in the current fiscal periods remained the same as in the prior fiscal year periods. All conversion rates below are based on the U.S. Dollar equivalent to the applicable foreign currency:\nTable 121: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> % Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Brazilian Real\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 0.2548\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 0.2753\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (7.5\n</td> <td> )%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> % Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Brazilian Real\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 0.2753\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 0.3134\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (12.2\n</td> <td> )%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe believe that our non-GAAP constant currency assessments are a useful measure, indicating the actual growth and profitability of our operations.\nCombined Loans and Finance Receivables\nCombined loans and finance receivables is a non-GAAP measure that includes both loans and RPAs we own and loans we guarantee, which are either GAAP items or disclosures required by GAAP. We believe this non-GAAP measure provides investors with important information needed to evaluate the magnitude of potential receivable losses and the opportunity for revenue performance of the loans and finance receivables portfolio on an aggregate basis. We also believe that the comparison of the aggregate amounts from period to period is more meaningful than comparing only the amounts reflected on our consolidated balance sheets since both revenue and cost of revenue are impacted by the aggregate amount of receivables we own and those we guarantee as reflected in our consolidated financial statements.\nYEAR ENDED 2019 COMPARED TO YEAR ENDED 2018\nRevenue and Gross Profit\nRevenue increased $202.2 million, or 20.8%, to $1,174.8 million for 2019 as compared to $972.6 million for 2018. On a constant currency basis, revenue increased by $204.0 million, or 21.0%, for 2019 compared to 2018. The change in revenue was driven primarily by a 47.4% increase in line of credit accounts revenue and an 11.9% increase in installment loan and RPA revenue, partially offset by a 19.2% decline in short-term loan revenue.\nOur gross profit increased by $102.7 million or 21.9% to $571.9 million for 2019 from $469.2 million for 2018. On a constant currency basis, gross profit increased by $103.6 million for 2019 compared to 2018. Our gross profit as a percentage of revenue ( gross profit margin\u201d) increased slightly to 48.7% in 2019 from 48.2% in 2018.\nThe following table sets forth the components of revenue and gross

million, or 36.2%, to $1,062.7 million as of December 31, 2019 from $780.1 million as of December 31, 2018, and the combined portfolio balance of loans and finance receivables, net of allowance and liability for estimated losses, increased $281.0 million, or 34.8%, to $1,088.7 million as of December 31, 2019 from $807.7 million as of December 31, 2018, due primarily to increased demand for our near-prime installment product and our line of credit products. The outstanding loan balance for our near-prime product increased 29.7% as of December 31, 2019 compared to December 31, 2018, resulting in a near-prime portfolio balance that comprises approximately 48.1% of our total loan and finance receivables portfolio balance while short-term loans comprise approximately 3.5%. We expect this trend to continue as we expand our near-prime installment product offering in 2020. We expect the loan balances for our near-prime installment loan product will continue to comprise a larger percentage of the total loan and finance receivable\nportfolio, due to consumer demand for the product and its longer loan term. See -Non-GAAP Financial Measures-Combined Loans and Finance Receivables\u201d above for additional information related to combined loans and finance receivables.\nThe combined loan and finance receivable balance includes $1,239.6 million and $924.3 million as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively, of our Company-owned receivables balances before the allowance for losses of $176.9 million and $144.2 million provided in the consolidated financial statements for December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. The combined loan and finance receivable balance also includes $27.6 million and $29.7 million as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively, of loan and finance receivable balances that are guaranteed by us, which are not included in our consolidated balance sheets, with the exception of the liability for estimated losses of $1.5 million and $2.2 million, which is included in Accounts payable and accrued expenses\u201d as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively.\nThe following table summarizes loan and finance receivable balances outstanding as of December 31, 2019 and 2018 (dollars in thousands):\nTable 123: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> As of December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Guaranteed\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Guaranteed\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Company\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> by the\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Company\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> by the\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Owned(a)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Company(a)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Combined(b)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Owned(a)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Company(a)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Combined(b)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Ending loans and finance receivables:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Short-term loans\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 29,764\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 14,857\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 44,621\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 37,768\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 25,388\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 63,156\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Line of credit accounts\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 392,837\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 392,837\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 227,563\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 227,563\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Installment loans and RPAs\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 816,988\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 12,703\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 829,691\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 658,995\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 4,316\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 663,311\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total ending loans and finance receivables, gross\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,239,589\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 27,560\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,267,149\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 924,326\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 29,704\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 954,030\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Less: Allowance and liabilities for losses(a)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (176,939\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (1,511\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (178,450\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (144,214\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (2,166\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (146,380\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total ending loans and finance receivables, net\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,062,650\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 26,049\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,088,699\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 780,112\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 27,538\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 807,650\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Allowance and liability for losses as a % of loans and finance receivables, gross\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 14.3\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 5.5\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 14.1\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 15.6\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 7.3\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 15.3\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 124: <table> <tr> <td> (a)\n</td> <td> GAAP measure.

Additionally, the mix of lower dollar short-term loans continued to decrease, resulting in a greater mix of line of credit accounts with higher average amounts outstanding per loan relative to short-term loans, as of December 31, 2019 compared to prior year.\nAverage Loan Origination\nThe average loan origination amount is calculated as the total amount of combined loans originated, renewed and purchased for the period divided by the total number of combined loans originated, renewed and purchased for the period.

New customers require a greater reserve as these loans default at a higher rate than returning customers with a successful history of loan performance.\nThe cost of revenue in 2019 was $602.9 million, which was composed of $603.6 million related to our Company-owned loans and finance receivables partially offset by a $0.7 million decrease in the liability for estimated losses related to loans we guaranteed through the CSO programs. The cost of revenue in 2018 was $503.4 million, which was composed of $503.5 million related to our Company-owned loans and finance receivables partially offset by a $0.1 million decrease in the liability for estimated losses related to loans we guaranteed through the CSO programs. Total charge-offs, net of recoveries, were $570.7 million and $466.4 million in 2019 and 2018, respectively.\nThe following tables show loan and finance receivable balances and fees receivable and the relationship of the allowance and liability for losses to the combined balances of loans and finance receivables for each of the last eight quarters (dollars in thousands):\nTable 135: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> First\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Second\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Third\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Fourth\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Quarter\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Quarter\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Quarter\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Quarter\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Loans and finance receivables:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Gross -

For our products, we evaluate loans and finance receivables losses as a percentage of the average loan and finance receivable balance outstanding or the average combined loan and finance receivable balance outstanding, whichever is applicable, for each portfolio.\nShort-term Loans\nDemand for our short-term loan product has historically been highest in the third and fourth quarters of each year, and lowest in the first quarter of each year, corresponding to our customers' receipt of income tax refunds. The combined short-term loan balance has decreased year-over-year due in part to the shift of customers to line of credit accounts. This resulted in fewer loans written to new customers and a lower allowance and liability for losses as a percentage of combined loan balance.\nOur gross profit margin for short-term loans is typically highest in the first quarter of each year, corresponding to the seasonal decline in consumer loan balances outstanding. The cost of revenue as a percentage of the average combined loan balance for short-term loans outstanding is typically lower in the first quarter and generally peaks in the second half of the year with higher loan demand.\nThe following table includes information related only to short-term loans and shows our loss experience trends for short-term loans for each of the last eight quarters

seasonal trend to short-term loan loss rates as the ratio is typically lower in the first quarter and increases throughout the remainder of the year, peaking in the second half of the year with higher loan demand.\nThe gross profit margin is generally lower for line of credit accounts during periods of growth because the highest levels of default are exhibited in the early stages of the account, while the revenue is recognized over the term of the account. During 2019, we generally experienced lower gross profit margin and higher cost of revenue as a percentage of the average combined loan balance for line of credit accounts outstanding than we experienced in the prior year quarters as a result of the strong growth in the line of credit account portfolios.\nThe following table includes information related only to line of credit accounts and

</tr>\n</table>\nInstallment Loans and RPAs\nFor installment loans and RPAs, the cost of revenue as a percentage of average loan and finance receivable balance is typically more consistent throughout the year as compared to short-term loans and line of credit accounts. Due to the scheduled regular payments that are inherent with installment loans and RPAs, we do not experience the higher level of repayments in the first quarter for these receivables as we experience with short-term loans and, to a lesser extent, line of credit accounts.\nSimilar to line of credit accounts, the gross profit margin is generally lower for the installment loan and RPA products during periods of growth, primarily because the highest levels of default are exhibited in the early stages of the loan or RPA, while revenue is recognized over the term of the loan or estimated delivery term. In addition, installment loans and RPAs typically have higher average amounts per receivable. Another factor contributing to the lower gross profit margin is that the yield for installment loans and RPAs is\ntypically lower than the yield for the other products we offer. As a result, particularly in periods of higher growth for the installment loan and RPA portfolios, which has been the case in recent years, the gross profit margin is typically lower for this product than for other products, particularly our short-term loan products. Our installment loan and RPA portfolio balance outstanding at December 31, 2019 increased $166.4 million, or 25.1%, compared to December 31, 2018. During 2019, we generally experienced higher gross profit margin than we experienced in the prior year quarters as a result of better credit performance in the installment and RPA portfolios.\nThe following table includes information related only to our installment loans and RPAs and shows our loss experience trends for installment loans for each of the last eight quarters (dollars in

expenses increased $30.0 million, or 10.2%, to $323.7 million in 2019, compared to $293.7 million in 2018. On a constant currency basis, total expenses increased $30.8 million, or 10.5%, to $30.8 million for 2019 compared to 2018.\nMarketing expense increased $19.1 million, or 20.0%, to $115.1 million in 2019 compared to $96.0 million in 2018, primarily due to higher direct mail, television advertising and digital marketing costs.\nOperations and technology expense increased to $84.3 million in 2019 from $78.4 million in 2018, due primarily to higher underwriting costs primarily related to growth in loan originations and higher selling expense.\nGeneral and administrative expense increased $4.1 million, or 3.9%, to $109.2 million in 2019 compared to $105.1 million in 2018, due primarily to higher corporate services personnel costs, driven primarily by an increase in headcount.\nDepreciation and amortization expense increased to $15.1 million in 2019 compared to $14.2 million in 2018 primarily related to increased amortization on higher capitalized software development costs.\nInterest Expense, Net\nInterest expense, net decreased $3.7 million, or 4.7%, to $75.6 million in 2019 compared to $79.3 million in 2018. The decrease was due to a decrease in the weighted average interest rate on our outstanding debt to 8.61% in 2019 from 9.78% in 2018, partially offset by an increase in the average amount of debt outstanding of $76.4 million to $887.1 million during 2019 from $810.7 million during 2018.The increase in average debt outstanding was due primarily to additional principal amounts outstanding under our securitization facilities and a higher balance of senior note debt resulting from the issuance of $375.0 million in senior notes in September 2018, partially offset by the early pay down of our 9.75% senior notes due 2021. See -Liquidity and Capital Resources-Consumer Loan Securitizations\u201d below for further information.\nProvision for Income Taxes\nThe effective tax rate of 24.7% in 2019 was higher than the effective tax rate of 7.7% in 2018 due primarily to the acceleration of tax deductions in 2018 for prior year loan and fixed asset related deferred tax items, coupled with the overall decrease in the federal tax rate from 35% to 21% resulting from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act which was enacted into law on December 22, 2017.\nThe balance of unrecognized tax benefits recorded in our Consolidated Balance Sheet as of December 31, 2019 was $53.6 million, of which $13.9 million, if recognized, would favorably affect the effective tax rate in the period of recognition. We believe it is reasonably possible that, within the next twelve months, unrecognized domestic tax benefits will change by a significant amount. The principal uncertainties are related to the timing of recognition of income and losses related to our loan and finance receivable portfolio. We are currently under a Joint Committee on Taxation review of certain tax returns that were filed during 2018 in conjunction with the refunds claimed on those returns. Depending upon the outcome of the review and any related agreements or settlements with the relevant taxing authorities, the amount of the uncertainty, including amounts that would be recognized as a component of the effective tax rate, could change significantly. While the total amount of uncertainty to be resolved is not clear, it is reasonably possible that the uncertainties pertaining to this matter will be resolved in the next twelve months.\nYEAR ENDED 2018 COMPARED TO YEAR ENDED 2017\nRevenue and Gross Profit\nRevenue increased $243.7 million, or 33.4%, to $972.6 million for 2018 as compared to $728.9 million for 2017. On a constant currency basis, revenue increased by $247.5 million, or 34.0%, for 2018 compared to 2017. The change in revenue was driven by an increase in revenue of $237.0 million from our domestic operations, primarily resulting from a 38.4% increase in domestic line of credit accounts revenue in 2018 and a 38.2% increase in domestic installment loan and RPA revenue compared to 2017 driven by growth in these products. Additionally, revenue from international operations increased $6.7 million (or an increase of $10.6 million on a constant currency basis), due to a 30.3% increase in international installment loan revenue in 2018 compared to 2017.\nOur gross profit increased by $93.8 million or 25.0% to $469.2 million for 2018 from $375.4 million for 2017. On a constant currency basis, gross profit increased by $95.1 million for 2018 compared to 2017. Our gross profit margin decreased to 48.2% in 2018 from 51.5% in 2017. The decrease in gross profit margin was primarily driven by the strong new customer growth of our installment portfolio resulting in a higher mix of new customers overall, which require higher loss provisions as new customers default at a higher rate than returning customers with a successful history of loan performance. Growth in our near-prime installment portfolio also contributed to the lower gross profit margin, as these products typically have a lower margin than our short-term products.\nThe following table

primarily to increased demand for our near-prime installment product. The outstanding loan balance for our near-prime product increased 26.7% as of December 31, 2018 compared to December 31, 2017, resulting in a near-prime portfolio balance that comprises approximately 49% of our total loan and finance receivables portfolio balance while short-term loans comprise approximately 7%. See -Non-GAAP Financial Measures-Combined Loans and Finance Receivables\u201d above for additional information related to combined loans and finance receivables.\nThe combined loan and finance receivable balance includes $924.3 million and $733.2 million as of December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively, of our Company-owned receivables balances before the allowance for losses of $144.2 million and $107.8 million provided in the consolidated financial statements for December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively.

New customers require a greater reserve as these loans default at a higher rate than returning customers with a successful history of loan performance.\nThe cost of revenue in 2018 was $503.4 million, which was composed of $503.5 million related to our Company-owned loans and finance receivables partially offset by a $0.1 million decrease in the liability for estimated losses related to loans we guaranteed through the CSO programs. The cost of revenue in 2017 was $353.5 million, which was composed of $353.2 million related to our Company-owned loans and finance receivables, and a $0.3 million increase in the liability for estimated losses related to loans we guaranteed through the CSO programs.

For our products, we evaluate loans and finance receivables losses as a percentage of the average loan and finance receivable balance outstanding or the average combined loan and finance receivable balance outstanding, whichever is applicable, for each portfolio.\nShort-term Loans\nThe allowance and liability for losses as a percentage of combined loan balance in 2018 was fairly consistent with 2017.\nOur gross profit margin for short-term loans is typically highest in the first quarter of each year, corresponding to the seasonal decline in consumer loan balances outstanding. The cost of revenue as a percentage of the average combined loan balance for short-term loans outstanding is typically lower in the first quarter and generally peaks in the second half of the year

short-term loan loss rates as the ratio is typically lower in the first quarter and increases throughout the remainder of the year, peaking in the second half of the year with higher loan demand. The gross profit margin is generally lower for line of credit accounts during periods of growth because the highest levels of default are exhibited in the early stages of the account, while the revenue is recognized over the term of the account.\nDuring 2018, we experienced lower gross profit margin and higher cost of revenue as a percentage of the average combined loan balance for line of credit accounts outstanding than we experienced in the prior year quarters as a result of the strong growth in the line of credit account portfolios.\nThe following table includes information related

</tr>\n</table>\nInstallment Loans and RPAs\nFor installment loans and RPAs, the cost of revenue as a percentage of average loan and finance receivable balance is typically more consistent throughout the year as compared to short-term loans and line of credit accounts. Due to the scheduled regular payments that are inherent with installment loans and RPAs, we do not experience the higher level of repayments in the first quarter for these receivables as we experience with short-term loans and, to a lesser extent, line of credit accounts.\nSimilar to line of credit accounts, the gross profit margin is generally lower for the installment loan and RPA products than for other products, primarily because the highest levels of default are exhibited in the early stages of the loan or RPA, while revenue is recognized over the term of the loan or estimated delivery term. In addition, installment loans and RPAs typically have higher average amounts per receivable. Another factor contributing to the lower gross profit margin is that the yield for installment loans and RPAs is typically lower than the yield for our other products, particularly short-term products. During 2018, we generally experienced lower gross profit margin than we experienced in the prior year quarters as a result of the continued growth in our near-prime installment and RPA portfolios.\nThe following table includes information related only to our installment loans and RPAs and shows our loss experience trends for installment loans for each of the last eight quarters

expenses increased $34.5 million, or 13.3%, to $293.7 million in 2018, compared to $259.2 million in 2017. On a constant currency basis, total expenses increased $36.3 million, or 14.0%, to $295.5 million for 2018 compared to 2017.\nMarketing expense increased $19.4 million, or 25.3%, to $96.0 million in 2018 compared to $76.6 million in 2017, primarily due to higher direct mail, television advertising, lead purchase and digital marketing costs.\nOperations and technology expense increased to $78.4 million in 2018 from $69.6 million in 2017, due primarily to higher contact center headcount to support our growth and higher underwriting costs primarily related to growth in loan originations.\nGeneral and administrative expense increased $5.4 million, or 5.4%, to $105.1 million in 2018 compared to $99.7 million in 2017, due primarily to higher incentive expenses resulting from our strong financial performance.\nDepreciation and amortization expense increased to $14.2 million in 2018 compared to $13.3 million in 2017 primarily related to software development projects and amortization thereof.\nInterest Expense, Net\nInterest expense, net increased $5.3 million, or 7.2%, to $79.3 million in 2018 compared to $74.0 million in 2017. The increase was due to an increase in the average amount of debt outstanding of $116.2 million to $810.7 million during 2018 from $694.5 million during 2017, partially offset by a decrease in the weighted average interest rate on our outstanding debt to 9.78% in 2018 from 10.63% in 2017.The increase in average debt outstanding was due primarily to additional principal amounts outstanding under our securitization facilities and the issuance of $375.0 million in senior notes in September 2018, partially offset by the early paydown of our 9.75% senior notes due 2021. See -Liquidity and Capital Resources-Consumer Loan Securitizations\u201d below for further information.\nProvision for Income Taxes\nThe effective tax rate of 7.7% in 2018 was lower than the effective tax rate of 10.5% in 2017 due primarily to the estimated tax effects of optimizing the timing of certain income tax deductions in 2018 for prior year loan and fixed asset related deferred tax items, coupled with the overall decrease in the federal tax rate from 35% to 21% resulting from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, which was enacted into law on December 22, 2017.\nLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\nCapital Funding Strategy\nHistorically, we have generated significant cash flow through normal operating activities for funding both long-term and short-term needs. Our near-term liquidity is managed to ensure that adequate resources are available to fund our seasonal working capital growth, which is driven by demand for our loan and financing products, and to meet the continued growth in the demand for our near-prime installment products. On May 30, 2014, we issued and sold $500.0 million in aggregate principal amount of 9.75% senior notes due 2021 (the 2021 Senior Notes\u201d). On September 1, 2017, we issued and sold $250.0 million in aggregate principal amount of 8.50% Senior Notes due 2024 (the 2024 Senior Notes\u201d) and used the net proceeds, in part, to retire $155.0 million in 2021 Senior Notes. On January 21, 2018, we redeemed an additional $50.0 million in principal amount of the outstanding 2021 Senior Notes. On September 19, 2018, we issued and sold $375.0 million in aggregate principal amount of 8.50% Senior Notes due 2025 (the 2025 Senior Notes\u201d) and used the net proceeds, in part, to retire the remaining $295.0 million in principal amount of the outstanding 2021 Senior Notes.\nOn June 30, 2017, we entered into a secured revolving credit agreement (as amended, the Credit Agreement\u201d) which replaced our previous credit agreement that was terminated on June 30, 2017. On April 13, 2018, October 5, 2018 and July 1, 2019, we and certain of our operating subsidiaries entered into amendments to our Credit Agreement, as further described below. As of February 24, 2020, our available borrowings under the Credit Agreement were $28.8 million. Since 2016, we have entered into several consumer loan securitization facilities and offered asset-backed notes to fund our growth, primarily in our near-prime consumer installment loan business, as further described below under Consumer Loan Securitization.\u201d As of February 24, 2019, the outstanding balance under our securitization facilities was $289.2 million. We expect that our operating needs, including satisfying our obligations under our debt agreements and funding our working capital growth, will be satisfied by a combination of cash flows from operations, borrowings under the Credit Agreement, or any refinancing, replacement thereof or increase in borrowings thereunder, and securitization or sale of loans and finance receivables under our consumer loan securitization facilities.\nAs of December 31, 2019, we were in compliance with all financial ratios, covenants and other requirements set forth in our debt agreements. Unexpected changes in our financial condition or other unforeseen factors may result in our inability to obtain third-party financing or could increase our borrowing costs in the future. To the extent we experience short-term or long-term funding disruptions, we have the ability to adjust our volume of lending and financing to consumers and small businesses that would reduce cash outflow requirements while increasing cash inflows through repayments. Additional alternatives may include the securitization or sale of assets, increased borrowings under the Credit Agreement, or any refinancing or replacement thereof, and reductions in capital spending which could be expected to generate additional liquidity.\n8.50% Senior Unsecured Notes Due 2025\nOn September 19, 2018, we issued and sold the 2025 Senior Notes. The 2025 Senior Notes were sold to qualified institutional buyers in accordance with Rule 144A under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the Securities Act\u201d) and outside the United States pursuant to Regulation S under the Securities Act. The 2025 Senior Notes bear interest at a rate of 8.50% annually on the principal amount payable semi-annually in arrears on March 15 and September 15 of each year, beginning on March 15, 2019.

The 2019-1 Lender is an affiliate of Park Cities Asset Management, LLC.

We are unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate of the period of cash settlement with the respective taxing authority.\nOFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS\nIn certain markets, we arrange for consumers to obtain consumer loan products from independent third-party lenders through our CSO programs. For consumer loan products originated by third-party lenders under the CSO programs, each lender is responsible for providing the criteria by which the customer's application is underwritten and, if approved, determining the amount of the consumer loan. We are responsible for assessing whether or not we will guarantee such loan. When a customer executes an agreement with us under our CSO programs, we agree, for a fee payable to us by the customer, to provide certain services to the customer, one of which is to guarantee the customer's obligation to repay the loan received by the customer from the third-party lender if the customer fails to do so. The guarantee represents an obligation to purchase specific loans if they go into default, which generally occurs after one payment is missed. As of December 31, 2019 and 2018, the outstanding amount of active consumer loans originated by third-party lenders under the CSO programs was $27.6 million and $29.7 million, respectively, which were guaranteed by us.\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES\nAllowance and Liability for Estimated Losses on Loans and Finance Receivables\nWe monitor the performance of our loan and finance receivable portfolios and maintain either an allowance or liability for estimated losses on loans and finance receivables (including revenue, fees and/or interest) at a level estimated to be adequate to absorb losses inherent in the portfolio. The allowance for losses on our Company-owned loans and finance receivables reduces the outstanding loans and finance receivables balance in the consolidated balance sheets. The liability for estimated losses related to loans guaranteed under the CSO programs is initially recorded at fair value and is included in Accounts payable and accrued expenses\u201d in the consolidated balance sheets.\nIn determining the allowance or liability for estimated losses on loans and finance receivables, we apply a documented systematic methodology. In calculating the allowance or liability for receivable losses, outstanding loans and finance receivables are divided into discrete groups of short-term loans, line of credit accounts, installment loans and RPAs and are analyzed as current or delinquent. Increases in either the allowance or the liability, net of charge-offs and recoveries, are recorded as a Cost of revenue\u201d in the consolidated statements of income.\nThe allowance or liability for short-term loans classified as current is based on historical loss rates adjusted for recent default trends for current loans. For delinquent short-term loans, the allowance or liability is based on a six-month rolling average of loss rates by stage of collection. For line of credit account, installment loan and RPA portfolios, we generally use either a migration analysis or roll-rate based methodology to estimate losses inherent in the portfolio. The allowance or liability calculation under the migration analysis and roll-rate methodology is based on historical charge-off experience and the loss emergence period, which represents the average amount of time between the first occurrence of a loss event and the charge-off of a loan or RPA. The factors we consider to assess the adequacy of the allowance or liability include past due performance, historical behavior of monthly vintages, underwriting changes and recent trends in delinquency in the migration analysis. The roll-rate methodology is based on delinquency status, payment history and recency factors to estimate future charge-offs.\nWe fully reserve for loans and finance receivables once the receivable or a portion of the receivable has been classified as delinquent for 60 consecutive days and generally charge-off loans and finance receivables between 60 to 65 days delinquent. If a loan or finance receivable is deemed uncollectible before it is fully reserved, it is charged off at that point. Loans and finance receivables classified as delinquent generally have an age of one to 64 days from the date any portion of the receivable became delinquent, as defined above. Recoveries on loans and finance receivables previously charged to the allowance are credited to the allowance generally when collected.\nGoodwill\nGoodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired in each business combination. In accordance with Accounting Standards Codification ( ASC\u201d) 350, Goodwill, we test goodwill for potential impairment annually as of June 30 and between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value below its carrying amount.\nWe first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is necessary to perform the two-step quantitative goodwill impairment test. In assessing the qualitative factors, we consider relevant events and circumstances including but not limited to macroeconomic conditions, industry and market environment, our overall financial performance, cash flow from operating activities, market capitalization and stock price. If we determine that the two-step quantitative impairment test is required, we use the income approach to complete our annual goodwill assessment. The income approach uses future cash flows and estimated terminal values that are discounted using a market participant perspective to determine the fair value, which is then compared to the carrying value to determine if there is impairment. The income approach includes assumptions about revenue growth rates, operating margins and terminal growth rates discounted by an estimated weighted-average cost of capital derived from other publicly-traded companies that are similar from an operational and economic standpoint. We completed our annual assessment of goodwill as of June 30, 2019 based on qualitative factors and determined that the fair value of our goodwill exceeded carrying value, and, as a result, no impairment existed at that date. A 10% decrease in the estimated fair value for the June 2019 assessment would not have resulted in a goodwill impairment.\nIncome Taxes\nWe account for income taxes under ASC 740, Income Taxes. As part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements, we are required to estimate income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate. This process involves estimating the actual current tax expense together with assessing temporary differences in recognition of income for tax and accounting purposes. These differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities and are included within the consolidated balance sheets. We must then assess the likelihood that the deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and, to the extent we believe that recovery is not\nlikely, we must establish a valuation allowance. An expense or benefit is included within the tax provision in the consolidated statement of income for any increase or decrease in the valuation allowance for a given period.\nWe report our loans and finance receivables in the Company's tax returns at fair market value, which differs from how we report them in the consolidated financial statements. Changes in the fair market value of our loans and finance receivables as determined for tax purposes may have a significant impact on the timing and amount of how income taxes are recognized in the consolidated financial statements. The estimates of fair market value are dependent on multiple assumptions, including expected credit losses and discount rates.\nWe perform an evaluation of the recoverability of our deferred tax assets on a quarterly basis. We establish a valuation allowance if it is more-likely-than-not (greater than 50 percent) that all or some portion of the deferred tax asset will not be realized. We analyze several factors, including the nature and frequency of operating losses, our carryforward period for any losses, the reversal of future taxable temporary differences, the expected occurrence of future income or loss and the feasibility of available tax planning strategies to protect against the loss of deferred tax assets.\nWe account for uncertainty in income taxes in accordance with ASC 740, which requires that a more-likely-than-not threshold be met before the benefit of a tax position may be recognized in the consolidated financial statements and prescribes how such benefit should be measured. We must evaluate tax positions taken on our tax returns for all periods that are open to examination by taxing authorities and make a judgment as to whether and to what extent such positions are more likely than not to be sustained based on merit. We record interest and penalties related to tax matters as income tax expense in the consolidated statement of income.\nOur judgment is required in determining the provision for income taxes, the deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance recorded against deferred tax assets. Our judgment is also required in evaluating whether tax benefits meet the more-likely-than-not threshold for recognition under ASC 740.\nRECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS\nRefer to Note 1 in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d in this report for a discussion of recently issued accounting pronouncements.\nTable 196: <table> <tr> <td>", "item_7_truncated": "ITEM 7.\n</td> <td> MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nRECENT REGULATORY DEVELOPMENTS\nCalifornia AB 539\nOn October 10, 2019, the Governor of California signed into law Assembly Bill 539 ( AB 539\u201d), which amends several aspects of the California Finance Lenders Law. Specifically, on loans of $2,500 or more but less than $10,000, AB 539 caps interest rates at 36% plus the federal funds rate and requires loan terms to be at least 12 months. On loans of at least $3,000 but less than $10,000, AB 539 prohibits loan terms from exceeding 60 months and 15 days. The law became effective on January 1, 2020.\nBrazil General Data Privacy Law\nOn August 14, 2018, Brazil adopted the General Data Privacy Law (Lei Geral de Prote\u00e7\u00e3o de Dados Pessoais or LGPD\u201d). The key provisions of LGPD are quite similar to the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation in that it grants certain rights to data subjects, imposes obligations on companies with regard to the processing of data, and allows authorities to impose substantial fines on companies that violate the law. LGPD was originally anticipated to go into effect on February 15, 2020; however, several amendments to LGPD have been proposed, one of which could delay the effective date of the legislation to August 2020. Compliance with LGPD may increase the cost of conducting business in Brazil, and we could see regulatory compliance costs and enforcement activity once the law goes into effect.\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nOur financial results for the year ended December 31, 2019 ( 2019\u201d) are summarized below.\n \u2022 Revenue increased $202.2 million, or 20.8%, to $1,174.8 million in 2019 compared to $972.6 million in the year ended December 31, 2018 ( 2018\u201d). \n \u2022 Gross Profit increased $102.7 million, or 21.9%, to $571.9 million in 2019 compared to $469.2 million in 2018. \n \u2022 Income from Operations increased $72.7 million, or 41.4%, to $248.2 million in 2019, compared to $175.5 million in 2018. \n \u2022 Net Income was $36.6 million in 2019, compared to $70.1 million in 2018.

We believe that presentation of non-GAAP financial information is meaningful and useful in understanding the activities and business metrics of our operations. We believe that these non-GAAP financial measures reflect an additional way of viewing aspects of our business that, when viewed with our GAAP results, provide a more complete understanding of factors and trends affecting our business.\nWe provide non-GAAP financial information for informational purposes and to enhance understanding of our GAAP consolidated financial statements. Readers should consider the information in addition to, but not instead of or superior to, our consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP. This non-GAAP financial information may be determined or calculated differently by other companies, limiting the usefulness of those measures for comparative purposes.\nAdjusted Earnings Measures\nIn addition to reporting financial results in accordance with GAAP, we have provided adjusted earnings and adjusted earnings per share, or, collectively, the Adjusted Earnings Measures, which are non-GAAP measures. We believe that the presentation of these measures provides investors with greater transparency and facilitates comparison of operating results across a broad spectrum of companies with varying capital structures, compensation strategies, derivative instruments and amortization methods, which provides a more complete understanding of our financial performance, competitive position and prospects for the future. We also believe that investors regularly rely on non-GAAP financial measures, such as the Adjusted Earnings Measures, to assess operating performance and that such measures may highlight trends in our business that may not otherwise be apparent when relying on financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. In addition, we believe that the adjustments shown below are useful to investors in order to allow them to compare our financial results during the periods shown without the effect of each of these income or expense items.\nThe following table provides reconciliations between net income and diluted earnings per share calculated in accordance with GAAP to the Adjusted Earnings Measures, which are

For the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, we recorded $2.3 million. ($1.8 million net of tax), $25.0 million ($19.6 million net of tax) and $22.9 million ($17.7 million net of tax) losses on early extinguishment of debt, respectively, related to the redemption of $44.1 million of securitization notes in 2019, the repurchase of $345 million of principal amount of senior notes in 2018 and the repurchase of $155.0 million principal amount of senior notes and the redemption of $160.9 million of securitization notes in 2017. \n (b) For the year ended December 31, 2017 we recorded a $2.4 million ($1.8 million net of tax) fair value adjustment to contingent consideration, respectively, related to a prior year acquisition. \n (c) For the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, we recorded income tax benefits of $11.2 million and $7.5 million, respectively, from the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. \n (d) For the year ended December 31, 2018, we consented to the issuance of a Consent Order by the CFPB, pursuant to which it agreed, without admitting or denying any of the facts or conclusions made by the CFPB from its 2014 review of us, to pay a civil money penalty of $3.2 million, which is nondeductible for tax purposes. \nAdjusted EBITDA\nThe table below shows Adjusted EBITDA, which is a non-GAAP measure that we define as earnings excluding depreciation, amortization, interest, foreign currency transaction gains or losses, taxes and stock-based compensation expense. We believe Adjusted EBITDA is used by investors to analyze operating performance and evaluate our ability to incur and service debt and our capacity for making capital expenditures. Adjusted EBITDA is also useful to investors to help assess our estimated enterprise value. In addition, we believe that the adjustments for loss on early extinguishment of debt, acquisition-related costs and the regulatory settlement shown below are useful to investors in order to allow them to compare our financial results during the periods shown without the effect of the income or expense items. The computation of Adjusted EBITDA as presented below may differ from the computation of similarly-titled measures provided by other companies (dollars in thousands):\nTable 120: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net income from continuing operations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 128,016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 63,572\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 17,614\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Depreciation and amortization expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 15,055\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 14,200\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 13,282\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Interest expense, net\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 75,604\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 79,364\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 74,005\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Foreign currency transaction loss (gain), net\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,318\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (381\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Provision for income taxes\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 42,053\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 5,301\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,057\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Stock-based compensation expense\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 11,967\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 11,660\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 11,307\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Adjustments:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Lease termination and cease use costs\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Loss on early extinguishment of debt(a)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,321\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 24,991\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 22,895\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Acquisition-related costs(b)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (2,358\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Regulatory settlement(d)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Adjusted EBITDA\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 275,602\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 202,039\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 138,421\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Adjusted EBITDA margin calculated as follows:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total Revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,174,757\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 972,621\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 728,903\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Adjusted EBITDA\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 275,602\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 202,039\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 138,421\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Adjusted EBITDA as a percentage of total revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 23.5\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 20.8\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 19.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nRefer to footnotes in previous table for explanation of (a), (b), and (d)\nConstant Currency Basis\nIn addition to reporting financial results in accordance with GAAP, we have provided certain other non-GAAP financial information on a constant currency basis. Outside of the United States, we currently operate in Brazil. During 2019, 2018 and 2017, 1.8%, 2.7% and 2.7% of our revenue, respectively, originated in currencies other than the U.S. Dollar, principally the Brazilian Real. As a result, changes in our reported revenue and profits include the impacts of changes in foreign currency exchange rates. We provide constant currency assessments in the following discussion and analysis to isolate the impact of the fluctuation in foreign exchange rates and utilize constant currency results in our analysis of performance. Our constant currency assessment assumes foreign exchange rates in the current fiscal periods remained the same as in the prior fiscal year periods. All conversion rates below are based on the U.S. Dollar equivalent to the applicable foreign currency:\nTable 121: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> % Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Brazilian Real\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 0.2548\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 0.2753\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (7.5\n</td> <td> )%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> % Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Brazilian Real\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 0.2753\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 0.3134\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (12.2\n</td> <td> )%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe believe that our non-GAAP constant currency assessments are a useful measure, indicating the actual growth and profitability of our operations.\nCombined Loans and Finance Receivables\nCombined loans and finance receivables is a non-GAAP measure that includes both loans and RPAs we own and loans we guarantee, which are either GAAP items or disclosures required by GAAP. We believe this non-GAAP measure provides investors with important information needed to evaluate the magnitude of potential receivable losses and the opportunity for revenue performance of the loans and finance receivables portfolio on an aggregate basis. We also believe that the comparison of the aggregate amounts from period to period is more meaningful than comparing only the amounts reflected on our consolidated balance sheets since both revenue and cost of revenue are impacted by the aggregate amount of receivables we own and those we guarantee as reflected in our consolidated financial statements.\nYEAR ENDED 2019 COMPARED TO YEAR ENDED 2018\nRevenue and Gross Profit\nRevenue increased $202.2 million, or 20.8%, to $1,174.8 million for 2019 as compared to $972.6 million for 2018. On a constant currency basis, revenue increased by $204.0 million, or 21.0%, for 2019 compared to 2018. The change in revenue was driven primarily by a 47.4% increase in line of credit accounts revenue and an 11.9% increase in installment loan and RPA revenue, partially offset by a 19.2% decline in short-term loan revenue.\nOur gross profit increased by $102.7 million or 21.9% to $571.9 million for 2019 from $469.2 million for 2018. On a constant currency basis, gross profit increased by $103.6 million for 2019 compared to 2018. Our gross profit as a percentage of revenue ( gross profit margin\u201d) increased slightly to 48.7% in 2019 from 48.2% in 2018.\nThe following table sets forth the components of revenue and gross

million, or 36.2%, to $1,062.7 million as of December 31, 2019 from $780.1 million as of December 31, 2018, and the combined portfolio balance of loans and finance receivables, net of allowance and liability for estimated losses, increased $281.0 million, or 34.8%, to $1,088.7 million as of December 31, 2019 from $807.7 million as of December 31, 2018, due primarily to increased demand for our near-prime installment product and our line of credit products. The outstanding loan balance for our near-prime product increased 29.7% as of December 31, 2019 compared to December 31, 2018, resulting in a near-prime portfolio balance that comprises approximately 48.1% of our total loan and finance receivables portfolio balance while short-term loans comprise approximately 3.5%. We expect this trend to continue as we expand our near-prime installment product offering in 2020. We expect the loan balances for our near-prime installment loan product will continue to comprise a larger percentage of the total loan and finance receivable\nportfolio, due to consumer demand for the product and its longer loan term. See -Non-GAAP Financial Measures-Combined Loans and Finance Receivables\u201d above for additional information related to combined loans and finance receivables.\nThe combined loan and finance receivable balance includes $1,239.6 million and $924.3 million as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively, of our Company-owned receivables balances before the allowance for losses of $176.9 million and $144.2 million provided in the consolidated financial statements for December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. The combined loan and finance receivable balance also includes $27.6 million and $29.7 million as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively, of loan and finance receivable balances that are guaranteed by us, which are not included in our consolidated balance sheets, with the exception of the liability for estimated losses of $1.5 million and $2.2 million, which is included in Accounts payable and accrued expenses\u201d as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively.\nThe following table summarizes loan and finance receivable balances outstanding as of December 31, 2019 and 2018 (dollars in thousands):\nTable 123: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> As of December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Guaranteed\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Guaranteed\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Company\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> by the\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Company\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> by the\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Owned(a)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Company(a)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Combined(b)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Owned(a)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Company(a)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Combined(b)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Ending loans and finance receivables:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Short-term loans\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 29,764\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 14,857\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 44,621\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 37,768\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 25,388\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 63,156\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Line of credit accounts\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 392,837\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 392,837\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 227,563\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 227,563\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Installment loans and RPAs\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 816,988\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 12,703\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 829,691\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 658,995\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 4,316\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 663,311\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total ending loans and finance receivables, gross\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,239,589\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 27,560\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,267,149\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 924,326\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 29,704\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 954,030\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Less: Allowance and liabilities for losses(a)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (176,939\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (1,511\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (178,450\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (144,214\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (2,166\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (146,380\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total ending loans and finance receivables, net\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,062,650\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 26,049\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,088,699\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 780,112\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 27,538\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 807,650\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Allowance and liability for losses as a % of loans and finance receivables, gross\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 14.3\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 5.5\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 14.1\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 15.6\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 7.3\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 15.3\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n (a) GAAP measure.

Additionally, the mix of lower dollar short-term loans continued to decrease, resulting in a greater mix of line of credit accounts with higher average amounts outstanding per loan relative to short-term loans, as of December 31, 2019 compared to prior year.\nAverage Loan Origination\nThe average loan origination amount is calculated as the total amount of combined loans originated, renewed and purchased for the period divided by the total number of combined loans originated, renewed and purchased for the period.

New customers require a greater reserve as these loans default at a higher rate than returning customers with a successful history of loan performance.\nThe cost of revenue in 2019 was $602.9 million, which was composed of $603.6 million related to our Company-owned loans and finance receivables partially offset by a $0.7 million decrease in the liability for estimated losses related to loans we guaranteed through the CSO programs. The cost of revenue in 2018 was $503.4 million, which was composed of $503.5 million related to our Company-owned loans and finance receivables partially offset by a $0.1 million decrease in the liability for estimated losses related to loans we guaranteed through the CSO programs. Total charge-offs, net of recoveries, were $570.7 million and $466.4 million in 2019 and 2018, respectively.\nThe following tables show loan and finance receivable balances and fees receivable and the relationship of the allowance and liability for losses to the combined balances of loans and finance receivables for each of the last eight quarters (dollars in thousands):\nTable 135: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> First\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Second\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Third\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Fourth\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Quarter\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Quarter\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Quarter\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Quarter\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Loans and finance receivables:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Gross -

For our products, we evaluate loans and finance receivables losses as a percentage of the average loan and finance receivable balance outstanding or the average combined loan and finance receivable balance outstanding, whichever is applicable, for each portfolio.\nShort-term Loans\nDemand for our short-term loan product has historically been highest in the third and fourth quarters of each year, and lowest in the first quarter of each year, corresponding to our customers' receipt of income tax refunds. The combined short-term loan balance has decreased year-over-year due in part to the shift of customers to line of credit accounts. This resulted in fewer loans written to new customers and a lower allowance and liability for losses as a percentage of combined loan balance.\nOur gross profit margin for short-term loans is typically highest in the first quarter of each year, corresponding to the seasonal decline in consumer loan balances outstanding. The cost of revenue as a percentage of the average combined loan balance for short-term loans outstanding is typically lower in the first quarter and generally peaks in the second half of the year with higher loan demand.\nThe following table includes information related only to short-term loans and shows our loss experience trends for short-term loans for each of the last eight quarters

of Credit Accounts\nThe cost of revenue as a percentage of average loan balance for line of credit accounts exhibits a similar quarterly seasonal trend to short-term loan loss rates as the ratio is typically lower in the first quarter and increases throughout the remainder of the year, peaking in the second half of the year with higher loan demand.\nThe gross profit margin is generally lower for line of credit accounts during periods of growth because the highest levels of default are exhibited in the early stages of the account, while the revenue is recognized over the term of the account. During 2019, we generally experienced lower gross profit margin and higher cost of revenue as a percentage of the average combined loan balance for line of credit accounts outstanding than we experienced in the prior year quarters as a result of the strong growth in the line of credit account portfolios.\nThe following table includes information related only to line of credit accounts and

losses as a % of loan balance is determined using period-end balances. \nInstallment Loans and RPAs\nFor installment loans and RPAs, the cost of revenue as a percentage of average loan and finance receivable balance is typically more consistent throughout the year as compared to short-term loans and line of credit accounts. Due to the scheduled regular payments that are inherent with installment loans and RPAs, we do not experience the higher level of repayments in the first quarter for these receivables as we experience with short-term loans and, to a lesser extent, line of credit accounts.\nSimilar to line of credit accounts, the gross profit margin is generally lower for the installment loan and RPA products during periods of growth, primarily because the highest levels of default are exhibited in the early stages of the loan or RPA, while revenue is recognized over the term of the loan or estimated delivery term. In addition, installment loans and RPAs typically have higher average amounts per receivable. Another factor contributing to the lower gross profit margin is that the yield for installment loans and RPAs is\ntypically lower than the yield for the other products we offer. As a result, particularly in periods of higher growth for the installment loan and RPA portfolios, which has been the case in recent years, the gross profit margin is typically lower for this product than for other products, particularly our short-term loan products. Our installment loan and RPA portfolio balance outstanding at December 31, 2019 increased $166.4 million, or 25.1%, compared to December 31, 2018. During 2019, we generally experienced higher gross profit margin than we experienced in the prior year quarters as a result of better credit performance in the installment and RPA portfolios.\nThe following table includes information related only to our installment loans and RPAs and shows our loss experience trends for installment loans for each of the last eight quarters (dollars in

liability for losses as a % of combined loan and finance receivable balance, gross, is determined using period-end balances. \nTotal Expenses\nTotal expenses increased $30.0 million, or 10.2%, to $323.7 million in 2019, compared to $293.7 million in 2018. On a constant currency basis, total expenses increased $30.8 million, or 10.5%, to $30.8 million for 2019 compared to 2018.\nMarketing expense increased $19.1 million, or 20.0%, to $115.1 million in 2019 compared to $96.0 million in 2018, primarily due to higher direct mail, television advertising and digital marketing costs.\nOperations and technology expense increased to $84.3 million in 2019 from $78.4 million in 2018, due primarily to higher underwriting costs primarily related to growth in loan originations and higher selling expense.\nGeneral and administrative expense increased $4.1 million, or 3.9%, to $109.2 million in 2019 compared to $105.1 million in 2018, due primarily to higher corporate services personnel costs, driven primarily by an increase in headcount.\nDepreciation and amortization expense increased to $15.1 million in 2019 compared to $14.2 million in 2018 primarily related to increased amortization on higher capitalized software development costs.\nInterest Expense, Net\nInterest expense, net decreased $3.7 million, or 4.7%, to $75.6 million in 2019 compared to $79.3 million in 2018. The decrease was due to a decrease in the weighted average interest rate on our outstanding debt to 8.61% in 2019 from 9.78% in 2018, partially offset by an increase in the average amount of debt outstanding of $76.4 million to $887.1 million during 2019 from $810.7 million during 2018.The increase in average debt outstanding was due primarily to additional principal amounts outstanding under our securitization facilities and a higher balance of senior note debt resulting from the issuance of $375.0 million in senior notes in September 2018, partially offset by the early pay down of our 9.75% senior notes due 2021. See -Liquidity and Capital Resources-Consumer Loan Securitizations\u201d below for further information.\nProvision for Income Taxes\nThe effective tax rate of 24.7% in 2019 was higher than the effective tax rate of 7.7% in 2018 due primarily to the acceleration of tax deductions in 2018 for prior year loan and fixed asset related deferred tax items, coupled with the overall decrease in the federal tax rate from 35% to 21% resulting from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act which was enacted into law on December 22, 2017.\nThe balance of unrecognized tax benefits recorded in our Consolidated Balance Sheet as of December 31, 2019 was $53.6 million, of which $13.9 million, if recognized, would favorably affect the effective tax rate in the period of recognition. We believe it is reasonably possible that, within the next twelve months, unrecognized domestic tax benefits will change by a significant amount. The principal uncertainties are related to the timing of recognition of income and losses related to our loan and finance receivable portfolio. We are currently under a Joint Committee on Taxation review of certain tax returns that were filed during 2018 in conjunction with the refunds claimed on those returns. Depending upon the outcome of the review and any related agreements or settlements with the relevant taxing authorities, the amount of the uncertainty, including amounts that would be recognized as a component of the effective tax rate, could change significantly. While the total amount of uncertainty to be resolved is not clear, it is reasonably possible that the uncertainties pertaining to this matter will be resolved in the next twelve months.\nYEAR ENDED 2018 COMPARED TO YEAR ENDED 2017\nRevenue and Gross Profit\nRevenue increased $243.7 million, or 33.4%, to $972.6 million for 2018 as compared to $728.9 million for 2017. On a constant currency basis, revenue increased by $247.5 million, or 34.0%, for 2018 compared to 2017. The change in revenue was driven by an increase in revenue of $237.0 million from our domestic operations, primarily resulting from a 38.4% increase in domestic line of credit accounts revenue in 2018 and a 38.2% increase in domestic installment loan and RPA revenue compared to 2017 driven by growth in these products. Additionally, revenue from international operations increased $6.7 million (or an increase of $10.6 million on a constant currency basis), due to a 30.3% increase in international installment loan revenue in 2018 compared to 2017.\nOur gross profit increased by $93.8 million or 25.0% to $469.2 million for 2018 from $375.4 million for 2017. On a constant currency basis, gross profit increased by $95.1 million for 2018 compared to 2017. Our gross profit margin decreased to 48.2% in 2018 from 51.5% in 2017. The decrease in gross profit margin was primarily driven by the strong new customer growth of our installment portfolio resulting in a higher mix of new customers overall, which require higher loss provisions as new customers default at a higher rate than returning customers with a successful history of loan performance. Growth in our near-prime installment portfolio also contributed to the lower gross profit margin, as these products typically have a lower margin than our short-term products.\nThe following table sets forth the components of revenue, separated by product for 2018 and 2017 (dollars in thousands):\nTable 155: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td>

primarily to increased demand for our near-prime installment product. The outstanding loan balance for our near-prime product increased 26.7% as of December 31, 2018 compared to December 31, 2017, resulting in a near-prime portfolio balance that comprises approximately 49% of our total loan and finance receivables portfolio balance while short-term loans comprise approximately 7%.

New customers require a greater reserve as these loans default at a higher rate than returning customers with a successful history of loan performance.\nThe cost of revenue in 2018 was $503.4 million, which was composed of $503.5 million related to our Company-owned loans and finance receivables partially offset by a $0.1 million decrease in the liability for estimated losses related to loans we guaranteed through the CSO programs. The cost of revenue in 2017 was $353.5 million, which was composed of $353.2 million related to our Company-owned loans and finance receivables, and a $0.3 million increase in the liability for estimated losses related to loans we guaranteed through the CSO programs.

For our products, we evaluate loans and finance receivables losses as a percentage of the average loan and finance receivable balance outstanding or the average combined loan and finance receivable balance outstanding, whichever is applicable, for each portfolio.\nShort-term Loans\nThe allowance and liability for losses as a percentage of combined loan balance in 2018 was fairly consistent with 2017.\nOur gross profit margin for short-term loans is typically highest in the first quarter of each year, corresponding to the seasonal decline in consumer loan balances outstanding. The cost of revenue as a percentage of the average combined loan balance for short-term loans outstanding is typically lower in the first quarter and generally peaks in the second half of the year with higher loan demand.\nThe following table includes information related only to short-term loans and shows our loss experience trends for short-term loans for each of the last eight quarters

Accounts\nThe cost of revenue as a percentage of average loan balance for line of credit accounts exhibits a similar quarterly seasonal trend to short-term loan loss rates as the ratio is typically lower in the first quarter and increases throughout the remainder of the year, peaking in the second half of the year with higher loan demand. The gross profit margin is generally lower for line of credit accounts during periods of growth because the highest levels of default are exhibited in the early stages of the account, while the revenue is recognized over the term of the account.\nDuring 2018, we experienced lower gross profit margin and higher cost of revenue as a percentage of the average combined loan balance for line of credit accounts outstanding than we experienced in the prior year quarters as a result of the strong growth in the line of credit account portfolios.\nThe following table includes information related

\n (b) Allowance for losses as a % of loan balance is determined using period-end balances. \nInstallment Loans and RPAs\nFor installment loans and RPAs, the cost of revenue as a percentage of average loan and finance receivable balance is typically more consistent throughout the year as compared to short-term loans and line of credit accounts. Due to the scheduled regular payments that are inherent with installment loans and RPAs, we do not experience the higher level of repayments in the first quarter for these receivables as we experience with short-term loans and, to a lesser extent, line of credit accounts.\nSimilar to line of credit accounts, the gross profit margin is generally lower for the installment loan and RPA products than for other products, primarily because the highest levels of default are exhibited in the early stages of the loan or RPA, while revenue is recognized over the term of the loan or estimated delivery term. In addition, installment loans and RPAs typically have higher average amounts per receivable. Another factor contributing to the lower gross profit margin is that the yield for installment loans and RPAs is typically lower than the yield for our other products, particularly short-term products. During 2018, we generally experienced lower gross profit margin than we experienced in the prior year quarters as a result of the continued growth in our near-prime installment and RPA portfolios.\nThe following table includes information related only to our installment loans and RPAs and shows our loss experience trends for installment loans for each of the last eight quarters

liability for losses as a % of combined loan and finance receivable balance, gross, is determined using period-end balances. \nTotal Expenses\nTotal expenses increased $34.5 million, or 13.3%, to $293.7 million in 2018, compared to $259.2 million in 2017. On a constant currency basis, total expenses increased $36.3 million, or 14.0%, to $295.5 million for 2018 compared to 2017.\nMarketing expense increased $19.4 million, or 25.3%, to $96.0 million in 2018 compared to $76.6 million in 2017, primarily due to higher direct mail, television advertising, lead purchase and digital marketing costs.\nOperations and technology expense increased to $78.4 million in 2018 from $69.6 million in 2017, due primarily to higher contact center headcount to support our growth and higher underwriting costs primarily related to growth in loan originations.\nGeneral and administrative expense increased $5.4 million, or 5.4%, to $105.1 million in 2018 compared to $99.7 million in 2017, due primarily to higher incentive expenses resulting from our strong financial performance.\nDepreciation and amortization expense increased to $14.2 million in 2018 compared to $13.3 million in 2017 primarily related to software development projects and amortization thereof.\nInterest Expense, Net\nInterest expense, net increased $5.3 million, or 7.2%, to $79.3 million in 2018 compared to $74.0 million in 2017. The increase was due to an increase in the average amount of debt outstanding of $116.2 million to $810.7 million during 2018 from $694.5 million during 2017, partially offset by a decrease in the weighted average interest rate on our outstanding debt to 9.78% in 2018 from 10.63% in 2017.The increase in average debt outstanding was due primarily to additional principal amounts outstanding under our securitization facilities and the issuance of $375.0 million in senior notes in September 2018, partially offset by the early paydown of our 9.75% senior notes due 2021. See -Liquidity and Capital Resources-Consumer Loan Securitizations\u201d below for further information.\nProvision for Income Taxes\nThe effective tax rate of 7.7% in 2018 was lower than the effective tax rate of 10.5% in 2017 due primarily to the estimated tax effects of optimizing the timing of certain income tax deductions in 2018 for prior year loan and fixed asset related deferred tax items, coupled with the overall decrease in the federal tax rate from 35% to 21% resulting from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, which was enacted into law on December 22, 2017.\nLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\nCapital Funding Strategy\nHistorically, we have generated significant cash flow through normal operating activities for funding both long-term and short-term needs. Our near-term liquidity is managed to ensure that adequate resources are available to fund our seasonal working capital growth, which is driven by demand for our loan and financing products, and to meet the continued growth in the demand for our near-prime installment products. On May 30, 2014, we issued and sold $500.0 million in aggregate principal amount of 9.75% senior notes due 2021 (the 2021 Senior Notes\u201d). On September 1, 2017, we issued and sold $250.0 million in aggregate principal amount of 8.50% Senior Notes due 2024 (the 2024 Senior Notes\u201d) and used the net proceeds, in part, to retire $155.0 million in 2021 Senior Notes. On January 21, 2018, we redeemed an additional $50.0 million in principal amount of the outstanding 2021 Senior Notes. On September 19, 2018, we issued and sold $375.0 million in aggregate principal amount of 8.50% Senior Notes due 2025 (the 2025 Senior Notes\u201d) and used the net proceeds, in part, to retire the remaining $295.0 million in principal amount of the outstanding 2021 Senior Notes.\nOn June 30, 2017, we entered into a secured revolving credit agreement (as amended, the Credit Agreement\u201d) which replaced our previous credit agreement that was terminated on June 30, 2017. On April 13, 2018, October 5, 2018 and July 1, 2019, we and certain of our operating subsidiaries entered into amendments to our Credit Agreement, as further described below. As of February 24, 2020, our available borrowings under the Credit Agreement were $28.8 million. Since 2016, we have entered into several consumer loan securitization facilities and offered asset-backed notes to fund our growth, primarily in our near-prime consumer installment loan business, as further described below under Consumer Loan Securitization.\u201d As of February 24, 2019, the outstanding balance under our securitization facilities was $289.2 million. We expect that our operating needs, including satisfying our obligations under our debt agreements and funding our working capital growth, will be satisfied by a combination of cash flows from operations, borrowings under the Credit Agreement, or any refinancing, replacement thereof or increase in borrowings thereunder, and securitization or sale of loans and finance receivables under our consumer loan securitization facilities.\nAs of December 31, 2019, we were in compliance with all financial ratios, covenants and other requirements set forth in our debt agreements. Unexpected changes in our financial condition or other unforeseen factors may result in our inability to obtain third-party financing or could increase our borrowing costs in the future. To the extent we experience short-term or long-term funding disruptions, we have the ability to adjust our volume of lending and financing to consumers and small businesses that would reduce cash outflow requirements while increasing cash inflows through repayments. Additional alternatives may include the securitization or sale of assets, increased borrowings under the Credit Agreement, or any refinancing or replacement thereof, and reductions in capital spending which could be expected to generate additional liquidity.\n8.50% Senior Unsecured Notes Due 2025\nOn September 19, 2018, we issued and sold the 2025 Senior Notes. The 2025 Senior Notes were sold to qualified institutional buyers in accordance with Rule 144A under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the Securities Act\u201d) and outside the United States pursuant to Regulation S under the Securities Act.

Cash flows provided by financing activities for 2018 primarily reflects a net increase of $30.0 million in our senior notes facilities, $22.0 million in net borrowings under the Credit Agreement and $15.9 million in net borrowings under our securitization facilities, partially offset by $18.8 million of early termination fees paid in connection with the early payment of our 2021 Senior Notes, $17.3 million in treasury shares purchased and $13.0 million of debt issuance costs paid in connection with the 2025 Senior Notes, the Credit Agreement and the 2018-1, 2018-2 and 2018-A Securitization Facilities.\nCONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS AND COMMITMENTS\nThe following table summarizes our contractual obligations at December 31, 2019, and the effect such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flow in future periods (in thousands):\nTable 190: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Thereafter\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Securitizations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Revolving credit agreement (a)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 72,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 72,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Senior notes (b)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 250,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 375,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 625,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Interest on senior notes (c)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 53,125\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 53,125\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 53,125\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 53,125\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 53,125\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 31,875\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 297,500\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Securitization facilities (d)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 307,885\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 307,885\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Non-cancelable leases (e)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 7,242\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 7,282\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 7,018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 7,115\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 6,285\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 17,179\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 52,121\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 60,367\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 60,407\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 60,143\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 60,240\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 309,410\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 424,054\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 307,885\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,282,506\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n (a) Revolving credit agreement may be repaid at any time prior to maturity in June 2022; as such, no interest payments have been included in the table. \n (b) Represents obligations under the 2024 Senior Notes and 2025 Senior Notes. \n (c) Represents cash payments for interest on the 2024 Senior Notes and 2025 Senior Notes. \n (d) Securitizations and related interest are not included in maturities by period due to their variable monthly payments. \n (e) Represents obligations due under long-term operating leases. \nThe liability for uncertain tax positions has been excluded due to the high degree of uncertainty regarding the timing of potential future cash outflows. We are unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate of the period of cash settlement with the respective taxing authority.\nOFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS\nIn certain markets, we arrange for consumers to obtain consumer loan products from independent third-party lenders through our CSO programs. For consumer loan products originated by third-party lenders under the CSO programs, each lender is responsible for providing the criteria by which the customer's application is underwritten and, if approved, determining the amount of the consumer loan. We are responsible for assessing whether or not we will guarantee such loan. When a customer executes an agreement with us under our CSO programs, we agree, for a fee payable to us by the customer, to provide certain services to the customer, one of which is to guarantee the customer's obligation to repay the loan received by the customer from the third-party lender if the customer fails to do so. The guarantee represents an obligation to purchase specific loans if they go into default, which generally occurs after one payment is missed. As of December 31, 2019 and 2018, the outstanding amount of active consumer loans originated by third-party lenders under the CSO programs was $27.6 million and $29.7 million, respectively, which were guaranteed by us.\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES\nAllowance and Liability for Estimated Losses on Loans and Finance Receivables\nWe monitor the performance of our loan and finance receivable portfolios and maintain either an allowance or liability for estimated losses on loans and finance receivables (including revenue, fees and/or interest) at a level estimated to be adequate to absorb losses inherent in the portfolio. The allowance for losses on our Company-owned loans and finance receivables reduces the outstanding loans and finance receivables balance in the consolidated balance sheets. The liability for estimated losses related to loans guaranteed under the CSO programs is initially recorded at fair value and is included in Accounts payable and accrued expenses\u201d in the consolidated balance sheets.\nIn determining the allowance or liability for estimated losses on loans and finance receivables, we apply a documented systematic methodology. In calculating the allowance or liability for receivable losses, outstanding loans and finance receivables are divided into discrete groups of short-term loans, line of credit accounts, installment loans and RPAs and are analyzed as current or delinquent. Increases in either the allowance or the liability, net of charge-offs and recoveries, are recorded as a Cost of revenue\u201d in the consolidated statements of income.\nThe allowance or liability for short-term loans classified as current is based on historical loss rates adjusted for recent default trends for current loans. For delinquent short-term loans, the allowance or liability is based on a six-month rolling average of loss rates by stage of collection. For line of credit account, installment loan and RPA portfolios, we generally use either a migration analysis or roll-rate based methodology to estimate losses inherent in the portfolio. The allowance or liability calculation under the migration analysis and roll-rate methodology is based on historical charge-off experience and the loss emergence period, which represents the average amount of time between the first occurrence of a loss event and the charge-off of a loan or RPA. The factors we consider to assess the adequacy of the allowance or liability include past due performance, historical behavior of monthly vintages, underwriting changes and recent trends in delinquency in the migration analysis. The roll-rate methodology is based on delinquency status, payment history and recency factors to estimate future charge-offs.\nWe fully reserve for loans and finance receivables once the receivable or a portion of the receivable has been classified as delinquent for 60 consecutive days and generally charge-off loans and finance receivables between 60 to 65 days delinquent. If a loan or finance receivable is deemed uncollectible before it is fully reserved, it is charged off at that point. Loans and finance receivables classified as delinquent generally have an age of one to 64 days from the date any portion of the receivable became delinquent, as defined above. Recoveries on loans and finance receivables previously charged to the allowance are credited to the allowance generally when collected.\nGoodwill\nGoodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired in each business combination. In accordance with Accounting Standards Codification ( ASC\u201d) 350, Goodwill, we test goodwill for potential impairment annually as of June 30 and between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value below its carrying amount.\nWe first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is necessary to perform the two-step quantitative goodwill impairment test. In assessing the qualitative factors, we consider relevant events and circumstances including but not limited to macroeconomic conditions, industry and market environment, our overall financial performance, cash flow from operating activities, market capitalization and stock price. If we determine that the two-step quantitative impairment test is required, we use the income approach to complete our annual goodwill assessment. The income approach uses future cash flows and estimated terminal values that are discounted using a market participant perspective to determine the fair value, which is then compared to the carrying value to determine if there is impairment. The income approach includes assumptions about revenue growth rates, operating margins and terminal growth rates discounted by an estimated weighted-average cost of capital derived from other publicly-traded companies that are similar from an operational and economic standpoint. We completed our annual assessment of goodwill as of June 30, 2019 based on qualitative factors and determined that the fair value of our goodwill exceeded carrying value, and, as a result, no impairment existed at that date. A 10% decrease in the estimated fair value for the June 2019 assessment would not have resulted in a goodwill impairment.\nIncome Taxes\nWe account for income taxes under ASC 740, Income Taxes. As part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements, we are required to estimate income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate. This process involves estimating the actual current tax expense together with assessing temporary differences in recognition of income for tax and accounting purposes. These differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities and are included within the consolidated balance sheets. We must then assess the likelihood that the deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and, to the extent we believe that recovery is not\nlikely, we must establish a valuation allowance. An expense or benefit is included within the tax provision in the consolidated statement of income for any increase or decrease in the valuation allowance for a given period.\nWe report our loans and finance receivables in the Company's tax returns at fair market value, which differs from how we report them in the consolidated financial statements. Changes in the fair market value of our loans and finance receivables as determined for tax purposes may have a significant impact on the timing and amount of how income taxes are recognized in the consolidated financial statements. The estimates of fair market value are dependent on multiple assumptions, including expected credit losses and discount rates.\nWe perform an evaluation of the recoverability of our deferred tax assets on a quarterly basis. We establish a valuation allowance if it is more-likely-than-not (greater than 50 percent) that all or some portion of the deferred tax asset will not be realized. We analyze several factors, including the nature and frequency of operating losses, our carryforward period for any losses, the reversal of future taxable temporary differences, the expected occurrence of future income or loss and the feasibility of available tax planning strategies to protect against the loss of deferred tax assets.\nWe account for uncertainty in income taxes in accordance with ASC 740, which requires that a more-likely-than-not threshold be met before the benefit of a tax position may be recognized in the consolidated financial statements and prescribes how such benefit should be measured. We must evaluate tax positions taken on our tax returns for all periods that are open to examination by taxing authorities and make a judgment as to whether and to what extent such positions are more likely than not to be sustained based on merit. We record interest and penalties related to tax matters as income tax expense in the consolidated statement of income.\nOur judgment is required in determining the provision for income taxes, the deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance recorded against deferred tax assets. Our judgment is also required in evaluating whether tax benefits meet the more-likely-than-not threshold for recognition under ASC 740.\nRECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS\nRefer to Note 1 in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d in this report for a discussion of recently issued accounting pronouncements.\nTable 196: <table> <tr> <td>", "item_7_text": "ITEM 7.\n</td> <td> MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nRECENT REGULATORY DEVELOPMENTS\nCalifornia AB 539\nOn October 10, 2019, the Governor of California signed into law Assembly Bill 539 ( AB 539\u201d), which amends several aspects of the California Finance Lenders Law. Specifically, on loans of $2,500 or more but less than $10,000, AB 539 caps interest rates at 36% plus the federal funds rate and requires loan terms to be at least 12 months. On loans of at least $3,000 but less than $10,000, AB 539 prohibits loan terms from exceeding 60 months and 15 days. The law became effective on January 1, 2020.\nBrazil General Data Privacy Law\nOn August 14, 2018, Brazil adopted the General Data Privacy Law (Lei Geral de Prote\u00e7\u00e3o de Dados Pessoais or LGPD\u201d). The key provisions of LGPD are quite similar to the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation in that it grants certain rights to data subjects, imposes obligations on companies with regard to the processing of data, and allows authorities to impose substantial fines on companies that violate the law. LGPD was originally anticipated to go into effect on February 15, 2020; however, several amendments to LGPD have been proposed, one of which could delay the effective date of the legislation to August 2020. Compliance with LGPD may increase the cost of conducting business in Brazil, and we could see regulatory compliance costs and enforcement activity once the law goes into effect.\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nOur financial results for the year ended December 31, 2019 ( 2019\u201d) are summarized below.\n \u2022 Revenue increased $202.2 million, or 20.8%, to $1,174.8 million in 2019 compared to $972.6 million in the year ended December 31, 2018 ( 2018\u201d). \n \u2022 Gross Profit increased $102.7 million, or 21.9%, to $571.9 million in 2019 compared to $469.2 million in 2018. \n \u2022 Income from Operations increased $72.7 million, or 41.4%, to $248.2 million in 2019, compared to $175.5 million in 2018. \n \u2022 Net Income was $36.6 million in 2019, compared to $70.1 million in 2018. Diluted earnings per share were $1.06 in 2019 compared to $1.99 in 2018. \nThe following tables reflect our results of operations for the periods indicated, both in dollars and as a percentage of total revenue (dollars in thousands, except per share data):\n\nNON-GAAP FINANACIAL MEASURES\nIn addition to the financial information prepared in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles ( GAAP\u201d), we provide historical non-GAAP financial information. We believe that presentation of non-GAAP financial information is meaningful and useful in understanding the activities and business metrics of our operations. We believe that these non-GAAP financial measures reflect an additional way of viewing aspects of our business that, when viewed with our GAAP results, provide a more complete understanding of factors and trends affecting our business.\nWe provide non-GAAP financial information for informational purposes and to enhance understanding of our GAAP consolidated financial statements. Readers should consider the information in addition to, but not instead of or superior to, our consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP. This non-GAAP financial information may be determined or calculated differently by other companies, limiting the usefulness of those measures for comparative purposes.\nAdjusted Earnings Measures\nIn addition to reporting financial results in accordance with GAAP, we have provided adjusted earnings and adjusted earnings per share, or, collectively, the Adjusted Earnings Measures, which are non-GAAP measures. We believe that the presentation of these measures provides investors with greater transparency and facilitates comparison of operating results across a broad spectrum of companies with varying capital structures, compensation strategies, derivative instruments and amortization methods, which provides a more complete understanding of our financial performance, competitive position and prospects for the future. We also believe that investors regularly rely on non-GAAP financial measures, such as the Adjusted Earnings Measures, to assess operating performance and that such measures may highlight trends in our business that may not otherwise be apparent when relying on financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. In addition, we believe that the adjustments shown below are useful to investors in order to allow them to compare our financial results during the periods shown without the effect of each of these income or expense items.\nThe following table provides reconciliations between net income and diluted earnings per share calculated in accordance with GAAP to the Adjusted Earnings Measures, which are shown net of tax (in thousands, except per share data):\n\n (a) For the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, we recorded $2.3 million. ($1.8 million net of tax), $25.0 million ($19.6 million net of tax) and $22.9 million ($17.7 million net of tax) losses on early extinguishment of debt, respectively, related to the redemption of $44.1 million of securitization notes in 2019, the repurchase of $345 million of principal amount of senior notes in 2018 and the repurchase of $155.0 million principal amount of senior notes and the redemption of $160.9 million of securitization notes in 2017. \n (b) For the year ended December 31, 2017 we recorded a $2.4 million ($1.8 million net of tax) fair value adjustment to contingent consideration, respectively, related to a prior year acquisition. \n (c) For the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, we recorded income tax benefits of $11.2 million and $7.5 million, respectively, from the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. \n (d) For the year ended December 31, 2018, we consented to the issuance of a Consent Order by the CFPB, pursuant to which it agreed, without admitting or denying any of the facts or conclusions made by the CFPB from its 2014 review of us, to pay a civil money penalty of $3.2 million, which is nondeductible for tax purposes. \nAdjusted EBITDA\nThe table below shows Adjusted EBITDA, which is a non-GAAP measure that we define as earnings excluding depreciation, amortization, interest, foreign currency transaction gains or losses, taxes and stock-based compensation expense. We believe Adjusted EBITDA is used by investors to analyze operating performance and evaluate our ability to incur and service debt and our capacity for making capital expenditures. Adjusted EBITDA is also useful to investors to help assess our estimated enterprise value. In addition, we believe that the adjustments for loss on early extinguishment of debt, acquisition-related costs and the regulatory settlement shown below are useful to investors in order to allow them to compare our financial results during the periods shown without the effect of the income or expense items. The computation of Adjusted EBITDA as presented below may differ from the computation of similarly-titled measures provided by other companies (dollars in thousands):\n\nRefer to footnotes in previous table for explanation of (a), (b), and (d)\nConstant Currency Basis\nIn addition to reporting financial results in accordance with GAAP, we have provided certain other non-GAAP financial information on a constant currency basis. Outside of the United States, we currently operate in Brazil. During 2019, 2018 and 2017, 1.8%, 2.7% and 2.7% of our revenue, respectively, originated in currencies other than the U.S. Dollar, principally the Brazilian Real. As a result, changes in our reported revenue and profits include the impacts of changes in foreign currency exchange rates. We provide constant currency assessments in the following discussion and analysis to isolate the impact of the fluctuation in foreign exchange rates and utilize constant currency results in our analysis of performance. Our constant currency assessment assumes foreign exchange rates in the current fiscal periods remained the same as in the prior fiscal year periods. All conversion rates below are based on the U.S. Dollar equivalent to the applicable foreign currency:\n\nWe believe that our non-GAAP constant currency assessments are a useful measure, indicating the actual growth and profitability of our operations.\nCombined Loans and Finance Receivables\nCombined loans and finance receivables is a non-GAAP measure that includes both loans and RPAs we own and loans we guarantee, which are either GAAP items or disclosures required by GAAP. We believe this non-GAAP measure provides investors with important information needed to evaluate the magnitude of potential receivable losses and the opportunity for revenue performance of the loans and finance receivables portfolio on an aggregate basis. We also believe that the comparison of the aggregate amounts from period to period is more meaningful than comparing only the amounts reflected on our consolidated balance sheets since both revenue and cost of revenue are impacted by the aggregate amount of receivables we own and those we guarantee as reflected in our consolidated financial statements.\nYEAR ENDED 2019 COMPARED TO YEAR ENDED 2018\nRevenue and Gross Profit\nRevenue increased $202.2 million, or 20.8%, to $1,174.8 million for 2019 as compared to $972.6 million for 2018. On a constant currency basis, revenue increased by $204.0 million, or 21.0%, for 2019 compared to 2018. The change in revenue was driven primarily by a 47.4% increase in line of credit accounts revenue and an 11.9% increase in installment loan and RPA revenue, partially offset by a 19.2% decline in short-term loan revenue.\nOur gross profit increased by $102.7 million or 21.9% to $571.9 million for 2019 from $469.2 million for 2018. On a constant currency basis, gross profit increased by $103.6 million for 2019 compared to 2018. Our gross profit as a percentage of revenue ( gross profit margin\u201d) increased slightly to 48.7% in 2019 from 48.2% in 2018.\nThe following table sets forth the components of revenue and gross profit, separated by product for 2019 and 2018 (dollars in thousands):\n\nLoan and Finance Receivable Balances\nThe outstanding Company-owned portfolio balance of loans and finance receivables, net of allowance, increased $282.6 million, or 36.2%, to $1,062.7 million as of December 31, 2019 from $780.1 million as of December 31, 2018, and the combined portfolio balance of loans and finance receivables, net of allowance and liability for estimated losses, increased $281.0 million, or 34.8%, to $1,088.7 million as of December 31, 2019 from $807.7 million as of December 31, 2018, due primarily to increased demand for our near-prime installment product and our line of credit products. The outstanding loan balance for our near-prime product increased 29.7% as of December 31, 2019 compared to December 31, 2018, resulting in a near-prime portfolio balance that comprises approximately 48.1% of our total loan and finance receivables portfolio balance while short-term loans comprise approximately 3.5%. We expect this trend to continue as we expand our near-prime installment product offering in 2020. We expect the loan balances for our near-prime installment loan product will continue to comprise a larger percentage of the total loan and finance receivable\nportfolio, due to consumer demand for the product and its longer loan term. See -Non-GAAP Financial Measures-Combined Loans and Finance Receivables\u201d above for additional information related to combined loans and finance receivables.\nThe combined loan and finance receivable balance includes $1,239.6 million and $924.3 million as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively, of our Company-owned receivables balances before the allowance for losses of $176.9 million and $144.2 million provided in the consolidated financial statements for December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. The combined loan and finance receivable balance also includes $27.6 million and $29.7 million as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively, of loan and finance receivable balances that are guaranteed by us, which are not included in our consolidated balance sheets, with the exception of the liability for estimated losses of $1.5 million and $2.2 million, which is included in Accounts payable and accrued expenses\u201d as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively.\nThe following table summarizes loan and finance receivable balances outstanding as of December 31, 2019 and 2018 (dollars in thousands):\n\n (a) GAAP measure. The loan and finance receivable balances guaranteed by us relate to loans originated by third-party lenders through the CSO programs and are not included in our consolidated balance sheets. \n (b) Except for allowance and liability for estimated losses, amounts represent non-GAAP measures. \nAverage Amount Outstanding per Loan\nThe average amount outstanding per loan is calculated as the total combined loans, gross balance at the end of the period divided by the total number of combined loans outstanding at the end of the period. The following table shows the average amount outstanding per loan by product at December 31, 2019 and 2018:\n\n (a) The disclosure regarding the average amount per loan is statistical data that is not included in our consolidated financial statements. \n (b) Includes loans guaranteed by us, which represent loans originated by third-party lenders through the CSO programs and are not included in our consolidated balance sheets. \n (c) Excludes RPAs. \nThe average amount outstanding per loan increased to $2,002 as of December 31, 2019 compared to $1,753 from prior year, mainly due to increases in the average balances of installment loans, driven by a greater mix of larger near-prime loans, and line of credit accounts. Additionally, the mix of lower dollar short-term loans continued to decrease, resulting in a greater mix of line of credit accounts with higher average amounts outstanding per loan relative to short-term loans, as of December 31, 2019 compared to prior year.\nAverage Loan Origination\nThe average loan origination amount is calculated as the total amount of combined loans originated, renewed and purchased for the period divided by the total number of combined loans originated, renewed and purchased for the period. The following table shows the average loan origination amount by product for 2019 compared to 2018:\n\n (a) The disclosure regarding the average loan origination amount is statistical data that is not included in our consolidated financial statements. \n (b) Includes loans guaranteed by us, which represent loans originated by third-party lenders through the CSO programs and are not included in our consolidated balance sheets. \n (c) Represents the average amount of each incremental draw on line of credit accounts. \n (d) Excludes RPAs. \nThe average loan origination amount increased to $632 from $603 during 2019 compared to 2018, mainly due to an increase in the average size of installment loan originations, driven by a greater mix of near-prime installment loans, which have a higher origination amount than other installment loans, partially offset by a shift away from short-term loans to lower dollar line of credit draws.\nLoans and Finance Receivables Loss Experience\nThe allowance and liability for estimated losses as a percentage of loans and RPAs decreased to 14.3% as of December 31, 2019 compared to 15.6% as of December 31, 2018 on a Company-owned basis and 14.1% as of December 31, 2019 compared to 15.3% as of December 31, 2018 on a combined basis, due primarily to stabilizing credit performance in our installment and short-term loan products, partially offset by a greater concentration of loans to new customers in the line of credit account portfolio. New customers require a greater reserve as these loans default at a higher rate than returning customers with a successful history of loan performance.\nThe cost of revenue in 2019 was $602.9 million, which was composed of $603.6 million related to our Company-owned loans and finance receivables partially offset by a $0.7 million decrease in the liability for estimated losses related to loans we guaranteed through the CSO programs. The cost of revenue in 2018 was $503.4 million, which was composed of $503.5 million related to our Company-owned loans and finance receivables partially offset by a $0.1 million decrease in the liability for estimated losses related to loans we guaranteed through the CSO programs. Total charge-offs, net of recoveries, were $570.7 million and $466.4 million in 2019 and 2018, respectively.\nThe following tables show loan and finance receivable balances and fees receivable and the relationship of the allowance and liability for losses to the combined balances of loans and finance receivables for each of the last eight quarters (dollars in thousands):\n\n\n (a) Represents loans originated by third-party lenders through the CSO programs, which are not included in our consolidated financial statements. \n (b) Non-GAAP measure. \nLoans and Finance Receivables Loss Experience by Product\nWe evaluate loss rates for all financing products in our portfolio to determine credit quality and evaluate trends. For our products, we evaluate loans and finance receivables losses as a percentage of the average loan and finance receivable balance outstanding or the average combined loan and finance receivable balance outstanding, whichever is applicable, for each portfolio.\nShort-term Loans\nDemand for our short-term loan product has historically been highest in the third and fourth quarters of each year, and lowest in the first quarter of each year, corresponding to our customers' receipt of income tax refunds. The combined short-term loan balance has decreased year-over-year due in part to the shift of customers to line of credit accounts. This resulted in fewer loans written to new customers and a lower allowance and liability for losses as a percentage of combined loan balance.\nOur gross profit margin for short-term loans is typically highest in the first quarter of each year, corresponding to the seasonal decline in consumer loan balances outstanding. The cost of revenue as a percentage of the average combined loan balance for short-term loans outstanding is typically lower in the first quarter and generally peaks in the second half of the year with higher loan demand.\nThe following table includes information related only to short-term loans and shows our loss experience trends for short-term loans for each of the last eight quarters (dollars in thousands):\n\n\n (a) The average short-term combined loan balance is the average of the month-end balances during the period. \n (b) Represents loans originated by third-party lenders through the CSO programs, which are not included in our consolidated balance sheets. \n (c) Non-GAAP measure. \n (d) Allowance and liability for losses as a % of combined loan balance, gross, is determined using period-end balances. \nLine of Credit Accounts\nThe cost of revenue as a percentage of average loan balance for line of credit accounts exhibits a similar quarterly seasonal trend to short-term loan loss rates as the ratio is typically lower in the first quarter and increases throughout the remainder of the year, peaking in the second half of the year with higher loan demand.\nThe gross profit margin is generally lower for line of credit accounts during periods of growth because the highest levels of default are exhibited in the early stages of the account, while the revenue is recognized over the term of the account. During 2019, we generally experienced lower gross profit margin and higher cost of revenue as a percentage of the average combined loan balance for line of credit accounts outstanding than we experienced in the prior year quarters as a result of the strong growth in the line of credit account portfolios.\nThe following table includes information related only to line of credit accounts and shows our loss experience trends for line of credit accounts for each of the last eight quarters (dollars in thousands):\n\n\n (a) The average loan balance for line of credit accounts is the average of the month-end balances during the period. \n (b) Allowance for losses as a % of loan balance is determined using period-end balances. \nInstallment Loans and RPAs\nFor installment loans and RPAs, the cost of revenue as a percentage of average loan and finance receivable balance is typically more consistent throughout the year as compared to short-term loans and line of credit accounts. Due to the scheduled regular payments that are inherent with installment loans and RPAs, we do not experience the higher level of repayments in the first quarter for these receivables as we experience with short-term loans and, to a lesser extent, line of credit accounts.\nSimilar to line of credit accounts, the gross profit margin is generally lower for the installment loan and RPA products during periods of growth, primarily because the highest levels of default are exhibited in the early stages of the loan or RPA, while revenue is recognized over the term of the loan or estimated delivery term. In addition, installment loans and RPAs typically have higher average amounts per receivable. Another factor contributing to the lower gross profit margin is that the yield for installment loans and RPAs is\ntypically lower than the yield for the other products we offer. As a result, particularly in periods of higher growth for the installment loan and RPA portfolios, which has been the case in recent years, the gross profit margin is typically lower for this product than for other products, particularly our short-term loan products. Our installment loan and RPA portfolio balance outstanding at December 31, 2019 increased $166.4 million, or 25.1%, compared to December 31, 2018. During 2019, we generally experienced higher gross profit margin than we experienced in the prior year quarters as a result of better credit performance in the installment and RPA portfolios.\nThe following table includes information related only to our installment loans and RPAs and shows our loss experience trends for installment loans for each of the last eight quarters (dollars in thousands):\n\n\n (a) The average loan and finance receivable balance for installment loans is the average of the month-end balances during the period. \n (b) Represents loans originated by third-party lenders through the CSO programs, which are not included in our consolidated balance sheets. \n (c) Non-GAAP measure. \n (d) Allowance and liability for losses as a % of combined loan and finance receivable balance, gross, is determined using period-end balances. \nTotal Expenses\nTotal expenses increased $30.0 million, or 10.2%, to $323.7 million in 2019, compared to $293.7 million in 2018. On a constant currency basis, total expenses increased $30.8 million, or 10.5%, to $30.8 million for 2019 compared to 2018.\nMarketing expense increased $19.1 million, or 20.0%, to $115.1 million in 2019 compared to $96.0 million in 2018, primarily due to higher direct mail, television advertising and digital marketing costs.\nOperations and technology expense increased to $84.3 million in 2019 from $78.4 million in 2018, due primarily to higher underwriting costs primarily related to growth in loan originations and higher selling expense.\nGeneral and administrative expense increased $4.1 million, or 3.9%, to $109.2 million in 2019 compared to $105.1 million in 2018, due primarily to higher corporate services personnel costs, driven primarily by an increase in headcount.\nDepreciation and amortization expense increased to $15.1 million in 2019 compared to $14.2 million in 2018 primarily related to increased amortization on higher capitalized software development costs.\nInterest Expense, Net\nInterest expense, net decreased $3.7 million, or 4.7%, to $75.6 million in 2019 compared to $79.3 million in 2018. The decrease was due to a decrease in the weighted average interest rate on our outstanding debt to 8.61% in 2019 from 9.78% in 2018, partially offset by an increase in the average amount of debt outstanding of $76.4 million to $887.1 million during 2019 from $810.7 million during 2018.The increase in average debt outstanding was due primarily to additional principal amounts outstanding under our securitization facilities and a higher balance of senior note debt resulting from the issuance of $375.0 million in senior notes in September 2018, partially offset by the early pay down of our 9.75% senior notes due 2021. See -Liquidity and Capital Resources-Consumer Loan Securitizations\u201d below for further information.\nProvision for Income Taxes\nThe effective tax rate of 24.7% in 2019 was higher than the effective tax rate of 7.7% in 2018 due primarily to the acceleration of tax deductions in 2018 for prior year loan and fixed asset related deferred tax items, coupled with the overall decrease in the federal tax rate from 35% to 21% resulting from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act which was enacted into law on December 22, 2017.\nThe balance of unrecognized tax benefits recorded in our Consolidated Balance Sheet as of December 31, 2019 was $53.6 million, of which $13.9 million, if recognized, would favorably affect the effective tax rate in the period of recognition. We believe it is reasonably possible that, within the next twelve months, unrecognized domestic tax benefits will change by a significant amount. The principal uncertainties are related to the timing of recognition of income and losses related to our loan and finance receivable portfolio. We are currently under a Joint Committee on Taxation review of certain tax returns that were filed during 2018 in conjunction with the refunds claimed on those returns. Depending upon the outcome of the review and any related agreements or settlements with the relevant taxing authorities, the amount of the uncertainty, including amounts that would be recognized as a component of the effective tax rate, could change significantly. While the total amount of uncertainty to be resolved is not clear, it is reasonably possible that the uncertainties pertaining to this matter will be resolved in the next twelve months.\nYEAR ENDED 2018 COMPARED TO YEAR ENDED 2017\nRevenue and Gross Profit\nRevenue increased $243.7 million, or 33.4%, to $972.6 million for 2018 as compared to $728.9 million for 2017. On a constant currency basis, revenue increased by $247.5 million, or 34.0%, for 2018 compared to 2017. The change in revenue was driven by an increase in revenue of $237.0 million from our domestic operations, primarily resulting from a 38.4% increase in domestic line of credit accounts revenue in 2018 and a 38.2% increase in domestic installment loan and RPA revenue compared to 2017 driven by growth in these products. Additionally, revenue from international operations increased $6.7 million (or an increase of $10.6 million on a constant currency basis), due to a 30.3% increase in international installment loan revenue in 2018 compared to 2017.\nOur gross profit increased by $93.8 million or 25.0% to $469.2 million for 2018 from $375.4 million for 2017. On a constant currency basis, gross profit increased by $95.1 million for 2018 compared to 2017. Our gross profit margin decreased to 48.2% in 2018 from 51.5% in 2017. The decrease in gross profit margin was primarily driven by the strong new customer growth of our installment portfolio resulting in a higher mix of new customers overall, which require higher loss provisions as new customers default at a higher rate than returning customers with a successful history of loan performance. Growth in our near-prime installment portfolio also contributed to the lower gross profit margin, as these products typically have a lower margin than our short-term products.\nThe following table sets forth the components of revenue, separated by product for 2018 and 2017 (dollars in thousands):\n\nLoan and Finance Receivable Balances\nThe outstanding Company-owned portfolio balance of loans and finance receivables, net of allowance and liability for estimated losses, increased $154.7 million, or 24.7%, to $780.1 million as of December 31, 2018 from $625.4 million as of December 31, 2017, and the outstanding combined portfolio balance of loans and finance receivables, net of allowance and liability for estimated losses, increased $150.4 million, or 22.9%, to $807.7 million as of December 31, 2018 from $657.3 million as of December 31, 2017, due primarily to increased demand for our near-prime installment product. The outstanding loan balance for our near-prime product increased 26.7% as of December 31, 2018 compared to December 31, 2017, resulting in a near-prime portfolio balance that comprises approximately 49% of our total loan and finance receivables portfolio balance while short-term loans comprise approximately 7%. See -Non-GAAP Financial Measures-Combined Loans and Finance Receivables\u201d above for additional information related to combined loans and finance receivables.\nThe combined loan and finance receivable balance includes $924.3 million and $733.2 million as of December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively, of our Company-owned receivables balances before the allowance for losses of $144.2 million and $107.8 million provided in the consolidated financial statements for December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. The combined loan and finance receivable balance also includes $29.7 million and $34.1 million as of December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively, of loan and finance receivable balances that are guaranteed by us, which are not included in our consolidated balance sheets, with the exception of the liability for estimated losses of $2.2 million and $2.3 million, which is included in Accounts payable and accrued expenses\u201d as of December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively.\nThe following table summarizes loan and finance receivable balances outstanding as of December 31, 2018 and 2017 (dollars in thousands):\n\n (a) GAAP measure. The loan and finance receivable balances guaranteed by us relate to loans originated by third-party lenders through the CSO programs and are not included in our consolidated balance sheets. \n (b) Except for allowance and liability for estimated losses, amounts represent non-GAAP measures. \nAverage Amount Outstanding per Loan\nThe average amount outstanding per loan is calculated as the total combined loans, gross balance at the end of the period divided by the total number of combined loans outstanding at the end of the period. The following table shows the average amount outstanding per loan by product at December 31, 2018 and 2017:\n\n (a) The disclosure regarding the average amount per loan is statistical data that is not included in our consolidated financial statements. \n (b) Includes loans guaranteed by us, which represent loans originated by third-party lenders through the CSO programs and are not included in our consolidated balance sheets. \n (c) Excludes RPAs. \nThe average amount outstanding per loan increased to $1,753 from $1,581 during 2018 compared to 2017, mainly due to a greater mix of installment loans and line of credit accounts, which have higher average amounts outstanding per loan relative to short-term loans, in 2018 compared to 2017.\nAverage Loan Origination\nThe average loan origination amount is calculated as the total amount of combined loans originated, renewed and purchased for the period divided by the total number of combined loans originated, renewed and purchased for the period. The following table shows the average loan origination amount by product for 2018 compared to 2017:\n\n (a) The disclosure regarding the average loan origination amount is statistical data that is not included in our consolidated financial statements. \n (b) Includes loans guaranteed by us, which represent loans originated by third-party lenders through the CSO programs and are not included in our consolidated balance sheets. \n (c) Represents the average amount of each incremental draw on line of credit accounts. \n (d) Excludes RPAs. \nThe average loan origination amount increased to $603 from $571 during 2018 compared to 2017, mainly due to a greater mix of installment loans, which have a higher origination amount than short-term loans and line of credit accounts.\nLoans and Finance Receivables Loss Experience\nThe allowance and liability for estimated losses as a percentage of loans and RPAs increased to 15.6% as of December 31, 2018 compared to 14.7% as of December 31, 2017, on a Company-owned basis, and 15.3% as of December 31, 2018 compared to 14.3% as of December 31, 2017, on a combined basis, due primarily to a greater concentration of loans to new customers in the installment loan and line of credit account portfolios. New customers require a greater reserve as these loans default at a higher rate than returning customers with a successful history of loan performance.\nThe cost of revenue in 2018 was $503.4 million, which was composed of $503.5 million related to our Company-owned loans and finance receivables partially offset by a $0.1 million decrease in the liability for estimated losses related to loans we guaranteed through the CSO programs. The cost of revenue in 2017 was $353.5 million, which was composed of $353.2 million related to our Company-owned loans and finance receivables, and a $0.3 million increase in the liability for estimated losses related to loans we guaranteed through the CSO programs. Total charge-offs, net of recoveries, were $466.4 million and $334.2 million in 2018 and 2017, respectively.\nThe following tables show loan and finance receivable balances and fees receivable and the relationship of the allowance and liability for losses to the combined balances of loans and finance receivables for each of the last eight quarters (dollars in thousands):\n\n\n (a) Represents loans originated by third-party lenders through the CSO programs, which are not included in our consolidated financial statements. \n (b) Non-GAAP measure. \nLoans and Finance Receivables Loss Experience by Product\nWe evaluate loss rates for all financing products in our portfolio to determine credit quality and evaluate trends. For our products, we evaluate loans and finance receivables losses as a percentage of the average loan and finance receivable balance outstanding or the average combined loan and finance receivable balance outstanding, whichever is applicable, for each portfolio.\nShort-term Loans\nThe allowance and liability for losses as a percentage of combined loan balance in 2018 was fairly consistent with 2017.\nOur gross profit margin for short-term loans is typically highest in the first quarter of each year, corresponding to the seasonal decline in consumer loan balances outstanding. The cost of revenue as a percentage of the average combined loan balance for short-term loans outstanding is typically lower in the first quarter and generally peaks in the second half of the year with higher loan demand.\nThe following table includes information related only to short-term loans and shows our loss experience trends for short-term loans for each of the last eight quarters (dollars in thousands):\n\n\n (a) The average short-term combined loan balance is the average of the month-end balances during the period. \n (b) Represents loans originated by third-party lenders through the CSO programs, which are not included in our consolidated balance sheets. \n (c) Non-GAAP measure. \n (d) Allowance and liability for losses as a % of combined loan balance, gross, is determined using period-end balances. \nLine of Credit Accounts\nThe cost of revenue as a percentage of average loan balance for line of credit accounts exhibits a similar quarterly seasonal trend to short-term loan loss rates as the ratio is typically lower in the first quarter and increases throughout the remainder of the year, peaking in the second half of the year with higher loan demand. The gross profit margin is generally lower for line of credit accounts during periods of growth because the highest levels of default are exhibited in the early stages of the account, while the revenue is recognized over the term of the account.\nDuring 2018, we experienced lower gross profit margin and higher cost of revenue as a percentage of the average combined loan balance for line of credit accounts outstanding than we experienced in the prior year quarters as a result of the strong growth in the line of credit account portfolios.\nThe following table includes information related only to line of credit accounts and shows our loss experience trends for line of credit accounts for each of the last eight quarters (dollars in thousands):\n\n\n (a) The average loan balance for line of credit accounts is the average of the month-end balances during the period. \n (b) Allowance for losses as a % of loan balance is determined using period-end balances. \nInstallment Loans and RPAs\nFor installment loans and RPAs, the cost of revenue as a percentage of average loan and finance receivable balance is typically more consistent throughout the year as compared to short-term loans and line of credit accounts. Due to the scheduled regular payments that are inherent with installment loans and RPAs, we do not experience the higher level of repayments in the first quarter for these receivables as we experience with short-term loans and, to a lesser extent, line of credit accounts.\nSimilar to line of credit accounts, the gross profit margin is generally lower for the installment loan and RPA products than for other products, primarily because the highest levels of default are exhibited in the early stages of the loan or RPA, while revenue is recognized over the term of the loan or estimated delivery term. In addition, installment loans and RPAs typically have higher average amounts per receivable. Another factor contributing to the lower gross profit margin is that the yield for installment loans and RPAs is typically lower than the yield for our other products, particularly short-term products. During 2018, we generally experienced lower gross profit margin than we experienced in the prior year quarters as a result of the continued growth in our near-prime installment and RPA portfolios.\nThe following table includes information related only to our installment loans and RPAs and shows our loss experience trends for installment loans for each of the last eight quarters (dollars in thousands):\n\n\n (a) The average loan and finance receivable balance for installment loans is the average of the month-end balances during the period. \n (b) Represents loans originated by third-party lenders through the CSO programs, which are not included in our consolidated balance sheets. \n (c) Non-GAAP measure. \n (d) Allowance and liability for losses as a % of combined loan and finance receivable balance, gross, is determined using period-end balances. \nTotal Expenses\nTotal expenses increased $34.5 million, or 13.3%, to $293.7 million in 2018, compared to $259.2 million in 2017. On a constant currency basis, total expenses increased $36.3 million, or 14.0%, to $295.5 million for 2018 compared to 2017.\nMarketing expense increased $19.4 million, or 25.3%, to $96.0 million in 2018 compared to $76.6 million in 2017, primarily due to higher direct mail, television advertising, lead purchase and digital marketing costs.\nOperations and technology expense increased to $78.4 million in 2018 from $69.6 million in 2017, due primarily to higher contact center headcount to support our growth and higher underwriting costs primarily related to growth in loan originations.\nGeneral and administrative expense increased $5.4 million, or 5.4%, to $105.1 million in 2018 compared to $99.7 million in 2017, due primarily to higher incentive expenses resulting from our strong financial performance.\nDepreciation and amortization expense increased to $14.2 million in 2018 compared to $13.3 million in 2017 primarily related to software development projects and amortization thereof.\nInterest Expense, Net\nInterest expense, net increased $5.3 million, or 7.2%, to $79.3 million in 2018 compared to $74.0 million in 2017. The increase was due to an increase in the average amount of debt outstanding of $116.2 million to $810.7 million during 2018 from $694.5 million during 2017, partially offset by a decrease in the weighted average interest rate on our outstanding debt to 9.78% in 2018 from 10.63% in 2017.The increase in average debt outstanding was due primarily to additional principal amounts outstanding under our securitization facilities and the issuance of $375.0 million in senior notes in September 2018, partially offset by the early paydown of our 9.75% senior notes due 2021. See -Liquidity and Capital Resources-Consumer Loan Securitizations\u201d below for further information.\nProvision for Income Taxes\nThe effective tax rate of 7.7% in 2018 was lower than the effective tax rate of 10.5% in 2017 due primarily to the estimated tax effects of optimizing the timing of certain income tax deductions in 2018 for prior year loan and fixed asset related deferred tax items, coupled with the overall decrease in the federal tax rate from 35% to 21% resulting from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, which was enacted into law on December 22, 2017.\nLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\nCapital Funding Strategy\nHistorically, we have generated significant cash flow through normal operating activities for funding both long-term and short-term needs. Our near-term liquidity is managed to ensure that adequate resources are available to fund our seasonal working capital growth, which is driven by demand for our loan and financing products, and to meet the continued growth in the demand for our near-prime installment products. On May 30, 2014, we issued and sold $500.0 million in aggregate principal amount of 9.75% senior notes due 2021 (the 2021 Senior Notes\u201d). On September 1, 2017, we issued and sold $250.0 million in aggregate principal amount of 8.50% Senior Notes due 2024 (the 2024 Senior Notes\u201d) and used the net proceeds, in part, to retire $155.0 million in 2021 Senior Notes. On January 21, 2018, we redeemed an additional $50.0 million in principal amount of the outstanding 2021 Senior Notes. On September 19, 2018, we issued and sold $375.0 million in aggregate principal amount of 8.50% Senior Notes due 2025 (the 2025 Senior Notes\u201d) and used the net proceeds, in part, to retire the remaining $295.0 million in principal amount of the outstanding 2021 Senior Notes.\nOn June 30, 2017, we entered into a secured revolving credit agreement (as amended, the Credit Agreement\u201d) which replaced our previous credit agreement that was terminated on June 30, 2017. On April 13, 2018, October 5, 2018 and July 1, 2019, we and certain of our operating subsidiaries entered into amendments to our Credit Agreement, as further described below. As of February 24, 2020, our available borrowings under the Credit Agreement were $28.8 million. Since 2016, we have entered into several consumer loan securitization facilities and offered asset-backed notes to fund our growth, primarily in our near-prime consumer installment loan business, as further described below under Consumer Loan Securitization.\u201d As of February 24, 2019, the outstanding balance under our securitization facilities was $289.2 million. We expect that our operating needs, including satisfying our obligations under our debt agreements and funding our working capital growth, will be satisfied by a combination of cash flows from operations, borrowings under the Credit Agreement, or any refinancing, replacement thereof or increase in borrowings thereunder, and securitization or sale of loans and finance receivables under our consumer loan securitization facilities.\nAs of December 31, 2019, we were in compliance with all financial ratios, covenants and other requirements set forth in our debt agreements. Unexpected changes in our financial condition or other unforeseen factors may result in our inability to obtain third-party financing or could increase our borrowing costs in the future. To the extent we experience short-term or long-term funding disruptions, we have the ability to adjust our volume of lending and financing to consumers and small businesses that would reduce cash outflow requirements while increasing cash inflows through repayments. Additional alternatives may include the securitization or sale of assets, increased borrowings under the Credit Agreement, or any refinancing or replacement thereof, and reductions in capital spending which could be expected to generate additional liquidity.\n8.50% Senior Unsecured Notes Due 2025\nOn September 19, 2018, we issued and sold the 2025 Senior Notes. The 2025 Senior Notes were sold to qualified institutional buyers in accordance with Rule 144A under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the Securities Act\u201d) and outside the United States pursuant to Regulation S under the Securities Act.

Under the 2018-1 Facility, Securitization Receivables are sold to a wholly-owned subsidiary of ours (the 2018-1 Debtor\u201d) and serviced by another subsidiary of ours.\nThe 2018-1 Debtor has issued a revolving note with an initial maximum principal balance of $150.0 million, which is required to be secured by 1.25 times the drawn amount in eligible Securitization Receivables. The 2018-1 Facility is non-recourse to us and matures on July 22, 2023.\nThe 2018-1 Facility is governed by a loan and security agreement, dated as of July 23, 2018, between the 2018-1 Lender and the 2018-1 Debtor. The 2018-1 Facility bears interest at a rate per annum equal to LIBOR (subject to a floor) plus an applicable margin, which rate per annum is initially 4.00%. In addition, the 2018-1 Debtor paid certain customary upfront closing fees to the 2018-1 Lender. Interest payments on the 2018-1 Facility are made monthly. The 2018-1 Debtor is permitted to prepay the 2018-1 Facility, subject to certain fees and conditions. In the event of prepayment for the purposes of securitizations, no fees shall apply. Any remaining amounts outstanding will be payable no later than July 22, 2023, the final maturity date.\nAll amounts due under the 2018-1 Facility are secured by all of the 2018-1 Debtor's assets, which include the Securitization Receivables transferred to the 2018-1 Debtor, related rights under the Securitization Receivables, a bank account and certain other related collateral.\nThe 2018-1 Facility documents contain customary provisions for securitizations, including: representations and warranties as to the eligibility of the Securitization Receivables and other matters; indemnification for specified losses not including losses due to the inability of consumers to repay their loans; covenants regarding special purpose entity matters; and default and termination provisions which provide for the acceleration of the 2018-1 Facility in circumstances including, but not limited to, failure to make payments when due, servicer defaults, certain insolvency events, breaches of representations, warranties or covenants, failure to maintain the security interest in the receivables and defaults under other material indebtedness of the 2018-1 Debtor.\n2016-1 Facility\nOn January 15, 2016, we and certain of our subsidiaries entered into a receivables securitization (as amended, the 2016-1 Securitization Facility\u201d) with certain purchasers, Jefferies Funding LLC, as administrative agent (the 2016-1 Agent\u201d) and Bankers Trust Company, as indenture trustee and securities intermediary (the Indenture Trustee\u201d). The 2016-1 Securitization Facility securitized Securitization Receivables that were originated or acquired under our NetCredit brand and that met specified eligibility criteria. Under the 2016-1 Securitization Facility, Securitization Receivables were sold to a wholly-owned special purpose subsidiary of ours (the 2016-1 Issuer\u201d) and serviced by another subsidiary of ours. The 2016-1 Securitization Facility, as amended on October 20, 2017, provided for a maximum principal amount of $275 million, an initial term note with an with an initial principal amount of $181.1 million and the ability to subsequently issue term notes thereafter, variable funding notes with an aggregate committed availability of $75 million per quarter with an option to increase the commitment to $90 million and a revolving period of the facility ending in April 2019.\nOn October 31, 2018, the 2016-1 Issuer resold a substantial portion of the Securitization Receivables it owned to Enova International, Inc., and used the proceeds to redeem all of the outstanding 2017 Quarterly Term Notes and to repay all amounts owed on the 2017 Variable Funding Notes.\nSubject to certain exceptions, the 2016-1 Issuer was not permitted to prepay or redeem any of the 2016-1 Facility prior to April 15, 2019, but the 2016-1 Agent, the Indenture Trustee, and the holders of the notes agreed to permit an early repayment. On March 29, 2019, the 2016-1 Facility was repaid in full.\n2016-2 Facility\nOn December 1, 2016, we and certain of our subsidiaries entered into a receivables securitization (the 2016-2 Facility\u201d) with Redpoint Capital Asset Funding, LLC, as lender. The 2016-2 Facility securitized Securitization Receivables that were originated or acquired under our NetCredit brand by several of our subsidiaries and that meet specified eligibility criteria, including that the annual percentage rate for each securitized consumer loan was greater than or equal to 90%. Under the 2016-2 Facility, Securitization Receivables were sold to a wholly-owned subsidiary of ours and serviced by another subsidiary of ours. In October 2018, the 2016-2 Facility was repaid in full and there is no remaining amount available to be borrowed.\nRevolving Credit Facility\nOn June 30, 2017, we and certain of our operating subsidiaries entered into a secured revolving credit agreement with a syndicate of banks including TBK Bank, SSB ( TBK\u201d), as administrative agent and collateral agent, Jefferies Finance LLC and TBK as joint lead arrangers and joint lead bookrunners, and Veritex Community Bank (as successor in interest to Green Bank, N.A.), as lender. On April 13, 2018 and October 5, 2018, the Credit Agreement was amended to include Pacific Western Bank and Axos Bank, respectively, as lenders, in the syndicate of lenders. Additionally, on July 1, 2019, the Credit Agreement was amended to, amongst other changes, extend the maturity date to June 30, 2022 from May 1, 2020 and increase the advance rate to 65% from 53%.\nThe Credit Agreement is secured by domestic receivables. The borrowing limit in the Credit Agreement, as amended, is $125 million, and its maturity date is June 30, 2022. We had $72.0 million of borrowings under the Credit Agreement as of December 31, 2019.\nThe Credit Agreement provides for a revolving credit line with interest on borrowings under the facility at prime rate plus 1.00%. In addition, the Credit Agreement provides for payment of a commitment fee calculated with respect to the unused portion of the line, and ranges from 0.30% to 0.50% per annum depending on usage. A portion of the revolving credit facility, up to a maximum of $20 million, is available for the issuance of letters of credit. We had outstanding letters of credit under the Credit Agreement of $1.6 million as of December 31, 2019.\nThe Credit Agreement contains certain limitations on the incurrence of additional indebtedness, investments, the attachment of liens to our property, the amount of dividends and other distributions, fundamental changes to us or our business and certain other of our activities. The Credit Agreement contains standard financial covenants for a facility of this type based on a leverage ratio and a fixed charge coverage ratio. The Credit Agreement also provides for customary affirmative covenants, including financial reporting requirements, and certain events of default, including payment defaults, covenant defaults and other customary defaults.\nCash Flows\nOur cash flows and other key indicators of liquidity are summarized as follows (dollars in thousands):\n\n (a) Total debt to Adjusted EBITDA, a non-GAAP measure, is calculated using Adjusted EBITDA for the twelve months ended for the respective period indicated. See -Non-GAAP Financial Measures-Adjusted EBITDA.\u201d \nCash Flows from Operating Activities\n2019 comparison to 2018\nNet cash provided by operating activities increased $201.1 million, or 33.3%, to $804.6 million for 2019 from $603.5 million for 2018. The increase was driven primarily by overall growth in the business with interest and fees paid by customers outpacing operating cash outflows.\n2018 comparison to 2017\nNet cash provided by operating activities increased $209.4 million, or 53.2%, to $603.5 million for 2018 from $393.9 million for 2017. The increase was driven primarily by overall growth in the business with interest and fees paid by customers outpacing operating cash outflows.\nCash Flows from Investing Activities\n2019 comparison to 2018\nNet cash used in investing activities increased $222.7 million, or 34.4%, for 2019 compared to 2018, due primarily to a $217.1 million increase in net cash invested in loans and finance receivables, due to a 34.2% increase in loans and finance receivables originated or purchased and a $5.4 million increase in purchases of property and equipment.\n2018 comparison to 2017\nNet cash used in investing activities increased $181.2 million, or 38.8%, for 2018 compared to 2017, due primarily to a $180.2 million increase in net cash invested in loans and finance receivables, due to a 39.7% increase in loans and finance receivables originated or purchased.\nCash Flows from Financing Activities\n2019 comparison to 2018\nNet cash provided by financing activities in 2019 was $95.5 million compared to $22.5 million in 2018. Cash flows provided by financing activities for 2019 primarily reflects a net increase of $50.0 million in net borrowings under the Credit Agreement and $80.6 million in net borrowings under our securitization facilities, partially offset by $33.8 million in treasury shares purchased.\nOn September 15, 2017, we announced the Board of Directors had authorized a share repurchase program for the repurchase of up to $25.0 million of our common stock through December 31, 2019 (the 2017 Authorization\u201d). The $25.0 million limit was reached in January 2019, with all share repurchases having been through open market transactions. On January 31, 2019, we announced the Board of Directors had authorized a share repurchase program for the repurchase of up to $50.0 million of our common stock through December 31, 2020. On October 24, 2019, we announced the Board of Directors had authorized a new share repurchase program totaling $75.0 million that expires December 31, 2020. The new program replaced the prior authorization of $50.0 million. During the current year, we paid $31.9 million to repurchase common stock under the share repurchase programs.\n2018 comparison to 2017\nNet cash provided by financing activities in 2018 was $22.5 million compared to $104.6 million in 2017. Cash flows provided by financing activities for 2018 primarily reflects a net increase of $30.0 million in our senior notes facilities, $22.0 million in net borrowings under the Credit Agreement and $15.9 million in net borrowings under our securitization facilities, partially offset by $18.8 million of early termination fees paid in connection with the early payment of our 2021 Senior Notes, $17.3 million in treasury shares purchased and $13.0 million of debt issuance costs paid in connection with the 2025 Senior Notes, the Credit Agreement and the 2018-1, 2018-2 and 2018-A Securitization Facilities.\nCONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS AND COMMITMENTS\nThe following table summarizes our contractual obligations at December 31, 2019, and the effect such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flow in future periods (in thousands):\n\n (a) Revolving credit agreement may be repaid at any time prior to maturity in June 2022; as such, no interest payments have been included in the table. \n (b) Represents obligations under the 2024 Senior Notes and 2025 Senior Notes. \n (c) Represents cash payments for interest on the 2024 Senior Notes and 2025 Senior Notes. \n (d) Securitizations and related interest are not included in maturities by period due to their variable monthly payments. \n (e) Represents obligations due under long-term operating leases. \nThe liability for uncertain tax positions has been excluded due to the high degree of uncertainty regarding the timing of potential future cash outflows. We are unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate of the period of cash settlement with the respective taxing authority.\nOFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS\nIn certain markets, we arrange for consumers to obtain consumer loan products from independent third-party lenders through our CSO programs. For consumer loan products originated by third-party lenders under the CSO programs, each lender is responsible for providing the criteria by which the customer's application is underwritten and, if approved, determining the amount of the consumer loan. We are responsible for assessing whether or not we will guarantee such loan. When a customer executes an agreement with us under our CSO programs, we agree, for a fee payable to us by the customer, to provide certain services to the customer, one of which is to guarantee the customer's obligation to repay the loan received by the customer from the third-party lender if the customer fails to do so. The guarantee represents an obligation to purchase specific loans if they go into default, which generally occurs after one payment is missed. As of December 31, 2019 and 2018, the outstanding amount of active consumer loans originated by third-party lenders under the CSO programs was $27.6 million and $29.7 million, respectively, which were guaranteed by us.\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES\nAllowance and Liability for Estimated Losses on Loans and Finance Receivables\nWe monitor the performance of our loan and finance receivable portfolios and maintain either an allowance or liability for estimated losses on loans and finance receivables (including revenue, fees and/or interest) at a level estimated to be adequate to absorb losses inherent in the portfolio. The allowance for losses on our Company-owned loans and finance receivables reduces the outstanding loans and finance receivables balance in the consolidated balance sheets. The liability for estimated losses related to loans guaranteed under the CSO programs is initially recorded at fair value and is included in Accounts payable and accrued expenses\u201d in the consolidated balance sheets.\nIn determining the allowance or liability for estimated losses on loans and finance receivables, we apply a documented systematic methodology. In calculating the allowance or liability for receivable losses, outstanding loans and finance receivables are divided into discrete groups of short-term loans, line of credit accounts, installment loans and RPAs and are analyzed as current or delinquent. Increases in either the allowance or the liability, net of charge-offs and recoveries, are recorded as a Cost of revenue\u201d in the consolidated statements of income.\nThe allowance or liability for short-term loans classified as current is based on historical loss rates adjusted for recent default trends for current loans. For delinquent short-term loans, the allowance or liability is based on a six-month rolling average of loss rates by stage of collection. For line of credit account, installment loan and RPA portfolios, we generally use either a migration analysis or roll-rate based methodology to estimate losses inherent in the portfolio. The allowance or liability calculation under the migration analysis and roll-rate methodology is based on historical charge-off experience and the loss emergence period, which represents the average amount of time between the first occurrence of a loss event and the charge-off of a loan or RPA. The factors we consider to assess the adequacy of the allowance or liability include past due performance, historical behavior of monthly vintages, underwriting changes and recent trends in delinquency in the migration analysis. The roll-rate methodology is based on delinquency status, payment history and recency factors to estimate future charge-offs.\nWe fully reserve for loans and finance receivables once the receivable or a portion of the receivable has been classified as delinquent for 60 consecutive days and generally charge-off loans and finance receivables between 60 to 65 days delinquent. If a loan or finance receivable is deemed uncollectible before it is fully reserved, it is charged off at that point. Loans and finance receivables classified as delinquent generally have an age of one to 64 days from the date any portion of the receivable became delinquent, as defined above. Recoveries on loans and finance receivables previously charged to the allowance are credited to the allowance generally when collected.\nGoodwill\nGoodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired in each business combination. In accordance with Accounting Standards Codification ( ASC\u201d) 350, Goodwill, we test goodwill for potential impairment annually as of June 30 and between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value below its carrying amount.\nWe first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is necessary to perform the two-step quantitative goodwill impairment test. In assessing the qualitative factors, we consider relevant events and circumstances including but not limited to macroeconomic conditions, industry and market environment, our overall financial performance, cash flow from operating activities, market capitalization and stock price. If we determine that the two-step quantitative impairment test is required, we use the income approach to complete our annual goodwill assessment. The income approach uses future cash flows and estimated terminal values that are discounted using a market participant perspective to determine the fair value, which is then compared to the carrying value to determine if there is impairment. The income approach includes assumptions about revenue growth rates, operating margins and terminal growth rates discounted by an estimated weighted-average cost of capital derived from other publicly-traded companies that are similar from an operational and economic standpoint. We completed our annual assessment of goodwill as of June 30, 2019 based on qualitative factors and determined that the fair value of our goodwill exceeded carrying value, and, as a result, no impairment existed at that date. A 10% decrease in the estimated fair value for the June 2019 assessment would not have resulted in a goodwill impairment.\nIncome Taxes\nWe account for income taxes under ASC 740, Income Taxes. As part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements, we are required to estimate income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate. This process involves estimating the actual current tax expense together with assessing temporary differences in recognition of income for tax and accounting purposes. These differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities and are included within the consolidated balance sheets. We must then assess the likelihood that the deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and, to the extent we believe that recovery is not\nlikely, we must establish a valuation allowance. An expense or benefit is included within the tax provision in the consolidated statement of income for any increase or decrease in the valuation allowance for a given period.\nWe report our loans and finance receivables in the Company's tax returns at fair market value, which differs from how we report them in the consolidated financial statements. Changes in the fair market value of our loans and finance receivables as determined for tax purposes may have a significant impact on the timing and amount of how income taxes are recognized in the consolidated financial statements. The estimates of fair market value are dependent on multiple assumptions, including expected credit losses and discount rates.\nWe perform an evaluation of the recoverability of our deferred tax assets on a quarterly basis. We establish a valuation allowance if it is more-likely-than-not (greater than 50 percent) that all or some portion of the deferred tax asset will not be realized. We analyze several factors, including the nature and frequency of operating losses, our carryforward period for any losses, the reversal of future taxable temporary differences, the expected occurrence of future income or loss and the feasibility of available tax planning strategies to protect against the loss of deferred tax assets.\nWe account for uncertainty in income taxes in accordance with ASC 740, which requires that a more-likely-than-not threshold be met before the benefit of a tax position may be recognized in the consolidated financial statements and prescribes how such benefit should be measured. We must evaluate tax positions taken on our tax returns for all periods that are open to examination by taxing authorities and make a judgment as to whether and to what extent such positions are more likely than not to be sustained based on merit. We record interest and penalties related to tax matters as income tax expense in the consolidated statement of income.\nOur judgment is required in determining the provision for income taxes, the deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance recorded against deferred tax assets. Our judgment is also required in evaluating whether tax benefits meet the more-likely-than-not threshold for recognition under ASC 740.\nRECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS\nRefer to Note 1 in
