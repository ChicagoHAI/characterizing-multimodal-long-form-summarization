Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nYou should read the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations together with our financial statements and related notes appearing elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, or this Annual Report. In addition to historical information, this discussion and analysis contains forward-looking statements that involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions. Our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of certain factors. We discuss factors that we believe could cause or contribute to these differences below and elsewhere in this report, including those set forth under Item 1A. \"Risk Factors\" and under \"Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\" in this Annual Report.\nOverview\nWe are a commercial-stage biopharmaceutical company with a portfolio of innovative, best-in-class therapies to improve the lives of patients with debilitating neurological and neuropsychiatric diseases, including rare disorders. Our Neuroinnovation portfolio includes FDA-approved NURTEC ODT (rimegepant) for the acute and preventive treatment of migraine and a broad pipeline of product candidates across five distinct mechanistic platforms: calcitonin gene related peptide (\"CGRP\") receptor antagonism, glutamate modulation, myeloperoxidase (\"MPO\") inhibition, Kv7 Ion Channel Activators (\"Kv7\"), and Myostatin.\nOur clinical-stage milestones include the following:\nTable 8: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Drug Name </td> <td>Indication </td> <td>1H2021 </td> <td>2H2021 </td> <td>1H2022 </td> <td>2H2022 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>Migraine prevention </td> <td>Approval </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Migraine acute/prevention </td> <td>Europe Filing 1Q </td> <td> </td> <td>EU Positive Opinion </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Migraine acute (China/South Korea) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Topline </td> <td>China/Korea Filing </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Zavegepant\nSmall molecule/NCE\n</td> <td>Migraine (intranasal) </td> <td> </td> <td>Topline </td> <td>US Filing </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Migraine (oral) </td> <td>Start Phase 3 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Troriluzole\nNCE prodrug of riluloze\n</td> <td>Spinocerebellar ataxia </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Expected Topline </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder ( OCD\u201d) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Complete Enrollment </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Verdiperstat\nNCE oral MPO inhibitor\n</td> <td>Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (\"ALS\") </td> <td> </td> <td>Complete Enrollment </td> <td> </td> <td>Expected Topline\n(Mid-2022) </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Taldefgrobep Alfa\nAnti-myostatin adnectin\n</td> <td>Spinal Muscular Atrophy (\"SMA\") </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Start Phase 3 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>BHV- 7000\nKv7 channel modulator\n</td> <td>Focal seizures </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Clinic Start </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>BHV-1100\nARM combo\n</td> <td>Multiple Myeloma </td> <td> </td> <td>Start Phase 1 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Milestone Achieved </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nCGRP Platform\nIn July 2016, we acquired exclusive, worldwide rights to our CGRP receptor antagonist platform, including rimegepant and zavegepant (previously known as BHV-3500 and vazegepant), through a license agreement, as amended, with Bristol-Myers Squibb Company ( BMS\u201d). In December 2020, Sosei Heptares and Biohaven entered a global collaboration and license agreement (the \"Heptares Agreement\") under which Biohaven received exclusive global rights to develop, manufacture and commercialize a portfolio of novel, small-molecule CGRP receptor antagonists discovered\nby Sosei Heptares for the treatment of CGRP-mediated disorders.\nRimegepant\nThe most advanced product candidate from our CGRP receptor antagonist platform is rimegepant, an orally available, potent and selective small molecule human CGRP receptor antagonist that we have developed for the acute and preventive treatment of migraine. During the second quarter of 2019, we submitted NDAs for the acute treatment of migraine to\nthe FDA for the Zydis ODT and tablet formulations of rimegepant. The NDA submission for the Zydis ODT formulation of rimegepant was submitted using an FDA priority review voucher, purchased in March 2019, providing for an expedited 6-month review. The Zydis ODT formulation of rimegepant (NURTEC ODT) was approved by the FDA for the acute treatment of migraine on February 27, 2020 and was available by prescription in U.S. pharmacies on March 12, 2020. During the fourth quarter of 2020, we submitted an sNDA for the preventive treatment of migraine to the FDA for NURTEC ODT. The FDA approved NURTEC ODT for the preventive treatment of episodic migraine on May 27, 2021.\nWe remain focused on investing in long-term success by driving new-to-brand prescriptions, and ultimately market share, in this rapidly growing oral CGRP market and are continuing to observe a positive return on investment with increasing physician advocacy and attracting a greater pool of patients. We believe that the rapid adoption of NURTEC ODT is evidence of significant unmet need among people with migraine and an associated large acute and preventive therapy market opportunity. We continue to expand commercial payer coverage, with NURTEC ODT now covered by insurance providers reflecting 89% of commercial lives.\nA summary of key rimegepant studies is described below.\nStudy 301/Study 302\nIn March 2018, we announced positive topline data from our first two pivotal Phase 3 trials ( Study 301 and Study 302\u201d) for the acute treatment of migraine. In each trial, treatment with a single 75 mg dose of rimegepant met the co-primary efficacy endpoints of the trial, which were superior to placebo, at two hours post-dose, on measures of pain freedom and freedom from the patient's most bothersome symptom (\"MBS\"). In addition to achieving both co-primary endpoints in each of the trials, rimegepant also was observed to be generally safe and well-tolerated in the trials, with a safety profile similar to placebo. The co-primary endpoints achieved in the Phase 3 trials were consistent with regulatory guidance from the FDA and provided the basis for the submission of an NDA to the FDA.\nStudy 303\nA third Phase 3 clinical trial for the acute treatment of migraine with a bioequivalent ODT formulation of rimegepant was commenced in February 2018. On December 3, 2018, we announced positive topline data from this randomized, controlled Phase 3 clinical trial ( BHV3000-303\u201d or Study 303\u201d) evaluating the efficacy and safety of our Zydis ODT formulation of rimegepant for the acute treatment of migraine. Rimegepant differentiated from placebo on the two co-primary endpoints using a single dose, pain freedom and freedom from the MBS at two hours. In total, rimegepant was significantly differentiated from the placebo in the first 21 consecutive primary and\nsecondary outcome measures that were pre-specified. Patients treated with the rimegepant Zydis ODT formulation began to numerically separate from placebo on pain relief as early as 15 minutes, and this difference was statistically significant at 60 minutes. Additionally, a significantly greater percentage of patients treated with rimegepant Zydis ODT returned to normal functioning by 60 minutes and lasting clinical benefit compared to placebo was observed through 48 hours after a single dose of rimegepant on freedom from pain, pain relief, freedom from the MBS, and freedom from functional disability. The safety and tolerability observations of rimegepant in Study 303 were consistent with our previous observations. The overall rates of adverse events were similar to placebo (13.2% with respect to rimegepant compared to 10.5% with placebo). The co-primary endpoints achieved in the Phase 3 trials were consistent with regulatory guidance from the FDA and formed the basis of efficacy data required by the FDA for approval.\nStudy 305\nIn November 2018, we initiated a double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase 3 clinical trial examining regularly scheduled dosing of rimegepant 75 mg to evaluate its efficacy and safety as a preventive therapy for migraine ( BHV3000-305\u201d or Study 305\u201d). In March 2020 we announced positive topline results from this study. Rimegepant 75 mg, dosed every other day, demonstrated statistically significant superiority, compared to placebo, on the primary endpoint of reduction in the mean number of migraine days per month in both episodic and chronic migraine patients. The safety profile seen in the 370 patients who received rimegepant 75 mg every other day was consistent with prior clinical trial experience. With this trial, rimegepant has become the only CGRP targeted therapy to demonstrate efficacy in both the acute and preventive treatment of migraine. An sNDA for rimegepant for prevention of migraine was filed with the FDA and accepted for review in the fourth quarter of 2020. The FDA approved NURTEC ODT for the preventive treatment of migraine on May 27, 2021.\nPediatric Study Plan\nIn June 2019, the FDA agreed to our Pediatric Study Plan for the acute treatment of migraine. The pediatric program for the acute treatment of migraine was initiated in the fourth quarter of 2020.\nTrigeminal Neuralgia\nIn the second quarter of 2019, we initiated a Phase 2 proof of concept trial to evaluate the safety and efficacy of rimegepant in patients with treatment refractory trigeminal neuralgia. Trigeminal neuralgia is a chronic facial pain syndrome characterized by paroxysmal, severe, and lancinating episodes of pain in the distribution of one or more branches of the trigeminal nerve. The trigeminal nerve, or fifth cranial nerve, is the largest of the 12 cranial nerves and\nprovides sensory innervation to the head and neck, as well as motor innervation to the muscles of mastication. These episodic bouts of severe facial pain can last seconds to minutes, occur several times per day, and often result in significant disability. Over the long-term course of the disease, symptoms often become refractory to medical therapy and current treatment options remain suboptimal.\nPlaque Psoriasis\nIn the fourth quarter of 2020, we announced a collaboration with Weill Cornell Medicine's Dr. Richard Granstein, Chairman of Dermatology, to initiate an investigator-led clinical trial, which will explore whether treatment with one of our CGRP-receptor antagonists will reduce the severity of disease and percentage of area affected as measured by patients' Psoriasis Activity Severity Index (PASI) score after 16 weeks of treatment as compared to placebo. In addition, the study will assess the potential impact on itch and patient quality-of-life measures. Psoriasis is a chronic and painful autoimmune disease characterized by red patches of dry, cracked skin that may bleed, itch, and burn that affects approximately 7- 8 million people in the U.S.\nRhinosinusitis\nIn February 2022, we announced that we have begun enrollment in a Phase 2/3 clinical trial assessing the safety and efficacy of NURTEC ODT 75mg in patients with chronic rhinosinusitis (\"CRS\") with or without nasal polyps. CRS is a symptomatic inflammation of the paranasal sinuses and nasal cavity lasting more than 12 weeks. CRS typically manifests as facial pain/pressure/fullness, nasal obstruction (congestion), nasal discharge, and/or a decreased sense of smell. Both preclinical and human studies have indicated that increased CGRP levels are associated with CRS, and suggest that blocking CGRP receptors with NURTEC ODT may have beneficial effects for those suffering from CRS. We expect to enroll approximately 200 patients in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial across approximately 25 sites in the U.S. Researchers will evaluate acute symptomatic treatment with rimegepant in patients with chronic rhinosinusitis with and without nasal polyps. The primary outcome measure is the change in a patient's facial pain/pressure/fullness score on a Numerical Rating Scale (0-10). The trial will also assess the safety and tolerability of rimegepant.\nTemporomandibular Disorder\nIn the first quarter of 2022, we received Study May Proceed\u201d communications from the FDA regarding our proposed clinical trial for the use of NURTEC ODT in temporomandibular disorder (\"TMD\"). TMD is a disorder of the jaw muscles, temporomandibular joints, and the nerves associated with chronic facial pain. We expect to commence a clinical trial during the first quarter of 2022.\nInternational Health Authority Interactions\nScientific advice for rimegepant for acute and preventive migraine treatment was received from the CHMP, a committee of the European Medicines Agency, in June and December 2018, respectively. In the first quarter of 2021, we submitted the MAA for rimegepant dual activity, inclusive of acute and prevention of migraine. In February 2022, we were notified that CHMP adopted a positive opinion, recommending the granting of a marketing authorization in the EU for rimegepant 75 mg (available as an orally dissolving tablet), intended for the prophylaxis and acute treatment of migraine. If approved, VYDURA (rimegepant) will be the commercial name for rimegepant in the EU. The full indication for VYDURA is the acute treatment of migraine with or without aura in adults and preventive treatment of episodic migraine in adults who have at least four migraine attacks per month. We expect to receive determination regarding our Marketing Authorization Application in the EU for rimegepant in the first half of 2022.\nFilings in Israel and the Middle East began in 2020. In March 2021, we received approval for rimegepant in Israel and the UAE for the acute treatment of migraine. In the fourth quarter of 2021, we received approval for rimegepant in Israel for the preventive treatment of episodic migraine in adults and in Kuwait for the acute treatment of episodic migraine in adults. We expect further approvals in 2022.\nWith respect to Japan, we have engaged the Pharmaceuticals and Medical Devices Agency (\"PMDA\") on a path forward, and initiation of Phase 2/3 bridging studies are anticipated to begin mid-2022.\nIn January 2019, we and our subsidiary, BioShin (Shanghai) Consulting Services Company Ltd. ( BioShin Shanghai\u201d), a Shanghai based limited liability company, jointly announced that the National Medical Products Administration ( NMPA,\u201d formerly, the China FDA) had accepted the IND application for rimegepant for the treatment of migraine. As previously announced, BioShin Shanghai was established to develop and potentially commercialize our late-stage migraine and neurology portfolio in China and other Asia-Pacific markets. Following the results of Study 303, we submitted a second IND application to the NMPA for the Zydis ODT formulation of rimegepant for the acute treatment of migraine. The IND application for the Zydis ODT formulation of rimegepant was accepted by the NMPA in the fourth quarter of 2019. In September 2020, BioShin Limited (\"BioShin\"), our subsidiary and the parent organization of BioShin Shanghai, raised $60.0 million in series A funding (the \"Bioshin Funding\") which is being used to build out BioShin in China and advance our clinical portfolio in the Asia-Pacific region.\nIn November 2020, BioShin initiated a double-blind, randomized Phase 3 clinical trial evaluating the safety and efficacy of NURTEC ODT (rimegepant) for the acute treatment of migraine in China and South Korea.\nIn February 2022, we announced positive topline results from the study. The study met its co-primary endpoints of freedom from pain (p<0.0001) and freedom from MBS including either nausea, phonophobia or photophobia (p<0.0001) at 2-hours following a single oral dose of rimegepant. The early onset and durable 48 hour efficacy observed in China and South Korea is consistent with previous clinical trial results. In addition to the positive results on the co-primary endpoints, NURTEC ODT demonstrated rapid onset efficacy that was superior to placebo on multiple clinically important outcomes, including: pain relief at 2 hours (p < 0.0001); normal functioning at 2 hours post-dose (p<0.0001); no need for rescue medication within 24 hrs of dosing (p < 0.0001), and showed lasting efficacy with sustained pain freedom from 2 through 24 hours (p < 0.0001) and sustained pain freedom from 2 through 48 hours (p < 0.0001). Initial analysis of topline data indicates NURTEC ODT was numerically advantaged compared to placebo on multiple early-onset measures, including: pain relief within 45 minutes and freedom from MBS within 45 minutes; return to normal function within 60 min; and pain freedom within 90 min. Rimegepant also showed a favorable safety and tolerability profile among study participants that was consistent with prior clinical trial results in the United States. Detailed data from the study will be presented at future medical meetings to help inform ongoing and future research. We expect to submit an NDA during the second half of 2022.\nPursuant to the terms of our Collaboration Agreement with Pfizer, we will continue to perform development activities required for the regulatory approval of rimegepant and zavegepant in all countries outside of the U.S. (\"the Territory\"). The development activities are to be performed under a mutually agreed-upon development plan. In addition, Pfizer has the right to conduct certain development activities in the Territory and will be the marketing authorization holder in all countries in the Territory where permitted under applicable law.\nZavegepant\nBHV-3500, formerly \"vazegepant\", is now referred to as \"zavegepant\" (za ve' je pant). The World Health Organization (WHO) International Nonproprietary Names (INN) Expert Committee revised the name to \"zavegepant\" which was accepted by the United States Adopted Names Council for use in the U.S. and is pending formal adoption by the INN for international use.\nAcute Treatment of Migraine\nAdministration of intranasal zavegepant in a Phase 1 clinical trial was initiated in October 2018 and achieved targeted therapeutic exposures. We advanced zavegepant into a Phase 2/3 trial to evaluate its efficacy for the acute treatment of migraine in the first quarter of 2019. We believed that intranasal zavegepant could provide an ultra-rapid onset of action that could be used in a complementary fashion with other migraine\ntreatments when the speed of onset is critical to a patient and/or for patients experiencing severe nausea and/or vomiting symptoms. In December 2019, we announced positive topline results from the Phase 2/3 trial. Zavegepant 10 and 20 mg was statistically superior to placebo on the co-primary endpoints of pain freedom and freedom from the MBS at two hours using a single dose.\nIn January 2021, we announced the initiation of the Phase 3 clinical trial for the use of intranasal zavegepant for the acute treatment of migraine and in December 2021, we announced top-line results. The results of the study showed that zavegepant was statistically superior to placebo on the co-primary endpoints of pain freedom (24% vs 15%, p <.0001) and freedom from most bothersome symptom (40% vs 31%, p = 0.0012) at 2 hours. Zavegepant was superior to placebo demonstrating pain relief as early as 15 minutes, with patients achieving return to normal function as early as 30 minutes after dosing (p < 0.006). The efficacy benefits of zavegepant were durable, including superiority versus placebo (p < 0.05) on: sustained pain freedom 2 to 24 hours; sustained pain freedom 2 to 48 hours; sustained pain relief 2 to 24 hours; and sustained pain relief 2 to 48 hours. Based upon these results, combined with our prior positive Phase 2/3 trial, we plan to proceed with regulatory submissions in the United States and other countries and expect to submit an NDA for zavegepant with the FDA in the first half of 2022.\nPreventative Treatment of Migraine\nIn September 2020, we announced that the FDA authorized the initiation of clinical trials for oral zavegepant and that we had achieved first in human dosing in a Phase 1 trial designed to assess the safety and pharmacokinetics of oral formulations of zavegepant. In March 2021, we announced that our Phase 2/3 clinical program to assess the efficacy of oral zavegepant in the preventive treatment of migraine began enrollment. The Phase 2/3 trial is ongoing with results expected in the second half of 2022.\nCOVID-19\nIn April 2020, we announced our plan to study intranasal zavegepant in pulmonary complications of COVID-19 disease. The IND was approved by the Division of Pulmonary, Allergy, and Critical Care at FDA in April 2020, and a Phase 2 trial began in April 2020 in collaboration with Thomas Jefferson University and other academic medical institutions. The clinical trial will assess the potential benefits of CGRP receptor-blockade in mitigating an excessive immune response which in some cases can be fatal in COVID-19 patients.\nAsthma\nIn October 2021, we began enrollment in a Phase 1b, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of oral zavegepant for the treatment of subjects with mild allergic asthma. Enrollment in the trial is ongoing.\nNext Generation CGRP Receptor Antagonists\nSeveral clinical candidates are being developed through a global collaboration and license agreement between Biohaven and Sosei Heptares. Under the agreement, Biohaven received exclusive global rights to develop, manufacture and commercialize a portfolio of novel, small-molecule CGRP receptor antagonists discovered by Sosei Heptares for the treatment of CGRP-mediated disorders.\nBHV-3100, previously known as HTL0022562, was developed successfully through preclinical trials by Sosei Heptares and demonstrated promising and differentiated properties in target CGRP-mediated disorders. During the fourth quarter of 2021, we decided to stop development of BHV-3100 based upon its emerging preclinical profile and will instead advance one of the portfolio's backup compounds in its place.\nGlutamate Platform\nThe most advanced product candidate from our glutamate receptor antagonist platform is troriluzole (previously referred to as trigriluzole and BHV-4157), which is in multiple Phase 3 trials. Other product candidates include BHV-5500 which is an antagonist of the glutamate N-methyl-D-aspartate ( NMDA\u201d) receptor.\nTroriluzole\nAtaxias\nWe are developing troriluzole for the treatment of ataxias; our initial focus has been spinocerebellar ataxia (\"SCA\"). We have received both orphan drug designation and fast track designation from the FDA for troriluzole for the treatment of SCA. A Phase 3 trial began enrollment in March 2019 to evaluate the efficacy of troriluzole in SCA. We believe that the non-statistically significant clinical observations from our first Phase 2/3 trial and open-label extension phase in SCA support our decision to advance troriluzole into a Phase 3 trial that could provide the data needed to serve as the basis for an NDA. We completed enrollment in the Phase 3 trial of troriluzole in SCA in the first quarter of 2021. Results are expected in the first half of 2022.\nOther Indications\nA Phase 2/3 double-blind, randomized, controlled trial to assess the efficacy of troriluzole in OCD commenced in December 2017. The Phase 2/3 study results were announced in June 2020. Troriluzole 200 mg administered once daily as adjunctive therapy in OCD patients with inadequate response to standard of care treatment showed consistent numerical improvement over placebo on the Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale (Y-BOCS) at all study timepoints (weeks 4 to 12) but did not meet the primary outcome measure at week 12 (p = 0.22 at week 12), including significant improvement at week 8 (p < 0.05). Troriluzole was well tolerated with a safety profile consistent with past\nclinical trial experience. Given the strong signal in the Phase 2/3 proof of concept study and after receiving feedback from the FDA in an End of Phase 2 meeting, in December 2020 we initiated enrollment in the Phase 3 program. Two Phase 3 studies are currently ongoing with results expected in the second half of 2022.\nIn addition, a Phase 2/3 double-blind, randomized, controlled trial of troriluzole in the treatment of mild-to-moderate Alzheimer's disease was advanced with the Alzheimer's Disease Cooperative Study, a consortium of sites funded by the National Institutes of Health. In January 2021, topline data from the trial revealed that troriluzole did not statistically differentiate from placebo at 48 weeks on the study's prespecified co-primary endpoints on the Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-Cognitive Subscale and the Clinical Dementia Rating Scale Sumo of Boxes in study participants with mild-to-moderate AD. Troriluzole also did not differentiate from placebo on the key secondary measure of hippocampal volume assessed by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in the overall population. A subgroup analysis consisting only of mild AD patients did, however, reveal that troriluzole exhibited a nonsignificant numerical difference of a potential benefit at week 48 on both the ADAS-cog and hippocampal volumetric MRI. Although the numerical effects on the ADAS-cog and hippocampal MRI measured in mild AD patients suggests a potential biologic effect of troriluzole in patients with early stage disease, additional analyses and biomarker data will be informative and help determine whether any further study in early AD is warranted. With regard to safety and tolerability, treatment with troriluzole at a dose of 280 mg once daily was relatively well tolerated and demonstrated a safety profile consistent with previous studies of troriluzole. In December 2021, we completed an ongoing long-term extension study of troriluzole in AD for mild AD patients.\nIn December 2021, the Global Coalition for Adaptive Research (\"GCAR\") selected troriluzole for evaluation in Glioblastoma Adaptive Global Innovative Learning Environment - NCT03970447 (\"GBM AGILE\"). GBM AGILE is a revolutionary patient-centered, adaptive platform trial for registration that tests multiple therapies for patients with newly-diagnosed and recurrent glioblastoma (\"GBM\"), the most fatal form of brain cancer. Troriluzole will be evaluated in all patient subgroups of the trial which include newly-diagnosed methylated MGMT, newly-diagnosed unmethylated MGMT, and recurrent GBM. Troriluzole was selected for inclusion in GBM AGILE based on compelling evidence showing deregulation of glutamate in GBM. The therapeutic potential of troriluzole in GBM and other oncology indications is supported by several recent clinical and translational research studies conducted with troriluzole and its active moiety.\nInternational Development\nIn the third quarter of 2020, BioShin raised $60.0 million in series A funding (the \"Bioshin Funding\") which\nwill be used to build out BioShin Limited in China and advance our clinical portfolio in the Asia-Pacific region, including initiating sites in China to participate in the global registrational trial of troriluzole in SCA.In December 2021, in connection with entering into the Collaboration Agreement with Pfizer,we merged Bioshin into a Biohaven subsidiary. BioShin completed enrollment for the SCA trial in China in the first quarter of 2021 with results expected in the first half of 2022.\nBHV-5000 and BHV-5500\nWe are developing BHV-5500, a low-trapping NMDA receptor antagonist. One potential target indication includes Complex Regional Pain Syndrome ( CRPS\u201d). CRPS is a rare, chronic pain condition typically affecting limbs and triggered by traumatic injury. Accompanying symptoms also include chronic inflammation and reduced mobility in the affected areas. Other disorders of interest include post-herpetic neuralgia and diabetic peripheral neuralgia. We acquired worldwide rights to BHV-5000 and BHV-5500 under an exclusive license agreement with AstraZeneca AB in October 2016. We selected a lead formulation at the end of 2017 and completed single dosing in a Phase 1 clinical trial of BHV-5000 in January 2018 to evaluate its pharmacokinetic properties. Results from nonclinical studies limiting clinical dose of BHV-5000 have led us to focus on BHV-5500 (lanicemine). Current work is focused on formulation development.\nMPO Platform\nVerdiperstat\nWe are developing verdiperstat (previously BHV-3241), an oral myeloperoxidase inhibitor for the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases. One target indication is MSA, a rare, rapidly progressive and fatal neurodegenerative disease with no cure or effective treatments. Verdiperstat has received orphan drug designation for the treatment of MSA from both the FDA and the European Medicines Agency. In addition, Fast Track status was granted by the FDA in March 2020 for verdiperstat for the treatment for MSA. A Phase 3 trial began enrollment in July 2019 to evaluate the efficacy of verdiperstat in MSA. In September 2021, we announced results from a focused analysis of a clinical trial of verdiperstat in MSA. Verdiperstat did not statistically differentiate from placebo on the prespecified primary efficacy measure, nor on the key secondary efficacy measures. Initial analysis of safety data was consistent with the overall profile of verdiperstat from prior clinical trial experience. Additional analyses are still pending, and full study results will be presented at an upcoming scientific meeting.\nAnother potential target indication is ALS. In September 2019, we announced that verdiperstat was selected to be studied in the Phase 3 HEALEY ALS Platform Trial, which is being conducted by the Sean M. Healey & AMG Center for ALS at Massachusetts General Hospital in collaboration with the Northeast ALS\nConsortium ( NEALS\u201d) clinical trial network. Promising investigational drugs were chosen for the HEALEY ALS Platform Trial through a competitive process, with the Healey Center providing partial financial support to successful applicants. The Phase 3 HEALEY ALS Platform Trial of verdiperstat began enrollment in July 2020. Enrollment in the trial was completed in November of 2021, with results expected in mid-2022.\nVerdiperstat was progressed through Phase 2 clinical trials by AstraZeneca. Seven clinical studies have been completed by AstraZeneca, including four Phase 1 studies in healthy subjects, two Phase 2a studies in subjects with Parkinson's disease, and one Phase 2b study in subjects with MSA. We have entered into an exclusive license agreement with AstraZeneca for the product candidate.\nKv7 Platform\nBHV-7000\nIn February 2022, we announced that we entered into a definitive agreement with Channel Biosciences, LLC, a subsidiary of Knopp Biosciences, LLC, to acquire a Kv7 channel targeting platform, adding the latest advances in ion-channel modulation to our growing neuroscience portfolio. BHV-7000 (formerly known as KB-3061) is the lead asset from the Kv7 platform and is a potentially best-in-class potassium channel activator with a profile suggestive of a wide therapeutic index, high selectivity, and significantly reduced GABA-ergic activity. We intend to bring BHV-7000 to the clinic in in 2022 in preparation for a development program in focal epilepsy.\nMyostatin Platform\nTaldefgrobep Alfa License Agreement\nIn February 2022, following the transfer of intellectual property we announced that we entered into a worldwide license agreement with BMS for the development and commercialization rights to taldefgrobep alfa (also known as BMS-986089), a novel, Phase 3-ready anti-myostatin adnectin. Myostatin is a natural protein that limits skeletal muscle growth, an important process in healthy muscular development. However, in patients with neuromuscular diseases, active myostatin can critically limit the growth needed to achieve developmental and functional milestones. Myostatin inhibition is a promising therapeutic strategy for enhancing muscle mass and strength in a range of pediatric and adult neuromuscular conditions. Taldefgrobep is a muscle-targeted treatment for neuromuscular disease and offers the opportunity for combination therapy. We plan to initiate a Phase 3 clinical trial of taldefgrobep in SMA in 2022. SMA is a rare, progressively debilitating motor neuron disease in which development and growth of muscle mass are compromised, resulting in progressive weakness and muscle atrophy, reduced motor function, impaired quality of life and often death. The in-licensing of taldefgrobep expands our portfolio of innovative, late-stage product candidates for the treatment of\nneurologic, neuroinflammatory, and psychiatric indications.\nBiohaven Labs\nKleo Pharmaceuticals, Inc. and Biohaven Labs\nIn January 2021, we acquired the remaining approximately 58% of Kleo that we did not previously own. We have assumed Kleo's laboratory facilities located in Science Park in New Haven, Connecticut and formed Biohaven Labs to serve as the integrated chemistry and discovery research arm of Biohaven. Biohaven Labs will continue several existing Kleo discovery partnerships, including one with the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation for the development of a of a SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing therapy for COVID-19 and one with PeptiDream for the development of immuno-oncology therapeutics (See Note 6).\nBiohaven's proprietary Multimodal Antibody Therapy Enhancer (\"MATE\") conjugation technology uses a new class of synthetic peptide binders to target the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 that are then selectively conjugated to commercially available intravenous immunoglobulin. The Biohaven synthetic binders for SARS-CoV2 were designed to establish a much wider area and number of contacts with the spike protein that other agents like monoclonal antibodies. In February 2021, we announced that BHV-1200, developed with Biohaven's proprietary MATE platform, has demonstrated functional binding and neutralization of the SARS-CoV-2 virus, including the strains known as the \"English\" and \"South African\" variants (also known as B.1.1.7 and B.1.351, respectively). The preliminary experiments conducted by Biohaven Labs and an academic collaborator demonstrated that BHV-1200 substantially reduced viral entry into cells. We intend to advance BHV-1200 into a full clinical development program. Accelerated development of the COVID-19 MATE program has been supported by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. In addition, the in vitro data indicated that BHV-1200 may activate important immune system components including antibody-dependent cellular phagocytosis and antibody dependent cellular cytotoxicity. We believe our proprietary MATE-conjugation technology could also be used against other infectious diseases by changing the targeting moiety of its antibody binders.\nOption and License Agreement with the University of Connecticut\nIn October 2018, we entered into an exclusive, worldwide option and license agreement (the \"UConn Agreement\") with the University of Connecticut (\"UConn\") for the development and commercialization rights to UC1MT, a therapeutic antibody targeting extracellular MT. Under this agreement, we have the option to acquire an exclusive, worldwide license to UC1MT and its underlying patents to develop and commercialize throughout the world in all human indications. If we choose to exercise the option, we would be obligated to pay UConn milestone\npayments upon the achievement of specified regulatory and commercial milestones, and royalties of a low single-digit percentage of net sales of licensed products.\nFox Chase Chemical Diversity Center, Inc.\nIn May 2019, we entered into an agreement with Fox Chase Chemical Diversity Center Inc. ( FCCDC\u201d) for FCCDC's TDP-43 assets (the FCCDC Agreement\u201d). The FCCDC Agreement provides us with a plan and goal to identify one or more new chemical entity candidates for preclinical development for eventual clinical evaluation for the treatment of one or more TDP-43 proteinopathies. In connection with the FCCDC Agreement, Biohaven and FCCDC have established a TDP-43 Research Plan that provides for certain milestones to be achieved by FCCDC, and milestone payments to be made by us (See Note 14).\nSosei Heptares\nIn November 2020, we entered into a global collaboration and license agreement with Sosei Heptares, an international biopharmaceutical group focused on the discovery and early development of new medicines originating from their proprietary GPCR-targeted StaR technology and structure-based drug design platform capabilities. Under the agreement, Sosei Heptares will be eligible to receive development, regulatory and commercialization milestone payments, as well as tiered royalties on net sales of products resulting from the collaboration. In return, we will receive exclusive global rights to develop, manufacture and commercialize a portfolio of novel, small-molecule CGRP receptor antagonists discovered by Sosei Heptares for the treatment of CGRP-mediated disorders (See Note 14).\nArtizan Biosciences, Inc.\nIn December 2020, we entered into an Option and License Agreement with Artizan Biosciences Inc (\"Artizan\"), a biotechnology company focused on addressing inflammatory diseases involving the human intestinal microbiota. Pursuant to the agreement, we acquired an option to obtain a royalty-based license from Artizan to manufacture, use and commercialize certain products. Artizan will use the proceeds to continue advancing the preclinical research and development of its lead program for inflammatory bowel disease, which is anticipated to enter the clinic in 2022, as well as to explore additional disease targets (See Note 14). In November 2021, we announced a collaborative therapeutic discovery and development program in Parkinson's disease (PD), to exploit recent scientific advances in the understanding of pathogenic roles played by the gut microbiome in PD\nBHV-1100\nIn the fourth quarter of 2021, Biohaven initiated a Phase 1a/1b trial in multiple myeloma patients using its antibody recruiting molecule (ARM) BHV-1100 in combination with autologous cytokine induced memory-\nlike (CIML) natural killer (NK) cells and immune globulin (IG) to target and kill multiple myeloma cells expressing the cell surface protein CD38. BHV-1100 is the lead clinical asset from Biohaven's Antibody Recruiting Molecule (ARM\u2122) Platform developed from a strategic alliance with PeptiDream Inc. (TYO: 4587). This clinical trial will assess the safety and tolerability as well as exploratory efficacy endpoints in newly diagnosed multiple myeloma patients who have tested positive for minimal residual disease (MRD+) in first remission prior to autologous stem cell transplant (ASCT).\nReliant Glycosciences, LLC\nIn July 2021, Biohaven entered into a development and license agreement with Reliant Glycosciences, LLC (\"Reliant\") for collaboration on a program with Biohaven Labs' multifunctional molecules to develop and commercialize conjugated antibodies for therapeutic uses relating to IgA nephropathy and treatment of other diseases and conditions. Under the Agreement, Reliant was entitled to an upfront share payment and will be eligible to receive development milestone payments and royalties of net sales of licensed products (See Note 14).\nKU Leuven\nIn January 2022, we entered into the KU Leuven Agreement to develop and commercialize first-in-class TRPM3 antagonists to address the growing proportion of people worldwide living with chronic pain disorders. The TRPM3 antagonist platform was discovered at the Centre for Drug Design and Discovery and the Laboratory of Ion Channel Research at KU Leuven. Under the KU Leuven Agreement, we receive exclusive global rights to develop, manufacture and commercialize KU Leuven's portfolio of small-molecule TRPM3 antagonists. The portfolio includes the lead candidate, henceforth known as BHV-2100, which has demonstrated promising efficacy in preclinical pain models and will be the first to advance towards Phase 1 studies. We will support further basic and translational research at KU Leuven on the role of TRPM3 in pain and other disorders (See Note 14).\nRecent Developments\nThe following is a summary of key developments affecting our business in 2021.\nPfizer Collaboration Agreement\nIn November 2021, we entered into the Collaboration Agreement with Pfizer, pursuant to which Pfizer would commercialize the Licensed Products in all countries worldwide outside of the United States. In consideration thereof, in January 2022 Pfizer made an upfront payment of $150.0 million to Biohaven upon receipt of the requisite regulatory approvals needed for the effectiveness of the Collaboration Agreement. In addition, in January 2022 Pfizer purchased $350.0 million worth of Biohaven common shares at approximately $173.05 per share, equal to 125% of the volume weighted average price per share for the 20\nconsecutive trading days prior to the signing. We will be eligible to receive an aggregate additional $740.0 million in contingent payments based on specified commercial and sales-based milestones for the Licensed Products.\nWe are also entitled to tiered, escalating royalties from the upper teens to twenty percent of net sales of Licensed Products in the Territory. In general, Pfizer's obligation to pay royalties continues on a product-by-product and country-by-country basis until the latest of ten years after the first commercial sale of such product in such country, the expiration of the patent rights covering such product in such country or the expiration of the period of exclusivity applicable to such product in such country. In addition to the upfront payments, contingent payments and royalties described above, Pfizer will also compensate us for a pro-rata share of certain of its sales-based milestone obligations owed to BMS under the BMS License, and related net sales royalties owed to BMS and RPI that result from Pfizer's commercialization and sale, respectively, of the Licensed Products in the Territory.\nMerger Agreement with BioShin\nOn November 9, 2021, we entered into an agreement and plan of merger (the Merger Agreement\u201d) with BioShin. The Merger Agreement provides for the merger of a wholly owned indirect subsidiary of the Company with and into BioShin, with BioShin surviving the merger as a wholly owned indirect subsidiary of the Company (the BioShin Merger\u201d). As a result of the satisfaction of the closing conditions described in the Merger Agreement, on January 6, 2022, each Series A convertible preferred share of BioShin, no par value, other than Excluded Shares (as defined in the Merger Agreement), was converted into the right to receive 0.080121 of a Company common share.\nAmendments to the Sixth Street Financing Agreement\nIn August 2020, the Company and Biohaven Pharmaceuticals, Inc., our wholly-owned subsidiary (together with the Company, the \"Borrowers\"), entered into a financing agreement, as amended, with Sixth Street Specialty Lending, Inc., as administrative agent, and the lenders party thereto (the \"Lenders\") pursuant to which the Lenders agreed to extend a senior secured credit facility to us providing for term loans in an aggregate principal amount up to $500.0 million, plus any capitalized interest paid in kind. In September 2021, the Borrowers, and certain other of our subsidiaries entered into Amendment No. 2 (the Second Amendment\u201d) to the financing agreement (as previously amended and as amended by the Second Amendment, the Sixth Street Financing Agreement\u201d). Pursuant to the Second Amendment, the parties agreed to, among other things, increase the size of the credit facility by providing for additional term loans in an aggregate principal amount of $250.0 million for a total facility size of $750.0 million plus any capitalized interest paid in kind. The facility consists of drawn amounts for an initial\nterm loan of $275.0 million that the Borrowers drew at closing in August 2020 (the \"Initial Term Loan\"), $125.0 million drawn in August 2021 (the \"DDTL-2\"), and $125.0 million (the \"2021 Term Loan\") and $100.0 million (the \"DDTL-1\") both drawn in September 2021. The remaining $125.0 million delayed draw term loan commitments (the \"2021 DDTL Commitment\") was available to be drawn by the Borrowers until December 31, 2021 (the \"Delayed Draw Term Loan Commitment Termination Date\"). In November 2021, the Company entered into Amendment No. 3 and Limited Consent to Financing Agreement ( the Third Amendment and Limited Consent\u201d) to our Sixth Street Financing Agreement. Pursuant to the Third Amendment and Limited Consent, the lenders consented to the Company's entry into the Collaboration Agreement with Pfizer. In December 2021, we entered into Amendment No. 4 (the \"Fourth Amendment\") to the Sixth Street Financing Agreement, which extended the Delayed Draw Term Loan Commitment Termination Date to June 30, 2022. For additional details please refer to \"Liquidity and Capital Resources\" and Note 14, \"Debt.\"\nArtizan Biosciences Inc.\nIn December 2020, we entered into a Series A-2 Preferred Stock Purchase Agreement with Artizan Biosciences Inc. (\"Artizan\") (Note 14). Under the agreement, we paid Artizan 61,494 shares valued at $6.0 million, which were issued in January 2021. In exchange, we acquired 34,472,031 shares of series A-2 preferred stock of Artizan.\nYale MoDE Agreement\nOn January 1, 2021, we entered into a worldwide, exclusive license agreement for the development and commercialization of a novel Molecular Degrader of Extracellular Protein (MoDEs) platform based on ground-breaking research conducted in the laboratory of Professor David Spiegel at Yale University (Note 14). Under the agreement, we paid Yale University an upfront cash payment of $1.0 million and 11,668 shares valued at $1.0 million, both of which were included in research and development expense in the consolidated statements of operations.\nConsulting Agreement with Moda Pharmaceuticals LLC\nOn January 1, 2021, we entered into a consulting services agreement with Moda Pharmaceuticals LLC to further the scientific and commercial advancement of technology, drug discovery platforms, product candidates and related intellectual property owned or controlled by us (Note 14). Under the agreement, we paid Moda an upfront cash payment of $2.7 million and 37,836 shares valued at $3.2 million, both of which were included in research and development expense in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss.\nKU Leuven Agreement\nIn January 2022, Biohaven and Katholieke Universiteit Leuven (\"KU Leuven\") entered into an Exclusive License and Research Collaboration Agreement (the \"KU Leuven Agreement\") to develop and commercialize first-in-class TRPM3 antagonists to address the growing proportion of people worldwide living with chronic pain disorders. The TRPM3 antagonist platform was discovered at the Centre for Drug Design and Discovery (\"CD3\") and the Laboratory of Ion Channel Research (\"LICR\") at KU Leuven. Under the KU Leuven Agreement, Biohaven receives exclusive global rights to develop, manufacture and commercialize KU Leuven's portfolio of small-molecule TRPM3 antagonists. The portfolio includes the lead candidate, henceforth known as BHV-2100, which has demonstrated promising efficacy in preclinical pain models and will be the first to advance towards Phase 1 studies. Biohaven will support further basic and translational research at KU Leuven on the role of TRPM3 in pain and other disorders. As consideration, KU Leuven received an an upfront cash payment of $3.0 million and 15,340 shares valued at $1.8 million, and is eligible to receive additional development, regulatory, and commercialization milestones payments of up to $327.8 million. In addition, KU Leuven will be eligible to receive mid-single digit royalties on net sales of products resulting from the collaboration.\nKv7 Platform Acquisition\nIn February 2022, we announced that we entered into a definitive agreement with Channel Biosciences, LLC, a subsidiary of Knopp Biosciences, LLC, to acquire a Kv7 channel targeting platform, adding the latest advances in ion-channel modulation to our growing neuroscience portfolio. BHV-7000 (formerly known as KB-3061) is the lead asset from the Kv7 platform and is a potentially best-in-class potassium channel activator with a profile suggestive of a wide therapeutic index, high selectivity, and significantly reduced GABA-ergic activity. We intend to bring BHV-7000 to the clinic in in 2022 in preparation for a development program in focal epilepsy. In consideration for the transaction, we will make an upfront payment comprised of $65 million in Biohaven common shares and $35 million in cash to Knopp Biosciences. We have also agreed to make additional success-based earnout payments (i) up to $325 million based on BHV-7000 developmental and regulatory epilepsy milestones through approvals in the US, EU and Japan, (ii) up to an additional $250 million based on developmental and regulatory milestones for the Kv7 pipeline development in other indications and additional country approvals, and (iii) up to $562.5 million for commercial sales-based milestones of BHV-7000. Biohaven has also agreed to make scaled royalty payments for BHV-7000 and the pipeline programs, starting at high single digits and peaking at low teens for BHV-7000 and starting at mid-single digits and peaking at low double-digits for the pipeline programs.\nTaldefgrobep Alfa Platform License\nIn February 2022, following the transfer of intellectual property we announced that we entered into a worldwide license agreement with BMS for the development and commercialization rights to taldefgrobep alfa, a novel, Phase 3-ready anti-myostatin adnectin. The in-licensing of taldefgrobep expands our portfolio of innovative, late-stage product candidates for the treatment of neurologic, neuroinflammatory, and psychiatric indications. Under the terms of the agreement, we will receive worldwide rights to taldefgrobep alfa and BMS will be eligible for regulatory approval milestone payments, as well as tiered, sales-based royalty percentages from the high teens to the low twenties (Note 14). We plan to initiate a Phase 3 clinical trial of taldefgrobep alfa in SMA in 2022.\nCOVID-19 Update\nA novel strain of coronavirus (COVID-19) was first identified in Wuhan, China in December 2019, and subsequently declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization. To date, COVID-19 has surfaced in nearly all regions around the world and resulted in travel restrictions and business slowdowns or shutdowns in affected areas.\nAlthough, as of the date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we do not expect any material impact on our long-term activity, the extent to which COVID-19 impacts our business will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted, including new information which may emerge concerning the severity of COVID-19 and the actions to contain COVID-19 or treat its impact, among others, including government-imposed quarantines, travel restrictions and other public health safety measures.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic may impair our commercialization of NURTEC ODT. The spread of COVID-19 may reduce demand for NURTEC ODT. In response to regional quarantines, health professionals may reduce staffing and reduce or postpone appointments with patients, or patients may cancel or miss appointments, resulting in less prescriptions of NURTEC ODT than projected, thereby adversely affecting our revenues. In addition, in connection with the recent FDA approval of NURTEC ODT, we have been making presentations to physicians regarding the efficacy of NURTEC ODT but as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, we have needed to and may continue to need to conduct some or all of these key meetings with medical professionals solely by virtual means instead of in-person, which could reduce the number of medical professionals we are able to present to, and we cannot guarantee that any such virtual meetings will be as successful as in-person meetings. Moreover, restrictions on travel and transport may result in disruptions in NURTEC ODT distribution. Such events may result in a period of business disruption, and in reduced operations, any of which could materially affect\nour business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe continued spread of COVID-19 could also adversely impact our clinical trial operations. For example, we may be unable to enroll or retain an adequate number of patients to commence or complete our clinical trials, data may be missing, the FDA may delay or terminate clinical trials for any of our product candidates, or primary outcome measures may be impacted. As a result, our ability to generate product revenue from sales of any of those product candidates may be delayed or not realized at all.\nBusiness interruptions from the current or future pandemics may also adversely impact the third parties we rely on to sufficiently manufacture NURTEC ODT and to produce our product candidates in quantities we require, which may impair the commercialization of NURTEC ODT and our research and development activities.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic and responses to its spread have negatively impacted the global economy, disrupted global supply chains, and created significant volatility and disruption of financial markets. This significant disruption of the global financial markets could reduce our ability to access equity or debt capital on attractive terms if at all, which in turn could negatively affect our liquidity. In addition, a recession or market correction resulting from the spread of COVID-19 could materially affect our business and the value of our common shares.\nWe have taken numerous steps, and will continue to take further actions, in our approach to addressing the COVID-19 pandemic. We have implemented internal controls to contemplate a remote work environment and our incident management teams are in place to respond to changes in our work environment quickly and effectively. As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, we have instructed most of our employees to work from home. In April 2020, we announced a collaboration with Cove in order to facilitate telemedicine evaluation for migraine sufferers while patients are increasingly looking to remote evaluations during this time of unprecedented decreased access to routine office visits.\nWe continue to monitor the rapidly evolving situation and guidance from international and domestic authorities, including federal, state and local public health authorities and may take additional actions based on their recommendations. In these circumstances, there may be developments outside our control requiring us to adjust our operating plan. As such, given the dynamic nature of this situation, we cannot reasonably estimate the impacts of COVID-19 on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nComponents of Our Results of Operations\nProduct Revenues, Net\nWe began to recognize revenue from product sales, net of rebates, chargebacks, discounts and other adjustments, in March 2020 in conjunction with the launch of our first product, NURTEC ODT. We will continue to evaluate trends related to revenue momentum for NURTEC ODT, including any discernible impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic. If our development efforts for our other product candidates are successful and result in regulatory approval, or additional license agreements with third parties, we may generate additional revenue in the future from product sales.\nCost of Goods Sold\nCost of goods sold includes direct and indirect costs related to the manufacturing and distribution of NURTEC, including third-party manufacturing costs, packaging services, freight-in, third-party royalties payable on our net product revenues and amortization of intangible assets associated with NURTEC ODT.\nOperating Expenses\nResearch and Development Expenses\nResearch and development expenses consist primarily of costs incurred in connection with the development of our product candidates. We expense research and development costs as incurred. These expenses include:\n\u2022expenses incurred under agreements with contract research organizations ( CROs\u201d) or contract manufacturing organizations ( CMOs\u201d), as well as investigative sites and consultants that conduct our clinical trials, preclinical studies and other scientific development services;\n\u2022manufacturing scale-up expenses and the cost of acquiring and manufacturing preclinical and clinical trial materials and commercial materials, including manufacturing validation batches;\n\u2022employee-related expenses, including salaries, benefits, travel and non-cash share-based compensation expense for employees engaged in research and development functions;\n\u2022costs related to compliance with regulatory requirements;\n\u2022development milestone payments incurred prior to regulatory approval of the product candidate;\n\u2022payments made in cash, equity securities or other forms of consideration under third-party licensing agreements prior to\nregulatory approval of the product candidate; and\nWe recognize external development costs based on an evaluation of the progress to completion of specific tasks using estimates of our clinical personnel or information provided to us by our service providers.\nOur external direct research and development expenses are tracked on a program-by-program basis for our product candidates and consist primarily of external costs, such as fees paid to outside consultants, CROs, contract manufacturing organizations, and central laboratories in connection with our preclinical development, process development, manufacturing and clinical development activities. Our direct research and development expenses by program also include fees and certain development milestones incurred under license agreements. We do not allocate employee costs or other indirect costs, to specific programs because these costs are deployed across multiple programs and, as such, are not separately classified. We use internal resources primarily to oversee the research and development as well as for managing our preclinical development, process development, manufacturing and clinical development activities. Many employees work across multiple programs, and we do not track personnel costs by program.\nProduct candidates in later stages of clinical development generally have higher development costs than those in earlier stages of clinical development, primarily due to the increased size and duration of later-stage clinical trials. As a result, we expect that our research and development expenses will remain significant over the next several years as we increase personnel costs conduct clinical trials and prepare regulatory filings for our product candidates. We also expect to incur additional expenses related to milestone and royalty payments payable to third parties with whom we have entered into license agreements to acquire the rights to our product candidates.\nThe successful development and commercialization of our product candidates is highly uncertain. At this time, we cannot reasonably estimate or know the nature, timing and costs of the efforts that will be necessary to complete the preclinical and clinical development of any of our product candidates or when, if ever, material net cash inflows may commence from any of our product candidates. This uncertainty is due to the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with product development and commercialization, including the uncertainty of:\n\u2022the scope, progress, outcome and costs of our preclinical development activities, clinical trials and other research and development activities;\n\u2022establishment of an appropriate safety profile with IND-enabling studies;\n\u2022successful patient enrollment in, and the initiation and completion of, clinical trials;\n\u2022the timing, receipt and terms of any marketing approvals from applicable regulatory authorities;\n\u2022establishment of commercial manufacturing capabilities or making arrangements with third-party manufacturers;\n\u2022development and timely delivery of commercial-grade drug formulations that can be used in our clinical trials and for commercial launch;\n\u2022acquisition, maintenance, defense and enforcement of patent claims and other intellectual property rights;\n\u2022significant and changing government regulation;\n\u2022initiation of commercial sales of our product candidates, if and when approved, whether alone or in collaboration with others; and\n\u2022maintenance of a continued acceptable safety profile of the product candidates following approval.\nSelling, General and Administrative Expenses\nSelling, general and administrative expenses consist primarily of personnel costs, including salaries, benefits and travel expenses for our executive, commercial, finance, business, commercial, corporate development and other administrative functions; and non-cash share-based compensation expense. Selling, general and administrative expenses also include facilities and other related expenses, including rent, depreciation, maintenance of facilities, insurance and supplies; professional fees for expenses incurred under agreements with third parties relating to the commercialization of NURTEC ODT; and for public relations, audit, tax and legal services, including legal expenses to pursue patent protection of our intellectual property.\nWe anticipate that our selling, general and administrative expenses, including payroll and related expenses, will remain significant in the future as we continue to expand our operations and organizational capabilities, continue to support our commercial activities associated with NURTEC ODT, and prepare for potential commercialization of our product candidates, if successfully developed and approved. We also anticipate increased expenses associated with general operations, including costs related to accounting and legal services, director and officer insurance premiums, facilities and other corporate infrastructure and office-related costs, such as information technology costs.\nOther Income (Expense)\nInterest Expense\nInterest expense primarily consists of interest on our outstanding term loan with Sixth Street Specialty Lending, Inc., which includes interest expense on the outstanding loan balance, accretion of the debt discount and amortization of issuance costs. Our interest expense also includes implied interest on our finance leases associated with our commercial car fleet. We utilize the effective interest method to determine our interest expense on the term loan and finance leases and the straight-line method for the amortization of the debt issuance costs.\nInterest Expense on Mandatorily Redeemable Preferred Shares\nInterest expense on mandatorily redeemable preferred shares is being recognized in connection with the issuance of series A preferred shares and series B preferred shares pursuant to the Series A preferred share purchase agreement and Series B preferred shares forward contracts we entered into with RPI. Since we are required to redeem the series A preferred shares for 2x the original purchase price in equal quarterly installments by December 31, 2024 and the series B preferred shares for 1.77x the original purchase price in equal installments beginning on March 31, 2025 and ending December 31, 2030, we concluded that the Series A preferred shares and Series B preferred shares are mandatorily redeemable instruments and initially classified the preferred shares at their fair value as a liability. Interest expense on the mandatorily redeemable preferred shares represents the accretion of the carrying value of the preferred shares liability to its redemption value using the effective interest rate method.\nChange in Fair Value of Derivatives\nThe fair value of the derivative liability recognized in connection with contingent payments under the Series A Preferred Share Agreement is determined using the with-and-without valuation method. As inputs into the valuation, we considered the type and probability of occurrence of certain events, the amount of the payments, the expected timing of certain events, and a risk-adjusted discount rate. In accordance with ASC 815, Derivatives and Hedging, the fair value of the derivative is recorded on the consolidated balance sheet as a Series A preferred derivative liability with changes in fair value recorded in other income (expense) in the consolidated statements of operations.\nThe fair value of the derivative liability recognized in connection with the Series B Preferred Shares Forward Contracts is determined using discounted cash flow and Monte Carlo valuation methods. As inputs into the valuation, we considered the probability of occurrence of certain change of control events, the amount of the payments, the expected timing of certain events, and a risk-adjusted discount rate. In accordance\nwith ASC 815, Derivatives and Hedging, the fair value of the derivative is recorded on the consolidated balance sheet as a Series B preferred shares forward contact with changes in fair value recorded in other income (expense) in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss.\nInterest Expense on Liability Related to Sale of Future Royalties\nWe have accounted for the 2018 RPI Funding Agreement and a unit of accounting of the 2020 RPI Funding Agreement with RPI Trust both as liability financings, primarily because they have significant continuing involvement in generating the future revenue on which the royalties are based. The liabilities related to sale of future royalties and the related non-cash interest expense are measured based on our current estimate of the timing and amount of future royalties expected to be paid over the estimated terms of the 2018 RPI Funding Agreement and 2020 RPI Funding Agreement. The liabilities are amortized using the effective interest rate method, resulting in recognition of non-cash interest expense over the estimated term of the agreement. Each reporting period, we assess the estimated timing and amount of future expected royalty payments over the estimated terms. If there is a change to one of the estimates, we recognize the impact to the liability's amortization schedule and the related non-cash interest expense prospectively. Our estimate of the amount of expected future royalties to be paid considers the probability of success of compounds not yet approved for sale, and market penetration rates, compliance rate, and net pricing of both NURTEC ODT and compounds not yet approved for sale. Additionally, the transaction costs associated with the liabilities will be amortized to non-cash interest expense over the estimated term of the 2018 RPI Funding Agreement and 2020 RPI Funding Agreement, respectively.\nGain (Loss) from Equity Method Investment\nPrior to our acquisition of Kleo in January 2021, we owned approximately 42% of the outstanding shares as of December 31, 2020, and accounted for our investment in Kleo under the equity method of accounting. As a result, our proportionate share of Kleo's net income or loss each reporting period was included in other income (expense), net, in our consolidated statement of operations and results in a corresponding adjustment to the carrying value of the equity method investment on our consolidated balance sheet.\nOn January 4, 2021, we acquired the rest of the shares of Kleo, and post-transaction we own 100% of the outstanding shares of Kleo.\nProvision for Income Taxes\nAs a company incorporated in the British Virgin Islands ( BVI\u201d), we are principally subject to taxation in the BVI. Under the current laws of the BVI, tax on a company's income is assessed at a zero percent tax rate. As a result, we have not recorded any income tax\nbenefits from losses incurred in the BVI during each reporting period, and no net operating loss carryforwards will be available to us for those losses. We have historically outsourced all of the research and clinical development for our programs under a master services agreement with our wholly owned subsidiary, Biohaven Pharmaceuticals, Inc., a Delaware corporation ( BPI\u201d). As a result of providing services under this agreement and profit from US commercial sales of NURTEC ODT, BPI was profitable during the year ended December 31, 2021, and BPI is subject to taxation in the United States.\nIn August 2020, we completed an intra-entity asset transfer of certain of our intellectual property to our Irish subsidiary. As a result of the transfer, we recorded a deferred tax asset of $875.0 million for the step up in tax basis received pursuant to Irish tax law. Based on our analysis of all available objective evidence, we concluded that it was more likely than not that the deferred tax asset from the intra-entity transfer will not be realized due to the lack of net operating income history of our subsidiary. Therefore, we established a full valuation allowance against our net deferred tax asset in Ireland.\nWe continue to maintain a valuation allowance against our US deferred tax assets. We periodically review our position and have determined that a full valuation allowance on these assets was appropriate due to excess research and development (\"R&D\") credit carryforwards as of December 31, 2021. We will continue to evaluate the need for a valuation allowance on our deferred tax assets until there is sufficient positive evidence to support the reversal of all or some portion of these allowances. We anticipate the commercialization of NURTEC ODT will result in future earnings and believe sufficient positive evidence may become available to allow us to reach a conclusion that a significant portion, or all, of the valuation allowance will no longer be needed. Release of the valuation allowance would result in the recognition of certain deferred tax assets and a decrease to income tax expense for the period the release is recorded. However, the exact timing and amount of the valuation allowance release is subject to change on the basis of the level of profitability that we are able to actually achieve.\nIn January 2021, we completed the acquisition of Kleo. The acquisition and inclusion of Kleo did not result in a material impact on the provision for income taxes or the effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2021. We recorded a full valuation allowance against our Kleo US deferred tax assets and will periodically review our position and have determined that a full valuation allowance on these assets was appropriate due to Kleo's cumulative loss history. We will continue to evaluate the need for a valuation allowance on our deferred tax assets until there is sufficient positive evidence to support the reversal of all or some portion of these allowances.\nWe recorded an income tax provision during the year ended December 31, 2021 of $5.1 million which primarily represents certain state taxes for the period and US federal taxes due to general business credit limitations.\nResults of Operations\nComparison of the Years Ended December 31, 2021 and 2020\nThe following table summarizes our results of operations for the years ended

commercial launch in the U.S. in March 2020. Net product revenue was $462.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, compared to $63.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. The increase of $398.9 million in net product revenues was due to both increased NURTEC ODT sales volume and improvements in net price realization due to decreases in sales allowances in 2021, compared to 2020, and a full year of NURTEC ODT sales during 2021 compared to a partial period of NURTEC ODT sales in 2020. Sales allowances and accruals mostly consisted of patient affordability programs, distribution fees and rebates.\nCost of Goods Sold\nCost of goods sold of $91.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 is primarily related to\nroyalties on net sales payable to BMS under a license agreement, manufacturing costs for NURTEC ODT, certain distribution costs and amortization of intangible assets related to milestone payments to BMS and Catalent. The increase of $74.0 million in cost of goods sold was primarily due to increased NURTEC ODT sales during the year ended December 31, 2021, compared to the year ended December 31, 2020, which had no material manufacturing costs included as the majority of the costs were incurred prior to FDA approval and as such recorded as research and development expense.\nResearch and Development Expenses Table 10: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Year Ended December 31, </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>In thousands </td> <td> </td> <td>2021 </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>Change </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Direct research and development expenses by program: </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Rimegepant </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>65,394 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>53,838 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>11,556 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Troriluzole </td> <td> </td> <td>50,637 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>42,127 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>8,510 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Zavegepant </td> <td> </td> <td>54,717 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>36,836 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>17,881 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Verdiperstat </td> <td> </td> <td>34,518 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>24,987 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>9,531 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other programs </td> <td> </td> <td>4,329 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>383 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3,946 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Unallocated research and development costs: </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Personnel related (including non-cash share-based compensation) </td> <td> </td> <td>105,182 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>52,248 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>52,934 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Preclinical research programs </td> <td> </td> <td>29,031 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>12,092 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>16,939 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other </td> <td> </td> <td>17,532 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6,487 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>11,045 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total research and development expenses </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>361,340 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>228,998 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>132,342 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nR&D expenses, including non-cash share-based compensation costs, were $361.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, compared to $229.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. The increase of $132.3 million was primarily due to:\n\u2022a $52.9 million increase in personnel costs, driven by a $28.4 million increase in share-based compensation expense, as well as increases in headcount, merit increases and bonuses;\n\u2022increased expenses from later stage trials in our zavegepant programs of $17.9 million, which included a partial offset related to a $30.8 million reduction in our obligation to perform R&D services for zavegepant; and\n\u2022increases in preclinical research costs of $16.9 million, which included upfront payments of $2.0 million to Yale University in connection with a license agreement, $5.9 million to Moda Pharmaceuticals LLC in connection with a consulting agreement, and $3.7 million to Reliant Glycosciences, LLC in connection with a development and license agreement;\n\u2022increases in direct costs of $11.6 million, $9.5 million and $8.5 million for our rimegepant, verdiperstat and troriluzole programs, respectively, in 2021; and\n\u2022increases of $11.0 million in various other unallocated R&D costs.\nSelling, General and Administrative Expenses\nSG&A expenses, including non-cash share-based compensation costs, were $713.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, compared to $462.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. The increase of $251.2 million was primarily due to increased spending to support the continued launch of NURTEC ODT, including the launch of NURTEC ODT for the\npreventative treatment of migraine which was approved by the FDA in May of 2021. The increased spending included increases in marketing and advertising expenses, professional fees and non-cash share based compensation. Less than half of the SG&A expense was for commercial organization personnel costs, excluding non-cash share-based compensation expense. The increase of $41.3 million in non-cash share based compensation expense was primarily due to our annual equity incentive awards that were granted in the first quarter of 2021.\nOther Income (Expense), Net\nOther income (expense), net was a net expense of $139.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, compared to net expense of $113.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. The increase of $26.3 million in net expense was primarily due to increased interest expense on our term loans with Sixth Street, which were drawn in the third quarter of 2020 and the third quarter of 2021, an increase in the interest expense recognized on our liability related to the sale of future royalties, and increased interest expense on our liability related to the mandatorily redeemable preferred shares resulting from the sale of Series A Preferred Shares to RPI in April 2019. These increases were partially offset by a change in gain (loss) on equity investment of $9.4 million, primarily due to the acquisition of Kleo Pharmaceuticals, Inc. in the first quarter of 2021, and a $16.5 million decrease in expense related to changes in the fair value of our derivatives.\nProvision for Income Taxes\nWe recorded a provision for income taxes of $5.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, compared to a provision for income taxes of $10.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. The tax provision recorded for the year ended December 31, 2021 was primarily attributable to our profitable operations in the United States during the year.\nComparison of the Years Ended December

following the approval of NURTEC ODT by the FDA on February 27, 2020 and its subsequent commercial launch in the U.S. in March 2020. During the year ended December 31, 2020, we recognized $63.6 million of net product revenues related to sales of NURTEC ODT. Sales allowances and accruals mostly consisted of co-pay card discounts, distribution fees and rebates.\nCost of Goods Sold\nCost of goods sold of $17.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 is related to royalties on net sales payable to BMS under a license agreement (see Note 17 \"Commitments and Contingencies\" to our consolidated financial statements), product costs\nincurred after FDA approval, certain distribution costs and amortization of intangible assets related to milestone payments to BMS and Catalent, Inc. (\"Catalent\"). See Note 14 \"License and Other Agreements\" to our consolidated financial statements. Prior to receiving initial FDA approval for NURTEC ODT on February 27, 2020, we manufactured NURTEC ODT inventory to be sold upon commercialization and recorded all costs incurred as research and development expense. As a result, the manufacturing costs related to the NURTEC inventory build-up incurred before FDA approval were already expensed in a prior period and are therefore excluded from the cost of goods sold for the year ended December 31, 2020. These previously expensed costs were not material for the year ended December 31, 2020. The inventory build-up incurred before FDA approval was sold prior to the start of the fourth quarter of 2020.\nResearch and Development Expenses Table 12: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Year Ended December 31, </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>In thousands </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>Change </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Direct research and development expenses by program: </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>BHV-0223\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>172 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>849 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(677) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Troriluzole </td> <td> </td> <td>42,127 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>37,812 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4,315 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Rimegepant </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Priority review voucher </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>105,000 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(105,000) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Program expenses' </td> <td> </td> <td>53,838 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>88,948 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(35,110) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Zavegepant </td> <td> </td> <td>36,836 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>44,821 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(7,985) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>BHV-5000 </td> <td> </td> <td>211 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>850 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(639) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Verdiperstat </td> <td> </td> <td>24,987 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>10,922 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>14,065 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Unallocated research and development costs: </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Personnel related (including share-based compensation) </td> <td> </td> <td>52,248 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>45,683 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6,565 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Preclinical research programs </td> <td> </td> <td>12,092 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6,193 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5,899 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other </td> <td> </td> <td>6,487 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3,595 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,892 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total research and development expenses </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>228,998 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>344,673 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(115,675) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nResearch and development expenses including one-time regulatory and license fees were $229.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to $344.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The decrease of $115.7 million was primarily due to:\n\u2022one-time $105.0 million purchase of a priority review voucher to expedite the regulatory review of rimegepant ODT formulation in the second quarter of 2019;\n\u2022filing fees of $7.6 million related to our rimegepant NDA submissions to the FDA in the second quarter of 2019;\n\u2022development milestones payable to BMS of $11.5 million for rimegepant NDA submissions in 2019;\n\u2022non-cash research and development expense of $5.6 million due to issuance of common shares in the second quarter of 2019 relating to the collaborative discovery program with Fox Chase;\n\u2022decreases in direct costs of $8.0 million for our zavegepant program, mainly due to expenses for development milestones payable to BMS of $10.0 million in 2019;\n\u2022increases in direct costs of $4.3 million for our troriluzole program in 2020, which include increases for our OCD, and Alzheimer's Disease trials;\n\u2022increases in direct costs of $14.1 million for our verdiperstat program in 2020; and\n\u2022increases in personnel costs of $6.6 million mainly due to an increase of $8.4 million in non-\ncash share-based compensation in 2020 as a result of additional share-based compensation awards, hiring additional research and development personnel, and the implementation of the Employee Share Purchase Plan.\n\u2022increases due to the global collaboration and license agreement with Sosei Heptares, which included an upfront cash payment of $5.0 million and the issuance 54,617 shares valued at $4.9 million to Sosei Heptares.\nSelling, General and Administrative Expenses\nSelling, general and administrative expenses were $462.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to $134.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase of $327.9 million was primarily due to an increase in spending to support the commercial launch of NURTEC ODT. Less than half of the SG&A expense was for commercial organization personnel costs, excluding non-cash share-based compensation expense. Non-cash share-based compensation expense, included in personnel related costs, was $33.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, an increase of $5.0 million as compared to the same period in 2019.\nOther Income (Expense), Net\nOther income (expense), net was a net expense of $113.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to net expense of $49.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase of $63.7 million in net expense was primarily due to interest expense on our outstanding term loan with Sixth Street Specialty Lending, Inc, the non-cash interest expense on our liability related to the mandatorily redeemable preferred shares resulting from the sale of Series A Preferred\nShares to RPI in April 2019, an increase in the non-cash interest expense recognized on our liability related to the sale of future royalties, and an increase in the change in fair value of derivative liability related to the Series B Preferred Shares Forward Contracts.\nProvision for Income Taxes\nWe recorded a provision for income taxes of $10.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to a provision for income taxes of $0.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The provision for income taxes is comprised of $5.0 million relating to US federal and state income taxes for BPI's profitable operations in the United States and $5.2 million of uncertain tax benefits recognized in the period December 31, 2020.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nSince our inception, we have incurred significant operating losses and negative cash flows from our operations. We have funded our operations primarily with proceeds from sales of our common and preferred equity, sales of revenue participation rights related to future royalties, a senior secured credit facility and the Collaboration Agreement with Pfizer. In addition, we began to generate net product revenue in the first\nquarter of 2020 in conjunction with the launch of our first product, NURTEC ODT.\nWe continuously assess our working capital needs, capital expenditure requirements and future investments or acquisitions. As of February 25, 2022, we expect that our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities as of December 31, 2021, our future operating cash flows from sales of NURTEC ODT, $125.0 million in potential future borrowings under our credit facility, proceeds related to the settlement of our Series B preferred shares forward contracts, potential sales of common shares under the Equity Distribution Agreement in 2022, and the $500.0 million in proceeds received on January 4, 2022 and potential milestone payments from the strategic collaboration with Pfizer will be sufficient sources of cash to meet our cash needs for more than one year.\nAs of December 31, 2021, we had cash and cash equivalents of $171.9 million, excluding restricted cash of $2.4 million. Cash in excess of immediate requirements is invested in marketable securities with a view to liquidity and capital preservation. As of December 31, 2021, we had marketable securities of $192.6 million .\nCash Flows\nThe following table summarizes our cash flows for each of the periods presented: Table 13: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Year Ended December 31, </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>In thousands </td> <td> </td> <td>2021 </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash used in operating activities </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(831,100) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(702,879) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(377,331) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash provided by (used in) investing activities </td> <td> </td> <td>26,552 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(269,880) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(3,784) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash provided by financing activities </td> <td> </td> <td>844,849 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>788,824 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>434,593 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Effect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash </td> <td> </td> <td>(189) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>439 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net increase (decrease) in cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>40,112 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(183,496) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>53,478 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nOperating Activities\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2021, we used $831.1 million of cash in operating activities, an increase of $128.2 million as compared to the year ended December 31, 2020. The increase in cash usage was primarily due to an increase in SG&A expenses due to increased costs, including advertising, to support the commercial growth of NURTEC ODT and an increase in R&D expenses to support our portfolio of late stage product candidates and preclinical assets, partially offset by an increase in cash receipts from an increase in net product revenue from sales of NURTEC ODT. The increase in cash usage was also due to $62.5 million in payments to RPI for the mandatory redemption of 624 Series A preferred shares, which were accounted for as payments of accrued interest on the mandatorily redeemable preferred shares liability.\nInvesting Activities\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2021, net cash provided by investing activities was $26.6 million, an increase of $296.4 million as compared to the year ended December 31, 2020. The increase was primarily due to an increase of $126.6 million of sales and maturities of marketable securities, a decrease of $126.1 million of purchases of marketable securities, and a decrease of $41.5 million of payments for intangible assets during the year ended December 31, 2021. The $41.5 million of payments for intangible assets during the year ended December 31, 2020 are milestone payments related to the FDA approval and launch of NURTEC ODT.\nFinancing Activities\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2021, net cash provided by financing activities was $844.8 million, an increase of $56.0 million compared to the year ended\nDecember 31, 2020. The increase was primarily due to an increase of $97.9 million of R&D funding, $75.0 million of long-term debt and $70.4 million for the issuance of Series B preferred shares all in the year ended December 31, 2021 partially offset by $147.5 million from the sale of future royalties and $60.0 million from the sale of contingently redeemable non-controlling interests during the year ended December 31, 2020.\nPfizer Collaboration Agreement\nIn November 2021, we entered into the Collaboration Agreement with Pfizer, pursuant to which Pfizer would commercialize the Licensed Products in all countries worldwide outside of the United States. In consideration thereof, in January 2022 Pfizer made an upfront payment of $150.0 million to Biohaven upon receipt of the requisite regulatory approvals needed for the effectiveness of the Collaboration Agreement. In addition, in January 2022 Pfizer purchased $350.0 million worth of Biohaven common shares at approximately $173.05 per share. We will be eligible to receive an aggregate additional $740.0 million in contingent payments based on specified commercial and sales-based milestones for the Licensed Products.\nWe are also entitled to tiered, escalating royalties from the upper teens to twenty percent of net sales of Licensed Products in the Territory. In general, Pfizer's obligation to pay royalties continues on a product-by-product and country-by-country basis until the latest of ten years after the first commercial sale of such product in such country, the expiration of the patent rights covering such product in such country or the expiration of the period of exclusivity applicable to such product in such country. In addition to the upfront payments, contingent payments and royalties described above, Pfizer will also compensate us for a pro-rata share of certain of our sales-based milestone obligations owed to BMS under the BMS License, and related net sales royalties owed to BMS and RPI that result from Pfizer's commercialization and sale, respectively, of the Licensed Products in the Territory.\nCredit Facility\nIn August 2020, we entered into a financing agreement, as amended, with the Lenders pursuant to which the Lenders agreed to extend a senior secured credit facility to the Company providing for term loans in an aggregate principal amount up to $500.0 million, plus any capitalized interest paid in kind. We drew an initial term loan of $275.0 million at closing in August 2020 (the \"Initial Term Loan\"), and had $100.0 million of immediately available delayed draw term loan commitments and $125.0 million of delayed draw term loan commitments available upon achievement of the Delay Draw Sales Milestone (as defined in the Sixth Street Financing Agreement).\nIn March 2021, we entered into Amendment No. 1 (the First Amendment\u201d) to the financing agreement\npursuant to which the parties agreed to, among other things, remove the Delayed Draw Sales Milestone tied to the availability of the $125.0 million tranche of delayed draw term loans. In August 2021, we drew the $125.0 million tranche of delayed draw term loans (the \"DDTL-2).\nIn September 2021, we entered into Amendment No. 2 (the Second Amendment\u201d) to the financing agreement. Pursuant to the Second Amendment, the parties agreed to, among other things, increase the size of the credit facility by providing for additional term loans in an aggregate principal amount of $250.0 million for a total facility size of $750.0 million plus any capitalized interest paid in kind. At closing of the Second Amendment, we drew an initial term loan of $125.0 million (the \"2021 Term Loan\") and $100.0 million of delayed draw term loan commitments (the \"DDTL-1\"). The remaining $125.0 million in delayed draw term loan commitments (the \"2021 DDTL Commitment\") was available to be drawn by the Borrowers until December 31, 2021 (the \"Delayed Draw Term Loan Commitment Termination Date\").\nIn November 2021, we entered into Amendment No. 3 and Limited Consent to Financing Agreement ( the Third Amendment and Limited Consent\u201d) to our Sixth Street Financing Agreement. Pursuant to the Third Amendment and Limited Consent, the Lenders consented to our entry into the Collaboration Agreement with Pfizer.\nIn December 2021, we entered into Amendment No. 4 (the \"Fourth Amendment\") to the financing agreement (as previously amended and as amended by the Fourth Amendment, the Sixth Street Financing Agreement\u201d), pursuant to which the parties agreed to, among other things, extend the Delayed Draw Term Loan Commitment Termination Date to June 30, 2022.\n2020 Loans\nIn August 2020, we borrowed the Initial Term Loan for total proceeds of $262.2 million, net of discounts and issuance costs. In August 2021, we borrowed the DDTL-2 for total proceeds of $123.8 million, net of discounts and issuance costs. The DDTL-2 was borrowed under the same financing terms as the Initial Term Loan. The Initial Term Loan and the DDTL-2 (collectively, the \"August 2020 Loans\") become due and payable in August 2025. The August 2020 Loans accrue interest at a variable rate, with interest paid on a quarterly basis. The interest rate on the August 2020 Loans as of December 31, 2021 was 10.0%. We have the option to pay-in-kind up to 4.0% interest per annum for the first two years and have elected to pay-in-kind the maximum amount for all interest payments as of December 31, 2021. The proceeds from the August 2020 Loans are being used for general corporate purposes.\n2021 Loans\nIn September 2021, we borrowed the 2021 Term Loan for total proceeds of $119.7 million and the DDTL-1\nfor total proceeds of $97.8 million, both net of discounts and issuance costs. The 2021 Term Loan and the DDTL-1 (collectively, the \"September 2021 Loans\") become due and payable in September 2026. The September 2021 Loans accrue interest at a variable rate, with interest paid on a quarterly basis. The interest rate on the September 2021 Loans as of December 31, 2021 was 9.25%. We have the option to pay-in-kind up to 4.0% interest per annum for the first two years that the loans are outstanding. The proceeds from the September 2021 Loans are being used for general corporate purposes.\nAs of December 31, 2021, we have $125.0 million in delayed draw term loan commitments still available to borrow under the Sixth Street Financing Agreement until June 30, 2022. If drawn, the loans will be borrowed under the same financing terms as the September 2021 Loans.\nEquity Distribution Agreement\nIn December 2020, we entered into an equity distribution agreement in which we may offer and sell common shares having an aggregate offering price of up to $400.0 million from time to time through or to the sales agents, acting as our agents or principals (the \"Equity Distribution Agreement\"). Sales of our common shares, if any, will be made in sales deemed to be at the market offerings\u201d. The sales agents are not required to sell any specific amount of securities but will act as our sales agents using commercially reasonable efforts consistent with their normal trading and sales practices, on mutually agreed terms between the sales agents and us. We currently plan to use the net proceeds from the offering for general corporate purposes.\nAs of December 31, 2021, we have issued and sold 939,328 common shares for net proceeds of approximately $78.7 million all in the first quarter of 2021 under the Equity Distribution Agreement.\nSeries B Preferred Shares Forward Contracts\nIn August 2020, we entered into the Series B preferred share agreement, whereby RPI will invest in the Company through the purchase of up to 3,992 Series B preferred shares at a price of $50,100 per share for aggregate proceeds of approximately $200.0 million (the \"RPI Series B Preferred Share Agreement\"). The shares will be issued in quarterly increments from March 31, 2021 to December 31, 2024. We are required to redeem the Series B Preferred Shares for 1.77 times the original purchase price, payable beginning March 31, 2025 in equal quarterly installments through December 31, 2030. The gross proceeds from the transaction with RPI will be used for the clinical development of zavegepant and other general corporate purposes.\nAs of December 31, 2021, we have issued 1,406 Series B preferred shares to RPI for proceeds of $70.4 million.\nFunding Requirements\nWe expect our expenses to increase in connection with our ongoing activities, particularly as we advance and expand preclinical activities, clinical trials and commercialization of our product candidates. Our costs will also increase as we:\n\u2022continue and expand our commercial activities related to NURTEC ODT for the acute treatment of migraine;\n\u2022advance and expand the development of our CGRP and glutamate modulation platform product candidates and continue development of our MPO platform;\n\u2022conduct ongoing Phase 2 proof of concept trial to evaluate the safety and efficacy of rimegepant in patients with treatment refractory trigeminal neuralgia;\n\u2022complete the ongoing extension phase of the Phase 2/3 clinical trial of troriluzole in SCA and our ongoing Phase 3 trials of troriluzole in OCD, and complete our ongoing Phase 3 randomized controlled trial to assess the efficacy of troriluzole in SCA;\n\u2022conduct support activities for future clinical trials of BHV-5000;\n\u2022complete the Phase 3 clinical trial of oral zavegepant and related support activities, and continue other clinical trials of oral zavegepant;\n\u2022continue to initiate and progress other supporting studies required for regulatory approval of our product candidates, including long-term safety studies, drug-drug interaction studies, preclinical toxicology and carcinogenicity studies;\n\u2022make required milestone and royalty payments under the license agreements by which we acquired some of the rights to our product candidates;\n\u2022initiate preclinical studies and clinical trials for any additional indications for our current product candidates and any future product candidates that we may pursue;\n\u2022continue to build our portfolio of product candidates through the acquisition or in-license of additional product candidates or technologies;\n\u2022continue to develop, maintain, expand and protect our intellectual property portfolio;\n\u2022pursue regulatory approvals for our current and future product candidates that successfully complete clinical trials;\n\u2022support our sales, marketing and distribution infrastructure to commercialize any future product candidates for which we may obtain marketing approval;\n\u2022hire additional clinical, medical, commercial, and development personnel; and\n\u2022incur additional legal, accounting and other expenses in operating as a public company.\nAs of February 25, 2022, the issuance date of our consolidated financial statements, we expect that our cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities as of December 31, 2021, our furture operating cash flows from sales of NURTEC ODT, the funds available from the Sixth Street Financing Agreement, proceeds from the issuance of Series B Preferred Shares, potential sales under the Equity Distribution Agreement in 2022, and proceeds from our Collaboration Agreement with Pfizer will be sufficient to fund our current forecast for operating expenses, including commercialization of NURTEC ODT, financial commitments and other cash requirements for more than one year. We may need to raise additional capital until we are profitable. If no additional capital is raised through either public or private equity financings, debt financings, strategic relationships, alliances and licensing agreements, or a combination thereof, we may delay, limit or reduce discretionary spending in areas related to research and development activities and other general and administrative expenses in order to fund our operating costs and working capital needs.\nWe have based these estimates on assumptions that may prove to be wrong, and we could utilize our available capital resources sooner than we expect. We expect that we will require additional capital to pursue in-licenses or acquisitions of other product candidates. If we receive regulatory approval for troriluzole, or our other product candidates, we expect to incur additional commercialization expenses related to product manufacturing, sales, marketing and distribution, depending on whether we commercialize jointly or on our own.\nBecause of the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with research, development and commercialization of pharmaceutical product candidates, we are unable to estimate the exact amount of our working capital requirements. Our future funding requirements will depend on and could increase significantly as a result of many factors, including:\n\u2022the scope, progress, results and costs of researching and developing our product candidates, and conducting preclinical studies and clinical trials;\n\u2022the costs, timing and outcome of regulatory review of our product candidates;\n\u2022the effect of COVID-19 pandemic on our business operations and funding needs;\n\u2022the costs of future activities, including product sales, medical affairs, marketing, manufacturing and distribution, for NURTEC ODT, in addition to any of our product candidates for which we receive marketing approval;\n\u2022the revenue from NURTEC ODT, and revenue, if any, received from commercial sale of our products, should any of our product candidates receive marketing approval;\n\u2022the costs and timing of hiring new employees to support our continued growth;\n\u2022the costs of preparing, filing, and prosecuting patent applications, maintaining and enforcing our intellectual property rights and defending intellectual property-related claims;\n\u2022the extent to which we acquire or in-license other product candidates and technologies;\n\u2022the costs of manufacturing commercial-grade product and necessary inventory to support commercial launch;\n\u2022the costs associated with payment of milestones and royalties under existing contractual arrangements and/or in-licensing additional products candidates to augment our current pipeline; and\n\u2022the timing, receipt and amount of sales of, or milestone payments related to or royalties on, our current or future product candidates, if any.\nUntil such time, if ever, that we can generate product revenue sufficient to achieve profitability, we expect to finance our cash needs through a combination of public and private equity offerings, debt financings, other third-party funding, strategic alliances, licensing arrangements or marketing and distribution arrangements. To the extent that we raise additional capital through the sale of equity or convertible debt securities, the ownership interest of our existing shareholders will be diluted, and the terms of these securities may include liquidation or other preferences that adversely affect the rights of our existing shareholders. Debt financing and preferred equity financing, if available, may involve agreements that include covenants limiting or restricting our ability to take specific actions, such as incurring additional debt, making capital expenditures or declaring dividends. If we raise additional funds through other third-party funding, strategic alliances, licensing arrangements or marketing and distribution arrangements, we may have\nto relinquish valuable rights to our technologies, future revenue streams, research programs or product candidates or grant licenses on terms that may not be favorable to us. If we are unable to raise additional funds through equity or debt financings when needed, we will\nbe required to delay, limit, reduce or terminate our product development or future commercialization efforts or grant rights to develop and market products or product candidates that we would otherwise prefer to develop and market ourselves.\nContractual Obligations and Commitments\nThe following table summarizes certain estimated future obligations by period under our various contractual obligations as of December 31, 2021 and the effects that such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flows in future periods: Table 14: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Payments Due by Period </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>In thousands </td> <td> </td> <td>Total </td> <td> </td> <td>2022 </td> <td> </td> <td>2023 - 2024\n</td> <td> </td> <td>2025 - 2026\n</td> <td> </td> <td>Thereafter\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Long-term debt obligations </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Principal payments(1)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>675,333 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>47,811 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>627,522 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest payment(2)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>225,062 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>43,967 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>120,984 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>60,111 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Finance leases </td> <td> </td> <td>9,518 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5,714 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3,804 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating leases </td> <td> </td> <td>4,155 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>689 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,420 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,477 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>569 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Purchase obligations </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Commercial commitments(3)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>107,882 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>90,809 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>17,073 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Research commitments(4)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>33,485 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>33,485 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other long-term liabilities </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Mandatorily redeemable preferred shares(5)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>187,500 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>62,500 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>125,000 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Series B preferred shares forward contracts(6)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>354,552 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>118,184 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>236,368 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,597,487 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>237,164 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>316,092 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>807,294 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>236,937 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\n(1) Principal payments on long-term debt relate to the $625.0 million in term loans drawn under our senior secured credit facility with Sixth Street Specialty Lending, Inc., and includes the capitalization and payment as principal of $50.3 million of interest paid-in-kind.\n(2) Interest payments on long-term debt are calculated using the 10.00% interest rate on the August 2020 Loans and 9.25% on the September 2021 Loans, our outstanding term loans in effect on December 31, 2021. It excludes 4% of interest paid-in-kind for the first eight quarters that the loans are outstanding and includes the effect of the inclusion of the interest paid-in-kind as part of the outstanding loan principal.\n(3) Commercial commitments primarily related to advertising, data license agreements and manufacturing preparation services that are enforceable and legally binding on us and that specify all significant terms, including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed, minimum or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the transaction. For obligations with cancellation provisions, the amounts included in the preceding table are limited to the non-cancelable portion of the agreement terms or the minimum cancellation fee.\n(4) Research commitments are primarily CRO and CMO agreements that are enforceable and legally binding on us and that specify all significant terms, including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed, minimum or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the transaction. For obligations with cancellation provisions, the amounts included in the preceding table are limited to the non-cancelable portion of the agreement terms or the minimum cancellation fee.\n(5) Pursuant to the Series A Preferred Shares Agreement with RPI, the mandatorily redeemable preferred shares are redeemed in cash in equal quarterly installments beginning on March 31, 2021 and ending December 31, 2024.\n(6) The Series B preferred shares forward contracts require RPI to purchase $200.0 million of Series B preferred shares from us on a quarterly basis beginning on March 31, 2021 and ending on December 31, 2024. After December 31, 2024, we are required to redeem the Series B preferred shares at 1.77x the purchase price in quarterly installments ending December 31, 2030.\nIn addition to the contractual obligations in the table above, under various agreements with third-party licensors and collaborators, we have agreed to make milestone payments and pay royalties and annual maintenance fees to third parties and to meet due diligence requirements based upon specified milestones. We have not included any contingent payment obligations, such as milestones, royalties, or due diligence, in the table above as the amount, timing and likelihood of such payments are not known. We have not included any of the annual license maintenance fee payments in the above table, as although the amount and timing are known, we cannot currently determine the final termination dates of the agreements and, as a result, we cannot determine the total amounts of such payments we will be required to make under the agreements. We do not anticipate making material annual license maintenance payments related to our license agreements in the next 12 months.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Significant Judgments and Estimates\nOur consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (\"GAAP\"). The preparation of our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, costs and expenses, and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities in our financial statements. We base our estimates on historical experience, known trends and events and various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. We evaluate our estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis.\nOur actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. While our significant accounting policies are described in more detail in Note 2 \"Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\" in the notes to our financial statements appearing at the end of this Annual Report, we believe that the following accounting policies are those most critical to the judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements.\nRevenue Recognition\nRevenues from product sales are recorded at the net sales price, or transaction price,\u201d which includes estimates of variable consideration that result from (a) invoice discounts for prompt payment and distribution service fees, (b) government and private payor rebates, chargebacks, discounts and fees, (c) product returns and (d) costs of co-pay assistance programs for patients, as well as other incentives for certain indirect customers. Reserves are established for the estimates of variable consideration based on the amounts earned or to be claimed on the related sales. The reserves are classified as reductions to trade receivable, net if payable to a Customer or accrued expenses if payable to a third-party. Where appropriate, we utilize the expected value method to determine the appropriate amount for estimates of variable consideration based on factors such as our historical experience, current contractual and statutory requirements, specific known market events and trends, industry data and forecasted customer buying and payment patterns. The amount of variable consideration that is included in the transaction price may be constrained and is included in net product revenues only to the extent that it is probable that a significant reversal in the amount of the cumulative revenue recognized will not occur in a future period. Actual amounts of consideration ultimately received may differ from our estimates. If actual results vary from our estimates, we adjust these estimates, which would affect net product revenue and earnings in the period such variances become known.\nWe make significant estimates and judgments that materially affect our recognition of net product revenue. Claims by third-party payors for rebates, chargebacks and discounts frequently are submitted to us significantly after the related sales, potentially resulting in adjustments in the period in which the new information becomes known. We will adjust our estimates based on new information, including information regarding actual rebates, chargebacks and discounts for our products, as it becomes available.\nInterest Expense and Liability Related to Sale of Future Royalties\nWe have accounted for the 2018 Funding Agreement with RPI Finance Trust (\"RPI\") and a portion of the 2020 Funding Agreement with RPI 2019 Intermediate Finance Trust ( RPI 2019 IFT\u201d) as liability financings. See Note 7 \"Liability Related to Sale of Future Royalties, net\" for additional details. The liability related to sale of future royalties and the related interest expense are measured based on our current estimate of the timing and amount of expected future royalties expected to be paid over the estimated term of the related funding agreement with RPI Trust. The liability is amortized using the effective interest rate method, resulting in recognition of interest expense over the estimated term of the agreement. Each reporting period, we assess the estimated timing and amount of future expected royalty payments over the estimated term. If there are changes to the estimate, we recognize the impact to the liability's amortization schedule and the related interest expense prospectively. Our estimate of the amount of expected future royalties to be paid considers the probability of success of the compounds being approved for sale, market penetration rates of the compounds upon approval, compliance rate and net pricing.\nValuation of Series B Forward Contract Derivative\nThe fair value of the derivative recognized in connection with the RPI Series B Preferred Share Agreement was determined based on significant inputs not observable in the market. The fair value of the derivative primarily relates to the difference between the fair value of the Series B Preferred Shares and the contractual future purchase price. The fair value of the Series B Preferred Shares is calculated based on the cash flows to RPI (1.77 times the original purchase price as scheduled or accelerated upon certain events) and our estimated cost of capital for those cash flows. The cash flows to RPI are based on probability adjusted cash flows from certain scenarios outlined in the agreement that would result in accelerated payments modeled using a Monte Carlo simulation. As inputs into the valuation, we considered the type and probability of occurrence of certain change of control events, the amount of the payments, the expected timing of certain acceleration of payments, and a risk-adjusted discount rate. Assessing the probability of certain change of control events over a 10-year time period requires significant judgment and the successful completion of a\nchange of control is largely dependent on the outcome of potential negotiations with a third party. Due to this uncertainty, our expectation of the probability of the timing of a change of control event at the reporting date could reasonably be different than the timing of an actual change of control event, and if so, would mean the estimated fair value could differ from the fair value determined.\nIncome Taxes\nIn August 2020, we completed an intra-entity asset transfer of intellectual property (\"IP\"). See Note 15 \"Income Taxes\" for additional details. The fair value of the transferred IP required significant and complex management judgments to establish assumptions about the intellectual property's fair value, including revenue growth rates, projected profit margins, and discount rate. The fair value determination was based upon a discounted cash flow model that was subject to significant judgement given the IP asset transferred had been recently launched and there was limited historical sales activity. As a result of the transfer, we recognized a deferred tax asset for the step up in tax basis based on the fair value of the transferred IP.\nWe periodically evaluate the likelihood of the realization of deferred tax assets and reduce the carrying amount of these deferred tax assets by a valuation allowance to the extent we believe a portion will not be realized. We continue to maintain a full valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets recognized in connection with our intra-entity transfer of IP as realization is not certain due to a lack of net operating income history by taxing jurisdictions. We consider many factors when assessing the likelihood of future realization of deferred tax assets, including our current operating results, expectations of future taxable income, carryforward periods available to us for tax reporting purposes, various income tax strategies, and other relevant factors. Significant judgment is required in making this assessment and, to the extent future expectations change, we would assess the recoverability of our deferred tax assets at that time.\nRecently Issued Accounting Pronouncements\nA description of recently issued accounting pronouncements that may potentially impact our financial position and results of operations is disclosed in Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements appearing at the end of this Annual Report.", "item_7_truncated": "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nYou should read the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations together with our financial statements and related notes appearing elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, or this Annual Report. In addition to historical information, this discussion and analysis contains forward-looking statements that involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions. Our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of certain factors. We discuss factors that we believe could cause or contribute to these differences below and elsewhere in this report, including those set forth under Item 1A. \"Risk Factors\" and under \"Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\" in this Annual Report.\nOverview\nWe are a commercial-stage biopharmaceutical company with a portfolio of innovative, best-in-class therapies to improve the lives of patients with debilitating neurological and neuropsychiatric diseases, including rare disorders. Our Neuroinnovation portfolio includes FDA-approved NURTEC ODT (rimegepant) for the acute and preventive treatment of migraine and a broad pipeline of product candidates across five distinct mechanistic platforms: calcitonin gene related peptide (\"CGRP\") receptor antagonism, glutamate modulation, myeloperoxidase (\"MPO\") inhibition, Kv7 Ion Channel Activators (\"Kv7\"), and Myostatin.\nOur clinical-stage milestones include the following:\nTable 8: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Drug Name </td> <td>Indication </td> <td>1H2021 </td> <td>2H2021 </td> <td>1H2022 </td> <td>2H2022 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>Migraine prevention </td> <td>Approval </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Migraine acute/prevention </td> <td>Europe Filing 1Q </td> <td> </td> <td>EU Positive Opinion </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Migraine acute (China/South Korea) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Topline </td> <td>China/Korea Filing </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Zavegepant\nSmall molecule/NCE\n</td> <td>Migraine (intranasal) </td> <td> </td> <td>Topline </td> <td>US Filing </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Migraine (oral) </td> <td>Start Phase 3 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Troriluzole\nNCE prodrug of riluloze\n</td> <td>Spinocerebellar ataxia </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Expected Topline </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder ( OCD\u201d) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Complete Enrollment </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Verdiperstat\nNCE oral MPO inhibitor\n</td> <td>Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (\"ALS\") </td> <td> </td> <td>Complete Enrollment </td> <td> </td> <td>Expected Topline\n(Mid-2022) </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Taldefgrobep Alfa\nAnti-myostatin adnectin\n</td> <td>Spinal Muscular Atrophy (\"SMA\") </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Start Phase 3 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>BHV- 7000\nKv7 channel modulator\n</td> <td>Focal seizures </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Clinic Start </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>BHV-1100\nARM combo\n</td> <td>Multiple Myeloma </td> <td> </td> <td>Start Phase 1 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Milestone Achieved </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nCGRP Platform\nIn July 2016, we acquired exclusive, worldwide rights to our CGRP receptor antagonist platform, including rimegepant and zavegepant (previously known as BHV-3500 and vazegepant), through a license agreement, as amended, with Bristol-Myers Squibb Company ( BMS\u201d). In December 2020, Sosei Heptares and Biohaven entered a global collaboration and license agreement (the \"Heptares Agreement\") under which Biohaven received exclusive global rights to develop, manufacture and commercialize a portfolio of novel, small-molecule CGRP receptor antagonists discovered\nby Sosei Heptares for the treatment of CGRP-mediated disorders.\nRimegepant\nThe most advanced product candidate from our CGRP receptor antagonist platform is rimegepant, an orally available, potent and selective small molecule human CGRP receptor antagonist that we have developed for the acute and preventive treatment of migraine. During the second quarter of 2019, we submitted NDAs for the acute treatment of migraine to\nthe FDA for the Zydis ODT and tablet formulations of rimegepant. The NDA submission for the Zydis ODT formulation of rimegepant was submitted using an FDA priority review voucher, purchased in March 2019, providing for an expedited 6-month review. The Zydis ODT formulation of rimegepant (NURTEC ODT) was approved by the FDA for the acute treatment of migraine on February 27, 2020 and was available by prescription in U.S. pharmacies on March 12, 2020. During the fourth quarter of 2020, we submitted an sNDA for the preventive treatment of migraine to the FDA for NURTEC ODT. The FDA approved NURTEC ODT for the preventive treatment of episodic migraine on May 27, 2021.\nWe remain focused on investing in long-term success by driving new-to-brand prescriptions, and ultimately market share, in this rapidly growing oral CGRP market and are continuing to observe a positive return on investment with increasing physician advocacy and attracting a greater pool of patients. We believe that the rapid adoption of NURTEC ODT is evidence of significant unmet need among people with migraine and an associated large acute and preventive therapy market opportunity. We continue to expand commercial payer coverage, with NURTEC ODT now covered by insurance providers reflecting 89% of commercial lives.\nA summary of key rimegepant studies is described below.\nStudy 301/Study 302\nIn March 2018, we announced positive topline data from our first two pivotal Phase 3 trials ( Study 301 and Study 302\u201d) for the acute treatment of migraine. In each trial, treatment with a single 75 mg dose of rimegepant met the co-primary efficacy endpoints of the trial, which were superior to placebo, at two hours post-dose, on measures of pain freedom and freedom from the patient's most bothersome symptom (\"MBS\"). In addition to achieving both co-primary endpoints in each of the trials, rimegepant also was observed to be generally safe and well-tolerated in the trials, with a safety profile similar to placebo. The co-primary endpoints achieved in the Phase 3 trials were consistent with regulatory guidance from the FDA and provided the basis for the submission of an NDA to the FDA.\nStudy 303\nA third Phase 3 clinical trial for the acute treatment of migraine with a bioequivalent ODT formulation of rimegepant was commenced in February 2018. On December 3, 2018, we announced positive topline data from this randomized, controlled Phase 3 clinical trial ( BHV3000-303\u201d or Study 303\u201d) evaluating the efficacy and safety of our Zydis ODT formulation of rimegepant for the acute treatment of migraine. Rimegepant differentiated from placebo on the two co-primary endpoints using a single dose, pain freedom and freedom from the MBS at two hours. In total, rimegepant was significantly differentiated from the placebo in the first 21 consecutive primary and\nsecondary outcome measures that were pre-specified. Patients treated with the rimegepant Zydis ODT formulation began to numerically separate from placebo on pain relief as early as 15 minutes, and this difference was statistically significant at 60 minutes. Additionally, a significantly greater percentage of patients treated with rimegepant Zydis ODT returned to normal functioning by 60 minutes and lasting clinical benefit compared to placebo was observed through 48 hours after a single dose of rimegepant on freedom from pain, pain relief, freedom from the MBS, and freedom from functional disability. The safety and tolerability observations of rimegepant in Study 303 were consistent with our previous observations. The overall rates of adverse events were similar to placebo (13.2% with respect to rimegepant compared to 10.5% with placebo). The co-primary endpoints achieved in the Phase 3 trials were consistent with regulatory guidance from the FDA and formed the basis of efficacy data required by the FDA for approval.\nStudy 305\nIn November 2018, we initiated a double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase 3 clinical trial examining regularly scheduled dosing of rimegepant 75 mg to evaluate its efficacy and safety as a preventive therapy for migraine ( BHV3000-305\u201d or Study 305\u201d). In March 2020 we announced positive topline results from this study. Rimegepant 75 mg, dosed every other day, demonstrated statistically significant superiority, compared to placebo, on the primary endpoint of reduction in the mean number of migraine days per month in both episodic and chronic migraine patients. The safety profile seen in the 370 patients who received rimegepant 75 mg every other day was consistent with prior clinical trial experience. With this trial, rimegepant has become the only CGRP targeted therapy to demonstrate efficacy in both the acute and preventive treatment of migraine. An sNDA for rimegepant for prevention of migraine was filed with the FDA and accepted for review in the fourth quarter of 2020. The FDA approved NURTEC ODT for the preventive treatment of migraine on May 27, 2021.\nPediatric Study Plan\nIn June 2019, the FDA agreed to our Pediatric Study Plan for the acute treatment of migraine. The pediatric program for the acute treatment of migraine was initiated in the fourth quarter of 2020.\nTrigeminal Neuralgia\nIn the second quarter of 2019, we initiated a Phase 2 proof of concept trial to evaluate the safety and efficacy of rimegepant in patients with treatment refractory trigeminal neuralgia. Trigeminal neuralgia is a chronic facial pain syndrome characterized by paroxysmal, severe, and lancinating episodes of pain in the distribution of one or more branches of the trigeminal nerve. The trigeminal nerve, or fifth cranial nerve, is the largest of the 12 cranial nerves and\nprovides sensory innervation to the head and neck, as well as motor innervation to the muscles of mastication. These episodic bouts of severe facial pain can last seconds to minutes, occur several times per day, and often result in significant disability. Over the long-term course of the disease, symptoms often become refractory to medical therapy and current treatment options remain suboptimal.\nPlaque Psoriasis\nIn the fourth quarter of 2020, we announced a collaboration with Weill Cornell Medicine's Dr. Richard Granstein, Chairman of Dermatology, to initiate an investigator-led clinical trial, which will explore whether treatment with one of our CGRP-receptor antagonists will reduce the severity of disease and percentage of area affected as measured by patients' Psoriasis Activity Severity Index (PASI) score after 16 weeks of treatment as compared to placebo. In addition, the study will assess the potential impact on itch and patient quality-of-life measures. Psoriasis is a chronic and painful autoimmune disease characterized by red patches of dry, cracked skin that may bleed, itch, and burn that affects approximately 7- 8 million people in the U.S.\nRhinosinusitis\nIn February 2022, we announced that we have begun enrollment in a Phase 2/3 clinical trial assessing the safety and efficacy of NURTEC ODT 75mg in patients with chronic rhinosinusitis (\"CRS\") with or without nasal polyps. CRS is a symptomatic inflammation of the paranasal sinuses and nasal cavity lasting more than 12 weeks. CRS typically manifests as facial pain/pressure/fullness, nasal obstruction (congestion), nasal discharge, and/or a decreased sense of smell. Both preclinical and human studies have indicated that increased CGRP levels are associated with CRS, and suggest that blocking CGRP receptors with NURTEC ODT may have beneficial effects for those suffering from CRS. We expect to enroll approximately 200 patients in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial across approximately 25 sites in the U.S. Researchers will evaluate acute symptomatic treatment with rimegepant in patients with chronic rhinosinusitis with and without nasal polyps. The primary outcome measure is the change in a patient's facial pain/pressure/fullness score on a Numerical Rating Scale (0-10). The trial will also assess the safety and tolerability of rimegepant.\nTemporomandibular Disorder\nIn the first quarter of 2022, we received Study May Proceed\u201d communications from the FDA regarding our proposed clinical trial for the use of NURTEC ODT in temporomandibular disorder (\"TMD\"). TMD is a disorder of the jaw muscles, temporomandibular joints, and the nerves associated with chronic facial pain. We expect to commence a clinical trial during the first quarter of 2022.\nInternational Health Authority Interactions\nScientific advice for rimegepant for acute and preventive migraine treatment was received from the CHMP, a committee of the European Medicines Agency, in June and December 2018, respectively. In the first quarter of 2021, we submitted the MAA for rimegepant dual activity, inclusive of acute and prevention of migraine. In February 2022, we were notified that CHMP adopted a positive opinion, recommending the granting of a marketing authorization in the EU for rimegepant 75 mg (available as an orally dissolving tablet), intended for the prophylaxis and acute treatment of migraine. If approved, VYDURA (rimegepant) will be the commercial name for rimegepant in the EU. The full indication for VYDURA is the acute treatment of migraine with or without aura in adults and preventive treatment of episodic migraine in adults who have at least four migraine attacks per month. We expect to receive determination regarding our Marketing Authorization Application in the EU for rimegepant in the first half of 2022.\nFilings in Israel and the Middle East began in 2020. In March 2021, we received approval for rimegepant in Israel and the UAE for the acute treatment of migraine. In the fourth quarter of 2021, we received approval for rimegepant in Israel for the preventive treatment of episodic migraine in adults and in Kuwait for the acute treatment of episodic migraine in adults. We expect further approvals in 2022.\nWith respect to Japan, we have engaged the Pharmaceuticals and Medical Devices Agency (\"PMDA\") on a path forward, and initiation of Phase 2/3 bridging studies are anticipated to begin mid-2022.\nIn January 2019, we and our subsidiary, BioShin (Shanghai) Consulting Services Company Ltd. ( BioShin Shanghai\u201d), a Shanghai based limited liability company, jointly announced that the National Medical Products Administration ( NMPA,\u201d formerly, the China FDA) had accepted the IND application for rimegepant for the treatment of migraine. As previously announced, BioShin Shanghai was established to develop and potentially commercialize our late-stage migraine and neurology portfolio in China and other Asia-Pacific markets. Following the results of Study 303, we submitted a second IND application to the NMPA for the Zydis ODT formulation of rimegepant for the acute treatment of migraine. The IND application for the Zydis ODT formulation of rimegepant was accepted by the NMPA in the fourth quarter of 2019. In September 2020, BioShin Limited (\"BioShin\"), our subsidiary and the parent organization of BioShin Shanghai, raised $60.0 million in series A funding (the \"Bioshin Funding\") which is being used to build out BioShin in China and advance our clinical portfolio in the Asia-Pacific region.\nIn November 2020, BioShin initiated a double-blind, randomized Phase 3 clinical trial evaluating the safety and efficacy of NURTEC ODT (rimegepant) for the acute treatment of migraine in China and South Korea.\nIn February 2022, we announced positive topline results from the study. The study met its co-primary endpoints of freedom from pain (p<0.0001) and freedom from MBS including either nausea, phonophobia or photophobia (p<0.0001) at 2-hours following a single oral dose of rimegepant. The early onset and durable 48 hour efficacy observed in China and South Korea is consistent with previous clinical trial results. In addition to the positive results on the co-primary endpoints, NURTEC ODT demonstrated rapid onset efficacy that was superior to placebo on multiple clinically important outcomes, including: pain relief at 2 hours (p < 0.0001); normal functioning at 2 hours post-dose (p<0.0001); no need for rescue medication within 24 hrs of dosing (p < 0.0001), and showed lasting efficacy with sustained pain freedom from 2 through 24 hours (p < 0.0001) and sustained pain freedom from 2 through 48 hours (p < 0.0001). Initial analysis of topline data indicates NURTEC ODT was numerically advantaged compared to placebo on multiple early-onset measures, including: pain relief within 45 minutes and freedom from MBS within 45 minutes; return to normal function within 60 min; and pain freedom within 90 min. Rimegepant also showed a favorable safety and tolerability profile among study participants that was consistent with prior clinical trial results in the United States. Detailed data from the study will be presented at future medical meetings to help inform ongoing and future research. We expect to submit an NDA during the second half of 2022.\nPursuant to the terms of our Collaboration Agreement with Pfizer, we will continue to perform development activities required for the regulatory approval of rimegepant and zavegepant in all countries outside of the U.S. (\"the Territory\"). The development activities are to be performed under a mutually agreed-upon development plan. In addition, Pfizer has the right to conduct certain development activities in the Territory and will be the marketing authorization holder in all countries in the Territory where permitted under applicable law.\nZavegepant\nBHV-3500, formerly \"vazegepant\", is now referred to as \"zavegepant\" (za ve' je pant). The World Health Organization (WHO) International Nonproprietary Names (INN) Expert Committee revised the name to \"zavegepant\" which was accepted by the United States Adopted Names Council for use in the U.S. and is pending formal adoption by the INN for international use.\nAcute Treatment of Migraine\nAdministration of intranasal zavegepant in a Phase 1 clinical trial was initiated in October 2018 and achieved targeted therapeutic exposures. We advanced zavegepant into a Phase 2/3 trial to evaluate its efficacy for the acute treatment of migraine in the first quarter of 2019. We believed that intranasal zavegepant could provide an ultra-rapid onset of action that could be used in a complementary fashion with other migraine\ntreatments when the speed of onset is critical to a patient and/or for patients experiencing severe nausea and/or vomiting symptoms. In December 2019, we announced positive topline results from the Phase 2/3 trial. Zavegepant 10 and 20 mg was statistically superior to placebo on the co-primary endpoints of pain freedom and freedom from the MBS at two hours using a single dose.\nIn January 2021, we announced the initiation of the Phase 3 clinical trial for the use of intranasal zavegepant for the acute treatment of migraine and in December 2021, we announced top-line results. The results of the study showed that zavegepant was statistically superior to placebo on the co-primary endpoints of pain freedom (24% vs 15%, p <.0001) and freedom from most bothersome symptom (40% vs 31%, p = 0.0012) at 2 hours. Zavegepant was superior to placebo demonstrating pain relief as early as 15 minutes, with patients achieving return to normal function as early as 30 minutes after dosing (p < 0.006). The efficacy benefits of zavegepant were durable, including superiority versus placebo (p < 0.05) on: sustained pain freedom 2 to 24 hours; sustained pain freedom 2 to 48 hours; sustained pain relief 2 to 24 hours; and sustained pain relief 2 to 48 hours. Based upon these results, combined with our prior positive Phase 2/3 trial, we plan to proceed with regulatory submissions in the United States and other countries and expect to submit an NDA for zavegepant with the FDA in the first half of 2022.\nPreventative Treatment of Migraine\nIn September 2020, we announced that the FDA authorized the initiation of clinical trials for oral zavegepant and that we had achieved first in human dosing in a Phase 1 trial designed to assess the safety and pharmacokinetics of oral formulations of zavegepant. In March 2021, we announced that our Phase 2/3 clinical program to assess the efficacy of oral zavegepant in the preventive treatment of migraine began enrollment. The Phase 2/3 trial is ongoing with results expected in the second half of 2022.\nCOVID-19\nIn April 2020, we announced our plan to study intranasal zavegepant in pulmonary complications of COVID-19 disease. The IND was approved by the Division of Pulmonary, Allergy, and Critical Care at FDA in April 2020, and a Phase 2 trial began in April 2020 in collaboration with Thomas Jefferson University and other academic medical institutions. The clinical trial will assess the potential benefits of CGRP receptor-blockade in mitigating an excessive immune response which in some cases can be fatal in COVID-19 patients.\nAsthma\nIn October 2021, we began enrollment in a Phase 1b, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of oral zavegepant for the treatment of subjects with mild allergic asthma. Enrollment in the trial is ongoing.\nNext Generation CGRP Receptor Antagonists\nSeveral clinical candidates are being developed through a global collaboration and license agreement between Biohaven and Sosei Heptares. Under the agreement, Biohaven received exclusive global rights to develop, manufacture and commercialize a portfolio of novel, small-molecule CGRP receptor antagonists discovered by Sosei Heptares for the treatment of CGRP-mediated disorders.\nBHV-3100, previously known as HTL0022562, was developed successfully through preclinical trials by Sosei Heptares and demonstrated promising and differentiated properties in target CGRP-mediated disorders. During the fourth quarter of 2021, we decided to stop development of BHV-3100 based upon its emerging preclinical profile and will instead advance one of the portfolio's backup compounds in its place.\nGlutamate Platform\nThe most advanced product candidate from our glutamate receptor antagonist platform is troriluzole (previously referred to as trigriluzole and BHV-4157), which is in multiple Phase 3 trials. Other product candidates include BHV-5500 which is an antagonist of the glutamate N-methyl-D-aspartate ( NMDA\u201d) receptor.\nTroriluzole\nAtaxias\nWe are developing troriluzole for the treatment of ataxias; our initial focus has been spinocerebellar ataxia (\"SCA\"). We have received both orphan drug designation and fast track designation from the FDA for troriluzole for the treatment of SCA. A Phase 3 trial began enrollment in March 2019 to evaluate the efficacy of troriluzole in SCA. We believe that the non-statistically significant clinical observations from our first Phase 2/3 trial and open-label extension phase in SCA support our decision to advance troriluzole into a Phase 3 trial that could provide the data needed to serve as the basis for an NDA. We completed enrollment in the Phase 3 trial of troriluzole in SCA in the first quarter of 2021. Results are expected in the first half of 2022.\nOther Indications\nA Phase 2/3 double-blind, randomized, controlled trial to assess the efficacy of troriluzole in OCD commenced in December 2017. The Phase 2/3 study results were announced in June 2020. Troriluzole 200 mg administered once daily as adjunctive therapy in OCD patients with inadequate response to standard of care treatment showed consistent numerical improvement over placebo on the Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale (Y-BOCS) at all study timepoints (weeks 4 to 12) but did not meet the primary outcome measure at week 12 (p = 0.22 at week 12), including significant improvement at week 8 (p < 0.05). Troriluzole was well tolerated with a safety profile consistent with past\nclinical trial experience. Given the strong signal in the Phase 2/3 proof of concept study and after receiving feedback from the FDA in an End of Phase 2 meeting, in December 2020 we initiated enrollment in the Phase 3 program. Two Phase 3 studies are currently ongoing with results expected in the second half of 2022.\nIn addition, a Phase 2/3 double-blind, randomized, controlled trial of troriluzole in the treatment of mild-to-moderate Alzheimer's disease was advanced with the Alzheimer's Disease Cooperative Study, a consortium of sites funded by the National Institutes of Health. In January 2021, topline data from the trial revealed that troriluzole did not statistically differentiate from placebo at 48 weeks on the study's prespecified co-primary endpoints on the Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-Cognitive Subscale and the Clinical Dementia Rating Scale Sumo of Boxes in study participants with mild-to-moderate AD. Troriluzole also did not differentiate from placebo on the key secondary measure of hippocampal volume assessed by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in the overall population. A subgroup analysis consisting only of mild AD patients did, however, reveal that troriluzole exhibited a nonsignificant numerical difference of a potential benefit at week 48 on both the ADAS-cog and hippocampal volumetric MRI. Although the numerical effects on the ADAS-cog and hippocampal MRI measured in mild AD patients suggests a potential biologic effect of troriluzole in patients with early stage disease, additional analyses and biomarker data will be informative and help determine whether any further study in early AD is warranted. With regard to safety and tolerability, treatment with troriluzole at a dose of 280 mg once daily was relatively well tolerated and demonstrated a safety profile consistent with previous studies of troriluzole. In December 2021, we completed an ongoing long-term extension study of troriluzole in AD for mild AD patients.\nIn December 2021, the Global Coalition for Adaptive Research (\"GCAR\") selected troriluzole for evaluation in Glioblastoma Adaptive Global Innovative Learning Environment - NCT03970447 (\"GBM AGILE\"). GBM AGILE is a revolutionary patient-centered, adaptive platform trial for registration that tests multiple therapies for patients with newly-diagnosed and recurrent glioblastoma (\"GBM\"), the most fatal form of brain cancer. Troriluzole will be evaluated in all patient subgroups of the trial which include newly-diagnosed methylated MGMT, newly-diagnosed unmethylated MGMT, and recurrent GBM. Troriluzole was selected for inclusion in GBM AGILE based on compelling evidence showing deregulation of glutamate in GBM. The therapeutic potential of troriluzole in GBM and other oncology indications is supported by several recent clinical and translational research studies conducted with troriluzole and its active moiety.\nInternational Development\nIn the third quarter of 2020, BioShin raised $60.0 million in series A funding (the \"Bioshin Funding\") which\nwill be used to build out BioShin Limited in China and advance our clinical portfolio in the Asia-Pacific region, including initiating sites in China to participate in the global registrational trial of troriluzole in SCA.In December 2021, in connection with entering into the Collaboration Agreement with Pfizer,we merged Bioshin into a Biohaven subsidiary. BioShin completed enrollment for the SCA trial in China in the first quarter of 2021 with results expected in the first half of 2022.\nBHV-5000 and BHV-5500\nWe are developing BHV-5500, a low-trapping NMDA receptor antagonist. One potential target indication includes Complex Regional Pain Syndrome ( CRPS\u201d). CRPS is a rare, chronic pain condition typically affecting limbs and triggered by traumatic injury. Accompanying symptoms also include chronic inflammation and reduced mobility in the affected areas. Other disorders of interest include post-herpetic neuralgia and diabetic peripheral neuralgia. We acquired worldwide rights to BHV-5000 and BHV-5500 under an exclusive license agreement with AstraZeneca AB in October 2016. We selected a lead formulation at the end of 2017 and completed single dosing in a Phase 1 clinical trial of BHV-5000 in January 2018 to evaluate its pharmacokinetic properties. Results from nonclinical studies limiting clinical dose of BHV-5000 have led us to focus on BHV-5500 (lanicemine). Current work is focused on formulation development.\nMPO Platform\nVerdiperstat\nWe are developing verdiperstat (previously BHV-3241), an oral myeloperoxidase inhibitor for the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases. One target indication is MSA, a rare, rapidly progressive and fatal neurodegenerative disease with no cure or effective treatments. Verdiperstat has received orphan drug designation for the treatment of MSA from both the FDA and the European Medicines Agency. In addition, Fast Track status was granted by the FDA in March 2020 for verdiperstat for the treatment for MSA. A Phase 3 trial began enrollment in July 2019 to evaluate the efficacy of verdiperstat in MSA. In September 2021, we announced results from a focused analysis of a clinical trial of verdiperstat in MSA. Verdiperstat did not statistically differentiate from placebo on the prespecified primary efficacy measure, nor on the key secondary efficacy measures. Initial analysis of safety data was consistent with the overall profile of verdiperstat from prior clinical trial experience. Additional analyses are still pending, and full study results will be presented at an upcoming scientific meeting.\nAnother potential target indication is ALS. In September 2019, we announced that verdiperstat was selected to be studied in the Phase 3 HEALEY ALS Platform Trial, which is being conducted by the Sean M. Healey & AMG Center for ALS at Massachusetts General Hospital in collaboration with the Northeast ALS\nConsortium ( NEALS\u201d) clinical trial network. Promising investigational drugs were chosen for the HEALEY ALS Platform Trial through a competitive process, with the Healey Center providing partial financial support to successful applicants. The Phase 3 HEALEY ALS Platform Trial of verdiperstat began enrollment in July 2020. Enrollment in the trial was completed in November of 2021, with results expected in mid-2022.\nVerdiperstat was progressed through Phase 2 clinical trials by AstraZeneca. Seven clinical studies have been completed by AstraZeneca, including four Phase 1 studies in healthy subjects, two Phase 2a studies in subjects with Parkinson's disease, and one Phase 2b study in subjects with MSA. We have entered into an exclusive license agreement with AstraZeneca for the product candidate.\nKv7 Platform\nBHV-7000\nIn February 2022, we announced that we entered into a definitive agreement with Channel Biosciences, LLC, a subsidiary of Knopp Biosciences, LLC, to acquire a Kv7 channel targeting platform, adding the latest advances in ion-channel modulation to our growing neuroscience portfolio. BHV-7000 (formerly known as KB-3061) is the lead asset from the Kv7 platform and is a potentially best-in-class potassium channel activator with a profile suggestive of a wide therapeutic index, high selectivity, and significantly reduced GABA-ergic activity. We intend to bring BHV-7000 to the clinic in in 2022 in preparation for a development program in focal epilepsy.\nMyostatin Platform\nTaldefgrobep Alfa License Agreement\nIn February 2022, following the transfer of intellectual property we announced that we entered into a worldwide license agreement with BMS for the development and commercialization rights to taldefgrobep alfa (also known as BMS-986089), a novel, Phase 3-ready anti-myostatin adnectin. Myostatin is a natural protein that limits skeletal muscle growth, an important process in healthy muscular development. However, in patients with neuromuscular diseases, active myostatin can critically limit the growth needed to achieve developmental and functional milestones. Myostatin inhibition is a promising therapeutic strategy for enhancing muscle mass and strength in a range of pediatric and adult neuromuscular conditions. Taldefgrobep is a muscle-targeted treatment for neuromuscular disease and offers the opportunity for combination therapy. We plan to initiate a Phase 3 clinical trial of taldefgrobep in SMA in 2022. SMA is a rare, progressively debilitating motor neuron disease in which development and growth of muscle mass are compromised, resulting in progressive weakness and muscle atrophy, reduced motor function, impaired quality of life and often death. The in-licensing of taldefgrobep expands our portfolio of innovative, late-stage product candidates for the treatment of\nneurologic, neuroinflammatory, and psychiatric indications.\nBiohaven Labs\nKleo Pharmaceuticals, Inc. and Biohaven Labs\nIn January 2021, we acquired the remaining approximately 58% of Kleo that we did not previously own. We have assumed Kleo's laboratory facilities located in Science Park in New Haven, Connecticut and formed Biohaven Labs to serve as the integrated chemistry and discovery research arm of Biohaven. Biohaven Labs will continue several existing Kleo discovery partnerships, including one with the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation for the development of a of a SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing therapy for COVID-19 and one with PeptiDream for the development of immuno-oncology therapeutics (See Note 6).\nBiohaven's proprietary Multimodal Antibody Therapy Enhancer (\"MATE\") conjugation technology uses a new class of synthetic peptide binders to target the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 that are then selectively conjugated to commercially available intravenous immunoglobulin. The Biohaven synthetic binders for SARS-CoV2 were designed to establish a much wider area and number of contacts with the spike protein that other agents like monoclonal antibodies. In February 2021, we announced that BHV-1200, developed with Biohaven's proprietary MATE platform, has demonstrated functional binding and neutralization of the SARS-CoV-2 virus, including the strains known as the \"English\" and \"South African\" variants (also known as B.1.1.7 and B.1.351, respectively). The preliminary experiments conducted by Biohaven Labs and an academic collaborator demonstrated that BHV-1200 substantially reduced viral entry into cells. We intend to advance BHV-1200 into a full clinical development program. Accelerated development of the COVID-19 MATE program has been supported by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. In addition, the in vitro data indicated that BHV-1200 may activate important immune system components including antibody-dependent cellular phagocytosis and antibody dependent cellular cytotoxicity. We believe our proprietary MATE-conjugation technology could also be used against other infectious diseases by changing the targeting moiety of its antibody binders.\nOption and License Agreement with the University of Connecticut\nIn October 2018, we entered into an exclusive, worldwide option and license agreement (the \"UConn Agreement\") with the University of Connecticut (\"UConn\") for the development and commercialization rights to UC1MT, a therapeutic antibody targeting extracellular MT. Under this agreement, we have the option to acquire an exclusive, worldwide license to UC1MT and its underlying patents to develop and commercialize throughout the world in all human indications. If we choose to exercise the option, we would be obligated to pay UConn milestone\npayments upon the achievement of specified regulatory and commercial milestones, and royalties of a low single-digit percentage of net sales of licensed products.\nFox Chase Chemical Diversity Center, Inc.\nIn May 2019, we entered into an agreement with Fox Chase Chemical Diversity Center Inc. ( FCCDC\u201d) for FCCDC's TDP-43 assets (the FCCDC Agreement\u201d). The FCCDC Agreement provides us with a plan and goal to identify one or more new chemical entity candidates for preclinical development for eventual clinical evaluation for the treatment of one or more TDP-43 proteinopathies. In connection with the FCCDC Agreement, Biohaven and FCCDC have established a TDP-43 Research Plan that provides for certain milestones to be achieved by FCCDC, and milestone payments to be made by us (See Note 14).\nSosei Heptares\nIn November 2020, we entered into a global collaboration and license agreement with Sosei Heptares, an international biopharmaceutical group focused on the discovery and early development of new medicines originating from their proprietary GPCR-targeted StaR technology and structure-based drug design platform capabilities. Under the agreement, Sosei Heptares will be eligible to receive development, regulatory and commercialization milestone payments, as well as tiered royalties on net sales of products resulting from the collaboration. In return, we will receive exclusive global rights to develop, manufacture and commercialize a portfolio of novel, small-molecule CGRP receptor antagonists discovered by Sosei Heptares for the treatment of CGRP-mediated disorders (See Note 14).\nArtizan Biosciences, Inc.\nIn December 2020, we entered into an Option and License Agreement with Artizan Biosciences Inc (\"Artizan\"), a biotechnology company focused on addressing inflammatory diseases involving the human intestinal microbiota. Pursuant to the agreement, we acquired an option to obtain a royalty-based license from Artizan to manufacture, use and commercialize certain products. Artizan will use the proceeds to continue advancing the preclinical research and development of its lead program for inflammatory bowel disease, which is anticipated to enter the clinic in 2022, as well as to explore additional disease targets (See Note 14). In November 2021, we announced a collaborative therapeutic discovery and development program in Parkinson's disease (PD), to exploit recent scientific advances in the understanding of pathogenic roles played by the gut microbiome in PD\nBHV-1100\nIn the fourth quarter of 2021, Biohaven initiated a Phase 1a/1b trial in multiple myeloma patients using its antibody recruiting molecule (ARM) BHV-1100 in combination with autologous cytokine induced memory-\nlike (CIML) natural killer (NK) cells and immune globulin (IG) to target and kill multiple myeloma cells expressing the cell surface protein CD38. BHV-1100 is the lead clinical asset from Biohaven's Antibody Recruiting Molecule (ARMTM) Platform developed from a strategic alliance with PeptiDream Inc. (TYO: 4587). This clinical trial will assess the safety and tolerability as well as exploratory efficacy endpoints in newly diagnosed multiple myeloma patients who have tested positive for minimal residual disease (MRD+) in first remission prior to autologous stem cell transplant (ASCT).\nReliant Glycosciences, LLC\nIn July 2021, Biohaven entered into a development and license agreement with Reliant Glycosciences, LLC (\"Reliant\") for collaboration on a program with Biohaven Labs' multifunctional molecules to develop and commercialize conjugated antibodies for therapeutic uses relating to IgA nephropathy and treatment of other diseases and conditions. Under the Agreement, Reliant was entitled to an upfront share payment and will be eligible to receive development milestone payments and royalties of net sales of licensed products (See Note 14).\nKU Leuven\nIn January 2022, we entered into the KU Leuven Agreement to develop and commercialize first-in-class TRPM3 antagonists to address the growing proportion of people worldwide living with chronic pain disorders. The TRPM3 antagonist platform was discovered at the Centre for Drug Design and Discovery and the Laboratory of Ion Channel Research at KU Leuven. Under the KU Leuven Agreement, we receive exclusive global rights to develop, manufacture and commercialize KU Leuven's portfolio of small-molecule TRPM3 antagonists. The portfolio includes the lead candidate, henceforth known as BHV-2100, which has demonstrated promising efficacy in preclinical pain models and will be the first to advance towards Phase 1 studies. We will support further basic and translational research at KU Leuven on the role of TRPM3 in pain and other disorders (See Note 14).\nRecent Developments\nThe following is a summary of key developments affecting our business in 2021.\nPfizer Collaboration Agreement\nIn November 2021, we entered into the Collaboration Agreement with Pfizer, pursuant to which Pfizer would commercialize the Licensed Products in all countries worldwide outside of the United States. In consideration thereof, in January 2022 Pfizer made an upfront payment of $150.0 million to Biohaven upon receipt of the requisite regulatory approvals needed for the effectiveness of the Collaboration Agreement. In addition, in January 2022 Pfizer purchased $350.0 million worth of Biohaven common shares at approximately $173.05 per share, equal to 125% of the volume weighted average price per share for the 20\nconsecutive trading days prior to the signing. We will be eligible to receive an aggregate additional $740.0 million in contingent payments based on specified commercial and sales-based milestones for the Licensed Products.\nWe are also entitled to tiered, escalating royalties from the upper teens to twenty percent of net sales of Licensed Products in the Territory. In general, Pfizer's obligation to pay royalties continues on a product-by-product and country-by-country basis until the latest of ten years after the first commercial sale of such product in such country, the expiration of the patent rights covering such product in such country or the expiration of the period of exclusivity applicable to such product in such country. In addition to the upfront payments, contingent payments and royalties described above, Pfizer will also compensate us for a pro-rata share of certain of its sales-based milestone obligations owed to BMS under the BMS License, and related net sales royalties owed to BMS and RPI that result from Pfizer's commercialization and sale, respectively, of the Licensed Products in the Territory.\nMerger Agreement with BioShin\nOn November 9, 2021, we entered into an agreement and plan of merger (the Merger Agreement\u201d) with BioShin. The Merger Agreement provides for the merger of a wholly owned indirect subsidiary of the Company with and into BioShin, with BioShin surviving the merger as a wholly owned indirect subsidiary of the Company (the BioShin Merger\u201d). As a result of the satisfaction of the closing conditions described in the Merger Agreement, on January 6, 2022, each Series A convertible preferred share of BioShin, no par value, other than Excluded Shares (as defined in the Merger Agreement), was converted into the right to receive 0.080121 of a Company common share.\nAmendments to the Sixth Street Financing Agreement\nIn August 2020, the Company and Biohaven Pharmaceuticals, Inc., our wholly-owned subsidiary (together with the Company, the \"Borrowers\"), entered into a financing agreement, as amended, with Sixth Street Specialty Lending, Inc., as administrative agent, and the lenders party thereto (the \"Lenders\") pursuant to which the Lenders agreed to extend a senior secured credit facility to us providing for term loans in an aggregate principal amount up to $500.0 million, plus any capitalized interest paid in kind.

Biohaven will support further basic and translational research at KU Leuven on the role of TRPM3 in pain and other disorders. As consideration, KU Leuven received an an upfront cash payment of $3.0 million and 15,340 shares valued at $1.8 million, and is eligible to receive additional development, regulatory, and commercialization milestones payments of up to $327.8 million. In addition, KU Leuven will be eligible to receive mid-single digit royalties on net sales of products resulting from the collaboration.\nKv7 Platform Acquisition\nIn February 2022, we announced that we entered into a definitive agreement with Channel Biosciences, LLC, a subsidiary of Knopp Biosciences, LLC, to acquire a Kv7 channel targeting platform, adding the latest advances in ion-channel modulation to our growing neuroscience portfolio. BHV-7000 (formerly known as KB-3061) is the lead asset from the Kv7 platform and is a potentially best-in-class potassium channel activator with a profile suggestive of a wide therapeutic index, high selectivity, and significantly reduced GABA-ergic activity. We intend to bring BHV-7000 to the clinic in in 2022 in preparation for a development program in focal epilepsy. In consideration for the transaction, we will make an upfront payment comprised of $65 million in Biohaven common shares and $35 million in cash to Knopp Biosciences. We have also agreed to make additional success-based earnout payments (i) up to $325 million based on BHV-7000 developmental and regulatory epilepsy milestones through approvals in the US, EU and Japan, (ii) up to an additional $250 million based on developmental and regulatory milestones for the Kv7 pipeline development in other indications and additional country approvals, and (iii) up to $562.5 million for commercial sales-based milestones of BHV-7000. Biohaven has also agreed to make scaled royalty payments for BHV-7000 and the pipeline programs, starting at high single digits and peaking at low teens for BHV-7000 and starting at mid-single digits and peaking at low double-digits for the pipeline programs.\nTaldefgrobep Alfa Platform License\nIn February 2022, following the transfer of intellectual property we announced that we entered into a worldwide license agreement with BMS for the development and commercialization rights to taldefgrobep alfa, a novel, Phase 3-ready anti-myostatin adnectin. The in-licensing of taldefgrobep expands our portfolio of innovative, late-stage product candidates for the treatment of neurologic, neuroinflammatory, and psychiatric indications. Under the terms of the agreement, we will receive worldwide rights to taldefgrobep alfa and BMS will be eligible for regulatory approval milestone payments, as well as tiered, sales-based royalty percentages from the high teens to the low twenties (Note 14). We plan to initiate a Phase 3 clinical trial of taldefgrobep alfa in SMA in 2022.\nCOVID-19 Update\nA novel strain of coronavirus (COVID-19) was first identified in Wuhan, China in December 2019, and subsequently declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization. To date, COVID-19 has surfaced in nearly all regions around the world and resulted in travel restrictions and business slowdowns or shutdowns in affected areas.\nAlthough, as of the date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we do not expect any material impact on our long-term activity, the extent to which COVID-19 impacts our business will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted, including new information which may emerge concerning the severity of COVID-19 and the actions to contain COVID-19 or treat its impact, among others, including government-imposed quarantines, travel restrictions and other public health safety measures.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic may impair our commercialization of NURTEC ODT. The spread of COVID-19 may reduce demand for NURTEC ODT. In response to regional quarantines, health professionals may reduce staffing and reduce or postpone appointments with patients, or patients may cancel or miss appointments, resulting in less prescriptions of NURTEC ODT than projected, thereby adversely affecting our revenues. In addition, in connection with the recent FDA approval of NURTEC ODT, we have been making presentations to physicians regarding the efficacy of NURTEC ODT but as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, we have needed to and may continue to need to conduct some or all of these key meetings with medical professionals solely by virtual means instead of in-person, which could reduce the number of medical professionals we are able to present to, and we cannot guarantee that any such virtual meetings will be as successful as in-person meetings. Moreover, restrictions on travel and transport may result in disruptions in NURTEC ODT distribution. Such events may result in a period of business disruption, and in reduced operations, any of which could materially affect\nour business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe continued spread of COVID-19 could also adversely impact our clinical trial operations. For example, we may be unable to enroll or retain an adequate number of patients to commence or complete our clinical trials, data may be missing, the FDA may delay or terminate clinical trials for any of our product candidates, or primary outcome measures may be impacted. As a result, our ability to generate product revenue from sales of any of those product candidates may be delayed or not realized at all.\nBusiness interruptions from the current or future pandemics may also adversely impact the third parties we rely on to sufficiently manufacture NURTEC ODT and to produce our product candidates in quantities we require, which may impair the commercialization of NURTEC ODT and our research and development activities.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic and responses to its spread have negatively impacted the global economy, disrupted global supply chains, and created significant volatility and disruption of financial markets. This significant disruption of the global financial markets could reduce our ability to access equity or debt capital on attractive terms if at all, which in turn could negatively affect our liquidity. In addition, a recession or market correction resulting from the spread of COVID-19 could materially affect our business and the value of our common shares.\nWe have taken numerous steps, and will continue to take further actions, in our approach to addressing the COVID-19 pandemic. We have implemented internal controls to contemplate a remote work environment and our incident management teams are in place to respond to changes in our work environment quickly and effectively. As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, we have instructed most of our employees to work from home. In April 2020, we announced a collaboration with Cove in order to facilitate telemedicine evaluation for migraine sufferers while patients are increasingly looking to remote evaluations during this time of unprecedented decreased access to routine office visits.\nWe continue to monitor the rapidly evolving situation and guidance from international and domestic authorities, including federal, state and local public health authorities and may take additional actions based on their recommendations. In these circumstances, there may be developments outside our control requiring us to adjust our operating plan. As such, given the dynamic nature of this situation, we cannot reasonably estimate the impacts of COVID-19 on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nComponents of Our Results of Operations\nProduct Revenues, Net\nWe began to recognize revenue from product sales, net of rebates, chargebacks, discounts and other adjustments, in March 2020 in conjunction with the launch of our first product, NURTEC ODT. We will continue to evaluate trends related to revenue momentum for NURTEC ODT, including any discernible impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic. If our development efforts for our other product candidates are successful and result in regulatory approval, or additional license agreements with third parties, we may generate additional revenue in the future from product sales.\nCost of Goods Sold\nCost of goods sold includes direct and indirect costs related to the manufacturing and distribution of NURTEC, including third-party manufacturing costs, packaging services, freight-in, third-party royalties payable on our net product revenues and amortization of intangible assets associated with NURTEC ODT.\nOperating Expenses\nResearch and Development Expenses\nResearch and development expenses consist primarily of costs incurred in connection with the development of our product candidates. We expense research and development costs as incurred. These expenses include:\n\u2022expenses incurred under agreements with contract research organizations ( CROs\u201d) or contract manufacturing organizations ( CMOs\u201d), as well as investigative sites and consultants that conduct our clinical trials, preclinical studies and other scientific development services;\n\u2022manufacturing scale-up expenses and the cost of acquiring and manufacturing preclinical and clinical trial materials and commercial materials, including manufacturing validation batches;\n\u2022employee-related expenses, including salaries, benefits, travel and non-cash share-based compensation expense for employees engaged in research and development functions;\n\u2022costs related to compliance with regulatory requirements;\n\u2022development milestone payments incurred prior to regulatory approval of the product candidate;\n\u2022payments made in cash, equity securities or other forms of consideration under third-party licensing agreements prior to\nregulatory approval of the product candidate; and\nWe recognize external development costs based on an evaluation of the progress to completion of specific tasks using estimates of our clinical personnel or information provided to us by our service providers.\nOur external direct research and development expenses are tracked on a program-by-program basis for our product candidates and consist primarily of external costs, such as fees paid to outside consultants, CROs, contract manufacturing organizations, and central laboratories in connection with our preclinical development, process development, manufacturing and clinical development activities. Our direct research and development expenses by program also include fees and certain development milestones incurred under license agreements. We do not allocate employee costs or other indirect costs, to specific programs because these costs are deployed across multiple programs and, as such, are not separately classified. We use internal resources primarily to oversee the research and development as well as for managing our preclinical development, process development, manufacturing and clinical development activities. Many employees work across multiple programs, and we do not track personnel costs by program.\nProduct candidates in later stages of clinical development generally have higher development costs than those in earlier stages of clinical development, primarily due to the increased size and duration of later-stage clinical trials. As a result, we expect that our research and development expenses will remain significant over the next several years as we increase personnel costs conduct clinical trials and prepare regulatory filings for our product candidates. We also expect to incur additional expenses related to milestone and royalty payments payable to third parties with whom we have entered into license agreements to acquire the rights to our product candidates.\nThe successful development and commercialization of our product candidates is highly uncertain. At this time, we cannot reasonably estimate or know the nature, timing and costs of the efforts that will be necessary to complete the preclinical and clinical development of any of our product candidates or when, if ever, material net cash inflows may commence from any of our product candidates. This uncertainty is due to the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with product development and commercialization, including the uncertainty of:\n\u2022the scope, progress, outcome and costs of our preclinical development activities, clinical trials and other research and development activities;\n\u2022establishment of an appropriate safety profile with IND-enabling studies;\n\u2022successful patient enrollment in, and the initiation and completion of, clinical trials;\n\u2022the timing, receipt and terms of any marketing approvals from applicable regulatory authorities;\n\u2022establishment of commercial manufacturing capabilities or making arrangements with third-party manufacturers;\n\u2022development and timely delivery of commercial-grade drug formulations that can be used in our clinical trials and for commercial launch;\n\u2022acquisition, maintenance, defense and enforcement of patent claims and other intellectual property rights;\n\u2022significant and changing government regulation;\n\u2022initiation of commercial sales of our product candidates, if and when approved, whether alone or in collaboration with others; and\n\u2022maintenance of a continued acceptable safety profile of the product candidates following approval.\nSelling, General and Administrative Expenses\nSelling, general and administrative expenses consist primarily of personnel costs, including salaries, benefits and travel expenses for our executive, commercial, finance, business, commercial, corporate development and other administrative functions; and non-cash share-based compensation expense. Selling, general and administrative expenses also include facilities and other related expenses, including rent, depreciation, maintenance of facilities, insurance and supplies; professional fees for expenses incurred under agreements with third parties relating to the commercialization of NURTEC ODT; and for public relations, audit, tax and legal services, including legal expenses to pursue patent protection of our intellectual property.\nWe anticipate that our selling, general and administrative expenses, including payroll and related expenses, will remain significant in the future as we continue to expand our operations and organizational capabilities, continue to support our commercial activities associated with NURTEC ODT, and prepare for potential commercialization of our product candidates, if successfully developed and approved. We also anticipate increased expenses associated with general operations, including costs related to accounting and legal services, director and officer insurance premiums, facilities and other corporate infrastructure and office-related costs, such as information technology costs.\nOther Income (Expense)\nInterest Expense\nInterest expense primarily consists of interest on our outstanding term loan with Sixth Street Specialty Lending, Inc., which includes interest expense on the outstanding loan balance, accretion of the debt discount and amortization of issuance costs. Our interest expense also includes implied interest on our finance leases associated with our commercial car fleet. We utilize the effective interest method to determine our interest expense on the term loan and finance leases and the straight-line method for the amortization of the debt issuance costs.\nInterest Expense on Mandatorily Redeemable Preferred Shares\nInterest expense on mandatorily redeemable preferred shares is being recognized in connection with the issuance of series A preferred shares and series B preferred shares pursuant to the Series A preferred share purchase agreement and Series B preferred shares forward contracts we entered into with RPI. Since we are required to redeem the series A preferred shares for 2x the original purchase price in equal quarterly installments by December 31, 2024 and the series B preferred shares for 1.77x the original purchase price in equal installments beginning on March 31, 2025 and ending December 31, 2030, we concluded that the Series A preferred shares and Series B preferred shares are mandatorily redeemable instruments and initially classified the preferred shares at their fair value as a liability. Interest expense on the mandatorily redeemable preferred shares represents the accretion of the carrying value of the preferred shares liability to its redemption value using the effective interest rate method.\nChange in Fair Value of Derivatives\nThe fair value of the derivative liability recognized in connection with contingent payments under the Series A Preferred Share Agreement is determined using the with-and-without valuation method. As inputs into the valuation, we considered the type and probability of occurrence of certain events, the amount of the payments, the expected timing of certain events, and a risk-adjusted discount rate. In accordance with ASC 815, Derivatives and Hedging, the fair value of the derivative is recorded on the consolidated balance sheet as a Series A preferred derivative liability with changes in fair value recorded in other income (expense) in the consolidated statements of operations.\nThe fair value of the derivative liability recognized in connection with the Series B Preferred Shares Forward Contracts is determined using discounted cash flow and Monte Carlo valuation methods. As inputs into the valuation, we considered the probability of occurrence of certain change of control events, the amount of the payments, the expected timing of certain events, and a risk-adjusted discount rate. In accordance\nwith ASC 815, Derivatives and Hedging, the fair value of the derivative is recorded on the consolidated balance sheet as a Series B preferred shares forward contact with changes in fair value recorded in other income (expense) in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss.\nInterest Expense on Liability Related to Sale of Future Royalties\nWe have accounted for the 2018 RPI Funding Agreement and a unit of accounting of the 2020 RPI Funding Agreement with RPI Trust both as liability financings, primarily because they have significant continuing involvement in generating the future revenue on which the royalties are based. The liabilities related to sale of future royalties and the related non-cash interest expense are measured based on our current estimate of the timing and amount of future royalties expected to be paid over the estimated terms of the 2018 RPI Funding Agreement and 2020 RPI Funding Agreement. The liabilities are amortized using the effective interest rate method, resulting in recognition of non-cash interest expense over the estimated term of the agreement. Each reporting period, we assess the estimated timing and amount of future expected royalty payments over the estimated terms. If there is a change to one of the estimates, we recognize the impact to the liability's amortization schedule and the related non-cash interest expense prospectively. Our estimate of the amount of expected future royalties to be paid considers the probability of success of compounds not yet approved for sale, and market penetration rates, compliance rate, and net pricing of both NURTEC ODT and compounds not yet approved for sale. Additionally, the transaction costs associated with the liabilities will be amortized to non-cash interest expense over the estimated term of the 2018 RPI Funding Agreement and 2020 RPI Funding Agreement, respectively.\nGain (Loss) from Equity Method Investment\nPrior to our acquisition of Kleo in January 2021, we owned approximately 42% of the outstanding shares as of December 31, 2020, and accounted for our investment in Kleo under the equity method of accounting. As a result, our proportionate share of Kleo's net income or loss each reporting period was included in other income (expense), net, in our consolidated statement of operations and results in a corresponding adjustment to the carrying value of the equity method investment on our consolidated balance sheet.\nOn January 4, 2021, we acquired the rest of the shares of Kleo, and post-transaction we own 100% of the outstanding shares of Kleo.\nProvision for Income Taxes\nAs a company incorporated in the British Virgin Islands ( BVI\u201d), we are principally subject to taxation in the BVI. Under the current laws of the BVI, tax on a company's income is assessed at a zero percent tax rate. As a result, we have not recorded any income tax\nbenefits from losses incurred in the BVI during each reporting period, and no net operating loss carryforwards will be available to us for those losses. We have historically outsourced all of the research and clinical development for our programs under a master services agreement with our wholly owned subsidiary, Biohaven Pharmaceuticals, Inc., a Delaware corporation ( BPI\u201d). As a result of providing services under this agreement and profit from US commercial sales of NURTEC ODT, BPI was profitable during the year ended December 31, 2021, and BPI is subject to taxation in the United States.\nIn August 2020, we completed an intra-entity asset transfer of certain of our intellectual property to our Irish subsidiary. As a result of the transfer, we recorded a deferred tax asset of $875.0 million for the step up in tax basis received pursuant to Irish tax law. Based on our analysis of all available objective evidence, we concluded that it was more likely than not that the deferred tax asset from the intra-entity transfer will not be realized due to the lack of net operating income history of our subsidiary. Therefore, we established a full valuation allowance against our net deferred tax asset in Ireland.\nWe continue to maintain a valuation allowance against our US deferred tax assets. We periodically review our position and have determined that a full valuation allowance on these assets was appropriate due to excess research and development (\"R&D\") credit carryforwards as of December 31, 2021. We will continue to evaluate the need for a valuation allowance on our deferred tax assets until there is sufficient positive evidence to support the reversal of all or some portion of these allowances. We anticipate the commercialization of NURTEC ODT will result in future earnings and believe sufficient positive evidence may become available to allow us to reach a conclusion that a significant portion, or all, of the valuation allowance will no longer be needed. Release of the valuation allowance would result in the recognition of certain deferred tax assets and a decrease to income tax expense for the period the release is recorded. However, the exact timing and amount of the valuation allowance release is subject to change on the basis of the level of profitability that we are able to actually achieve.\nIn January 2021, we completed the acquisition of Kleo. The acquisition and inclusion of Kleo did not result in a material impact on the provision for income taxes or the effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2021. We recorded a full valuation allowance against our Kleo US deferred tax assets and will periodically review our position and have determined that a full valuation allowance on these assets was appropriate due to Kleo's cumulative loss history. We will continue to evaluate the need for a valuation allowance on our deferred tax assets until there is sufficient positive evidence to support the reversal of all or some portion of these allowances.\nWe recorded an income tax provision during the year ended December 31, 2021 of $5.1 million which primarily represents certain state taxes for the period and US federal taxes due to general business credit limitations.\nResults of Operations\nComparison of the Years Ended December 31, 2021 and 2020\nThe following table summarizes our results of operations for the years ended

commercial launch in the U.S. in March 2020. Net product revenue was $462.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, compared to $63.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. The increase of $398.9 million in net product revenues was due to both increased NURTEC ODT sales volume and improvements in net price realization due to decreases in sales allowances in 2021, compared to 2020, and a full year of NURTEC ODT sales during 2021 compared to a partial period of NURTEC ODT sales in 2020. Sales allowances and accruals mostly consisted of patient affordability programs, distribution fees and rebates.\nCost of Goods Sold\nCost of goods sold of $91.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 is primarily related to\nroyalties on net sales payable to BMS under a license agreement, manufacturing costs for NURTEC ODT, certain distribution costs and amortization of intangible assets related to milestone payments to BMS and Catalent. The increase of $74.0 million in cost of goods sold was primarily due to increased NURTEC ODT sales during the year ended December 31, 2021, compared to the year ended December 31, 2020, which had no material manufacturing costs included as the majority of the costs were incurred prior to FDA approval and as such recorded as research and development expense.\nResearch and Development Expenses Table 10: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Year Ended December 31, </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>In thousands </td> <td> </td> <td>2021 </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>Change </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Direct research and development expenses by program: </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Rimegepant </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>65,394 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>53,838 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>11,556 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Troriluzole </td> <td> </td> <td>50,637 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>42,127 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>8,510 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Zavegepant </td> <td> </td> <td>54,717 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>36,836 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>17,881 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Verdiperstat </td> <td> </td> <td>34,518 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>24,987 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>9,531 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other programs </td> <td> </td> <td>4,329 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>383 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3,946 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Unallocated research and development costs: </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Personnel related (including non-cash share-based compensation) </td> <td> </td> <td>105,182 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>52,248 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>52,934 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Preclinical research programs </td> <td> </td> <td>29,031 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>12,092 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>16,939 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other </td> <td> </td> <td>17,532 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6,487 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>11,045 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total research and development expenses </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>361,340 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>228,998 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>132,342 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nR&D expenses, including non-cash share-based compensation costs, were $361.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, compared to $229.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. The increase of $132.3 million was primarily due to:\n\u2022a $52.9 million increase in personnel costs, driven by a $28.4 million increase in share-based compensation expense, as well as increases in headcount, merit increases and bonuses;\n\u2022increased expenses from later stage trials in our zavegepant programs of $17.9 million, which included a partial offset related to a $30.8 million reduction in our obligation to perform R&D services for zavegepant; and\n\u2022increases in preclinical research costs of $16.9 million, which included upfront payments of $2.0 million to Yale University in connection with a license agreement, $5.9 million to Moda Pharmaceuticals LLC in connection with a consulting agreement, and $3.7 million to Reliant Glycosciences, LLC in connection with a development and license agreement;\n\u2022increases in direct costs of $11.6 million, $9.5 million and $8.5 million for our rimegepant, verdiperstat and troriluzole programs, respectively, in 2021; and\n\u2022increases of $11.0 million in various other unallocated R&D costs.\nSelling, General and Administrative Expenses\nSG&A expenses, including non-cash share-based compensation costs, were $713.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, compared to $462.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. The increase of $251.2 million was primarily due to increased spending to support the continued launch of NURTEC ODT, including the launch of NURTEC ODT for the\npreventative treatment of migraine which was approved by the FDA in May of 2021. The increased spending included increases in marketing and advertising expenses, professional fees and non-cash share based compensation. Less than half of the SG&A expense was for commercial organization personnel costs, excluding non-cash share-based compensation expense. The increase of $41.3 million in non-cash share based compensation expense was primarily due to our annual equity incentive awards that were granted in the first quarter of 2021.\nOther Income (Expense), Net\nOther income (expense), net was a net expense of $139.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, compared to net expense of $113.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. The increase of $26.3 million in net expense was primarily due to increased interest expense on our term loans with Sixth Street, which were drawn in the third quarter of 2020 and the third quarter of 2021, an increase in the interest expense recognized on our liability related to the sale of future royalties, and increased interest expense on our liability related to the mandatorily redeemable preferred shares resulting from the sale of Series A Preferred Shares to RPI in April 2019. These increases were partially offset by a change in gain (loss) on equity investment of $9.4 million, primarily due to the acquisition of Kleo Pharmaceuticals, Inc. in the first quarter of 2021, and a $16.5 million decrease in expense related to changes in the fair value of our derivatives.\nProvision for Income Taxes\nWe recorded a provision for income taxes of $5.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, compared to a provision for income taxes of $10.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. The tax provision recorded for the year ended December 31, 2021 was primarily attributable to our profitable operations in the United States during the year.\nComparison of the Years Ended December

following the approval of NURTEC ODT by the FDA on February 27, 2020 and its subsequent commercial launch in the U.S. in March 2020. During the year ended December 31, 2020, we recognized $63.6 million of net product revenues related to sales of NURTEC ODT. Sales allowances and accruals mostly consisted of co-pay card discounts, distribution fees and rebates.\nCost of Goods Sold\nCost of goods sold of $17.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 is related to royalties on net sales payable to BMS under a license agreement (see Note 17 \"Commitments and Contingencies\" to our consolidated financial statements), product costs\nincurred after FDA approval, certain distribution costs and amortization of intangible assets related to milestone payments to BMS and Catalent, Inc. (\"Catalent\"). See Note 14 \"License and Other Agreements\" to our consolidated financial statements. Prior to receiving initial FDA approval for NURTEC ODT on February 27, 2020, we manufactured NURTEC ODT inventory to be sold upon commercialization and recorded all costs incurred as research and development expense. As a result, the manufacturing costs related to the NURTEC inventory build-up incurred before FDA approval were already expensed in a prior period and are therefore excluded from the cost of goods sold for the year ended December 31, 2020. These previously expensed costs were not material for the year ended December 31, 2020. The inventory build-up incurred before FDA approval was sold prior to the start of the fourth quarter of 2020.\nResearch and Development Expenses Table 12: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Year Ended December 31, </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>In thousands </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>Change </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Direct research and development expenses by program: </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>BHV-0223\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>172 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>849 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(677) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Troriluzole </td> <td> </td> <td>42,127 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>37,812 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4,315 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Rimegepant </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Priority review voucher </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>105,000 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(105,000) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Program expenses' </td> <td> </td> <td>53,838 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>88,948 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(35,110) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Zavegepant </td> <td> </td> <td>36,836 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>44,821 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(7,985) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>BHV-5000 </td> <td> </td> <td>211 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>850 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(639) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Verdiperstat </td> <td> </td> <td>24,987 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>10,922 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>14,065 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Unallocated research and development costs: </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Personnel related (including share-based compensation) </td> <td> </td> <td>52,248 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>45,683 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6,565 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Preclinical research programs </td> <td> </td> <td>12,092 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6,193 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5,899 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other </td> <td> </td> <td>6,487 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3,595 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,892 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total research and development expenses </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>228,998 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>344,673 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(115,675) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nResearch and development expenses including one-time regulatory and license fees were $229.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to $344.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The decrease of $115.7 million was primarily due to:\n\u2022one-time $105.0 million purchase of a priority review voucher to expedite the regulatory review of rimegepant ODT formulation in the second quarter of 2019;\n\u2022filing fees of $7.6 million related to our rimegepant NDA submissions to the FDA in the second quarter of 2019;\n\u2022development milestones payable to BMS of $11.5 million for rimegepant NDA submissions in 2019;\n\u2022non-cash research and development expense of $5.6 million due to issuance of common shares in the second quarter of 2019 relating to the collaborative discovery program with Fox Chase;\n\u2022decreases in direct costs of $8.0 million for our zavegepant program, mainly due to expenses for development milestones payable to BMS of $10.0 million in 2019;\n\u2022increases in direct costs of $4.3 million for our troriluzole program in 2020, which include increases for our OCD, and Alzheimer's Disease trials;\n\u2022increases in direct costs of $14.1 million for our verdiperstat program in 2020; and\n\u2022increases in personnel costs of $6.6 million mainly due to an increase of $8.4 million in non-\ncash share-based compensation in 2020 as a result of additional share-based compensation awards, hiring additional research and development personnel, and the implementation of the Employee Share Purchase Plan.\n\u2022increases due to the global collaboration and license agreement with Sosei Heptares, which included an upfront cash payment of $5.0 million and the issuance 54,617 shares valued at $4.9 million to Sosei Heptares.\nSelling, General and Administrative Expenses\nSelling, general and administrative expenses were $462.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to $134.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase of $327.9 million was primarily due to an increase in spending to support the commercial launch of NURTEC ODT. Less than half of the SG&A expense was for commercial organization personnel costs, excluding non-cash share-based compensation expense. Non-cash share-based compensation expense, included in personnel related costs, was $33.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, an increase of $5.0 million as compared to the same period in 2019.\nOther Income (Expense), Net\nOther income (expense), net was a net expense of $113.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to net expense of $49.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase of $63.7 million in net expense was primarily due to interest expense on our outstanding term loan with Sixth Street Specialty Lending, Inc, the non-cash interest expense on our liability related to the mandatorily redeemable preferred shares resulting from the sale of Series A Preferred\nShares to RPI in April 2019, an increase in the non-cash interest expense recognized on our liability related to the sale of future royalties, and an increase in the change in fair value of derivative liability related to the Series B Preferred Shares Forward Contracts.\nProvision for Income Taxes\nWe recorded a provision for income taxes of $10.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to a provision for income taxes of $0.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The provision for income taxes is comprised of $5.0 million relating to US federal and state income taxes for BPI's profitable operations in the United States and $5.2 million of uncertain tax benefits recognized in the period December 31, 2020.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nSince our inception, we have incurred significant operating losses and negative cash flows from our operations. We have funded our operations primarily with proceeds from sales of our common and preferred equity, sales of revenue participation rights related to future royalties, a senior secured credit facility and the Collaboration Agreement with Pfizer. In addition, we began to generate net product revenue in the first\nquarter of 2020 in conjunction with the launch of our first product, NURTEC ODT.\nWe continuously assess our working capital needs, capital expenditure requirements and future investments or acquisitions. As of February 25, 2022, we expect that our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities as of December 31, 2021, our future operating cash flows from sales of NURTEC ODT, $125.0 million in potential future borrowings under our credit facility, proceeds related to the settlement of our Series B preferred shares forward contracts, potential sales of common shares under the Equity Distribution Agreement in 2022, and the $500.0 million in proceeds received on January 4, 2022 and potential milestone payments from the strategic collaboration with Pfizer will be sufficient sources of cash to meet our cash needs for more than one year.\nAs of December 31, 2021, we had cash and cash equivalents of $171.9 million, excluding restricted cash of $2.4 million. Cash in excess of immediate requirements is invested in marketable securities with a view to liquidity and capital preservation. As of December 31, 2021, we had marketable securities of $192.6 million.\nCash Flows\nThe following table summarizes our cash flows for each of the periods presented: Table 13: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Year Ended December 31, </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>In thousands </td> <td> </td> <td>2021 </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash used in operating activities </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(831,100) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(702,879) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(377,331) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash provided by (used in) investing activities </td> <td> </td> <td>26,552 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(269,880) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(3,784) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash provided by financing activities </td> <td> </td> <td>844,849 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>788,824 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>434,593 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Effect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash </td> <td> </td> <td>(189) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>439 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net increase (decrease) in cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>40,112 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(183,496) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>53,478 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nOperating Activities\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2021, we used $831.1 million of cash in operating activities, an increase of $128.2 million as compared to the year ended December 31, 2020. The increase in cash usage was primarily due to an increase in SG&A expenses due to increased costs, including advertising, to support the commercial growth of NURTEC ODT and an increase in R&D expenses to support our portfolio of late stage product candidates and preclinical assets, partially offset by an increase in cash receipts from an increase in net product revenue from sales of NURTEC ODT. The increase in cash usage was also due to $62.5 million in payments to RPI for the mandatory redemption of 624 Series A preferred shares, which were accounted for as payments of accrued interest on the mandatorily redeemable preferred shares liability.\nInvesting Activities\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2021, net cash provided by investing activities was $26.6 million, an increase of $296.4 million as compared to the year ended December 31, 2020. The increase was primarily due to an increase of $126.6 million of sales and maturities of marketable securities, a decrease of $126.1 million of purchases of marketable securities, and a decrease of $41.5 million of payments for intangible assets during the year ended December 31, 2021. The $41.5 million of payments for intangible assets during the year ended December 31, 2020 are milestone payments related to the FDA approval and launch of NURTEC ODT.\nFinancing Activities\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2021, net cash provided by financing activities was $844.8 million, an increase of $56.0 million compared to the year ended\nDecember 31, 2020. The increase was primarily due to an increase of $97.9 million of R&D funding, $75.0 million of long-term debt and $70.4 million for the issuance of Series B preferred shares all in the year ended December 31, 2021 partially offset by $147.5 million from the sale of future royalties and $60.0 million from the sale of contingently redeemable non-controlling interests during the year ended December 31, 2020.\nPfizer Collaboration Agreement\nIn November 2021, we entered into the Collaboration Agreement with Pfizer, pursuant to which Pfizer would commercialize the Licensed Products in all countries worldwide outside of the United States. In consideration thereof, in January 2022 Pfizer made an upfront payment of $150.0 million to Biohaven upon receipt of the requisite regulatory approvals needed for the effectiveness of the Collaboration Agreement. In addition, in January 2022 Pfizer purchased $350.0 million worth of Biohaven common shares at approximately $173.05 per share. We will be eligible to receive an aggregate additional $740.0 million in contingent payments based on specified commercial and sales-based milestones for the Licensed Products.\nWe are also entitled to tiered, escalating royalties from the upper teens to twenty percent of net sales of Licensed Products in the Territory. In general, Pfizer's obligation to pay royalties continues on a product-by-product and country-by-country basis until the latest of ten years after the first commercial sale of such product in such country, the expiration of the patent rights covering such product in such country or the expiration of the period of exclusivity applicable to such product in such country. In addition to the upfront payments, contingent payments and royalties described above, Pfizer will also compensate us for a pro-rata share of certain of our sales-based milestone obligations owed to BMS under the BMS License, and related net sales royalties owed to BMS and RPI that result from Pfizer's commercialization and sale, respectively, of the Licensed Products in the Territory.\nCredit Facility\nIn August 2020, we entered into a financing agreement, as amended, with the Lenders pursuant to which the Lenders agreed to extend a senior secured credit facility to the Company providing for term loans in an aggregate principal amount up to $500.0 million, plus any capitalized interest paid in kind. We drew an initial term loan of $275.0 million at closing in August 2020 (the \"Initial Term Loan\"), and had $100.0 million of immediately available delayed draw term loan commitments and $125.0 million of delayed draw term loan commitments available upon achievement of the Delay Draw Sales Milestone (as defined in the Sixth Street Financing Agreement).\nIn March 2021, we entered into Amendment No. 1 (the First Amendment\u201d) to the financing agreement\npursuant to which the parties agreed to, among other things, remove the Delayed Draw Sales Milestone tied to the availability of the $125.0 million tranche of delayed draw term loans. In August 2021, we drew the $125.0 million tranche of delayed draw term loans (the \"DDTL-2).\nIn September 2021, we entered into Amendment No. 2 (the Second Amendment\u201d) to the financing agreement. Pursuant to the Second Amendment, the parties agreed to, among other things, increase the size of the credit facility by providing for additional term loans in an aggregate principal amount of $250.0 million for a total facility size of $750.0 million plus any capitalized interest paid in kind. At closing of the Second Amendment, we drew an initial term loan of $125.0 million (the \"2021 Term Loan\") and $100.0 million of delayed draw term loan commitments (the \"DDTL-1\"). The remaining $125.0 million in delayed draw term loan commitments (the \"2021 DDTL Commitment\") was available to be drawn by the Borrowers until December 31, 2021 (the \"Delayed Draw Term Loan Commitment Termination Date\").\nIn November 2021, we entered into Amendment No. 3 and Limited Consent to Financing Agreement ( the Third Amendment and Limited Consent\u201d) to our Sixth Street Financing Agreement. Pursuant to the Third Amendment and Limited Consent, the Lenders consented to our entry into the Collaboration Agreement with Pfizer.\nIn December 2021, we entered into Amendment No. 4 (the \"Fourth Amendment\") to the financing agreement (as previously amended and as amended by the Fourth Amendment, the Sixth Street Financing Agreement\u201d), pursuant to which the parties agreed to, among other things, extend the Delayed Draw Term Loan Commitment Termination Date to June 30, 2022.\n2020 Loans\nIn August 2020, we borrowed the Initial Term Loan for total proceeds of $262.2 million, net of discounts and issuance costs. In August 2021, we borrowed the DDTL-2 for total proceeds of $123.8 million, net of discounts and issuance costs. The DDTL-2 was borrowed under the same financing terms as the Initial Term Loan. The Initial Term Loan and the DDTL-2 (collectively, the \"August 2020 Loans\") become due and payable in August 2025. The August 2020 Loans accrue interest at a variable rate, with interest paid on a quarterly basis. The interest rate on the August 2020 Loans as of December 31, 2021 was 10.0%. We have the option to pay-in-kind up to 4.0% interest per annum for the first two years and have elected to pay-in-kind the maximum amount for all interest payments as of December 31, 2021. The proceeds from the August 2020 Loans are being used for general corporate purposes.\n2021 Loans\nIn September 2021, we borrowed the 2021 Term Loan for total proceeds of $119.7 million and the DDTL-1\nfor total proceeds of $97.8 million, both net of discounts and issuance costs. The 2021 Term Loan and the DDTL-1 (collectively, the \"September 2021 Loans\") become due and payable in September 2026. The September 2021 Loans accrue interest at a variable rate, with interest paid on a quarterly basis. The interest rate on the September 2021 Loans as of December 31, 2021 was 9.25%. We have the option to pay-in-kind up to 4.0% interest per annum for the first two years that the loans are outstanding. The proceeds from the September 2021 Loans are being used for general corporate purposes.\nAs of December 31, 2021, we have $125.0 million in delayed draw term loan commitments still available to borrow under the Sixth Street Financing Agreement until June 30, 2022. If drawn, the loans will be borrowed under the same financing terms as the September 2021 Loans.\nEquity Distribution Agreement\nIn December 2020, we entered into an equity distribution agreement in which we may offer and sell common shares having an aggregate offering price of up to $400.0 million from time to time through or to the sales agents, acting as our agents or principals (the \"Equity Distribution Agreement\"). Sales of our common shares, if any, will be made in sales deemed to be at the market offerings\u201d. The sales agents are not required to sell any specific amount of securities but will act as our sales agents using commercially reasonable efforts consistent with their normal trading and sales practices, on mutually agreed terms between the sales agents and us. We currently plan to use the net proceeds from the offering for general corporate purposes.\nAs of December 31, 2021, we have issued and sold 939,328 common shares for net proceeds of approximately $78.7 million all in the first quarter of 2021 under the Equity Distribution Agreement.\nSeries B Preferred Shares Forward Contracts\nIn August 2020, we entered into the Series B preferred share agreement, whereby RPI will invest in the Company through the purchase of up to 3,992 Series B preferred shares at a price of $50,100 per share for aggregate proceeds of approximately $200.0 million (the \"RPI Series B Preferred Share Agreement\"). The shares will be issued in quarterly increments from March 31, 2021 to December 31, 2024. We are required to redeem the Series B Preferred Shares for 1.77 times the original purchase price, payable beginning March 31, 2025 in equal quarterly installments through December 31, 2030. The gross proceeds from the transaction with RPI will be used for the clinical development of zavegepant and other general corporate purposes.\nAs of December 31, 2021, we have issued 1,406 Series B preferred shares to RPI for proceeds of $70.4 million.\nFunding Requirements\nWe expect our expenses to increase in connection with our ongoing activities, particularly as we advance and expand preclinical activities, clinical trials and commercialization of our product candidates. Our costs will also increase as we:\n\u2022continue and expand our commercial activities related to NURTEC ODT for the acute treatment of migraine;\n\u2022advance and expand the development of our CGRP and glutamate modulation platform product candidates and continue development of our MPO platform;\n\u2022conduct ongoing Phase 2 proof of concept trial to evaluate the safety and efficacy of rimegepant in patients with treatment refractory trigeminal neuralgia;\n\u2022complete the ongoing extension phase of the Phase 2/3 clinical trial of troriluzole in SCA and our ongoing Phase 3 trials of troriluzole in OCD, and complete our ongoing Phase 3 randomized controlled trial to assess the efficacy of troriluzole in SCA;\n\u2022conduct support activities for future clinical trials of BHV-5000;\n\u2022complete the Phase 3 clinical trial of oral zavegepant and related support activities, and continue other clinical trials of oral zavegepant;\n\u2022continue to initiate and progress other supporting studies required for regulatory approval of our product candidates, including long-term safety studies, drug-drug interaction studies, preclinical toxicology and carcinogenicity studies;\n\u2022make required milestone and royalty payments under the license agreements by which we acquired some of the rights to our product candidates;\n\u2022initiate preclinical studies and clinical trials for any additional indications for our current product candidates and any future product candidates that we may pursue;\n\u2022continue to build our portfolio of product candidates through the acquisition or in-license of additional product candidates or technologies;\n\u2022continue to develop, maintain, expand and protect our intellectual property portfolio;\n\u2022pursue regulatory approvals for our current and future product candidates that successfully complete clinical trials;\n\u2022support our sales, marketing and distribution infrastructure to commercialize any future product candidates for which we may obtain marketing approval;\n\u2022hire additional clinical, medical, commercial, and development personnel; and\n\u2022incur additional legal, accounting and other expenses in operating as a public company.\nAs of February 25, 2022, the issuance date of our consolidated financial statements, we expect that our cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities as of December 31, 2021, our furture operating cash flows from sales of NURTEC ODT, the funds available from the Sixth Street Financing Agreement, proceeds from the issuance of Series B Preferred Shares, potential sales under the Equity Distribution Agreement in 2022, and proceeds from our Collaboration Agreement with Pfizer will be sufficient to fund our current forecast for operating expenses, including commercialization of NURTEC ODT, financial commitments and other cash requirements for more than one year. We may need to raise additional capital until we are profitable. If no additional capital is raised through either public or private equity financings, debt financings, strategic relationships, alliances and licensing agreements, or a combination thereof, we may delay, limit or reduce discretionary spending in areas related to research and development activities and other general and administrative expenses in order to fund our operating costs and working capital needs.\nWe have based these estimates on assumptions that may prove to be wrong, and we could utilize our available capital resources sooner than we expect. We expect that we will require additional capital to pursue in-licenses or acquisitions of other product candidates. If we receive regulatory approval for troriluzole, or our other product candidates, we expect to incur additional commercialization expenses related to product manufacturing, sales, marketing and distribution, depending on whether we commercialize jointly or on our own.\nBecause of the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with research, development and commercialization of pharmaceutical product candidates, we are unable to estimate the exact amount of our working capital requirements. Our future funding requirements will depend on and could increase significantly as a result of many factors, including:\n\u2022the scope, progress, results and costs of researching and developing our product candidates, and conducting preclinical studies and clinical trials;\n\u2022the costs, timing and outcome of regulatory review of our product candidates;\n\u2022the effect of COVID-19 pandemic on our business operations and funding needs;\n\u2022the costs of future activities, including product sales, medical affairs, marketing, manufacturing and distribution, for NURTEC ODT, in addition to any of our product candidates for which we receive marketing approval;\n\u2022the revenue from NURTEC ODT, and revenue, if any, received from commercial sale of our products, should any of our product candidates receive marketing approval;\n\u2022the costs and timing of hiring new employees to support our continued growth;\n\u2022the costs of preparing, filing, and prosecuting patent applications, maintaining and enforcing our intellectual property rights and defending intellectual property-related claims;\n\u2022the extent to which we acquire or in-license other product candidates and technologies;\n\u2022the costs of manufacturing commercial-grade product and necessary inventory to support commercial launch;\n\u2022the costs associated with payment of milestones and royalties under existing contractual arrangements and/or in-licensing additional products candidates to augment our current pipeline; and\n\u2022the timing, receipt and amount of sales of, or milestone payments related to or royalties on, our current or future product candidates, if any.\nUntil such time, if ever, that we can generate product revenue sufficient to achieve profitability, we expect to finance our cash needs through a combination of public and private equity offerings, debt financings, other third-party funding, strategic alliances, licensing arrangements or marketing and distribution arrangements. To the extent that we raise additional capital through the sale of equity or convertible debt securities, the ownership interest of our existing shareholders will be diluted, and the terms of these securities may include liquidation or other preferences that adversely affect the rights of our existing shareholders. Debt financing and preferred equity financing, if available, may involve agreements that include covenants limiting or restricting our ability to take specific actions, such as incurring additional debt, making capital expenditures or declaring dividends. If we raise additional funds through other third-party funding, strategic alliances, licensing arrangements or marketing and distribution arrangements, we may have\nto relinquish valuable rights to our technologies, future revenue streams, research programs or product candidates or grant licenses on terms that may not be favorable to us. If we are unable to raise additional funds through equity or debt financings when needed, we will\nbe required to delay, limit, reduce or terminate our product development or future commercialization efforts or grant rights to develop and market products or product candidates that we would otherwise prefer to develop and market ourselves.\nContractual Obligations and Commitments\nThe following table summarizes certain estimated future obligations by period under our various contractual obligations as of December 31, 2021 and the effects that such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flows in future periods: Table 14: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Payments Due by Period </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>In thousands </td> <td> </td> <td>Total </td> <td> </td> <td>2022 </td> <td> </td> <td>2023 - 2024\n</td> <td> </td> <td>2025 - 2026\n</td> <td> </td> <td>Thereafter\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Long-term debt obligations </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Principal payments(1)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>675,333 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>47,811 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>627,522 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest payment(2)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>225,062 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>43,967 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>120,984 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>60,111 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Finance leases </td> <td> </td> <td>9,518 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5,714 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3,804 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating leases </td> <td> </td> <td>4,155 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>689 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,420 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,477 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>569 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Purchase obligations </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Commercial commitments(3)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>107,882 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>90,809 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>17,073 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Research commitments(4)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>33,485 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>33,485 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other long-term liabilities </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Mandatorily redeemable preferred shares(5)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>187,500 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>62,500 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>125,000 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Series B preferred shares forward contracts(6)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>354,552 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>118,184 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>236,368 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,597,487 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>237,164 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>316,092 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>807,294 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>236,937 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\n(1) Principal payments on long-term debt relate to the $625.0 million in term loans drawn under our senior secured credit facility with Sixth Street Specialty Lending, Inc., and includes the capitalization and payment as principal of $50.3 million of interest paid-in-kind.\n(2) Interest payments on long-term debt are calculated using the 10.00% interest rate on the August 2020 Loans and 9.25% on the September 2021 Loans, our outstanding term loans in effect on December 31, 2021. It excludes 4% of interest paid-in-kind for the first eight quarters that the loans are outstanding and includes the effect of the inclusion of the interest paid-in-kind as part of the outstanding loan principal.\n(3) Commercial commitments primarily related to advertising, data license agreements and manufacturing preparation services that are enforceable and legally binding on us and that specify all significant terms, including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed, minimum or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the transaction. For obligations with cancellation provisions, the amounts included in the preceding table are limited to the non-cancelable portion of the agreement terms or the minimum cancellation fee.\n(4) Research commitments are primarily CRO and CMO agreements that are enforceable and legally binding on us and that specify all significant terms, including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed, minimum or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the transaction. For obligations with cancellation provisions, the amounts included in the preceding table are limited to the non-cancelable portion of the agreement terms or the minimum cancellation fee.\n(5) Pursuant to the Series A Preferred Shares Agreement with RPI, the mandatorily redeemable preferred shares are redeemed in cash in equal quarterly installments beginning on March 31, 2021 and ending December 31, 2024.\n(6) The Series B preferred shares forward contracts require RPI to purchase $200.0 million of Series B preferred shares from us on a quarterly basis beginning on March 31, 2021 and ending on December 31, 2024. After December 31, 2024, we are required to redeem the Series B preferred shares at 1.77x the purchase price in quarterly installments ending December 31, 2030.\nIn addition to the contractual obligations in the table above, under various agreements with third-party licensors and collaborators, we have agreed to make milestone payments and pay royalties and annual maintenance fees to third parties and to meet due diligence requirements based upon specified milestones. We have not included any contingent payment obligations, such as milestones, royalties, or due diligence, in the table above as the amount, timing and likelihood of such payments are not known. We have not included any of the annual license maintenance fee payments in the above table, as although the amount and timing are known, we cannot currently determine the final termination dates of the agreements and, as a result, we cannot determine the total amounts of such payments we will be required to make under the agreements. We do not anticipate making material annual license maintenance payments related to our license agreements in the next 12 months.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Significant Judgments and Estimates\nOur consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (\"GAAP\"). The preparation of our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, costs and expenses, and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities in our financial statements. We base our estimates on historical experience, known trends and events and various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. We evaluate our estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis.\nOur actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. While our significant accounting policies are described in more detail in Note 2 \"Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\" in the notes to our financial statements appearing at the end of this Annual Report, we believe that the following accounting policies are those most critical to the judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements.\nRevenue Recognition\nRevenues from product sales are recorded at the net sales price, or transaction price,\u201d which includes estimates of variable consideration that result from (a) invoice discounts for prompt payment and distribution service fees, (b) government and private payor rebates, chargebacks, discounts and fees, (c) product returns and (d) costs of co-pay assistance programs for patients, as well as other incentives for certain indirect customers. Reserves are established for the estimates of variable consideration based on the amounts earned or to be claimed on the related sales. The reserves are classified as reductions to trade receivable, net if payable to a Customer or accrued expenses if payable to a third-party. Where appropriate, we utilize the expected value method to determine the appropriate amount for estimates of variable consideration based on factors such as our historical experience, current contractual and statutory requirements, specific known market events and trends, industry data and forecasted customer buying and payment patterns. The amount of variable consideration that is included in the transaction price may be constrained and is included in net product revenues only to the extent that it is probable that a significant reversal in the amount of the cumulative revenue recognized will not occur in a future period. Actual amounts of consideration ultimately received may differ from our estimates. If actual results vary from our estimates, we adjust these estimates, which would affect net product revenue and earnings in the period such variances become known.\nWe make significant estimates and judgments that materially affect our recognition of net product revenue. Claims by third-party payors for rebates, chargebacks and discounts frequently are submitted to us significantly after the related sales, potentially resulting in adjustments in the period in which the new information becomes known. We will adjust our estimates based on new information, including information regarding actual rebates, chargebacks and discounts for our products, as it becomes available.\nInterest Expense and Liability Related to Sale of Future Royalties\nWe have accounted for the 2018 Funding Agreement with RPI Finance Trust (\"RPI\") and a portion of the 2020 Funding Agreement with RPI 2019 Intermediate Finance Trust ( RPI 2019 IFT\u201d) as liability financings. See Note 7 \"Liability Related to Sale of Future Royalties, net\" for additional details. The liability related to sale of future royalties and the related interest expense are measured based on our current estimate of the timing and amount of expected future royalties expected to be paid over the estimated term of the related funding agreement with RPI Trust. The liability is amortized using the effective interest rate method, resulting in recognition of interest expense over the estimated term of the agreement. Each reporting period, we assess the estimated timing and amount of future expected royalty payments over the estimated term. If there are changes to the estimate, we recognize the impact to the liability's amortization schedule and the related interest expense prospectively. Our estimate of the amount of expected future royalties to be paid considers the probability of success of the compounds being approved for sale, market penetration rates of the compounds upon approval, compliance rate and net pricing.\nValuation of Series B Forward Contract Derivative\nThe fair value of the derivative recognized in connection with the RPI Series B Preferred Share Agreement was determined based on significant inputs not observable in the market. The fair value of the derivative primarily relates to the difference between the fair value of the Series B Preferred Shares and the contractual future purchase price. The fair value of the Series B Preferred Shares is calculated based on the cash flows to RPI (1.77 times the original purchase price as scheduled or accelerated upon certain events) and our estimated cost of capital for those cash flows. The cash flows to RPI are based on probability adjusted cash flows from certain scenarios outlined in the agreement that would result in accelerated payments modeled using a Monte Carlo simulation. As inputs into the valuation, we considered the type and probability of occurrence of certain change of control events, the amount of the payments, the expected timing of certain acceleration of payments, and a risk-adjusted discount rate. Assessing the probability of certain change of control events over a 10-year time period requires significant judgment and the successful completion of a\nchange of control is largely dependent on the outcome of potential negotiations with a third party. Due to this uncertainty, our expectation of the probability of the timing of a change of control event at the reporting date could reasonably be different than the timing of an actual change of control event, and if so, would mean the estimated fair value could differ from the fair value determined.\nIncome Taxes\nIn August 2020, we completed an intra-entity asset transfer of intellectual property (\"IP\"). See Note 15 \"Income Taxes\" for additional details. The fair value of the transferred IP required significant and complex management judgments to establish assumptions about the intellectual property's fair value, including revenue growth rates, projected profit margins, and discount rate. The fair value determination was based upon a discounted cash flow model that was subject to significant judgement given the IP asset transferred had been recently launched and there was limited historical sales activity. As a result of the transfer, we recognized a deferred tax asset for the step up in tax basis based on the fair value of the transferred IP.\nWe periodically evaluate the likelihood of the realization of deferred tax assets and reduce the carrying amount of these deferred tax assets by a valuation allowance to the extent we believe a portion will not be realized. We continue to maintain a full valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets recognized in connection with our intra-entity transfer of IP as realization is not certain due to a lack of net operating income history by taxing jurisdictions. We consider many factors when assessing the likelihood of future realization of deferred tax assets, including our current operating results, expectations of future taxable income, carryforward periods available to us for tax reporting purposes, various income tax strategies, and other relevant factors. Significant judgment is required in making this assessment and, to the extent future expectations change, we would assess the recoverability of our deferred tax assets at that time.\nRecently Issued Accounting Pronouncements\nA description of recently issued accounting pronouncements that may potentially impact our financial position and results of operations is disclosed in Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements appearing at the end of this Annual Report.", "item_7_text": "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nYou should read the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations together with our financial statements and related notes appearing elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, or this Annual Report. In addition to historical information, this discussion and analysis contains forward-looking statements that involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions. Our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of certain factors. We discuss factors that we believe could cause or contribute to these differences below and elsewhere in this report, including those set forth under Item 1A. \"Risk Factors\" and under \"Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\" in this Annual Report.\nOverview\nWe are a commercial-stage biopharmaceutical company with a portfolio of innovative, best-in-class therapies to improve the lives of patients with debilitating neurological and neuropsychiatric diseases, including rare disorders. Our Neuroinnovation portfolio includes FDA-approved NURTEC ODT (rimegepant) for the acute and preventive treatment of migraine and a broad pipeline of product candidates across five distinct mechanistic platforms: calcitonin gene related peptide (\"CGRP\") receptor antagonism, glutamate modulation, myeloperoxidase (\"MPO\") inhibition, Kv7 Ion Channel Activators (\"Kv7\"), and Myostatin.\nOur clinical-stage milestones include the following:\n\nCGRP Platform\nIn July 2016, we acquired exclusive, worldwide rights to our CGRP receptor antagonist platform, including rimegepant and zavegepant (previously known as BHV-3500 and vazegepant), through a license agreement, as amended, with Bristol-Myers Squibb Company ( BMS\u201d). In December 2020, Sosei Heptares and Biohaven entered a global collaboration and license agreement (the \"Heptares Agreement\") under which Biohaven received exclusive global rights to develop, manufacture and commercialize a portfolio of novel, small-molecule CGRP receptor antagonists discovered\nby Sosei Heptares for the treatment of CGRP-mediated disorders.\nRimegepant\nThe most advanced product candidate from our CGRP receptor antagonist platform is rimegepant, an orally available, potent and selective small molecule human CGRP receptor antagonist that we have developed for the acute and preventive treatment of migraine. During the second quarter of 2019, we submitted NDAs for the acute treatment of migraine to\nthe FDA for the Zydis ODT and tablet formulations of rimegepant. The NDA submission for the Zydis ODT formulation of rimegepant was submitted using an FDA priority review voucher, purchased in March 2019, providing for an expedited 6-month review. The Zydis ODT formulation of rimegepant (NURTEC ODT) was approved by the FDA for the acute treatment of migraine on February 27, 2020 and was available by prescription in U.S. pharmacies on March 12, 2020. During the fourth quarter of 2020, we submitted an sNDA for the preventive treatment of migraine to the FDA for NURTEC ODT. The FDA approved NURTEC ODT for the preventive treatment of episodic migraine on May 27, 2021.\nWe remain focused on investing in long-term success by driving new-to-brand prescriptions, and ultimately market share, in this rapidly growing oral CGRP market and are continuing to observe a positive return on investment with increasing physician advocacy and attracting a greater pool of patients. We believe that the rapid adoption of NURTEC ODT is evidence of significant unmet need among people with migraine and an associated large acute and preventive therapy market opportunity. We continue to expand commercial payer coverage, with NURTEC ODT now covered by insurance providers reflecting 89% of commercial lives.\nA summary of key rimegepant studies is described below.\nStudy 301/Study 302\nIn March 2018, we announced positive topline data from our first two pivotal Phase 3 trials ( Study 301 and Study 302\u201d) for the acute treatment of migraine. In each trial, treatment with a single 75 mg dose of rimegepant met the co-primary efficacy endpoints of the trial, which were superior to placebo, at two hours post-dose, on measures of pain freedom and freedom from the patient's most bothersome symptom (\"MBS\"). In addition to achieving both co-primary endpoints in each of the trials, rimegepant also was observed to be generally safe and well-tolerated in the trials, with a safety profile similar to placebo. The co-primary endpoints achieved in the Phase 3 trials were consistent with regulatory guidance from the FDA and provided the basis for the submission of an NDA to the FDA.\nStudy 303\nA third Phase 3 clinical trial for the acute treatment of migraine with a bioequivalent ODT formulation of rimegepant was commenced in February 2018. On December 3, 2018, we announced positive topline data from this randomized, controlled Phase 3 clinical trial ( BHV3000-303\u201d or Study 303\u201d) evaluating the efficacy and safety of our Zydis ODT formulation of rimegepant for the acute treatment of migraine. Rimegepant differentiated from placebo on the two co-primary endpoints using a single dose, pain freedom and freedom from the MBS at two hours. In total, rimegepant was significantly differentiated from the placebo in the first 21 consecutive primary and\nsecondary outcome measures that were pre-specified. Patients treated with the rimegepant Zydis ODT formulation began to numerically separate from placebo on pain relief as early as 15 minutes, and this difference was statistically significant at 60 minutes. Additionally, a significantly greater percentage of patients treated with rimegepant Zydis ODT returned to normal functioning by 60 minutes and lasting clinical benefit compared to placebo was observed through 48 hours after a single dose of rimegepant on freedom from pain, pain relief, freedom from the MBS, and freedom from functional disability. The safety and tolerability observations of rimegepant in Study 303 were consistent with our previous observations. The overall rates of adverse events were similar to placebo (13.2% with respect to rimegepant compared to 10.5% with placebo). The co-primary endpoints achieved in the Phase 3 trials were consistent with regulatory guidance from the FDA and formed the basis of efficacy data required by the FDA for approval.\nStudy 305\nIn November 2018, we initiated a double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase 3 clinical trial examining regularly scheduled dosing of rimegepant 75 mg to evaluate its efficacy and safety as a preventive therapy for migraine ( BHV3000-305\u201d or Study 305\u201d). In March 2020 we announced positive topline results from this study. Rimegepant 75 mg, dosed every other day, demonstrated statistically significant superiority, compared to placebo, on the primary endpoint of reduction in the mean number of migraine days per month in both episodic and chronic migraine patients. The safety profile seen in the 370 patients who received rimegepant 75 mg every other day was consistent with prior clinical trial experience. With this trial, rimegepant has become the only CGRP targeted therapy to demonstrate efficacy in both the acute and preventive treatment of migraine. An sNDA for rimegepant for prevention of migraine was filed with the FDA and accepted for review in the fourth quarter of 2020. The FDA approved NURTEC ODT for the preventive treatment of migraine on May 27, 2021.\nPediatric Study Plan\nIn June 2019, the FDA agreed to our Pediatric Study Plan for the acute treatment of migraine. The pediatric program for the acute treatment of migraine was initiated in the fourth quarter of 2020.\nTrigeminal Neuralgia\nIn the second quarter of 2019, we initiated a Phase 2 proof of concept trial to evaluate the safety and efficacy of rimegepant in patients with treatment refractory trigeminal neuralgia. Trigeminal neuralgia is a chronic facial pain syndrome characterized by paroxysmal, severe, and lancinating episodes of pain in the distribution of one or more branches of the trigeminal nerve. The trigeminal nerve, or fifth cranial nerve, is the largest of the 12 cranial nerves and\nprovides sensory innervation to the head and neck, as well as motor innervation to the muscles of mastication. These episodic bouts of severe facial pain can last seconds to minutes, occur several times per day, and often result in significant disability. Over the long-term course of the disease, symptoms often become refractory to medical therapy and current treatment options remain suboptimal.\nPlaque Psoriasis\nIn the fourth quarter of 2020, we announced a collaboration with Weill Cornell Medicine's Dr. Richard Granstein, Chairman of Dermatology, to initiate an investigator-led clinical trial, which will explore whether treatment with one of our CGRP-receptor antagonists will reduce the severity of disease and percentage of area affected as measured by patients' Psoriasis Activity Severity Index (PASI) score after 16 weeks of treatment as compared to placebo. In addition, the study will assess the potential impact on itch and patient quality-of-life measures. Psoriasis is a chronic and painful autoimmune disease characterized by red patches of dry, cracked skin that may bleed, itch, and burn that affects approximately 7- 8 million people in the U.S.\nRhinosinusitis\nIn February 2022, we announced that we have begun enrollment in a Phase 2/3 clinical trial assessing the safety and efficacy of NURTEC ODT 75mg in patients with chronic rhinosinusitis (\"CRS\") with or without nasal polyps. CRS is a symptomatic inflammation of the paranasal sinuses and nasal cavity lasting more than 12 weeks. CRS typically manifests as facial pain/pressure/fullness, nasal obstruction (congestion), nasal discharge, and/or a decreased sense of smell. Both preclinical and human studies have indicated that increased CGRP levels are associated with CRS, and suggest that blocking CGRP receptors with NURTEC ODT may have beneficial effects for those suffering from CRS. We expect to enroll approximately 200 patients in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial across approximately 25 sites in the U.S. Researchers will evaluate acute symptomatic treatment with rimegepant in patients with chronic rhinosinusitis with and without nasal polyps. The primary outcome measure is the change in a patient's facial pain/pressure/fullness score on a Numerical Rating Scale (0-10). The trial will also assess the safety and tolerability of rimegepant.\nTemporomandibular Disorder\nIn the first quarter of 2022, we received Study May Proceed\u201d communications from the FDA regarding our proposed clinical trial for the use of NURTEC ODT in temporomandibular disorder (\"TMD\"). TMD is a disorder of the jaw muscles, temporomandibular joints, and the nerves associated with chronic facial pain. We expect to commence a clinical trial during the first quarter of 2022.\nInternational Health Authority Interactions\nScientific advice for rimegepant for acute and preventive migraine treatment was received from the CHMP, a committee of the European Medicines Agency, in June and December 2018, respectively. In the first quarter of 2021, we submitted the MAA for rimegepant dual activity, inclusive of acute and prevention of migraine. In February 2022, we were notified that CHMP adopted a positive opinion, recommending the granting of a marketing authorization in the EU for rimegepant 75 mg (available as an orally dissolving tablet), intended for the prophylaxis and acute treatment of migraine. If approved, VYDURA (rimegepant) will be the commercial name for rimegepant in the EU. The full indication for VYDURA is the acute treatment of migraine with or without aura in adults and preventive treatment of episodic migraine in adults who have at least four migraine attacks per month. We expect to receive determination regarding our Marketing Authorization Application in the EU for rimegepant in the first half of 2022.\nFilings in Israel and the Middle East began in 2020. In March 2021, we received approval for rimegepant in Israel and the UAE for the acute treatment of migraine. In the fourth quarter of 2021, we received approval for rimegepant in Israel for the preventive treatment of episodic migraine in adults and in Kuwait for the acute treatment of episodic migraine in adults. We expect further approvals in 2022.\nWith respect to Japan, we have engaged the Pharmaceuticals and Medical Devices Agency (\"PMDA\") on a path forward, and initiation of Phase 2/3 bridging studies are anticipated to begin mid-2022.\nIn January 2019, we and our subsidiary, BioShin (Shanghai) Consulting Services Company Ltd. ( BioShin Shanghai\u201d), a Shanghai based limited liability company, jointly announced that the National Medical Products Administration ( NMPA,\u201d formerly, the China FDA) had accepted the IND application for rimegepant for the treatment of migraine. As previously announced, BioShin Shanghai was established to develop and potentially commercialize our late-stage migraine and neurology portfolio in China and other Asia-Pacific markets. Following the results of Study 303, we submitted a second IND application to the NMPA for the Zydis ODT formulation of rimegepant for the acute treatment of migraine. The IND application for the Zydis ODT formulation of rimegepant was accepted by the NMPA in the fourth quarter of 2019. In September 2020, BioShin Limited (\"BioShin\"), our subsidiary and the parent organization of BioShin Shanghai, raised $60.0 million in series A funding (the \"Bioshin Funding\") which is being used to build out BioShin in China and advance our clinical portfolio in the Asia-Pacific region.\nIn November 2020, BioShin initiated a double-blind, randomized Phase 3 clinical trial evaluating the safety and efficacy of NURTEC ODT (rimegepant) for the acute treatment of migraine in China and South Korea.\nIn February 2022, we announced positive topline results from the study. The study met its co-primary endpoints of freedom from pain (p<0.0001) and freedom from MBS including either nausea, phonophobia or photophobia (p<0.0001) at 2-hours following a single oral dose of rimegepant. The early onset and durable 48 hour efficacy observed in China and South Korea is consistent with previous clinical trial results. In addition to the positive results on the co-primary endpoints, NURTEC ODT demonstrated rapid onset efficacy that was superior to placebo on multiple clinically important outcomes, including: pain relief at 2 hours (p < 0.0001); normal functioning at 2 hours post-dose (p<0.0001); no need for rescue medication within 24 hrs of dosing (p < 0.0001), and showed lasting efficacy with sustained pain freedom from 2 through 24 hours (p < 0.0001) and sustained pain freedom from 2 through 48 hours (p < 0.0001). Initial analysis of topline data indicates NURTEC ODT was numerically advantaged compared to placebo on multiple early-onset measures, including: pain relief within 45 minutes and freedom from MBS within 45 minutes; return to normal function within 60 min; and pain freedom within 90 min. Rimegepant also showed a favorable safety and tolerability profile among study participants that was consistent with prior clinical trial results in the United States. Detailed data from the study will be presented at future medical meetings to help inform ongoing and future research. We expect to submit an NDA during the second half of 2022.\nPursuant to the terms of our Collaboration Agreement with Pfizer, we will continue to perform development activities required for the regulatory approval of rimegepant and zavegepant in all countries outside of the U.S. (\"the Territory\"). The development activities are to be performed under a mutually agreed-upon development plan. In addition, Pfizer has the right to conduct certain development activities in the Territory and will be the marketing authorization holder in all countries in the Territory where permitted under applicable law.\nZavegepant\nBHV-3500, formerly \"vazegepant\", is now referred to as \"zavegepant\" (za ve' je pant). The World Health Organization (WHO) International Nonproprietary Names (INN) Expert Committee revised the name to \"zavegepant\" which was accepted by the United States Adopted Names Council for use in the U.S. and is pending formal adoption by the INN for international use.\nAcute Treatment of Migraine\nAdministration of intranasal zavegepant in a Phase 1 clinical trial was initiated in October 2018 and achieved targeted therapeutic exposures. We advanced zavegepant into a Phase 2/3 trial to evaluate its efficacy for the acute treatment of migraine in the first quarter of 2019. We believed that intranasal zavegepant could provide an ultra-rapid onset of action that could be used in a complementary fashion with other migraine\ntreatments when the speed of onset is critical to a patient and/or for patients experiencing severe nausea and/or vomiting symptoms. In December 2019, we announced positive topline results from the Phase 2/3 trial. Zavegepant 10 and 20 mg was statistically superior to placebo on the co-primary endpoints of pain freedom and freedom from the MBS at two hours using a single dose.\nIn January 2021, we announced the initiation of the Phase 3 clinical trial for the use of intranasal zavegepant for the acute treatment of migraine and in December 2021, we announced top-line results. The results of the study showed that zavegepant was statistically superior to placebo on the co-primary endpoints of pain freedom (24% vs 15%, p <.0001) and freedom from most bothersome symptom (40% vs 31%, p = 0.0012) at 2 hours. Zavegepant was superior to placebo demonstrating pain relief as early as 15 minutes, with patients achieving return to normal function as early as 30 minutes after dosing (p < 0.006). The efficacy benefits of zavegepant were durable, including superiority versus placebo (p < 0.05) on: sustained pain freedom 2 to 24 hours; sustained pain freedom 2 to 48 hours; sustained pain relief 2 to 24 hours; and sustained pain relief 2 to 48 hours. Based upon these results, combined with our prior positive Phase 2/3 trial, we plan to proceed with regulatory submissions in the United States and other countries and expect to submit an NDA for zavegepant with the FDA in the first half of 2022.\nPreventative Treatment of Migraine\nIn September 2020, we announced that the FDA authorized the initiation of clinical trials for oral zavegepant and that we had achieved first in human dosing in a Phase 1 trial designed to assess the safety and pharmacokinetics of oral formulations of zavegepant. In March 2021, we announced that our Phase 2/3 clinical program to assess the efficacy of oral zavegepant in the preventive treatment of migraine began enrollment. The Phase 2/3 trial is ongoing with results expected in the second half of 2022.\nCOVID-19\nIn April 2020, we announced our plan to study intranasal zavegepant in pulmonary complications of COVID-19 disease. The IND was approved by the Division of Pulmonary, Allergy, and Critical Care at FDA in April 2020, and a Phase 2 trial began in April 2020 in collaboration with Thomas Jefferson University and other academic medical institutions. The clinical trial will assess the potential benefits of CGRP receptor-blockade in mitigating an excessive immune response which in some cases can be fatal in COVID-19 patients.\nAsthma\nIn October 2021, we began enrollment in a Phase 1b, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of oral zavegepant for the treatment of subjects with mild allergic asthma. Enrollment in the trial is ongoing.\nNext Generation CGRP Receptor Antagonists\nSeveral clinical candidates are being developed through a global collaboration and license agreement between Biohaven and Sosei Heptares. Under the agreement, Biohaven received exclusive global rights to develop, manufacture and commercialize a portfolio of novel, small-molecule CGRP receptor antagonists discovered by Sosei Heptares for the treatment of CGRP-mediated disorders.\nBHV-3100, previously known as HTL0022562, was developed successfully through preclinical trials by Sosei Heptares and demonstrated promising and differentiated properties in target CGRP-mediated disorders. During the fourth quarter of 2021, we decided to stop development of BHV-3100 based upon its emerging preclinical profile and will instead advance one of the portfolio's backup compounds in its place.\nGlutamate Platform\nThe most advanced product candidate from our glutamate receptor antagonist platform is troriluzole (previously referred to as trigriluzole and BHV-4157), which is in multiple Phase 3 trials. Other product candidates include BHV-5500 which is an antagonist of the glutamate N-methyl-D-aspartate ( NMDA\u201d) receptor.\nTroriluzole\nAtaxias\nWe are developing troriluzole for the treatment of ataxias; our initial focus has been spinocerebellar ataxia (\"SCA\"). We have received both orphan drug designation and fast track designation from the FDA for troriluzole for the treatment of SCA. A Phase 3 trial began enrollment in March 2019 to evaluate the efficacy of troriluzole in SCA. We believe that the non-statistically significant clinical observations from our first Phase 2/3 trial and open-label extension phase in SCA support our decision to advance troriluzole into a Phase 3 trial that could provide the data needed to serve as the basis for an NDA. We completed enrollment in the Phase 3 trial of troriluzole in SCA in the first quarter of 2021. Results are expected in the first half of 2022.\nOther Indications\nA Phase 2/3 double-blind, randomized, controlled trial to assess the efficacy of troriluzole in OCD commenced in December 2017. The Phase 2/3 study results were announced in June 2020. Troriluzole 200 mg administered once daily as adjunctive therapy in OCD patients with inadequate response to standard of care treatment showed consistent numerical improvement over placebo on the Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale (Y-BOCS) at all study timepoints (weeks 4 to 12) but did not meet the primary outcome measure at week 12 (p = 0.22 at week 12), including significant improvement at week 8 (p < 0.05). Troriluzole was well tolerated with a safety profile consistent with past\nclinical trial experience. Given the strong signal in the Phase 2/3 proof of concept study and after receiving feedback from the FDA in an End of Phase 2 meeting, in December 2020 we initiated enrollment in the Phase 3 program. Two Phase 3 studies are currently ongoing with results expected in the second half of 2022.\nIn addition, a Phase 2/3 double-blind, randomized, controlled trial of troriluzole in the treatment of mild-to-moderate Alzheimer's disease was advanced with the Alzheimer's Disease Cooperative Study, a consortium of sites funded by the National Institutes of Health. In January 2021, topline data from the trial revealed that troriluzole did not statistically differentiate from placebo at 48 weeks on the study's prespecified co-primary endpoints on the Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-Cognitive Subscale and the Clinical Dementia Rating Scale Sumo of Boxes in study participants with mild-to-moderate AD. Troriluzole also did not differentiate from placebo on the key secondary measure of hippocampal volume assessed by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in the overall population. A subgroup analysis consisting only of mild AD patients did, however, reveal that troriluzole exhibited a nonsignificant numerical difference of a potential benefit at week 48 on both the ADAS-cog and hippocampal volumetric MRI. Although the numerical effects on the ADAS-cog and hippocampal MRI measured in mild AD patients suggests a potential biologic effect of troriluzole in patients with early stage disease, additional analyses and biomarker data will be informative and help determine whether any further study in early AD is warranted. With regard to safety and tolerability, treatment with troriluzole at a dose of 280 mg once daily was relatively well tolerated and demonstrated a safety profile consistent with previous studies of troriluzole. In December 2021, we completed an ongoing long-term extension study of troriluzole in AD for mild AD patients.\nIn December 2021, the Global Coalition for Adaptive Research (\"GCAR\") selected troriluzole for evaluation in Glioblastoma Adaptive Global Innovative Learning Environment - NCT03970447 (\"GBM AGILE\"). GBM AGILE is a revolutionary patient-centered, adaptive platform trial for registration that tests multiple therapies for patients with newly-diagnosed and recurrent glioblastoma (\"GBM\"), the most fatal form of brain cancer. Troriluzole will be evaluated in all patient subgroups of the trial which include newly-diagnosed methylated MGMT, newly-diagnosed unmethylated MGMT, and recurrent GBM. Troriluzole was selected for inclusion in GBM AGILE based on compelling evidence showing deregulation of glutamate in GBM. The therapeutic potential of troriluzole in GBM and other oncology indications is supported by several recent clinical and translational research studies conducted with troriluzole and its active moiety.\nInternational Development\nIn the third quarter of 2020, BioShin raised $60.0 million in series A funding (the \"Bioshin Funding\") which\nwill be used to build out BioShin Limited in China and advance our clinical portfolio in the Asia-Pacific region, including initiating sites in China to participate in the global registrational trial of troriluzole in SCA.In December 2021, in connection with entering into the Collaboration Agreement with Pfizer,we merged Bioshin into a Biohaven subsidiary. BioShin completed enrollment for the SCA trial in China in the first quarter of 2021 with results expected in the first half of 2022.\nBHV-5000 and BHV-5500\nWe are developing BHV-5500, a low-trapping NMDA receptor antagonist. One potential target indication includes Complex Regional Pain Syndrome ( CRPS\u201d). CRPS is a rare, chronic pain condition typically affecting limbs and triggered by traumatic injury. Accompanying symptoms also include chronic inflammation and reduced mobility in the affected areas. Other disorders of interest include post-herpetic neuralgia and diabetic peripheral neuralgia. We acquired worldwide rights to BHV-5000 and BHV-5500 under an exclusive license agreement with AstraZeneca AB in October 2016. We selected a lead formulation at the end of 2017 and completed single dosing in a Phase 1 clinical trial of BHV-5000 in January 2018 to evaluate its pharmacokinetic properties. Results from nonclinical studies limiting clinical dose of BHV-5000 have led us to focus on BHV-5500 (lanicemine). Current work is focused on formulation development.\nMPO Platform\nVerdiperstat\nWe are developing verdiperstat (previously BHV-3241), an oral myeloperoxidase inhibitor for the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases. One target indication is MSA, a rare, rapidly progressive and fatal neurodegenerative disease with no cure or effective treatments. Verdiperstat has received orphan drug designation for the treatment of MSA from both the FDA and the European Medicines Agency. In addition, Fast Track status was granted by the FDA in March 2020 for verdiperstat for the treatment for MSA. A Phase 3 trial began enrollment in July 2019 to evaluate the efficacy of verdiperstat in MSA. In September 2021, we announced results from a focused analysis of a clinical trial of verdiperstat in MSA. Verdiperstat did not statistically differentiate from placebo on the prespecified primary efficacy measure, nor on the key secondary efficacy measures. Initial analysis of safety data was consistent with the overall profile of verdiperstat from prior clinical trial experience. Additional analyses are still pending, and full study results will be presented at an upcoming scientific meeting.\nAnother potential target indication is ALS. In September 2019, we announced that verdiperstat was selected to be studied in the Phase 3 HEALEY ALS Platform Trial, which is being conducted by the Sean M. Healey & AMG Center for ALS at Massachusetts General Hospital in collaboration with the Northeast ALS\nConsortium ( NEALS\u201d) clinical trial network. Promising investigational drugs were chosen for the HEALEY ALS Platform Trial through a competitive process, with the Healey Center providing partial financial support to successful applicants. The Phase 3 HEALEY ALS Platform Trial of verdiperstat began enrollment in July 2020. Enrollment in the trial was completed in November of 2021, with results expected in mid-2022.\nVerdiperstat was progressed through Phase 2 clinical trials by AstraZeneca. Seven clinical studies have been completed by AstraZeneca, including four Phase 1 studies in healthy subjects, two Phase 2a studies in subjects with Parkinson's disease, and one Phase 2b study in subjects with MSA. We have entered into an exclusive license agreement with AstraZeneca for the product candidate.\nKv7 Platform\nBHV-7000\nIn February 2022, we announced that we entered into a definitive agreement with Channel Biosciences, LLC, a subsidiary of Knopp Biosciences, LLC, to acquire a Kv7 channel targeting platform, adding the latest advances in ion-channel modulation to our growing neuroscience portfolio. BHV-7000 (formerly known as KB-3061) is the lead asset from the Kv7 platform and is a potentially best-in-class potassium channel activator with a profile suggestive of a wide therapeutic index, high selectivity, and significantly reduced GABA-ergic activity. We intend to bring BHV-7000 to the clinic in in 2022 in preparation for a development program in focal epilepsy.\nMyostatin Platform\nTaldefgrobep Alfa License Agreement\nIn February 2022, following the transfer of intellectual property we announced that we entered into a worldwide license agreement with BMS for the development and commercialization rights to taldefgrobep alfa (also known as BMS-986089), a novel, Phase 3-ready anti-myostatin adnectin. Myostatin is a natural protein that limits skeletal muscle growth, an important process in healthy muscular development. However, in patients with neuromuscular diseases, active myostatin can critically limit the growth needed to achieve developmental and functional milestones. Myostatin inhibition is a promising therapeutic strategy for enhancing muscle mass and strength in a range of pediatric and adult neuromuscular conditions. Taldefgrobep is a muscle-targeted treatment for neuromuscular disease and offers the opportunity for combination therapy. We plan to initiate a Phase 3 clinical trial of taldefgrobep in SMA in 2022. SMA is a rare, progressively debilitating motor neuron disease in which development and growth of muscle mass are compromised, resulting in progressive weakness and muscle atrophy, reduced motor function, impaired quality of life and often death. The in-licensing of taldefgrobep expands our portfolio of innovative, late-stage product candidates for the treatment of\nneurologic, neuroinflammatory, and psychiatric indications.\nBiohaven Labs\nKleo Pharmaceuticals, Inc. and Biohaven Labs\nIn January 2021, we acquired the remaining approximately 58% of Kleo that we did not previously own. We have assumed Kleo's laboratory facilities located in Science Park in New Haven, Connecticut and formed Biohaven Labs to serve as the integrated chemistry and discovery research arm of Biohaven. Biohaven Labs will continue several existing Kleo discovery partnerships, including one with the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation for the development of a of a SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing therapy for COVID-19 and one with PeptiDream for the development of immuno-oncology therapeutics (See Note 6).\nBiohaven's proprietary Multimodal Antibody Therapy Enhancer (\"MATE\") conjugation technology uses a new class of synthetic peptide binders to target the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 that are then selectively conjugated to commercially available intravenous immunoglobulin. The Biohaven synthetic binders for SARS-CoV2 were designed to establish a much wider area and number of contacts with the spike protein that other agents like monoclonal antibodies. In February 2021, we announced that BHV-1200, developed with Biohaven's proprietary MATE platform, has demonstrated functional binding and neutralization of the SARS-CoV-2 virus, including the strains known as the \"English\" and \"South African\" variants (also known as B.1.1.7 and B.1.351, respectively). The preliminary experiments conducted by Biohaven Labs and an academic collaborator demonstrated that BHV-1200 substantially reduced viral entry into cells. We intend to advance BHV-1200 into a full clinical development program. Accelerated development of the COVID-19 MATE program has been supported by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. In addition, the in vitro data indicated that BHV-1200 may activate important immune system components including antibody-dependent cellular phagocytosis and antibody dependent cellular cytotoxicity. We believe our proprietary MATE-conjugation technology could also be used against other infectious diseases by changing the targeting moiety of its antibody binders.\nOption and License Agreement with the University of Connecticut\nIn October 2018, we entered into an exclusive, worldwide option and license agreement (the \"UConn Agreement\") with the University of Connecticut (\"UConn\") for the development and commercialization rights to UC1MT, a therapeutic antibody targeting extracellular MT. Under this agreement, we have the option to acquire an exclusive, worldwide license to UC1MT and its underlying patents to develop and commercialize throughout the world in all human indications. If we choose to exercise the option, we would be obligated to pay UConn milestone\npayments upon the achievement of specified regulatory and commercial milestones, and royalties of a low single-digit percentage of net sales of licensed products.\nFox Chase Chemical Diversity Center, Inc.\nIn May 2019, we entered into an agreement with Fox Chase Chemical Diversity Center Inc. ( FCCDC\u201d) for FCCDC's TDP-43 assets (the FCCDC Agreement\u201d). The FCCDC Agreement provides us with a plan and goal to identify one or more new chemical entity candidates for preclinical development for eventual clinical evaluation for the treatment of one or more TDP-43 proteinopathies. In connection with the FCCDC Agreement, Biohaven and FCCDC have established a TDP-43 Research Plan that provides for certain milestones to be achieved by FCCDC, and milestone payments to be made by us (See Note 14).\nSosei Heptares\nIn November 2020, we entered into a global collaboration and license agreement with Sosei Heptares, an international biopharmaceutical group focused on the discovery and early development of new medicines originating from their proprietary GPCR-targeted StaR technology and structure-based drug design platform capabilities. Under the agreement, Sosei Heptares will be eligible to receive development, regulatory and commercialization milestone payments, as well as tiered royalties on net sales of products resulting from the collaboration. In return, we will receive exclusive global rights to develop, manufacture and commercialize a portfolio of novel, small-molecule CGRP receptor antagonists discovered by Sosei Heptares for the treatment of CGRP-mediated disorders (See Note 14).\nArtizan Biosciences, Inc.\nIn December 2020, we entered into an Option and License Agreement with Artizan Biosciences Inc (\"Artizan\"), a biotechnology company focused on addressing inflammatory diseases involving the human intestinal microbiota. Pursuant to the agreement, we acquired an option to obtain a royalty-based license from Artizan to manufacture, use and commercialize certain products. Artizan will use the proceeds to continue advancing the preclinical research and development of its lead program for inflammatory bowel disease, which is anticipated to enter the clinic in 2022, as well as to explore additional disease targets (See Note 14). In November 2021, we announced a collaborative therapeutic discovery and development program in Parkinson's disease (PD), to exploit recent scientific advances in the understanding of pathogenic roles played by the gut microbiome in PD\nBHV-1100\nIn the fourth quarter of 2021, Biohaven initiated a Phase 1a/1b trial in multiple myeloma patients using its antibody recruiting molecule (ARM) BHV-1100 in combination with autologous cytokine induced memory-\nlike (CIML) natural killer (NK) cells and immune globulin (IG) to target and kill multiple myeloma cells expressing the cell surface protein CD38. BHV-1100 is the lead clinical asset from Biohaven's Antibody Recruiting Molecule (ARMTM) Platform developed from a strategic alliance with PeptiDream Inc. (TYO: 4587). This clinical trial will assess the safety and tolerability as well as exploratory efficacy endpoints in newly diagnosed multiple myeloma patients who have tested positive for minimal residual disease (MRD+) in first remission prior to autologous stem cell transplant (ASCT).\nReliant Glycosciences, LLC\nIn July 2021, Biohaven entered into a development and license agreement with Reliant Glycosciences, LLC (\"Reliant\") for collaboration on a program with Biohaven Labs' multifunctional molecules to develop and commercialize conjugated antibodies for therapeutic uses relating to IgA nephropathy and treatment of other diseases and conditions. Under the Agreement, Reliant was entitled to an upfront share payment and will be eligible to receive development milestone payments and royalties of net sales of licensed products (See Note 14).\nKU Leuven\nIn January 2022, we entered into the KU Leuven Agreement to develop and commercialize first-in-class TRPM3 antagonists to address the growing proportion of people worldwide living with chronic pain disorders. The TRPM3 antagonist platform was discovered at the Centre for Drug Design and Discovery and the Laboratory of Ion Channel Research at KU Leuven. Under the KU Leuven Agreement, we receive exclusive global rights to develop, manufacture and commercialize KU Leuven's portfolio of small-molecule TRPM3 antagonists. The portfolio includes the lead candidate, henceforth known as BHV-2100, which has demonstrated promising efficacy in preclinical pain models and will be the first to advance towards Phase 1 studies. We will support further basic and translational research at KU Leuven on the role of TRPM3 in pain and other disorders (See Note 14).\nRecent Developments\nThe following is a summary of key developments affecting our business in 2021.\nPfizer Collaboration Agreement\nIn November 2021, we entered into the Collaboration Agreement with Pfizer, pursuant to which Pfizer would commercialize the Licensed Products in all countries worldwide outside of the United States. In consideration thereof, in January 2022 Pfizer made an upfront payment of $150.0 million to Biohaven upon receipt of the requisite regulatory approvals needed for the effectiveness of the Collaboration Agreement. In addition, in January 2022 Pfizer purchased $350.0 million worth of Biohaven common shares at approximately $173.05 per share, equal to 125% of the volume weighted average price per share for the 20\nconsecutive trading days prior to the signing. We will be eligible to receive an aggregate additional $740.0 million in contingent payments based on specified commercial and sales-based milestones for the Licensed Products.\nWe are also entitled to tiered, escalating royalties from the upper teens to twenty percent of net sales of Licensed Products in the Territory. In general, Pfizer's obligation to pay royalties continues on a product-by-product and country-by-country basis until the latest of ten years after the first commercial sale of such product in such country, the expiration of the patent rights covering such product in such country or the expiration of the period of exclusivity applicable to such product in such country. In addition to the upfront payments, contingent payments and royalties described above, Pfizer will also compensate us for a pro-rata share of certain of its sales-based milestone obligations owed to BMS under the BMS License, and related net sales royalties owed to BMS and RPI that result from Pfizer's commercialization and sale, respectively, of the Licensed Products in the Territory.\nMerger Agreement with BioShin\nOn November 9, 2021, we entered into an agreement and plan of merger (the Merger Agreement\u201d) with BioShin. The Merger Agreement provides for the merger of a wholly owned indirect subsidiary of the Company with and into BioShin, with BioShin surviving the merger as a wholly owned indirect subsidiary of the Company (the BioShin Merger\u201d). As a result of the satisfaction of the closing conditions described in the Merger Agreement, on January 6, 2022, each Series A convertible preferred share of BioShin, no par value, other than Excluded Shares (as defined in the Merger Agreement), was converted into the right to receive 0.080121 of a Company common share.\nAmendments to the Sixth Street Financing Agreement\nIn August 2020, the Company and Biohaven Pharmaceuticals, Inc., our wholly-owned subsidiary (together with the Company, the \"Borrowers\"), entered into a financing agreement, as amended, with Sixth Street Specialty Lending, Inc., as administrative agent, and the lenders party thereto (the \"Lenders\") pursuant to which the Lenders agreed to extend a senior secured credit facility to us providing for term loans in an aggregate principal amount up to $500.0 million, plus any capitalized interest paid in kind. In September 2021, the Borrowers, and certain other of our subsidiaries entered into Amendment No. 2 (the Second Amendment\u201d) to the financing agreement (as previously amended and as amended by the Second Amendment, the Sixth Street Financing Agreement\u201d). Pursuant to the Second Amendment, the parties agreed to, among other things, increase the size of the credit facility by providing for additional term loans in an aggregate principal amount of $250.0 million for a total facility size of $750.0 million plus any capitalized interest paid in kind. The facility consists of drawn amounts for an initial\nterm loan of $275.0 million that the Borrowers drew at closing in August 2020 (the \"Initial Term Loan\"), $125.0 million drawn in August 2021 (the \"DDTL-2\"), and $125.0 million (the \"2021 Term Loan\") and $100.0 million (the \"DDTL-1\") both drawn in September 2021. The remaining $125.0 million delayed draw term loan commitments (the \"2021 DDTL Commitment\") was available to be drawn by the Borrowers until December 31, 2021 (the \"Delayed Draw Term Loan Commitment Termination Date\"). In November 2021, the Company entered into Amendment No. 3 and Limited Consent to Financing Agreement ( the Third Amendment and Limited Consent\u201d) to our Sixth Street Financing Agreement. Pursuant to the Third Amendment and Limited Consent, the lenders consented to the Company's entry into the Collaboration Agreement with Pfizer. In December 2021, we entered into Amendment No. 4 (the \"Fourth Amendment\") to the Sixth Street Financing Agreement, which extended the Delayed Draw Term Loan Commitment Termination Date to June 30, 2022. For additional details please refer to \"Liquidity and Capital Resources\" and Note 14, \"Debt.\"\nArtizan Biosciences Inc.\nIn December 2020, we entered into a Series A-2 Preferred Stock Purchase Agreement with Artizan Biosciences Inc. (\"Artizan\") (Note 14). Under the agreement, we paid Artizan 61,494 shares valued at $6.0 million, which were issued in January 2021. In exchange, we acquired 34,472,031 shares of series A-2 preferred stock of Artizan.\nYale MoDE Agreement\nOn January 1, 2021, we entered into a worldwide, exclusive license agreement for the development and commercialization of a novel Molecular Degrader of Extracellular Protein (MoDEs) platform based on ground-breaking research conducted in the laboratory of Professor David Spiegel at Yale University (Note 14). Under the agreement, we paid Yale University an upfront cash payment of $1.0 million and 11,668 shares valued at $1.0 million, both of which were included in research and development expense in the consolidated statements of operations.\nConsulting Agreement with Moda Pharmaceuticals LLC\nOn January 1, 2021, we entered into a consulting services agreement with Moda Pharmaceuticals LLC to further the scientific and commercial advancement of technology, drug discovery platforms, product candidates and related intellectual property owned or controlled by us (Note 14). Under the agreement, we paid Moda an upfront cash payment of $2.7 million and 37,836 shares valued at $3.2 million, both of which were included in research and development expense in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss.\nKU Leuven Agreement\nIn January 2022, Biohaven and Katholieke Universiteit Leuven (\"KU Leuven\") entered into an Exclusive License and Research Collaboration Agreement (the \"KU Leuven Agreement\") to develop and commercialize first-in-class TRPM3 antagonists to address the growing proportion of people worldwide living with chronic pain disorders. The TRPM3 antagonist platform was discovered at the Centre for Drug Design and Discovery (\"CD3\") and the Laboratory of Ion Channel Research (\"LICR\") at KU Leuven. Under the KU Leuven Agreement, Biohaven receives exclusive global rights to develop, manufacture and commercialize KU Leuven's portfolio of small-molecule TRPM3 antagonists. The portfolio includes the lead candidate, henceforth known as BHV-2100, which has demonstrated promising efficacy in preclinical pain models and will be the first to advance towards Phase 1 studies. Biohaven will support further basic and translational research at KU Leuven on the role of TRPM3 in pain and other disorders. As consideration, KU Leuven received an an upfront cash payment of $3.0 million and 15,340 shares valued at $1.8 million, and is eligible to receive additional development, regulatory, and commercialization milestones payments of up to $327.8 million. In addition, KU Leuven will be eligible to receive mid-single digit royalties on net sales of products resulting from the collaboration.\nKv7 Platform Acquisition\nIn February 2022, we announced that we entered into a definitive agreement with Channel Biosciences, LLC, a subsidiary of Knopp Biosciences, LLC, to acquire a Kv7 channel targeting platform, adding the latest advances in ion-channel modulation to our growing neuroscience portfolio. BHV-7000 (formerly known as KB-3061) is the lead asset from the Kv7 platform and is a potentially best-in-class potassium channel activator with a profile suggestive of a wide therapeutic index, high selectivity, and significantly reduced GABA-ergic activity. We intend to bring BHV-7000 to the clinic in in 2022 in preparation for a development program in focal epilepsy. In consideration for the transaction, we will make an upfront payment comprised of $65 million in Biohaven common shares and $35 million in cash to Knopp Biosciences. We have also agreed to make additional success-based earnout payments (i) up to $325 million based on BHV-7000 developmental and regulatory epilepsy milestones through approvals in the US, EU and Japan, (ii) up to an additional $250 million based on developmental and regulatory milestones for the Kv7 pipeline development in other indications and additional country approvals, and (iii) up to $562.5 million for commercial sales-based milestones of BHV-7000. Biohaven has also agreed to make scaled royalty payments for BHV-7000 and the pipeline programs, starting at high single digits and peaking at low teens for BHV-7000 and starting at mid-single digits and peaking at low double-digits for the pipeline programs.\nTaldefgrobep Alfa Platform License\nIn February 2022, following the transfer of intellectual property we announced that we entered into a worldwide license agreement with BMS for the development and commercialization rights to taldefgrobep alfa, a novel, Phase 3-ready anti-myostatin adnectin. The in-licensing of taldefgrobep expands our portfolio of innovative, late-stage product candidates for the treatment of neurologic, neuroinflammatory, and psychiatric indications. Under the terms of the agreement, we will receive worldwide rights to taldefgrobep alfa and BMS will be eligible for regulatory approval milestone payments, as well as tiered, sales-based royalty percentages from the high teens to the low twenties (Note 14). We plan to initiate a Phase 3 clinical trial of taldefgrobep alfa in SMA in 2022.\nCOVID-19 Update\nA novel strain of coronavirus (COVID-19) was first identified in Wuhan, China in December 2019, and subsequently declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization. To date, COVID-19 has surfaced in nearly all regions around the world and resulted in travel restrictions and business slowdowns or shutdowns in affected areas.\nAlthough, as of the date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we do not expect any material impact on our long-term activity, the extent to which COVID-19 impacts our business will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted, including new information which may emerge concerning the severity of COVID-19 and the actions to contain COVID-19 or treat its impact, among others, including government-imposed quarantines, travel restrictions and other public health safety measures.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic may impair our commercialization of NURTEC ODT. The spread of COVID-19 may reduce demand for NURTEC ODT. In response to regional quarantines, health professionals may reduce staffing and reduce or postpone appointments with patients, or patients may cancel or miss appointments, resulting in less prescriptions of NURTEC ODT than projected, thereby adversely affecting our revenues. In addition, in connection with the recent FDA approval of NURTEC ODT, we have been making presentations to physicians regarding the efficacy of NURTEC ODT but as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, we have needed to and may continue to need to conduct some or all of these key meetings with medical professionals solely by virtual means instead of in-person, which could reduce the number of medical professionals we are able to present to, and we cannot guarantee that any such virtual meetings will be as successful as in-person meetings. Moreover, restrictions on travel and transport may result in disruptions in NURTEC ODT distribution. Such events may result in a period of business disruption, and in reduced operations, any of which could materially affect\nour business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe continued spread of COVID-19 could also adversely impact our clinical trial operations. For example, we may be unable to enroll or retain an adequate number of patients to commence or complete our clinical trials, data may be missing, the FDA may delay or terminate clinical trials for any of our product candidates, or primary outcome measures may be impacted. As a result, our ability to generate product revenue from sales of any of those product candidates may be delayed or not realized at all.\nBusiness interruptions from the current or future pandemics may also adversely impact the third parties we rely on to sufficiently manufacture NURTEC ODT and to produce our product candidates in quantities we require, which may impair the commercialization of NURTEC ODT and our research and development activities.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic and responses to its spread have negatively impacted the global economy, disrupted global supply chains, and created significant volatility and disruption of financial markets. This significant disruption of the global financial markets could reduce our ability to access equity or debt capital on attractive terms if at all, which in turn could negatively affect our liquidity. In addition, a recession or market correction resulting from the spread of COVID-19 could materially affect our business and the value of our common shares.\nWe have taken numerous steps, and will continue to take further actions, in our approach to addressing the COVID-19 pandemic. We have implemented internal controls to contemplate a remote work environment and our incident management teams are in place to respond to changes in our work environment quickly and effectively. As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, we have instructed most of our employees to work from home. In April 2020, we announced a collaboration with Cove in order to facilitate telemedicine evaluation for migraine sufferers while patients are increasingly looking to remote evaluations during this time of unprecedented decreased access to routine office visits.\nWe continue to monitor the rapidly evolving situation and guidance from international and domestic authorities, including federal, state and local public health authorities and may take additional actions based on their recommendations. In these circumstances, there may be developments outside our control requiring us to adjust our operating plan. As such, given the dynamic nature of this situation, we cannot reasonably estimate the impacts of COVID-19 on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nComponents of Our Results of Operations\nProduct Revenues, Net\nWe began to recognize revenue from product sales, net of rebates, chargebacks, discounts and other adjustments, in March 2020 in conjunction with the launch of our first product, NURTEC ODT. We will continue to evaluate trends related to revenue momentum for NURTEC ODT, including any discernible impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic. If our development efforts for our other product candidates are successful and result in regulatory approval, or additional license agreements with third parties, we may generate additional revenue in the future from product sales.\nCost of Goods Sold\nCost of goods sold includes direct and indirect costs related to the manufacturing and distribution of NURTEC, including third-party manufacturing costs, packaging services, freight-in, third-party royalties payable on our net product revenues and amortization of intangible assets associated with NURTEC ODT.\nOperating Expenses\nResearch and Development Expenses\nResearch and development expenses consist primarily of costs incurred in connection with the development of our product candidates. We expense research and development costs as incurred. These expenses include:\n\u2022expenses incurred under agreements with contract research organizations ( CROs\u201d) or contract manufacturing organizations ( CMOs\u201d), as well as investigative sites and consultants that conduct our clinical trials, preclinical studies and other scientific development services;\n\u2022manufacturing scale-up expenses and the cost of acquiring and manufacturing preclinical and clinical trial materials and commercial materials, including manufacturing validation batches;\n\u2022employee-related expenses, including salaries, benefits, travel and non-cash share-based compensation expense for employees engaged in research and development functions;\n\u2022costs related to compliance with regulatory requirements;\n\u2022development milestone payments incurred prior to regulatory approval of the product candidate;\n\u2022payments made in cash, equity securities or other forms of consideration under third-party licensing agreements prior to\nregulatory approval of the product candidate; and\nWe recognize external development costs based on an evaluation of the progress to completion of specific tasks using estimates of our clinical personnel or information provided to us by our service providers.\nOur external direct research and development expenses are tracked on a program-by-program basis for our product candidates and consist primarily of external costs, such as fees paid to outside consultants, CROs, contract manufacturing organizations, and central laboratories in connection with our preclinical development, process development, manufacturing and clinical development activities. Our direct research and development expenses by program also include fees and certain development milestones incurred under license agreements. We do not allocate employee costs or other indirect costs, to specific programs because these costs are deployed across multiple programs and, as such, are not separately classified. We use internal resources primarily to oversee the research and development as well as for managing our preclinical development, process development, manufacturing and clinical development activities. Many employees work across multiple programs, and we do not track personnel costs by program.\nProduct candidates in later stages of clinical development generally have higher development costs than those in earlier stages of clinical development, primarily due to the increased size and duration of later-stage clinical trials. As a result, we expect that our research and development expenses will remain significant over the next several years as we increase personnel costs conduct clinical trials and prepare regulatory filings for our product candidates. We also expect to incur additional expenses related to milestone and royalty payments payable to third parties with whom we have entered into license agreements to acquire the rights to our product candidates.\nThe successful development and commercialization of our product candidates is highly uncertain. At this time, we cannot reasonably estimate or know the nature, timing and costs of the efforts that will be necessary to complete the preclinical and clinical development of any of our product candidates or when, if ever, material net cash inflows may commence from any of our product candidates. This uncertainty is due to the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with product development and commercialization, including the uncertainty of:\n\u2022the scope, progress, outcome and costs of our preclinical development activities, clinical trials and other research and development activities;\n\u2022establishment of an appropriate safety profile with IND-enabling studies;\n\u2022successful patient enrollment in, and the initiation and completion of, clinical trials;\n\u2022the timing, receipt and terms of any marketing approvals from applicable regulatory authorities;\n\u2022establishment of commercial manufacturing capabilities or making arrangements with third-party manufacturers;\n\u2022development and timely delivery of commercial-grade drug formulations that can be used in our clinical trials and for commercial launch;\n\u2022acquisition, maintenance, defense and enforcement of patent claims and other intellectual property rights;\n\u2022significant and changing government regulation;\n\u2022initiation of commercial sales of our product candidates, if and when approved, whether alone or in collaboration with others; and\n\u2022maintenance of a continued acceptable safety profile of the product candidates following approval.\nSelling, General and Administrative Expenses\nSelling, general and administrative expenses consist primarily of personnel costs, including salaries, benefits and travel expenses for our executive, commercial, finance, business, commercial, corporate development and other administrative functions; and non-cash share-based compensation expense. Selling, general and administrative expenses also include facilities and other related expenses, including rent, depreciation, maintenance of facilities, insurance and supplies; professional fees for expenses incurred under agreements with third parties relating to the commercialization of NURTEC ODT; and for public relations, audit, tax and legal services, including legal expenses to pursue patent protection of our intellectual property.\nWe anticipate that our selling, general and administrative expenses, including payroll and related expenses, will remain significant in the future as we continue to expand our operations and organizational capabilities, continue to support our commercial activities associated with NURTEC ODT, and prepare for potential commercialization of our product candidates, if successfully developed and approved. We also anticipate increased expenses associated with general operations, including costs related to accounting and legal services, director and officer insurance premiums, facilities and other corporate infrastructure and office-related costs, such as information technology costs.\nOther Income (Expense)\nInterest Expense\nInterest expense primarily consists of interest on our outstanding term loan with Sixth Street Specialty Lending, Inc., which includes interest expense on the outstanding loan balance, accretion of the debt discount and amortization of issuance costs. Our interest expense also includes implied interest on our finance leases associated with our commercial car fleet. We utilize the effective interest method to determine our interest expense on the term loan and finance leases and the straight-line method for the amortization of the debt issuance costs.\nInterest Expense on Mandatorily Redeemable Preferred Shares\nInterest expense on mandatorily redeemable preferred shares is being recognized in connection with the issuance of series A preferred shares and series B preferred shares pursuant to the Series A preferred share purchase agreement and Series B preferred shares forward contracts we entered into with RPI. Since we are required to redeem the series A preferred shares for 2x the original purchase price in equal quarterly installments by December 31, 2024 and the series B preferred shares for 1.77x the original purchase price in equal installments beginning on March 31, 2025 and ending December 31, 2030, we concluded that the Series A preferred shares and Series B preferred shares are mandatorily redeemable instruments and initially classified the preferred shares at their fair value as a liability. Interest expense on the mandatorily redeemable preferred shares represents the accretion of the carrying value of the preferred shares liability to its redemption value using the effective interest rate method.\nChange in Fair Value of Derivatives\nThe fair value of the derivative liability recognized in connection with contingent payments under the Series A Preferred Share Agreement is determined using the with-and-without valuation method. As inputs into the valuation, we considered the type and probability of occurrence of certain events, the amount of the payments, the expected timing of certain events, and a risk-adjusted discount rate. In accordance with ASC 815, Derivatives and Hedging, the fair value of the derivative is recorded on the consolidated balance sheet as a Series A preferred derivative liability with changes in fair value recorded in other income (expense) in the consolidated statements of operations.\nThe fair value of the derivative liability recognized in connection with the Series B Preferred Shares Forward Contracts is determined using discounted cash flow and Monte Carlo valuation methods. As inputs into the valuation, we considered the probability of occurrence of certain change of control events, the amount of the payments, the expected timing of certain events, and a risk-adjusted discount rate. In accordance\nwith ASC 815, Derivatives and Hedging, the fair value of the derivative is recorded on the consolidated balance sheet as a Series B preferred shares forward contact with changes in fair value recorded in other income (expense) in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss.\nInterest Expense on Liability Related to Sale of Future Royalties\nWe have accounted for the 2018 RPI Funding Agreement and a unit of accounting of the 2020 RPI Funding Agreement with RPI Trust both as liability financings, primarily because they have significant continuing involvement in generating the future revenue on which the royalties are based. The liabilities related to sale of future royalties and the related non-cash interest expense are measured based on our current estimate of the timing and amount of future royalties expected to be paid over the estimated terms of the 2018 RPI Funding Agreement and 2020 RPI Funding Agreement. The liabilities are amortized using the effective interest rate method, resulting in recognition of non-cash interest expense over the estimated term of the agreement. Each reporting period, we assess the estimated timing and amount of future expected royalty payments over the estimated terms. If there is a change to one of the estimates, we recognize the impact to the liability's amortization schedule and the related non-cash interest expense prospectively. Our estimate of the amount of expected future royalties to be paid considers the probability of success of compounds not yet approved for sale, and market penetration rates, compliance rate, and net pricing of both NURTEC ODT and compounds not yet approved for sale. Additionally, the transaction costs associated with the liabilities will be amortized to non-cash interest expense over the estimated term of the 2018 RPI Funding Agreement and 2020 RPI Funding Agreement, respectively.\nGain (Loss) from Equity Method Investment\nPrior to our acquisition of Kleo in January 2021, we owned approximately 42% of the outstanding shares as of December 31, 2020, and accounted for our investment in Kleo under the equity method of accounting. As a result, our proportionate share of Kleo's net income or loss each reporting period was included in other income (expense), net, in our consolidated statement of operations and results in a corresponding adjustment to the carrying value of the equity method investment on our consolidated balance sheet.\nOn January 4, 2021, we acquired the rest of the shares of Kleo, and post-transaction we own 100% of the outstanding shares of Kleo.\nProvision for Income Taxes\nAs a company incorporated in the British Virgin Islands ( BVI\u201d), we are principally subject to taxation in the BVI. Under the current laws of the BVI, tax on a company's income is assessed at a zero percent tax rate. As a result, we have not recorded any income tax\nbenefits from losses incurred in the BVI during each reporting period, and no net operating loss carryforwards will be available to us for those losses. We have historically outsourced all of the research and clinical development for our programs under a master services agreement with our wholly owned subsidiary, Biohaven Pharmaceuticals, Inc., a Delaware corporation ( BPI\u201d). As a result of providing services under this agreement and profit from US commercial sales of NURTEC ODT, BPI was profitable during the year ended December 31, 2021, and BPI is subject to taxation in the United States.\nIn August 2020, we completed an intra-entity asset transfer of certain of our intellectual property to our Irish subsidiary. As a result of the transfer, we recorded a deferred tax asset of $875.0 million for the step up in tax basis received pursuant to Irish tax law. Based on our analysis of all available objective evidence, we concluded that it was more likely than not that the deferred tax asset from the intra-entity transfer will not be realized due to the lack of net operating income history of our subsidiary. Therefore, we established a full valuation allowance against our net deferred tax asset in Ireland.\nWe continue to maintain a valuation allowance against our US deferred tax assets. We periodically review our position and have determined that a full valuation allowance on these assets was appropriate due to excess research and development (\"R&D\") credit carryforwards as of December 31, 2021. We will continue to evaluate the need for a valuation allowance on our deferred tax assets until there is sufficient positive evidence to support the reversal of all or some portion of these allowances. We anticipate the commercialization of NURTEC ODT will result in future earnings and believe sufficient positive evidence may become available to allow us to reach a conclusion that a significant portion, or all, of the valuation allowance will no longer be needed. Release of the valuation allowance would result in the recognition of certain deferred tax assets and a decrease to income tax expense for the period the release is recorded. However, the exact timing and amount of the valuation allowance release is subject to change on the basis of the level of profitability that we are able to actually achieve.\nIn January 2021, we completed the acquisition of Kleo. The acquisition and inclusion of Kleo did not result in a material impact on the provision for income taxes or the effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2021. We recorded a full valuation allowance against our Kleo US deferred tax assets and will periodically review our position and have determined that a full valuation allowance on these assets was appropriate due to Kleo's cumulative loss history. We will continue to evaluate the need for a valuation allowance on our deferred tax assets until there is sufficient positive evidence to support the reversal of all or some portion of these allowances.\nWe recorded an income tax provision during the year ended December 31, 2021 of $5.1 million which primarily represents certain state taxes for the period and US federal taxes due to general business credit limitations.\nResults of Operations\nComparison of the Years Ended December 31, 2021 and 2020\nThe following table summarizes our results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020: \nProduct Revenue, Net\nWe began recording product revenues in the first quarter of 2020 following the approval of NURTEC ODT by the FDA on February 27, 2020 and its subsequent commercial launch in the U.S. in March 2020. Net product revenue was $462.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, compared to $63.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. The increase of $398.9 million in net product revenues was due to both increased NURTEC ODT sales volume and improvements in net price realization due to decreases in sales allowances in 2021, compared to 2020, and a full year of NURTEC ODT sales during 2021 compared to a partial period of NURTEC ODT sales in 2020. Sales allowances and accruals mostly consisted of patient affordability programs, distribution fees and rebates.\nCost of Goods Sold\nCost of goods sold of $91.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 is primarily related to\nroyalties on net sales payable to BMS under a license agreement, manufacturing costs for NURTEC ODT, certain distribution costs and amortization of intangible assets related to milestone payments to BMS and Catalent. The increase of $74.0 million in cost of goods sold was primarily due to increased NURTEC ODT sales during the year ended December 31, 2021, compared to the year ended December 31, 2020, which had no material manufacturing costs included as the majority of the costs were incurred prior to FDA approval and as such recorded as research and development expense.\nResearch and Development Expenses \nR&D expenses, including non-cash share-based compensation costs, were $361.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, compared to $229.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. The increase of $132.3 million was primarily due to:\n\u2022a $52.9 million increase in personnel costs, driven by a $28.4 million increase in share-based compensation expense, as well as increases in headcount, merit increases and bonuses;\n\u2022increased expenses from later stage trials in our zavegepant programs of $17.9 million, which included a partial offset related to a $30.8 million reduction in our obligation to perform R&D services for zavegepant; and\n\u2022increases in preclinical research costs of $16.9 million, which included upfront payments of $2.0 million to Yale University in connection with a license agreement, $5.9 million to Moda Pharmaceuticals LLC in connection with a consulting agreement, and $3.7 million to Reliant Glycosciences, LLC in connection with a development and license agreement;\n\u2022increases in direct costs of $11.6 million, $9.5 million and $8.5 million for our rimegepant, verdiperstat and troriluzole programs, respectively, in 2021; and\n\u2022increases of $11.0 million in various other unallocated R&D costs.\nSelling, General and Administrative Expenses\nSG&A expenses, including non-cash share-based compensation costs, were $713.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, compared to $462.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. The increase of $251.2 million was primarily due to increased spending to support the continued launch of NURTEC ODT, including the launch of NURTEC ODT for the\npreventative treatment of migraine which was approved by the FDA in May of 2021. The increased spending included increases in marketing and advertising expenses, professional fees and non-cash share based compensation. Less than half of the SG&A expense was for commercial organization personnel costs, excluding non-cash share-based compensation expense. The increase of $41.3 million in non-cash share based compensation expense was primarily due to our annual equity incentive awards that were granted in the first quarter of 2021.\nOther Income (Expense), Net\nOther income (expense), net was a net expense of $139.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, compared to net expense of $113.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. The increase of $26.3 million in net expense was primarily due to increased interest expense on our term loans with Sixth Street, which were drawn in the third quarter of 2020 and the third quarter of 2021, an increase in the interest expense recognized on our liability related to the sale of future royalties, and increased interest expense on our liability related to the mandatorily redeemable preferred shares resulting from the sale of Series A Preferred Shares to RPI in April 2019. These increases were partially offset by a change in gain (loss) on equity investment of $9.4 million, primarily due to the acquisition of Kleo Pharmaceuticals, Inc. in the first quarter of 2021, and a $16.5 million decrease in expense related to changes in the fair value of our derivatives.\nProvision for Income Taxes\nWe recorded a provision for income taxes of $5.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, compared to a provision for income taxes of $10.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. The tax provision recorded for the year ended December 31, 2021 was primarily attributable to our profitable operations in the United States during the year.\nComparison of the Years Ended December 31, 2020 and 2019\nThe following table summarizes our results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019: \nProduct Revenue, net\nWe began recording product revenues in the first quarter of 2020 following the approval of NURTEC ODT by the FDA on February 27, 2020 and its subsequent commercial launch in the U.S. in March 2020. During the year ended December 31, 2020, we recognized $63.6 million of net product revenues related to sales of NURTEC ODT. Sales allowances and accruals mostly consisted of co-pay card discounts, distribution fees and rebates.\nCost of Goods Sold\nCost of goods sold of $17.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 is related to royalties on net sales payable to BMS under a license agreement (see Note 17 \"Commitments and Contingencies\" to our consolidated financial statements), product costs\nincurred after FDA approval, certain distribution costs and amortization of intangible assets related to milestone payments to BMS and Catalent, Inc. (\"Catalent\"). See Note 14 \"License and Other Agreements\" to our consolidated financial statements. Prior to receiving initial FDA approval for NURTEC ODT on February 27, 2020, we manufactured NURTEC ODT inventory to be sold upon commercialization and recorded all costs incurred as research and development expense. As a result, the manufacturing costs related to the NURTEC inventory build-up incurred before FDA approval were already expensed in a prior period and are therefore excluded from the cost of goods sold for the year ended December 31, 2020. These previously expensed costs were not material for the year ended December 31, 2020. The inventory build-up incurred before FDA approval was sold prior to the start of the fourth quarter of 2020.\nResearch and Development Expenses \nResearch and development expenses including one-time regulatory and license fees were $229.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to $344.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The decrease of $115.7 million was primarily due to:\n\u2022one-time $105.0 million purchase of a priority review voucher to expedite the regulatory review of rimegepant ODT formulation in the second quarter of 2019;\n\u2022filing fees of $7.6 million related to our rimegepant NDA submissions to the FDA in the second quarter of 2019;\n\u2022development milestones payable to BMS of $11.5 million for rimegepant NDA submissions in 2019;\n\u2022non-cash research and development expense of $5.6 million due to issuance of common shares in the second quarter of 2019 relating to the collaborative discovery program with Fox Chase;\n\u2022decreases in direct costs of $8.0 million for our zavegepant program, mainly due to expenses for development milestones payable to BMS of $10.0 million in 2019;\n\u2022increases in direct costs of $4.3 million for our troriluzole program in 2020, which include increases for our OCD, and Alzheimer's Disease trials;\n\u2022increases in direct costs of $14.1 million for our verdiperstat program in 2020; and\n\u2022increases in personnel costs of $6.6 million mainly due to an increase of $8.4 million in non-\ncash share-based compensation in 2020 as a result of additional share-based compensation awards, hiring additional research and development personnel, and the implementation of the Employee Share Purchase Plan.\n\u2022increases due to the global collaboration and license agreement with Sosei Heptares, which included an upfront cash payment of $5.0 million and the issuance 54,617 shares valued at $4.9 million to Sosei Heptares.\nSelling, General and Administrative Expenses\nSelling, general and administrative expenses were $462.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to $134.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase of $327.9 million was primarily due to an increase in spending to support the commercial launch of NURTEC ODT. Less than half of the SG&A expense was for commercial organization personnel costs, excluding non-cash share-based compensation expense. Non-cash share-based compensation expense, included in personnel related costs, was $33.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, an increase of $5.0 million as compared to the same period in 2019.\nOther Income (Expense), Net\nOther income (expense), net was a net expense of $113.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to net expense of $49.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase of $63.7 million in net expense was primarily due to interest expense on our outstanding term loan with Sixth Street Specialty Lending, Inc, the non-cash interest expense on our liability related to the mandatorily redeemable preferred shares resulting from the sale of Series A Preferred\nShares to RPI in April 2019, an increase in the non-cash interest expense recognized on our liability related to the sale of future royalties, and an increase in the change in fair value of derivative liability related to the Series B Preferred Shares Forward Contracts.\nProvision for Income Taxes\nWe recorded a provision for income taxes of $10.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to a provision for income taxes of $0.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The provision for income taxes is comprised of $5.0 million relating to US federal and state income taxes for BPI's profitable operations in the United States and $5.2 million of uncertain tax benefits recognized in the period December 31, 2020.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nSince our inception, we have incurred significant operating losses and negative cash flows from our operations. We have funded our operations primarily with proceeds from sales of our common and preferred equity, sales of revenue participation rights related to future royalties, a senior secured credit facility and the Collaboration Agreement with Pfizer. In addition, we began to generate net product revenue in the first\nquarter of 2020 in conjunction with the launch of our first product, NURTEC ODT.\nWe continuously assess our working capital needs, capital expenditure requirements and future investments or acquisitions. As of February 25, 2022, we expect that our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities as of December 31, 2021, our future operating cash flows from sales of NURTEC ODT, $125.0 million in potential future borrowings under our credit facility, proceeds related to the settlement of our Series B preferred shares forward contracts, potential sales of common shares under the Equity Distribution Agreement in 2022, and the $500.0 million in proceeds received on January 4, 2022 and potential milestone payments from the strategic collaboration with Pfizer will be sufficient sources of cash to meet our cash needs for more than one year.\nAs of December 31, 2021, we had cash and cash equivalents of $171.9 million, excluding restricted cash of $2.4 million. Cash in excess of immediate requirements is invested in marketable securities with a view to liquidity and capital preservation. As of December 31, 2021, we had marketable securities of $192.6 million.\nCash Flows\nThe following table summarizes our cash flows for each of the periods presented: \nOperating Activities\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2021, we used $831.1 million of cash in operating activities, an increase of $128.2 million as compared to the year ended December 31, 2020. The increase in cash usage was primarily due to an increase in SG&A expenses due to increased costs, including advertising, to support the commercial growth of NURTEC ODT and an increase in R&D expenses to support our portfolio of late stage product candidates and preclinical assets, partially offset by an increase in cash receipts from an increase in net product revenue from sales of NURTEC ODT. The increase in cash usage was also due to $62.5 million in payments to RPI for the mandatory redemption of 624 Series A preferred shares, which were accounted for as payments of accrued interest on the mandatorily redeemable preferred shares liability.\nInvesting Activities\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2021, net cash provided by investing activities was $26.6 million, an increase of $296.4 million as compared to the year ended December 31, 2020. The increase was primarily due to an increase of $126.6 million of sales and maturities of marketable securities, a decrease of $126.1 million of purchases of marketable securities, and a decrease of $41.5 million of payments for intangible assets during the year ended December 31, 2021. The $41.5 million of payments for intangible assets during the year ended December 31, 2020 are milestone payments related to the FDA approval and launch of NURTEC ODT.\nFinancing Activities\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2021, net cash provided by financing activities was $844.8 million, an increase of $56.0 million compared to the year ended\nDecember 31, 2020. The increase was primarily due to an increase of $97.9 million of R&D funding, $75.0 million of long-term debt and $70.4 million for the issuance of Series B preferred shares all in the year ended December 31, 2021 partially offset by $147.5 million from the sale of future royalties and $60.0 million from the sale of contingently redeemable non-controlling interests during the year ended December 31, 2020.\nPfizer Collaboration Agreement\nIn November 2021, we entered into the Collaboration Agreement with Pfizer, pursuant to which Pfizer would commercialize the Licensed Products in all countries worldwide outside of the United States. In consideration thereof, in January 2022 Pfizer made an upfront payment of $150.0 million to Biohaven upon receipt of the requisite regulatory approvals needed for the effectiveness of the Collaboration Agreement. In addition, in January 2022 Pfizer purchased $350.0 million worth of Biohaven common shares at approximately $173.05 per share. We will be eligible to receive an aggregate additional $740.0 million in contingent payments based on specified commercial and sales-based milestones for the Licensed Products.\nWe are also entitled to tiered, escalating royalties from the upper teens to twenty percent of net sales of Licensed Products in the Territory. In general, Pfizer's obligation to pay royalties continues on a product-by-product and country-by-country basis until the latest of ten years after the first commercial sale of such product in such country, the expiration of the patent rights covering such product in such country or the expiration of the period of exclusivity applicable to such product in such country. In addition to the upfront payments, contingent payments and royalties described above, Pfizer will also compensate us for a pro-rata share of certain of our sales-based milestone obligations owed to BMS under the BMS License, and related net sales royalties owed to BMS and RPI that result from Pfizer's commercialization and sale, respectively, of the Licensed Products in the Territory.\nCredit Facility\nIn August 2020, we entered into a financing agreement, as amended, with the Lenders pursuant to which the Lenders agreed to extend a senior secured credit facility to the Company providing for term loans in an aggregate principal amount up to $500.0 million, plus any capitalized interest paid in kind. We drew an initial term loan of $275.0 million at closing in August 2020 (the \"Initial Term Loan\"), and had $100.0 million of immediately available delayed draw term loan commitments and $125.0 million of delayed draw term loan commitments available upon achievement of the Delay Draw Sales Milestone (as defined in the Sixth Street Financing Agreement).\nIn March 2021, we entered into Amendment No. 1 (the First Amendment\u201d) to the financing agreement\npursuant to which the parties agreed to, among other things, remove the Delayed Draw Sales Milestone tied to the availability of the $125.0 million tranche of delayed draw term loans. In August 2021, we drew the $125.0 million tranche of delayed draw term loans (the \"DDTL-2).\nIn September 2021, we entered into Amendment No. 2 (the Second Amendment\u201d) to the financing agreement. Pursuant to the Second Amendment, the parties agreed to, among other things, increase the size of the credit facility by providing for additional term loans in an aggregate principal amount of $250.0 million for a total facility size of $750.0 million plus any capitalized interest paid in kind. At closing of the Second Amendment, we drew an initial term loan of $125.0 million (the \"2021 Term Loan\") and $100.0 million of delayed draw term loan commitments (the \"DDTL-1\"). The remaining $125.0 million in delayed draw term loan commitments (the \"2021 DDTL Commitment\") was available to be drawn by the Borrowers until December 31, 2021 (the \"Delayed Draw Term Loan Commitment Termination Date\").\nIn November 2021, we entered into Amendment No. 3 and Limited Consent to Financing Agreement ( the Third Amendment and Limited Consent\u201d) to our Sixth Street Financing Agreement. Pursuant to the Third Amendment and Limited Consent, the Lenders consented to our entry into the Collaboration Agreement with Pfizer.\nIn December 2021, we entered into Amendment No. 4 (the \"Fourth Amendment\") to the financing agreement (as previously amended and as amended by the Fourth Amendment, the Sixth Street Financing Agreement\u201d), pursuant to which the parties agreed to, among other things, extend the Delayed Draw Term Loan Commitment Termination Date to June 30, 2022.\n2020 Loans\nIn August 2020, we borrowed the Initial Term Loan for total proceeds of $262.2 million, net of discounts and issuance costs. In August 2021, we borrowed the DDTL-2 for total proceeds of $123.8 million, net of discounts and issuance costs. The DDTL-2 was borrowed under the same financing terms as the Initial Term Loan. The Initial Term Loan and the DDTL-2 (collectively, the \"August 2020 Loans\") become due and payable in August 2025. The August 2020 Loans accrue interest at a variable rate, with interest paid on a quarterly basis. The interest rate on the August 2020 Loans as of December 31, 2021 was 10.0%. We have the option to pay-in-kind up to 4.0% interest per annum for the first two years and have elected to pay-in-kind the maximum amount for all interest payments as of December 31, 2021. The proceeds from the August 2020 Loans are being used for general corporate purposes.\n2021 Loans\nIn September 2021, we borrowed the 2021 Term Loan for total proceeds of $119.7 million and the DDTL-1\nfor total proceeds of $97.8 million, both net of discounts and issuance costs. The 2021 Term Loan and the DDTL-1 (collectively, the \"September 2021 Loans\") become due and payable in September 2026. The September 2021 Loans accrue interest at a variable rate, with interest paid on a quarterly basis. The interest rate on the September 2021 Loans as of December 31, 2021 was 9.25%. We have the option to pay-in-kind up to 4.0% interest per annum for the first two years that the loans are outstanding. The proceeds from the September 2021 Loans are being used for general corporate purposes.\nAs of December 31, 2021, we have $125.0 million in delayed draw term loan commitments still available to borrow under the Sixth Street Financing Agreement until June 30, 2022. If drawn, the loans will be borrowed under the same financing terms as the September 2021 Loans.\nEquity Distribution Agreement\nIn December 2020, we entered into an equity distribution agreement in which we may offer and sell common shares having an aggregate offering price of up to $400.0 million from time to time through or to the sales agents, acting as our agents or principals (the \"Equity Distribution Agreement\"). Sales of our common shares, if any, will be made in sales deemed to be at the market offerings\u201d. The sales agents are not required to sell any specific amount of securities but will act as our sales agents using commercially reasonable efforts consistent with their normal trading and sales practices, on mutually agreed terms between the sales agents and us. We currently plan to use the net proceeds from the offering for general corporate purposes.\nAs of December 31, 2021, we have issued and sold 939,328 common shares for net proceeds of approximately $78.7 million all in the first quarter of 2021 under the Equity Distribution Agreement.\nSeries B Preferred Shares Forward Contracts\nIn August 2020, we entered into the Series B preferred share agreement, whereby RPI will invest in the Company through the purchase of up to 3,992 Series B preferred shares at a price of $50,100 per share for aggregate proceeds of approximately $200.0 million (the \"RPI Series B Preferred Share Agreement\"). The shares will be issued in quarterly increments from March 31, 2021 to December 31, 2024. We are required to redeem the Series B Preferred Shares for 1.77 times the original purchase price, payable beginning March 31, 2025 in equal quarterly installments through December 31, 2030. The gross proceeds from the transaction with RPI will be used for the clinical development of zavegepant and other general corporate purposes.\nAs of December 31, 2021, we have issued 1,406 Series B preferred shares to RPI for proceeds of $70.4 million.\nFunding Requirements\nWe expect our expenses to increase in connection with our ongoing activities, particularly as we advance and expand preclinical activities, clinical trials and commercialization of our product candidates. Our costs will also increase as we:\n\u2022continue and expand our commercial activities related to NURTEC ODT for the acute treatment of migraine;\n\u2022advance and expand the development of our CGRP and glutamate modulation platform product candidates and continue development of our MPO platform;\n\u2022conduct ongoing Phase 2 proof of concept trial to evaluate the safety and efficacy of rimegepant in patients with treatment refractory trigeminal neuralgia;\n\u2022complete the ongoing extension phase of the Phase 2/3 clinical trial of troriluzole in SCA and our ongoing Phase 3 trials of troriluzole in OCD, and complete our ongoing Phase 3 randomized controlled trial to assess the efficacy of troriluzole in SCA;\n\u2022conduct support activities for future clinical trials of BHV-5000;\n\u2022complete the Phase 3 clinical trial of oral zavegepant and related support activities, and continue other clinical trials of oral zavegepant;\n\u2022continue to initiate and progress other supporting studies required for regulatory approval of our product candidates, including long-term safety studies, drug-drug interaction studies, preclinical toxicology and carcinogenicity studies;\n\u2022make required milestone and royalty payments under the license agreements by which we acquired some of the rights to our product candidates;\n\u2022initiate preclinical studies and clinical trials for any additional indications for our current product candidates and any future product candidates that we may pursue;\n\u2022continue to build our portfolio of product candidates through the acquisition or in-license of additional product candidates or technologies;\n\u2022continue to develop, maintain, expand and protect our intellectual property portfolio;\n\u2022pursue regulatory approvals for our current and future product candidates that successfully complete clinical trials;\n\u2022support our sales, marketing and distribution infrastructure to commercialize any future product candidates for which we may obtain marketing approval;\n\u2022hire additional clinical, medical, commercial, and development personnel; and\n\u2022incur additional legal, accounting and other expenses in operating as a public company.\nAs of February 25, 2022, the issuance date of our consolidated financial statements, we expect that our cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities as of December 31, 2021, our furture operating cash flows from sales of NURTEC ODT, the funds available from the Sixth Street Financing Agreement, proceeds from the issuance of Series B Preferred Shares, potential sales under the Equity Distribution Agreement in 2022, and proceeds from our Collaboration Agreement with Pfizer will be sufficient to fund our current forecast for operating expenses, including commercialization of NURTEC ODT, financial commitments and other cash requirements for more than one year. We may need to raise additional capital until we are profitable. If no additional capital is raised through either public or private equity financings, debt financings, strategic relationships, alliances and licensing agreements, or a combination thereof, we may delay, limit or reduce discretionary spending in areas related to research and development activities and other general and administrative expenses in order to fund our operating costs and working capital needs.\nWe have based these estimates on assumptions that may prove to be wrong, and we could utilize our available capital resources sooner than we expect. We expect that we will require additional capital to pursue in-licenses or acquisitions of other product candidates. If we receive regulatory approval for troriluzole, or our other product candidates, we expect to incur additional commercialization expenses related to product manufacturing, sales, marketing and distribution, depending on whether we commercialize jointly or on our own.\nBecause of the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with research, development and commercialization of pharmaceutical product candidates, we are unable to estimate the exact amount of our working capital requirements. Our future funding requirements will depend on and could increase significantly as a result of many factors, including:\n\u2022the scope, progress, results and costs of researching and developing our product candidates, and conducting preclinical studies and clinical trials;\n\u2022the costs, timing and outcome of regulatory review of our product candidates;\n\u2022the effect of COVID-19 pandemic on our business operations and funding needs;\n\u2022the costs of future activities, including product sales, medical affairs, marketing, manufacturing and distribution, for NURTEC ODT, in addition to any of our product candidates for which we receive marketing approval;\n\u2022the revenue from NURTEC ODT, and revenue, if any, received from commercial sale of our products, should any of our product candidates receive marketing approval;\n\u2022the costs and timing of hiring new employees to support our continued growth;\n\u2022the costs of preparing, filing, and prosecuting patent applications, maintaining and enforcing our intellectual property rights and defending intellectual property-related claims;\n\u2022the extent to which we acquire or in-license other product candidates and technologies;\n\u2022the costs of manufacturing commercial-grade product and necessary inventory to support commercial launch;\n\u2022the costs associated with payment of milestones and royalties under existing contractual arrangements and/or in-licensing additional products candidates to augment our current pipeline; and\n\u2022the timing, receipt and amount of sales of, or milestone payments related to or royalties on, our current or future product candidates, if any.\nUntil such time, if ever, that we can generate product revenue sufficient to achieve profitability, we expect to finance our cash needs through a combination of public and private equity offerings, debt financings, other third-party funding, strategic alliances, licensing arrangements or marketing and distribution arrangements. To the extent that we raise additional capital through the sale of equity or convertible debt securities, the ownership interest of our existing shareholders will be diluted, and the terms of these securities may include liquidation or other preferences that adversely affect the rights of our existing shareholders. Debt financing and preferred equity financing, if available, may involve agreements that include covenants limiting or restricting our ability to take specific actions, such as incurring additional debt, making capital expenditures or declaring dividends. If we raise additional funds through other third-party funding, strategic alliances, licensing arrangements or marketing and distribution arrangements, we may have\nto relinquish valuable rights to our technologies, future revenue streams, research programs or product candidates or grant licenses on terms that may not be favorable to us. If we are unable to raise additional funds through equity or debt financings when needed, we will\nbe required to delay, limit, reduce or terminate our product development or future commercialization efforts or grant rights to develop and market products or product candidates that we would otherwise prefer to develop and market ourselves.\nContractual Obligations and Commitments\nThe following table summarizes certain estimated future obligations by period under our various contractual obligations as of December 31, 2021 and the effects that such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flows in future periods: \n(1) Principal payments on long-term debt relate to the $625.0 million in term loans drawn under our senior secured credit facility with Sixth Street Specialty Lending, Inc., and includes the capitalization and payment as principal of $50.3 million of interest paid-in-kind.\n(2) Interest payments on long-term debt are calculated using the 10.00% interest rate on the August 2020 Loans and 9.25% on the September 2021 Loans, our outstanding term loans in effect on December 31, 2021. It excludes 4% of interest paid-in-kind for the first eight quarters that the loans are outstanding and includes the effect of the inclusion of the interest paid-in-kind as part of the outstanding loan principal.\n(3) Commercial commitments primarily related to advertising, data license agreements and manufacturing preparation services that are enforceable and legally binding on us and that specify all significant terms, including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed, minimum or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the transaction. For obligations with cancellation provisions, the amounts included in the preceding table are limited to the non-cancelable portion of the agreement terms or the minimum cancellation fee.\n(4) Research commitments are primarily CRO and CMO agreements that are enforceable and legally binding on us and that specify all significant terms, including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed, minimum or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the transaction. For obligations with cancellation provisions, the amounts included in the preceding table are limited to the non-cancelable portion of the agreement terms or the minimum cancellation fee.\n(5) Pursuant to the Series A Preferred Shares Agreement with RPI, the mandatorily redeemable preferred shares are redeemed in cash in equal quarterly installments beginning on March 31, 2021 and ending December 31, 2024.\n(6) The Series B preferred shares forward contracts require RPI to purchase $200.0 million of Series B preferred shares from us on a quarterly basis beginning on March 31, 2021 and ending on December 31, 2024. After December 31, 2024, we are required to redeem the Series B preferred shares at 1.77x the purchase price in quarterly installments ending December 31, 2030.\nIn addition to the contractual obligations in the table above, under various agreements with third-party licensors and collaborators, we have agreed to make milestone payments and pay royalties and annual maintenance fees to third parties and to meet due diligence requirements based upon specified milestones. We have not included any contingent payment obligations, such as milestones, royalties, or due diligence, in the table above as the amount, timing and likelihood of such payments are not known. We have not included any of the annual license maintenance fee payments in the above table, as although the amount and timing are known, we cannot currently determine the final termination dates of the agreements and, as a result, we cannot determine the total amounts of such payments we will be required to make under the agreements. We do not anticipate making material annual license maintenance payments related to our license agreements in the next 12 months.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Significant Judgments and Estimates\nOur consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (\"GAAP\"). The preparation of our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, costs and expenses, and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities in our financial statements. We base our estimates on historical experience, known trends and events and various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. We evaluate our estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis.\nOur actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. While our significant accounting policies are described in more detail in Note 2 \"Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\" in the notes to our financial statements appearing at the end of this Annual Report, we believe that the following accounting policies are those most critical to the judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements.\nRevenue Recognition\nRevenues from product sales are recorded at the net sales price, or transaction price,\u201d which includes estimates of variable consideration that result from (a) invoice discounts for prompt payment and distribution service fees, (b) government and private payor rebates, chargebacks, discounts and fees, (c) product returns and (d) costs of co-pay assistance programs for patients, as well as other incentives for certain indirect customers. Reserves are established for the estimates of variable consideration based on the amounts earned or to be claimed on the related sales. The reserves are classified as reductions to trade receivable, net if payable to a Customer or accrued expenses if payable to a third-party. Where appropriate, we utilize the expected value method to determine the appropriate amount for estimates of variable consideration based on factors such as our historical experience, current contractual and statutory requirements, specific known market events and trends, industry data and forecasted customer buying and payment patterns. The amount of variable consideration that is included in the transaction price may be constrained and is included in net product revenues only to the extent that it is probable that a significant reversal in the amount of the cumulative revenue recognized will not occur in a future period. Actual amounts of consideration ultimately received may differ from our estimates. If actual results vary from our estimates, we adjust these estimates, which would affect net product revenue and earnings in the period such variances become known.\nWe make significant estimates and judgments that materially affect our recognition of net product revenue. Claims by third-party payors for rebates, chargebacks and discounts frequently are submitted to us significantly after the related sales, potentially resulting in adjustments in the period in which the new information becomes known. We will adjust our estimates based on new information, including information regarding actual rebates, chargebacks and discounts for our products, as it becomes available.\nInterest Expense and Liability Related to Sale of Future Royalties\nWe have accounted for the 2018 Funding Agreement with RPI Finance Trust (\"RPI\") and a portion of the 2020 Funding Agreement with RPI 2019 Intermediate Finance Trust ( RPI 2019 IFT\u201d) as liability financings. See Note 7 \"Liability Related to Sale of Future Royalties, net\" for additional details. The liability related to sale of future royalties and the related interest expense are measured based on our current estimate of the timing and amount of expected future royalties expected to be paid over the estimated term of the related funding agreement with RPI Trust. The liability is amortized using the effective interest rate method, resulting in recognition of interest expense over the estimated term of the agreement. Each reporting period, we assess the estimated timing and amount of future expected royalty payments over the estimated term. If there are changes to the estimate, we recognize the impact to the liability's amortization schedule and the related interest expense prospectively. Our estimate of the amount of expected future royalties to be paid considers the probability of success of the compounds being approved for sale, market penetration rates of the compounds upon approval, compliance rate and net pricing.\nValuation of Series B Forward Contract Derivative\nThe fair value of the derivative recognized in connection with the RPI Series B Preferred Share Agreement was determined based on significant inputs not observable in the market. The fair value of the derivative primarily relates to the difference between the fair value of the Series B Preferred Shares and the contractual future purchase price. The fair value of the Series B Preferred Shares is calculated based on the cash flows to RPI (1.77 times the original purchase price as scheduled or accelerated upon certain events) and our estimated cost of capital for those cash flows. The cash flows to RPI are based on probability adjusted cash flows from certain scenarios outlined in the agreement that would result in accelerated payments modeled using a Monte Carlo simulation. As inputs into the valuation, we considered the type and probability of occurrence of certain change of control events, the amount of the payments, the expected timing of certain acceleration of payments, and a risk-adjusted discount rate. Assessing the probability of certain change of control events over a 10-year time period requires significant judgment and the successful completion of a\nchange of control is largely dependent on the outcome of potential negotiations with a third party. Due to this uncertainty, our expectation of the probability of the timing of a change of control event at the reporting date could reasonably be different than the timing of an actual change of control event, and if so, would mean the estimated fair value could differ from the fair value determined.\nIncome Taxes\nIn August 2020, we completed an intra-entity asset transfer of intellectual property (\"IP\"). See Note 15 \"Income Taxes\" for additional details. The fair value of the transferred IP required significant and complex management judgments to establish assumptions about the intellectual property's fair value, including revenue growth rates, projected profit margins, and discount rate. The fair value determination was based upon a discounted cash flow model that was subject to significant judgement given the IP asset transferred had been recently launched and there was limited historical sales activity. As a result of the transfer, we recognized a deferred tax asset for the step up in tax basis based on the fair value of the transferred IP.\nWe periodically evaluate the likelihood of the realization of deferred tax assets and reduce the carrying amount of these deferred tax assets by a valuation allowance to the extent we believe a portion will not be realized. We continue to maintain a full valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets recognized in connection with our intra-entity transfer of IP as realization is not certain due to a lack of net operating income history by taxing jurisdictions. We consider many factors when assessing the likelihood of future realization of deferred tax assets, including our current operating results, expectations of future taxable income, carryforward periods available to us for tax reporting purposes, various income tax strategies, and other relevant factors. Significant judgment is required in making this assessment and, to the extent future expectations change, we would assess the recoverability of our deferred tax assets at that time.\nRecently Issued Accounting Pronouncements\nA description of recently issued accounting pronouncements that may potentially impact our financial position and results of operations is disclosed in Note 2 to our

due to increased sales of NURTEC ODT. \n\n- R&D expenses were $361.3 million in 2021, up from $229.0 million in 2020, primarily due to increased personnel costs, expenses for later stage trials of zavegepant, and payments for license agreements.\n\n- SG&A expenses were $713.5 million in 2021, up from $462.3 million in 2020, primarily due to increased costs to support the commercialization of NURTEC ODT. \n\n- Net cash used in operating activities was $831.1 million in 2021, up from $702.9 million in 2020, due to increased R&D and SG&A expenses, partially offset by increased cash from NURTEC ODT sales.\n\n- In 2021, cash provided by financing activities was $844.8 million, primarily from debt issuances, sale of future royalties, and sale of Series B preferred shares. \n\n- As of December 31, 2021, cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities totaled $364.5 million. \n\n- The company expects existing cash resources, future NURTEC ODT sales, and potential milestone payments
