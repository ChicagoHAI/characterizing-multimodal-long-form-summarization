References herein to Redwood,\u201d the company,\u201d we,\u201d us,\u201d and our\u201d include Redwood Trust, Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries, unless the context otherwise requires. The discussion in this MD&A contains forward-looking statements that involve substantial risks and uncertainties. Our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of various factors, such as those discussed in the Cautionary Statement in Part 1, Item 1, Business and in Part 1, Item 1A, Risk Factors of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nOVERVIEW\nOur Business\nRedwood Trust, Inc., together with its subsidiaries, is a specialty finance company focused on making credit-sensitive investments in single-family residential and multifamily mortgages and related assets and engaging in mortgage banking activities. Our goal is to provide attractive returns to shareholders through a stable and growing stream of earnings and dividends, as well as through capital appreciation. We operate our business in four segments: Residential Lending, Business Purpose Lending, Multifamily Investments, and Third-Party Residential Investments. Our segments are based on our organizational and management structure, which aligns with how our results are monitored and performance is assessed.\nOur primary sources of income are net interest income from our investments and non-interest income from our mortgage banking activities. Net interest income consists of the interest income we earn on investments less the interest expense we incur on borrowed funds and other liabilities. Income from mortgage banking activities is generated through the acquisition and origination of loans and their subsequent sale, securitization, or transfer to our investment portfolios.\nRedwood Trust, Inc. has elected to be taxed as a real estate investment trust ( REIT\u201d). We generally refer, collectively, to Redwood Trust, Inc. and those of its subsidiaries that are not subject to subsidiary-level corporate income tax as the REIT\u201d or our REIT.\u201d We generally refer to subsidiaries of Redwood Trust, Inc. that are subject to subsidiary-level corporate income tax as our operating subsidiaries\u201d or our taxable REIT subsidiaries\u201d or TRS.\u201d\nFor additional information on our business, refer to Part I, Item 1, Business of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nBusiness Update\nRedwood ended 2019 on a strong note, with solid earnings and sustained momentum across our business lines. Our earnings were $0.38 per share for the fourth quarter and we ended the year with earnings of $1.46 per share. Our earnings for the full year were comprised of a healthy balance of investment returns and income from mortgage banking operations, and we made $1.09 billion of investments through a combination of organic and acquisition activity that we believe will help us deliver increased returns to our shareholders in the coming quarters and years.\nWe recently announced a 6.7% increase to our regular quarterly dividend to shareholders to $0.32 per share for the first quarter of 2020. Our ability to raise our dividend despite the market volatility we experienced over the past year is significant and we believe that it demonstrates the stability of our business model and the diversity of our revenues.\nDuring 2019, we made significant progress on our strategic priorities. Enabled in part by two acquisitions, it was a historic year for our business that set a new foundation for our participation in several distinct areas of housing credit, and allowed our consolidated portfolio of investments to evolve to incorporate a diverse mix of residential, business purpose, and multifamily investments. We now operate out of four principal geographic locations across the United States, and our earnings power is supported by organically created investments and the associated platforms that produce them. Our risk-minded culture and our values, which emphasize passion, integrity, change, relationships, and results, underlie our methodical pursuit to become one of the nation's most innovative investors in housing credit. We continue to look ahead and our strategic priorities for 2020 are focused on capitalizing on regulatory changes and technological innovations to continue to advance our overall relevance to the housing market.\nWe recently reorganized our business to create a more scalable infrastructure. We believe this will allow us to better manage the evolving opportunities and risks facing our business and to create better visibility into the earnings power of our operating platforms and the investments they create. We now manage our business through four segments. Our new structure provides for centralized strategic decision-making that drives the activities of these segments. In turn, our businesses can operate end-to-end in their respective sectors while benefiting from corporate risk oversight and traditional shared services. Each of our segments currently operates at a slightly different stage of maturity, creating a mix of earnings generation and future prospects.\nReflecting on the macro environment in 2019, it was an unexpected, record year for residential mortgage refinance activity. The Federal Reserve kept interest rates low after three interest rate cuts in 2019 amid global trade tensions and signs of economic weakness. Inflation, meanwhile, remained low and the U.S. consumer balance sheet remained strong, in part driven by an increased propensity to save that is, in turn, putting downward pressure on benchmark interest rates. As we proceed further into 2020, interest rates on 30-year conforming mortgages have fallen once again. This continues to bolster refinance activity, which has increased loan origination volumes year-to-date in 2020. Low rates have also contributed to increased borrower spending power, something that should in theory increase home purchase demand among the cohort of the population that is now entering their prime home buying years.\nHowever, buying power is less impactful when there is limited housing stock. While the interest rate environment has contributed to consistent home price appreciation over the last decade, it also conceals trends that continue to garner our close attention. Most notably, the supply of quality, affordable homes in the United States badly trails new household formation. While this imbalance has greatly supported rising home prices, it has made access to desirable housing more challenging for many - especially low to moderate income families, many of whom are would-be first-time home buyers. An expedient solution being discussed in Washington, D.C. is to relax underwriting standards and make it easier to offer loans with lower down payments to borrowers with higher debt-to-income ratios. While we support expanding homeownership opportunities for all Americans who desire to own their own homes, lowering underwriting standards had significant consequences leading up to the 2008 financial crisis and beyond. Additionally, these solutions ignore the fundamental problem - not enough homes.\nAt Redwood, our approach to residential mortgage loan underwriting remains unchanged. We emphasize safe, well-structured loans that borrowers can reliably afford. But more importantly, we are advocating for solutions in our business lines that offer more high quality and accessible housing for consumers. For instance, our business purpose lending initiatives focus not only on stabilized rentals, but also bridge lending - where homes are renovated, upgraded, and brought up to current building codes before getting resold or rented to consumers. We are actively expanding our bridge loan lending business to include more robust construction/redevelopment opportunities, including market-leading financing programs for build-to-rent communities, urban infill development, and modular home development, among others. These strategies all complement our residential lending business.\nAs we look ahead into 2020, we are closely watching the U.S. housing finance regulator (Federal Housing Finance Agency), where its new director is focused on exiting Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac out of conservatorship, reducing their size and impact across the housing sector, and creating a level playing field for private capital to participate in a larger part of the market. We see this regulatory shift as a major opportunity for our residential lending business, and the catalyst for us to invest in our platform to support higher levels of growth. We are now applying recent technological innovations to reimagine our non-agency loan production and distribution workstream. We plan to transform our correspondent loan acquisition platform to be more component-based, allowing us to implement new technologies as they become available rather than through comprehensive systems that remain the standard in the industry. We are also working to automate the revalidation of underwriting data to significantly reduce the time it takes us to purchase non-agency loans from originators, allowing them to recycle capital faster and make more loans. At the moment, technology to assist loan sellers in originating conventional loans that can be seamlessly sold exists only in the Agency origination space. Our goal is to make it a reality in the private sector.\nWe also see compelling opportunities in our business-purpose lending segment. The business purpose lending platforms we acquired last year originated a total of $2.4 billion of loans in 2019. We also have an active SFR securitization platform which should support our goal to grow profitably and organically generate assets with attractive risk adjusted returns. We have begun the process of combining the 5 Arches and CoreVest platforms under a unified leadership structure, taking the best features from both businesses to position this segment for profitable future growth. Once fully integrated, our platform will possess a wide breadth of financing products and depth of expertise to deliver all-inclusive and customized solutions to residential real estate investors. A unified platform will also allow us to apply our technology advantage to a full suite of products and in the process remove redundant external costs in the day-to-day operation of the business. Importantly, we are still just beginning to understand how business-purpose lending can leverage the broader Redwood platform. For example, we have begun the process of offering single-family rental loan products to our residential loan sellers, secured the ability to pledge single-family rental loans on our FHLB borrowing facility, and lowered our cost of funds through both warehouse financing and securitization.\nOur multifamily initiative continues to grow and expand and is quickly emerging as a strategic and complementary aspect of our housing finance strategy. We now designate multifamily investing as a core business at Redwood, with over $475 million of capital invested since 2017. We originate small-balance multifamily loans (both term and bridge) in our business-purpose lending segment - an area of desired growth - however, capital deployment in traditional multifamily has been almost exclusively in programs offered by Freddie Mac. To date, we remain one of the only investors in newly issued Freddie Mac multifamily B-pieces (first loss credit risk) that is not also a multifamily operator. Given recent changes implemented by the FHFA, we are now exploring ways to expand how we provide liquidity to this rapidly growing market.\nWhile we anticipate most of our investing activities to originate from within our residential, business-purpose, and multifamily segments, we continue to dedicate meaningful resources to other third-party investment activities. For over a quarter century, our role as an active investor and liquidity provider has been highly relevant to the mortgage capital markets. This effort will operate in coordination with our other businesses and focus on third-party opportunities that we find attractive, including non-agency RMBS, agency CRT bonds, securities backed by re-performing loans, and other investments. Importantly, this segment also allows us to continue tracking the pertinent markets and manage our capital both opportunistically and for liquidity management purposes.\nOver the past two years we believe we have made meaningful progress in diversifying revenues, integrating resources, and positioning Redwood for growth in the years ahead. Our business segments now encompass production and earnings generation potential across a breadth of sectors and collaborate toward a unifying vision of being one of the market's most innovative mortgage investors.\n2019 Financial Overview\nThis section includes an overview of our 2019 financial results. A detailed discussion of our results of operations is presented in the next section of this MD&A. The following table presents selected financial highlights from 2019 and 2018.\nTable 1 - Key Earnings and Return Metrics\nTable 94: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Years Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(In Thousands, except per Share Data)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>169,183\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>119,600\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Earnings per share (diluted EPS)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1.46\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1.34\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Return on equity (ROE)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10.6\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9.3\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Book value per share\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>15.98\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>15.89\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Economic return on book value (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8.1\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7.8\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>REIT taxable income per share\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1.28\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1.38\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Dividends per share\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1.20\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1.18\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 95: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(1)\n</td> <td>Economic return on book value is based on the periodic change in GAAP book value per common share plus dividends declared per common share during the period.\n</td> </tr>\n</table> Our 2019 results benefited from the continued expansion of our businesses across the broader housing market, including our acquisitions of 5 Arches and CoreVest in the business purpose residential lending space, and further capital deployment into multifamily investments. Through these acquisitions, we established our business purpose loan origination capabilities, which helped drive higher mortgage banking income in 2019, and also deployed a significant amount of capital into attractive business purpose lending (\"BPL\") investments, which helped drive higher investment returns. Our results also benefited from a recovery in asset prices in the first quarter of 2019, after a significant decrease in value during the fourth quarter of 2018, which negatively impacted our 2018 results. Investment fair values also benefited in 2019 from spread tightening across many investment types, which also created opportunities to sell lower-yielding assets and realize gains. After rotating a significant amount of capital out of lower yielding assets (through sales) and redeploying that capital into higher yielding investments in business purpose, multifamily and reperforming loan assets, we expect our net interest income to grow and the pace and overall amount of securities sales and resulting gains to decrease in 2020, given current market conditions. Although REIT taxable income per share decreased in 2019, we earned a growing amount of more stable net interest income from investments at our REIT, which is an important contributor to supporting our dividend.\nTable 2 - Key Operational Metrics\nTable 96: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Years Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(In Thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Capital Deployed\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,085,994\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>810,203\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Residential Loans Purchased\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>5,901,802\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>7,133,558\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Business Purpose Residential Loans Originated\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,015,157\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nDuring 2019, we raised $451 million of equity capital, and replaced $201 million of exchangeable debt that matured with new exchangeable debt maturing in six years. We used the proceeds from these issuances along with proceeds from portfolio optimization to increase our capital deployment to $1.09 billion in 2019, which included approximately $530 million deployed into our two acquisitions (including associated financial assets) and the remainder into investment assets. As in the prior year, we continued to deploy a meaningful amount of our capital into business purpose residential loans, multifamily investments, and re-performing loan investments, expanding further into these areas of housing.\nOur residential mortgage banking business saw loan purchases decrease in 2019, impacted primarily by increased competition. However, we operated this business with lower capital in 2019, helping to improve its return on equity. Additionally, we saw acquisition volumes begin to increase late in the year and we expect purchase volumes to increase in 2020 given the current interest rate environment. In 2019, through our Sequoia platform, we completed five Select securitizations and three Choice securitizations, which were supplemented by an increasing proportion of whole loans sales.\nOur business purpose mortgage banking business, which began in earnest early in 2019 through our acquisition of 5 Arches, steadily grew origination volume throughout the year and saw a significant boost in the fourth quarter when we acquired CoreVest. With the origination capabilities of the combined platforms, we believe origination volume from this business can increase in 2020 as compared to 2019.\nBook Value per Share\nThe following table sets forth the changes in our book value per share for the year ended December 31, 2019.\nTable 3 - Changes in Book Value per Share\nTable 97: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(In Dollars, per share basis)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>December 31, 2019\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Beginning book value per share\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>15.89\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net income (diluted EPS)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.46\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Changes in unrealized gains on securities, net from:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Realized gains recognized in net income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(0.15\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Amortization income recognized in net income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(0.06\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Mark-to-market adjustments, net\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.25\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total change in unrealized gains on securities, net\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.04\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Dividends\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1.20\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Issuance of common stock\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(0.06\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>CoreVest acquisition equity consideration\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(0.08\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Changes in unrealized losses on derivatives hedging long-term debt\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(0.17\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other, net (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.10\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Ending Book Value per Share\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>15.98\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 98: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(1)\n</td> <td>Primarily represents income earned on actual shares outstanding, as we include diluted earnings per common share as a line item within table.\n</td> </tr>\n</table> Our GAAP book value per share increased $0.09 per share to $15.98 per share during 2019. This increase was driven primarily by earnings exceeding our dividend payments.\nUnrealized gains on our available-for-sale securities increased $0.04 per share during 2019. This decrease primarily resulted from $0.15 per share of previously unrealized net gains that were realized as income from the sale of securities, as well as $0.06 per share of discount accretion income recognized in earnings from the appreciation in the amortized cost basis of our available-for-sale securities. These decreases were offset by positive mark-to-market adjustments on available-for-sale securities primarily resulting from overall credit spread tightening on these investments during 2019.\nLower benchmark interest rates during 2019 resulted in a $0.17 per share decrease to book value from unrealized losses on the derivatives hedging a portion of our long-term debt. At December 31, 2019, the cumulative unrealized loss on these derivatives, which is included in our GAAP book value per share, was $0.45 per share. During 2019, we issued common stock for net proceeds that on a per share basis were lower than our book value per share and were, therefore, slightly dilutive to book value. Additionally, included in the change in book value per share for 2019 was an $0.08 per share decrease from the issuance of restricted common stock related to our acquisition of CoreVest.\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nConsolidated Results of Operations\nWithin this Results of Operations section, we provide commentary that compares results year-over-year for 2019, 2018, and 2017. Most tables include \"changes\" columns that show the amounts by which the year's results are greater or less than the results from the prior year. Unless otherwise specified, references in this section to increases or decreases in 2019 refer to the change in results from 2018 to 2019, and increases or decreases in 2018 refer to the change in results from 2017 to 2018.\nThe following table presents the components of our net income for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018, and 2017.\nTable 4 - Net Income\nTable 99: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Years Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Changes\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(In Thousands, except per Share Data)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>'19/'18\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>'18/'17\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net Interest Income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>142,473\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>139,678\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>139,241\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,795\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>437\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Non-interest Income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Mortgage banking activities, net\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>87,266\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>59,566\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>53,908\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>27,700\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5,658\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Investment fair value changes, net\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>35,500\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(25,689\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10,374\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>61,189\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(36,063\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>19,257\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>13,070\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12,436\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6,187\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>634\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Realized gains, net\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>23,821\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>27,041\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>13,355\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(3,220\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>13,686\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total non-interest income, net\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>165,844\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>73,988\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>90,073\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>91,856\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(16,085\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>General and administrative expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(118,672\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(82,782\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(77,156\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(35,890\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(5,626\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(13,022\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(196\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(12,826\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(196\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net income before income taxes\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>176,623\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>130,688\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>152,158\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>45,935\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(21,470\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Provision for income taxes\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(7,440\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(11,088\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(11,752\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,648\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>664\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net Income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>169,183\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>119,600\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>140,406\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>49,583\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(20,806\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nNet Interest Income\nNet interest income increased in 2019, as higher net capital deployment towards multifamily, third party, and business purpose lending investments improved net interest income. This improvement was partially offset by a decrease in net interest income from residential loans held-for-sale at our residential lending segment, as the average balance of loans in inventory awaiting sale or securitization declined in 2019 as compared with 2018. Additionally, higher interest expense on long-term debt in 2019 from a higher average balance of convertible debt further offset the increase from net capital deployment.\nWe utilize hedges to manage interest rate risk in our investment portfolio and the net interest expense from these instruments is a component of our Investment fair value changes line item, which is discussed below. Net hedge interest expense associated with investment hedges increased in 2019 and on a combined basis, net interest income plus net interest expense on hedges increased by $5 million in 2019, compared to 2018.\nNet interest income in 2018 was consistent with 2017, as higher interest income from net capital deployment and higher average yields in 2018 was offset by higher interest expense on short-term floating rate debt facilities and FHLB borrowings from rising benchmark interest rates.\nAdditional detail on changes in net interest income is provided in the Net Interest Income\u201d section that follows.\nMortgage Banking Activities, Net\nIncome from mortgage banking activities, net includes results from both our residential and business purpose mortgage banking operations. The $28 million increase in 2019 was due to a $40 million increase from business purpose mortgage banking, partially offset by a $12 million decrease from residential mortgage banking. The increase from business purpose mortgage banking resulted from our acquisitions of 5 Arches and CoreVest in 2019 and the income generated from those operations. The decrease from residential mortgage banking was primarily due to lower gross margins on slightly higher loan purchase commitments in 2019, relative to 2018. The $6 million increase in 2018 was primarily due to an increase in residential loan purchase volume in 2018, relative to 2017, on similar gross margins.\nAdditional analysis of the changes in this line item is included in the Results of Operations by Segment\u201d section that follows.\nInvestment Fair Value Changes, Net\nInvestment fair value changes, net, is primarily comprised of the change in fair values of our investments accounted for under the fair value option and interest rate hedges associated with these investments.\nDuring 2019, the positive investment fair value changes primarily resulted from tightening credit spreads in several investment classes. During 2018, the negative investment fair value changes primarily resulted from widening credit spreads during the fourth quarter, which impacted both our residential securities and our residential loans held-for-investment.\nAdditional analysis of the changes in this line item is included in the Results of Operations by Segment\u201d section that follows.\nOther Income\nThe $6 million increase in Other income in 2019 primarily resulted from $4 million of business purpose loan administration fee income earned at 5 Arches, as well as a $2 million gain associated with the re-measurement of our initial minority investment and purchase option in 5 Arches upon its acquisition. This increase was partially offset by a decrease in income from our MSR investments as the notional balance of these investments continued to pay down. Details on the composition of Other income is included in Note 21 in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K\nRealized Gains, Net\nFor 2019, we realized gains of $24 million, primarily from the sale of $110 million of AFS securities and the call of a seasoned Sequoia securitization in the first quarter. For 2018, we realized gains of $27 million, primarily from the sale of $144 million of AFS securities. For 2017, we realized gains of $13 million, primarily from the sale of $90 million of AFS securities.\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses\nThe $36 million increase in general and administrative expenses in 2019 primarily resulted from $28 million of additional expenses from the operations of 5 Arches and CoreVest, which were acquired in March and October of 2019, respectively. The remainder of the increase was primarily due to $7 million in higher compensation expense at the Redwood parent entity (exclusive of 5 Arches and CoreVest), as well as higher systems, consulting, accounting, and legal costs, driven mostly by the acquisition-related expenses associated with 5 Arches and CoreVest. The higher compensation expense at the Redwood parent entity was primarily driven by higher variable compensation, commensurate with improved results in 2019, as well as a higher average employee count in 2019.\nThe increase in general and administrative expenses in 2018 primarily resulted from higher loan acquisition costs due to higher loan purchase volume in 2018, as well as higher expenses associated with implementing new investment initiatives, including higher personnel costs and legal fees. These increases were partially offset by lower variable compensation expense commensurate with a decline in net income in 2018.\nOther Expenses\nOther expenses in 2019 primarily consisted of amortization expense from intangible assets and contingent consideration we recorded in connection with acquisition activity during 2019.\nProvision for Income Taxes\nOur provision for income taxes is almost entirely related to activity at our taxable REIT subsidiaries, which primarily includes our mortgage banking activities, MSR investments, as well as certain other investment and hedging activities associated with these investments.\nThe decrease in the provision for income taxes for 2019 was driven primarily by lower GAAP income earned at our TRS. Additionally, the provision for 2019 included a $2 million tax benefit resulting from the purchase of 5 Arches.\nThe decrease in the provision for income taxes for 2018 resulted primarily from a lower corporate tax rate, and lower investment portfolio income at our TRS during the year. The increase in the provision for income taxes in 2017 resulted primarily from higher mortgage banking income in 2017, compared to 2016. This increase was offset by a tax benefit of $8 million from the reduction of our net federal deferred tax liabilities as a result of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (the \"Tax Act\") that was enacted in December 2017. For additional detail on income taxes, see the Tax Provision and Taxable Income\u201d section that follows.\nNet Interest Income\nThe following tables present the components of net interest income for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018, and 2017.\nTable 5 -

These increases were partially offset by a $2 million gain associated with the re-measurement of our initial minority investment and purchase option in 5 Arches. The increase in corporate general and administrative expenses in 2019 was primarily due to $7 million in higher compensation expense, driven mostly by higher variable compensation commensurate with improved results in 2019, as well as higher systems, consulting, accounting, and legal costs, driven mostly by the acquisitions of 5 Arches and CoreVest.\nThe $9 million improvement from Corporate/Other in 2018 primarily resulted from lower variable compensation expense commensurate with lower GAAP earnings, as well as higher earnings from our consolidated Legacy Sequoia entities in 2018. Details regarding consolidated Legacy Sequoia entities are included in the \"Results of Consolidated Legacy Sequoia Entities\" section that follows.\nResidential Lending Segment\nOur Residential Lending segment primarily consists of a mortgage loan conduit that acquires residential loans from third-party originators for subsequent sale, securitization, or transfer to our investment portfolio, as well as the investments we retain from these activities. We typically acquire prime, jumbo mortgages and the related mortgage servicing rights on a flow basis from our network of loan sellers and distribute those loans through our Sequoia private-label securitization program or to institutions that acquire pools of whole loans. Our investments in this segment primarily consist of residential mortgage-backed securities (\"RMBS\") retained from our Sequoia securitizations (some of which we consolidate for GAAP purposes), jumbo whole loans we retained and finance through our Federal Home Loan Bank of Chicago (\"FHLBC\") member subsidiary, as well as MSRs retained from jumbo whole loans we sold.\nThe following table presents the components of segment contribution for the Residential Lending segment for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018, and 2017.\nTable 9 -

Mortgage banking income decreased due to a lower average balance of loans carried during 2019, resulting in lower net interest income, as well as lower mortgage banking activities income resulting from lower profit margins due to increased competition. Although the overall income from these operations decreased, we ran these operations with less capital in 2019 than 2018, resulting in higher returns on allocated capital year-over-year. The decrease in income from investing activities was primarily due to a lower average balance of investments in this segment in 2019, as we shifted capital from this segment into other segments. For example, as jumbo residential loans that we had financed with FHLB debt paid off, we pledged single-family rental loans to collateralize an increasing portion of our FHLB debt. In addition, as mortgage rates decreased throughout much of the year, we experienced increased loan prepayment rates, which negatively impacted the fair value of our investments held at a premium (including our residential loans at Redwood and our interest only securities), which resulted in higher negative investment fair value changes in 2019.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2019, our residential mortgage loan conduit purchased $5.86 billion of predominately prime residential jumbo loans, securitized $1.92 billion of jumbo Select loans that were accounted for as sales, and sold $3.22 billion of jumbo loans to third parties. Additionally, we transferred $1.08 billion of jumbo Choice loans that did not qualify for sales accounting treatment under GAAP to Sequoia securitization entities and we had net transfers of $69 million of residential jumbo loans into our Residential Lending investment portfolio that were financed with borrowings from the FHLBC. Our pipeline of loans identified for purchase at December 31, 2019 included $1.83 billion of jumbo loans. At December 31, 2019, our residential mortgage loan conduit had 492 loan sellers, including 184 jumbo sellers and 308 sellers from various FHLB districts participating in the FHLB's MPF Direct program.\nWe utilize a combination of capital and our residential loan warehouse facilities to manage our inventory of residential loans held-for-sale. At December 31, 2019, we had $186 million of warehouse debt outstanding to fund our residential loans held-for-sale. Jumbo loan warehouse capacity at December 31, 2019 totaled $1.43 billion across four separate counterparties, which should continue to provide sufficient liquidity to fund our residential mortgage banking operations in the near-term.\nNet Interest Income\nNet interest income from our Residential Lending segment is primarily comprised of net interest income earned from our residential loans held for investment and financed with FHLB debt, net interest income from securities retained from our Sequoia securitizations, and net interest income from our inventory of residential loans held-for-sale prior to sale or securitization.\nNet interest income from residential lending investments decreased in 2019, due primarily to higher interest costs on our variable-rate long-term FHLB borrowings during 2019, from higher benchmark interest rates. Additionally, the average balance of our investment portfolio at this segment declined, as capital freed-up from sales and paydowns within this segment were redeployed in our business purpose lending and multifamily investments segments. Residential securities at Redwood decreased from the sale of lower-yielding Sequoia mezzanine securities, and residential securities at consolidated Sequoia Choice entities increased due to the retention of securities from Choice securitizations that were issued in 2019.\nThe $6 million decrease in 2018 in net interest income was primarily attributable to higher interest expense in 2018 related to our variable-rate borrowings on our residential lending investments, including from FHLB borrowings.\nWe use a combination of swaps and other derivatives to hedge our exposure to interest rates on our fixed-rate loan and securities investments and their associated variable-rate debt. The interest expense or benefit associated with these hedges is included in our Investment fair value changes, net line item on our financial statements. Including the impact of this hedge interest, our combined net interest income for residential lending investments was $60 million, $62 million, and $59 million in 2019, 2018, and 2017, respectively.\nMortgage Banking Activities, Net\nMortgage banking activities, net, includes the changes in market value of both the loans we hold for sale and commitments for loans we intend to purchase (collectively, our loan pipeline), as well as the effect of derivative instruments we utilize to manage risks associated with our loan pipeline. Our loan sale profit margins are measured over the period from when we commit to purchase a loan and subsequently sell or securitize the loan. Accordingly, these profit margins may encompass positive or negative market valuation adjustments on loans, hedging gains or losses associated with our loan pipeline, and any other related transaction expenses, and may be realized over the course of one or more quarters for financial reporting purposes.\nThe following table presents the components of residential mortgage banking activities, net. Amounts presented include both the changes in market values for loans that were sold and associated derivative positions that were settled during the periods presented, as well as changes in market values of loans and derivatives outstanding at the end of each period.\nTable 12 - Components of Residential Mortgage Banking Activities, Net\nTable 112: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Years Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Changes\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(In Thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>'19/'18\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>'18/'17\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Residential Mortgage Banking Activities, Net\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Changes in fair value of:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Residential loans, at fair value (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>63,527\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>21,808\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>69,373\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>41,719\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(47,565\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Risk management derivatives (2)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(17,519\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>35,248\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(17,529\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(52,767\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>52,777\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other income (3)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,735\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,567\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,064\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(832\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>503\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total residential mortgage banking activities, net\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>47,743\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>59,623\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>53,908\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(11,880\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>5,715\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 113: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(1)\n</td> <td>Includes changes in fair value for loan purchase and forward sale commitments.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 114: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(2)\n</td> <td>Represents market valuation changes of derivatives that are used to manage risks associated with our accumulation of residential loans.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 115: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(3)\n</td> <td>Amounts in this line include other fee income from loan acquisitions and the provision for repurchase expense, presented net.\n</td> </tr>\n</table> The decrease in residential mortgage banking activities, net in 2019 was primarily due to lower gross margins on somewhat higher loan purchase commitments in 2019, compared to 2018. Gross margins were towards the higher end of our long-term expectations in 2019, though below our 2018 gross margins, which benefited from significant spread tightening on AAA securities experienced early in 2018. The spread tightening benefited both loan production and the high balance of loans in inventory at the end of 2017, which were subsequently sold in early 2018. The increase in mortgage banking activities, net in 2018 was primarily due to higher loan purchase commitments on similar gross margins in 2018 compared to 2017. We define gross margins as net interest income plus income from mortgage banking activities, divided by loan purchase commitments (\"LPCs\"). LPCs, adjusted for fallout expectations, were $7.01 billion, $6.44 billion, and $5.89 billion for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018, and 2017, respectively.\nAt December 31, 2019, we had a repurchase reserve of $4 million outstanding related to residential loans sold through this segment. For the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, we recorded $0.3 million of repurchase provisions and $0.3 million of reversals of provision for repurchases, respectively, that were included in income from mortgage banking activities, net, in this segment.

This decline was partially offset by spread tightening on certain of our net investments in Sequoia Choice entities.\nFor 2018, the negative investment fair value changes primarily resulted from credit spread widening that occurred in the fourth quarter, impacting both our residential loans and residential trading securities.\nIncluded in the risk management derivatives component of investment fair value changes, net is net interest expense from derivative instruments used to hedge interest rate risk on our financed investments. Net hedge interest expense associated with investment hedges was income of $3 million in 2019, an expense of $0.5 million in 2018, and an expense of $12 million in 2017.\nOther Income\nOther income was primarily comprised of MSR income and income from our residential loan risk-sharing arrangements with Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. The $3 million decrease in Other income in 2019 was primarily due to a decrease in income from our MSR investments, as the notional balance of underlying loans continued to pay down.\nRealized Gains, Net\nRealized gains, net result from sales of available-for-sale securities within this segment. We generally sell securities when their yields fall below our return thresholds and we see opportunities to redeploy the capital into other investments with more attractive risk-adjusted returns. During the past three years, the majority of the securities we sold in this segment were mezzanine securities we retained from Sequoia Select securitizations that experienced significant credit spread tightening as the securitizations have paid-down and experienced minimal losses.\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses\nGeneral and administrative expenses for this segment primarily include costs associated with the underwriting, purchase and sale of residential loans, as well as costs associated with managing the segment's investment portfolio. General and administrative expenses decreased $1 million during 2019, primarily related to a decrease in loan acquisition costs associated with lower loan purchase volume in 2019 relative to 2018, as well as lower variable compensation expense commensurate with lower returns for this segment in 2019 relative to 2018. General and administrative expenses increased $4 million during 2018, primarily related to an increase in loan acquisition costs associated with the increase in loan purchase volume in 2018 relative to 2017, as well as higher compensation expense as we increased headcount in 2018 and paid higher variable compensation tied to higher earnings in 2018.\nProvision for Income Taxes\nThe provision for income taxes for this segment primarily result from its mortgage banking activities, which are performed at our taxable REIT subsidiary, and is generally correlated to the amount of this segment's contribution before income taxes in relation to the TRS's overall GAAP income and associated tax provision. For 2019, the decrease in the tax provision primarily resulted from decreased TRS GAAP earnings at this segment and, in 2018, the increase primarily resulted from increased TRS GAAP earnings at this segment. For additional detail on income taxes, see the \"Tax Provision and Taxable Income\" section that follows.\nBusiness Purpose Lending Segment\nOur Business Purpose Lending segment consists of a platform that originates and acquires business purpose residential loans for subsequent securitization or transfer into our investment portfolio, as well as the investments we retain from these activities. We typically originate single-family rental and residential bridge loans and distribute certain single-family loans through our CoreVest American Finance Lender (\"CAFL\") private-label securitization program and retain others for investment along with our residential bridge loans. Single-family rental loans are business purpose residential mortgage loans to investors in single-family (1-4 unit) rental properties. Residential bridge loans are business purpose residential mortgage loans to investors rehabilitating and reselling or renting residential properties. Our investments in this segment primarily consist of securities retained from CAFL securitizations (which we consolidate for GAAP purposes), residential bridge loans, and single-family rental loans we finance through our FHLBC member subsidiary.\nThe following table presents the components of segment contribution for the Business Purpose Lending segment for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018, and 2017.\nTable 14 -

Through our acquisition of 5 Arches in March of 2019, we began originating business purpose loans, of which the SFR loans were generally initially held in inventory for future securitization and the bridge loans were generally transferred into our BPL investment portfolio. Later in 2019, we transferred nearly all of the 5 Arches originated SFR loans into our BPL investment portfolio, where they were financed through our FHLB member subsidiary. In October of 2019, we acquired CoreVest and obtained its inventory of single-family rental loans held-for-sale, along with an investment portfolio comprised of bridge loans and retained securities from CAFL securitizations it had previously issued. In November 2019, we issued our first securitization under the CAFL program and retained certain subordinate securities (for GAAP purposes, CAFL securitizations are not treated as sales and we consolidate all CAFL securitization entities onto our balance sheet). In the future, we expect to securitize a portion of our SFR loan originations and transfer a portion into our BPL investment portfolio. In the near-term, we generally expect to transfer the majority of newly originated bridge loans into our BPL investment portfolio.\nResults from this segment in 2019 were driven by our BPL mortgage banking operations as well as from our BPL investment portfolio, which both increased meaningfully relative to 2018, due to the acquisitions of 5 Arches and CoreVest. Mortgage banking results for this segment also benefited from spread tightening in the fourth quarter of 2019, as we experienced strong execution on the first securitization we issued under the CAFL program.\nDuring the first two months of 2019, prior to our acquisition of 5 Arches on March 1, 2019, we purchased $19 million of single-family rental loans from 5 Arches. During the period from March 1, 2019 to December 31, 2019, we funded $514 million of single-family rental loans, of which $238 million were transferred to our investment portfolio and financed with FHLB borrowings, and the remaining loans were held-for-sale. During the period from March 1, 2019 to December 31, 2019, we funded $501 million of residential bridge loans, of which $56 million were sold to a third party and the remaining loans were transferred to our BPL investment portfolio.\nWe utilize a combination of capital and our business purpose loan warehouse facilities to manage our inventory of business purpose residential loans held-for-sale and our business purpose loan investments. Our business purpose residential loan warehouse capacity totaled $1.48 billion across six separate counterparties. In addition, at December 31, 2019, we finance a portion of the CAFL securities we own through a securities repurchase facility.\nNet Interest Income\nNet interest income from our Business Purpose Lending segment is primarily comprised of net interest income earned from our BPL investments, and to a lesser extent from our inventory of SFR loans held-for-sale from the time we originate or acquire the loans to when securitize them or transfer them to our investment portfolio.\nThe $16 million increase in net interest income in 2019 was primarily due to a higher average balance of BPL investments during 2019 relative to 2018, as we retained SFR and residential bridge loans from 5 Arches and CoreVest production during 2019 and also acquired the in-place portfolio of residential bridge loans and retained SFR securities from CoreVest during the fourth quarter of 2019. The increase was also driven by a higher average balance of loans held-for-sale during 2019 relative to 2018.\nMortgage Banking Activities, Net\nMortgage banking activities, net, includes loan origination fees and the changes in market value of both the loans we hold for sale and our interest rate lock commitments (collectively, our loan pipeline), as well as the derivative instruments we utilize to manage risks associated with our loan pipeline, from the time we lock a loan with a borrower to when we subsequently securitize the loan or transfer it to our BPL investment portfolio. Accordingly, these profit margins may encompass positive or negative market valuation adjustments on loans, hedging gains or losses associated with our loan pipeline, and any other related transaction expenses, and may be realized over the course of one or more quarters for financial reporting purposes.\nThe following table presents the components of business purpose mortgage banking activities, net.

Business purpose mortgage banking activities for 2019 included $30 million earned in the fourth quarter, driven both by new origination activity from CoreVest, increased origination activity from 5 Arches, as well as a benefit from spread-tightening on securitization execution for the SFR loans we acquired from CoreVest. We generally would not expect the same spread-tightening in subsequent quarters, dependent on market conditions.\nInvestment Fair Value Changes, Net\nThe following table presents the components of investment fair value changes for our Business Purpose Lending segment by investment type for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018, and 2017.\nTable 18 - Investment Fair Value Changes, Net from Business Purpose Lending\nTable 130: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Years Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(In Thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Investment Fair Value Changes, Net\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Single-family rental loans held-for-investment\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>272\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Residential bridge loans held-for-investment\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(2,139\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(29\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>REO\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1,045\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net investments in CAFL entities (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(3,636\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(174\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Investment Fair Value Changes, Net\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(6,722\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(29\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 131: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(1)\n</td> <td>Includes changes in fair value of the loans held-for-investment and the ABS issued at the entities, which netted together represent the change in value of our economic investments (senior and subordinate securities) in securities at the consolidated VIEs.\n</td> </tr>\n</table> Residential bridge loans are carried at fair value and generally transferred to our REIT at a premium, which diminishes as the loans mature and ultimately repay, resulting in negative fair value changes over the life of the loans. The change in fair value for our net investments in CAFL entities represents the change in fair value of the underlying securities we own in these consolidated entities and was negative in 2019, primarily due to the receipt of expected cash flows on IO securities we own. During 2019, we recorded $1 million of negative fair value changes related to residential business purpose loans we foreclosed on and carried as REO.\nOther Income\nOther income at this segment is primarily comprised of fee income earned from the administration of loans for a third-party legacy fund, which is winding down.\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses\nGeneral and administrative expenses for this segment include costs associated with the origination, purchase and securitization of business purpose residential loans, as well as the management of our BPL investment portfolio. General and administrative expenses increased during 2019 due to the acquisitions of 5 Arches and CoreVest. We expect these expenses to increase in 2020 as we incur a full year of expenses for these operations.\nOther Expenses\nOther expenses for this segment includes amortization expense from intangible assets we recorded in connection with the acquisitions of 5 Arches and CoreVest for the periods we owned each company during 2019.\nProvision for Income Taxes\nThe provision for income taxes for this segment primarily result from its mortgage banking activities, which are performed at our taxable REIT subsidiary, and is generally correlated to the amount of this segment's contribution before income taxes in relation to the TRS's overall GAAP income and associated tax provision. For 2019, the increase in the tax provision primarily resulted from increased TRS GAAP earnings at this segment. For additional detail on income taxes, see the \"Tax Provision and Taxable Income\" section that follows.\nMultifamily Investments Segment\nOur Multifamily Investments segment consists of investments in securities collateralized by multifamily mortgage loans, as well as other investments in multifamily mortgages and related assets. The securities in this segment are primarily comprised of investments in Freddie Mac K-Series securitizations.\nThe following table presents the components of segment contribution for the Multifamily Investments segment for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018, and 2017.\nTable 19 - Multifamily Investments Segment Contribution\nTable 132: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Years Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Changes\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(In Thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>'19/'18\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>'18/'17\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net interest income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>9,712\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>5,726\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,063\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,986\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,663\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Non-interest income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Investment fair value changes, net\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>27,097\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,979\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>16,196\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>23,118\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(12,217\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,484\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,484\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Realized gains, net\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>134\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>134\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total non-interest income, net\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>28,715\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,979\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>16,196\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>24,736\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(12,217\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>General and administrative expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1,498\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(869\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(425\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(629\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(444\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Segment contribution before income taxes\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>36,929\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8,836\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>18,834\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>28,093\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(9,998\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Provision for income taxes\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(11\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(16\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(238\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>222\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total Segment Contribution\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>36,918\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>8,820\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>18,596\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>28,098\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(9,776\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe following table presents details of the investments in our Multifamily Investments segment at December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018.\nTable 20 - Multifamily Investments Table 133: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(In Thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>December 31, 2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>December 31, 2018\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Multifamily securities at Redwood\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>404,128\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>429,079\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Multifamily securities at consolidated Freddie Mac K-Series entities (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>252,285\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>125,523\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other investments\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>61,018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>15,092\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total Segment Investments\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>717,431\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>569,694\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 134: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(1)\n</td> <td>Represents our economic investment in securities issued by consolidated Freddie Mac K-Series securitization entities.

Due to certain rights given to the subordinate securities, we consolidate these securitizations for GAAP purposes and we consolidated three such securitizations in 2018 and two in 2019 as result of securities we purchased in those years. We also invest in mezzanine securities issued by Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae, which represent securities subordinate to senior securities, but senior to the most subordinate bonds in a securitization. While we continued to invest in new mezzanine multifamily securities during 2019, on a net basis we reduced our investment in these assets, as we sold several seasoned securities that had appreciated in price (contributing to higher investment fair value changes in 2019) and had lower current returns. We account for most of the securities in this segment under the fair value option and gains are reflected in investment fair value changes rather than realized gains.\nIn addition to our multifamily securities investments, our other investments are primarily comprised of an investment in a limited partnership created to acquire multifamily loans from Freddie Mac, and investments in multifamily excess MSRs.\nNet Interest Income\nThe increases in 2019 and 2018 in net interest income from multifamily investments were primarily driven by a higher average balance of investments in each sequential year, as we increased our investments in Freddie Mac K-Series subordinate securities in both years.\nInvestment Fair Value Changes, Net\nThe following table presents the components of investment fair value changes for our Multifamily segment by investment type for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018, and 2017.\nTable 21 - Investment Fair Value Changes, Net from Multifamily Investments\nTable 135: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Years Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(In Thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Investment Fair Value Changes, Net\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Changes in fair value of:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Trading securities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>33,233\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,825\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>15,798\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Excess MSRs\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(3,570\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(313\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net investments in Freddie Mac K-Series entities (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>21,430\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>931\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Risk management derivatives, net\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(23,996\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(464\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>98\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Valuation adjustments on commercial loans held-for-sale\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>300\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Investment Fair Value Changes, Net\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>27,097\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,979\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>16,196\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 136: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(1)\n</td> <td>Includes changes in fair value of the loans held-for-investment and the ABS issued at the entities, which netted together represent the change in value of our investments (subordinate securities) at the consolidated VIEs.\n</td> </tr>\n</table> The net positive investment fair value changes for 2019 were primarily driven by tightening credit spreads in our mezzanine securities as well as the subordinate securities we own in the consolidated Freddie Mac K-Series entities. The mezzanine trading securities saw price appreciation from both tightening credit spreads and lower benchmark interest rates in 2019. Nearly all of our risk management derivatives at this segment are used to manage interest rate risk on our mezzanine securities, and in 2019 they decreased in value as a result of declining benchmark interest rates. Our excess MSRs saw negative fair value changes in 2019 primarily related to the receipt of expected cash flows.\nOther Income\nOther income in this segment includes income from our investment in a multifamily loan fund, which we entered into in January 2019.\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses\nGeneral and administrative expenses increased over the last two years as we hired additional personnel to manage our growing investment portfolio.\nProvision for Income Taxes\nThe provision for income taxes is generally correlated to the amount of this segment's contribution before income taxes in relation to the TRS's overall GAAP income and associated tax provision. For 2019, the TRS GAAP income earned at this segment was consistent with the prior year.\nThird-Party Residential Investments Segment\nOur Third-Party Residential Investments segment consists of investments in RMBS issued by third parties, investments in Freddie Mac SLST securitizations (which we consolidate for GAAP purposes), our servicer advance investments, and other residential credit investments not generated through our Residential Lending segment.\nThe following table presents the components of segment contribution for the Third-Party Residential Investments segment for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018, and 2017.\nTable 22 -

This increase was partially offset by lower net interest income in 2019 resulting from lower discount accretion on available-for-sale securities, and lower realized gains as we sold fewer AFS securities in 2019.\nNet Interest Income\nNet interest income from our third-party residential investments decreased $7 million in 2019, primarily due to lower discount accretion from legacy available-for-sale securities, resulting from lower average balances of these investments during 2019. This decline was partially offset by an increase in net interest income from additional investments made in Freddie Mac SLST securities during 2019. Our net investments in these entities (i.e., the securities issued by these entities that we own) are accounted for under the fair value method and a portion of their economic return (related to the discount we purchased these securities at that we expect to receive in the future) is recognized through investment fair value changes.\nInvestment Fair Value Changes, Net\nThe following table presents the components of investment fair value changes for our Third-Party Residential Investments segment by investment type for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018, and 2017.\nTable 24 - Investment Fair Value Changes, Net from Third-Party Residential Investments\nTable 140: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Years Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(In Thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Investment Fair Value Changes, Net\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Changes in fair value of:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Trading securities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>37,488\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(8,599\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>29,328\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Servicer advance investments\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,001\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(701\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Excess MSRs\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>310\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,136\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Shared home appreciation options\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>842\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net investment in Freddie Mac SLST entities (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>27,206\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,271\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Risk management derivatives, net\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(24,185\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(975\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(633\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Impairments on AFS securities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(89\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1,011\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Investment Fair Value Changes, Net\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>44,662\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(6,957\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>27,684\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 141: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(1)\n</td> <td>Includes changes in fair value of the loans held-for-investment and the ABS issued at the entities, which netted together represent the change in value of our investments (subordinate securities) at the consolidated VIEs.\n</td> </tr>\n</table> The net positive investment fair value changes for 2019 were primarily driven by tightening credit spreads in our trading securities as well as the subordinate securities we own in the consolidated Freddie Mac SLST entities. The trading securities saw price appreciation from both tightening credit spreads and lower benchmark interest rates in 2019. Nearly all of our risk management derivatives at this segment are used to manage interest rate risk on our trading securities, and in 2019 they decreased in value as a result of declining benchmark interest rates.\nThe net negative investment fair value changes for 2018 were primarily driven by widening credit spreads in the fourth quarter of 2018.\nRealized Gains, Net\nRealized gains in this segment resulted from the sale of third-party AFS securities. Our portfolio of third-party AFS securities has decreased due to these sales and most of the new securities we purchase are accounted for under the fair value option. As such, we expect fewer realized gains from this portfolio in the future.\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses\nGeneral and administrative expenses in this segment are mostly comprised of personnel costs to manage this portfolio and have remained relatively consistent over the past two years.\nOther Expenses\nOther expenses in 2019 consisted of $1 million of income allocable to co-investors in our servicing advance investments.\nProvision for Income Taxes\nThe provision for income taxes is generally correlated to the amount of this segment's contribution before income taxes in relation to the TRS's overall GAAP income and associated tax provision. For 2019, while the TRS GAAP income earned at this segment increased from the prior year, the decrease in the tax provision primarily resulted from the decrease in our overall tax provision.\nInvestments\nThis section presents additional details on our investment assets and their activity during 2019 and 2018.\nResidential Loans Held-for-Investment at Redwood Portfolio\nThe following table provides the activity of residential loans held-for-investment at Redwood during the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018.\nTable 25 - Residential Loans Held-for-Investment at Redwood - Activity\nTable 142: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Years Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(In Thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Fair value at beginning of period\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,383,932\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,434,386\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Acquisitions\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>39,269\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Sales\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(9,421\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Transfers between portfolios (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>69,431\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>269,883\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Principal repayments\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(430,205\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(290,327\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Changes in fair value, net\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>58,891\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(30,010\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Fair Value at End of Period\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,111,897\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,383,932\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 143: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(1)\n</td> <td>Represents the net transfers of loans into our Investment Portfolio segment from our Mortgage Banking segment and their reclassification from held-for-sale to held-for-investment.\n</td> </tr>\n</table> The following table presents the unpaid principal balances and weighted average coupons for residential real estate loans held-for-investment at fair value by product type at December 31, 2019.\nTable 26 - Characteristics of Residential Real Estate Loans Held-for-Investment at Redwood\nTable 144: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>December 31, 2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(Dollars in Thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Principal Balance\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Weighted Average Coupon\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Fixed - 30 year\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,770,855\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.16\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Fixed - 15, 20, & 25 year\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>54,524\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.71\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Hybrid\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>227,399\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.16\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total Outstanding Principal\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,052,778\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe outstanding residential loans held-for-investment at Redwood at December 31, 2019 were prime-quality, first-lien loans, of which 96% were originated between 2013 and 2019 and 4% were originated in 2012 and prior years. The weighted average FICO score of borrowers backing these loans was 768 (at origination) and the weighted average loan-to-value (\"LTV\") ratio was 66% (at origination). At December 31, 2019, two of these loans with an aggregate fair value of $1 million and an unpaid principal balance of $2 million were greater than 90 days delinquent and none of these loans were in foreclosure.\nAt December 31, 2019, $2.10 billion of residential loans were held by our FHLB-member subsidiary and financed with $1.78 billion of borrowings from the FHLBC. At December 31, 2019, the weighted average maturity of these FHLB borrowings was approximately six years and they had a weighted average cost of 1.88% per annum. While the interest costs on these borrowings is variable and resets every 13 weeks, we utilize various interest rate derivative instruments to hedge our interest rate risk in this portfolio.\nUnder a final rule published by the Federal Housing Finance Agency in January 2016, our FHLB-member subsidiary will remain an FHLB-member through the five-year transition period for captive insurance companies. Our FHLB-member subsidiary's existing $2.00 billion of FHLB debt, which matures beyond this transition period, is permitted to remain outstanding until its stated maturity. As residential loans pledged as collateral for this debt pay down, we are permitted to pledge additional loans or other eligible assets to collateralize this debt; however, we do not expect to be able to increase our subsidiary's FHLB debt above the existing $2.00 billion.\nBusiness Purpose Residential Loans Portfolio\nSingle-Family Rental Loans Held-for-Investment at Redwood\nThe following table provides the activity of single-family rental loans held-for-investment at Redwood during the year ended December 31, 2019.\nTable 27 -Single-Family Rental Loans Held-for-Investment at Redwood - Activity\nTable 145: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(In Thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>December 31, 2019\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Fair value at beginning of period\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Transfers between portfolios\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>238,144\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Principal repayments\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(796\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Changes in fair value, net\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>272\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Fair Value at End of Period\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>237,620\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe outstanding single-family rental loans held-for-investment at Redwood at December 31, 2019 were first-lien, fixed-rate loans with original maturities of five, seven, or ten years.

At December 31, 2019, the weighted average coupon of our single-family rental loans was 5.70% and the weighted average remaining loan term was seven years. At origination, the weighted average LTV ratio of these loans was 68% and the weighted average debt service coverage ratio was 1.35 times. At December 31, 2019, 18 of these loans with an aggregate unpaid principal balance of $29 million were greater than 90 days delinquent and five of these loans with an aggregate unpaid principal balance of $9 million were in foreclosure.\nTax Provision and Taxable Income\nTax Provision under GAAP\nFor the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018, and 2017, we recorded tax provisions of $7 million, $11 million, and $12 million, respectively. Our tax provision is primarily derived from GAAP net income or loss at our TRS, as we do not book a material tax provision associated with income generated at our REIT. Our TRS income is generally earned from our mortgage banking activities, MSRs, and other non-REIT eligible security investments.\nTaxable Income\nThe following table summarizes our taxable income and distributions to shareholders for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018, and 2017.

In order to utilize these carryforwards, taxable income must exceed our dividend distributions. During 2019, we distributed $126 million to shareholders, which was less than our estimated taxable income of $136 million. We therefore expect to report REIT taxable income on our 2019 federal income tax return after the application of a dividends paid deduction. As a result, we expect $10 million of our federal NOLs at the REIT level to be utilized in 2019. Federal NOLs at the REIT level do not expire until 2029.\nThe Tax Act created a limitation on the annual usage of REIT NOLs to 80% of REIT taxable income, effective with respect to NOLs arising in taxable years beginning after December 31, 2017. We do not expect this to materially impact our REIT.\nOur TRS NOL carryforwards were acquired in the 5 Arches acquisition. They were generated after December 31, 2017 and therefore carry forward indefinitely. These NOLs are subject to the Separate Return Limitation Year (\"SRLY\") rules, which can limit the usage of the NOLs. However, we do not expect this to prevent us from utilizing these NOLs over time.\nTax Characteristics of Distributions to Shareholders\nFor the year ended December 31, 2019, we declared and distributed four regular quarterly dividends totaling $126 million ($1.20 per share). Under the federal income tax rules applicable to REITs, the taxable portion of any distribution to shareholders is determined by (i) taxable income of the REIT, exclusive of the dividends paid deduction and NOLs; and (ii) net capital gains recognized by the REIT, exclusive of capital loss carryforwards. The income or loss generated at our TRS does not directly affect the tax characterization of our dividends.\nOur 2019 dividend distributions are expected to be characterized for federal income tax purposes as 73% ordinary dividend income and 27% long-term capital gain dividend income. Under the federal income tax rules applicable to REITs, none of the 2019 dividend distributions are expected to be characterized as a return of capital or qualified dividends.\nBeginning in 2018, the Tax Act provides that individual taxpayers may generally deduct 20% of their ordinary REIT dividends from taxable income. This results in a maximum federal effective tax rate of 29.6% on an individual taxpayer's ordinary REIT dividends, compared to the highest marginal rate of 37%. This deduction does not apply to REIT dividends classified as qualified dividends or long-term capital gains dividends, as those dividends are taxed at a maximum rate of 20% for individuals.\nDifferences between Estimated Total Taxable Income and GAAP Income\nDifferences between estimated taxable income and GAAP income are largely due to the following: (i) we cannot establish loss reserves for future anticipated events for tax but we can for GAAP, as realized credit losses are expensed when incurred for tax and these losses can be anticipated through lower yields on assets or through loss provisions for GAAP; (ii) the timing, and possibly the amount, of some expenses (e.g., certain compensation expenses) are different for tax than for GAAP; (iii) since amortization and impairments differ for tax and GAAP, the tax and GAAP gains and losses on sales may differ, resulting in differences in realized gains on sale; (iv) at the REIT and certain TRS entities, unrealized gains and losses on market valuation adjustments of loans, securities and derivatives are not recognized for tax until the instrument is sold or extinguished; (v) for tax, basis may not be assigned to mortgage servicing rights retained when whole loans are sold resulting in lower tax gain on sale; (vi) for tax, we do not consolidate securitization entities as we do under GAAP; and, (vii) dividend distributions to our REIT from our TRS are included in REIT taxable income, but not GAAP income. As a result of these differences in accounting, our estimated taxable income can vary significantly from our GAAP income during certain reporting periods.\nFor tax years beginning after December 31, 2018, the Tax Act may require acceleration of discount accretion for federal income tax purposes for debt instruments with original issue discount. We have evaluated the effects of this change, and it did not have a material income tax effect for us.\nThe tax basis in assets and liabilities at the REIT was $6.35 billion and $4.68 billion, respectively, at December 31, 2019. The GAAP basis in assets and liabilities at the REIT was $16.22 billion and $14.52 billion, respectively, at December 31, 2019. The primary difference in both the tax and GAAP assets and liabilities is attributable to securitization entities that are consolidated for GAAP reporting purposes but not for tax purposes.\nThe tables below reconcile our estimated total taxable income to our GAAP income for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018, and 2017.\nTable 53 - Differences between Estimated Total Taxable Income and

primarily comprised of dividend income from our TRS.\n</td> </tr>\n</table> Potential Taxable Income Volatility\nWe expect period-to-period volatility in our estimated taxable income. A description of the factors that can cause this volatility is provided below.\nRecognition of Gains and Losses on Sale\nSince the computation of amortization and impairments on assets may differ for tax and GAAP and many of our assets held for investment purposes are marked-to-market for GAAP, but not for tax, the tax and GAAP basis on assets sold or called may differ, resulting in differences in gains and losses on sale or call. In addition, capital losses in excess of capital gains are generally disallowed and carry forward to future tax years. Subsequent capital gains realized for tax may be offset by prior capital losses and, thus, not affect taxable income. At December 31, 2019, we had no capital loss carryforwards at the REIT or TRS level.\nPrepayments on Securities\nWe have retained certain IO securities since the time they were issued from Sequoia securitizations we sponsored and purchased additional third-party IO securities. Our tax basis in these securities was $159 million at December 31, 2019. The return on IOs is sensitive to prepayments and, to the extent prepayments vary period to period, income from these IOs will vary. Typically, fast prepayments reduce yields and slow prepayments increase yields. We are not permitted to recognize a negative yield under tax accounting rules, so during periods of fast prepayments our periodic premium expense for tax purposes can be relatively low and the tax cost basis for these securities may not be significantly reduced. Currently, our tax basis is above the fair values for these IOs in the aggregate. If a securitization is called, the remaining tax basis in the IO is expensed, creating an ordinary loss at the call date.\nPrepayments also affect the taxable income recognition on other securities we own. For tax purposes, we are required to use particular prepayment assumptions for the remaining lives of each security. As actual prepayment speeds vary, the yield we recognize for tax purposes will be adjusted accordingly. Thus, to the extent actual prepayments differ from our long-term assumptions or vary from period to period, the yield recognized will also vary and this difference could be material.\nCredit Losses on Securities and Loans\nTo determine estimated taxable income, we are generally not permitted to anticipate, or reserve for, credit losses on investments which are generally purchased at a discount. For tax purposes, we accrue the entire purchase discount on a security into taxable income over the expected life of the security. Estimated taxable income is reduced when actual credit losses occur. As we have no credit reserves or allowances for tax, any future credit losses on securities or loans will have a more significant impact on tax earnings than on GAAP earnings and may create significant taxable income volatility to the extent the level of credit losses fluctuates during reporting periods. Credit losses are based on our tax basis, which differs from our basis for GAAP purposes. We anticipate an additional $14 million of credit losses for tax on securities, based on our projection of principal balance losses and assuming a similar tax basis as we have recently experienced, although the timing of actual losses is difficult to accurately project.\nOur estimated total taxable income for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018, and 2017 included $1 million, $2 million, and $3 million, respectively, in realized credit losses on investments.\nCompensation Expense\nThe total tax expense for equity award compensation is dependent upon varying factors such as the timing of payments of dividend equivalent rights, the distribution of deferred stock units and performance stock units, and the cash deferrals to and withdrawals from our Executive Deferred Compensation Plan. For GAAP purposes, the total expense associated with an equity award is determined at the award date and is recognized over the vesting period. For tax, the total expense is recognized at the date of distribution or exercise, not the award date. In addition, some compensation may not be deductible for tax if it exceeds certain levels. An exception may apply to performance-based compensation that is paid pursuant to a written and binding contract in effect before November 2, 2017. Thus, the total amount of compensation expense, as well as the timing, could be significantly different for tax than for GAAP.\nAs an example, for GAAP we expense the grant date fair value of performance stock units (PSUs) granted over the vesting term of those PSUs (regardless of the degree to which the performance conditions for vesting are ultimately satisfied, if at all), whereas for tax the value of the PSUs that actually vest in accordance with the performance conditions of those awards and are subsequently distributed to the award recipient is recorded as an expense on the date of distribution. For example, if no PSUs under a particular grant ultimately vest, due to the failure to satisfy the performance conditions, no tax expense will be recorded for those PSUs, even though we would have already recorded expense for GAAP equal to the grant date fair value of the PSU awards. Conversely, for example, if performance is such that a number of shares of common stock equal to 200% of the PSU award ultimately vest and are delivered to the award recipient, expense for tax will equal the common stock value on the date of distribution of 200% of the number of PSUs originally granted. This expense for tax could significantly exceed the recorded expense for GAAP.\nIn addition, since the timing of distributions of deferred stock units, performance stock units, or cash out of the Executive Deferred Compensation Plan is based on employees' deferral elections, it can be difficult to project when the tax expense will occur.\nMortgage Servicing Rights\nFor GAAP purposes, we recognize MSRs through the direct acquisition of servicing rights from third parties or through the retention of MSRs associated with residential loans that we have acquired and subsequently sold to non-consolidated securitization entities or to third parties. For tax purposes, basis in our MSR assets is recognized through the direct acquisition of servicing rights from third parties, or to the extent that a retained MSR entitles us to receive a servicing fee in excess of so-called normal servicing (or the right to receive reasonable compensation for services to be performed under the mortgage serving contract). Tax basis in our normal MSR assets is not recognized when MSRs are retained from sales of loans to non-consolidated securitization entities or to third parties, thereby creating a favorable temporary GAAP to tax difference from sale of the loans. For the year ended December 31, 2019, we retained $1 million of MSRs from jumbo loan sales for which no tax basis was recognized. No other material tax basis in our MSR assets was recognized in 2019.\nFor GAAP purposes, mortgage servicing fee income, net of servicing expense, as well as changes in the estimated fair value of our MSRs, is recognized on our consolidated statements of income over the life of the MSR asset. For tax purposes, only mortgage servicing fee income, net of servicing expense is recognized as taxable income. Any MSR where basis is recognized for tax purposes through acquisition is amortized as a tax expense over a finite life.\nPeriodic changes in the market values of MSRs are recorded through the income statement for GAAP purposes, but not for tax purposes. Only when MSRs are sold will a tax gain or loss be recognized. As tax basis is not recognized for retained MSRs and the rules for writing-off tax basis of purchased MSRs are restrictive, the tax gain from the sale of MSRs can be substantial.\nLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\nSummary\nIn addition to the proceeds from equity and debt capital-raising transactions, our principal sources of cash consist of borrowings under mortgage loan warehouse facilities, securities repurchase agreements, payments of principal and interest we receive from our investment portfolios, and cash generated from our operating activities. Our most significant uses of cash are to purchase and originate mortgage loans for our mortgage banking operations, to fund investments in residential loans, to purchase investment securities and make other investments, to repay principal and interest on our warehouse facilities, repurchase agreements, and long-term debt, to make dividend payments on our capital stock, and to fund our operations.\nAt December 31, 2019, our total capital was $2.60 billion and included $1.83 billion of equity capital and $0.79 billion of convertible notes and long-term debt on our consolidated balance sheet, including $245 million of convertible debt due in 2023, $200 million of convertible debt due in 2024, $201 million of exchangeable debt due in 2025, and $140 million of trust-preferred securities due in 2037.\nAs of December 31, 2019, our cash and liquidity capital included $260 million of capital available for investment. While we believe our available capital, together with additional liquidity we believe we can source through continued portfolio optimization (including collateralized borrowings or assets sales), is sufficient to fund our operations and currently contemplated investment activities and to repay existing debt, we may raise equity or debt capital from time to time to acquire assets and make long-term investments to expand our investment portfolio, including funding large purchases of portfolios of residential, multifamily, or business purpose residential loans or securities, or other portfolio investments, for acquisitions (which could include acquisitions to expand our mortgage banking operating platforms), or for other purposes. To the extent we seek to raise additional capital, our approach will continue to be based on what we believe to be in the best interests of our shareholders.\nWe are subject to risks relating to our liquidity and capital resources, including risks relating to incurring debt under residential loan warehouse facilities, securities repurchase facilities, and other short- and long-term debt facilities and other risks relating to our use of derivatives. A further discussion of these risks is set forth below under the heading Risks Relating to Debt Incurred under Short- and Long-Term Borrowing Facilities\" and in Part I, Item 1A - Risk Factors of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nCash Flows and Liquidity for the Year Ended December 31, 2019\nCash flows from our mortgage banking activities and our investments can be volatile from quarter to quarter depending on many factors, including the timing and amount of loan and securities acquisitions and sales and repayments, the profitability of mortgage banking activities, as well as changes in interest rates, prepayments, and credit losses. Therefore, cash flows generated in the current period are not necessarily reflective of the long-term cash flows we will receive from these investments or activities.\nCash Flows from Operating Activities\nCash flows from operating activities were negative $1.17 billion in 2019. This amount includes the net cash utilized during the period from the purchase and sale of residential mortgage loans associated with our mortgage banking activities. Purchases of loans are financed to a large extent with short-term debt, for which changes in cash are included as a component of financing activities. Excluding cash flows from the purchase, sale, and principal payments of loans classified as held-for-sale, cash flows from operating activities were negative $76 million in 2019, positive $100 million in 2018, and positive $37 million in 2017. The variance in these amounts from 2019 to 2018 was largely attributable to cash outflows for the net settlements of derivatives and payment of margin on derivatives agreements, which totaled $175 million in 2019, compared to net cash inflows of $35 million in 2018.\nCash Flows from Investing Activities\nDuring 2019, our net cash provided by investing activities was $1.03 billion and primarily resulted from proceeds from principal payments on loans held-for-investment and sales of real estate securities. Although we generally intend to hold our investment securities as long-term investments, we may sell certain of these securities in order to manage our interest rate risk and liquidity needs, to meet other operating objectives, and to adapt to market conditions. We cannot predict the timing and impact of future sales of investment securities, if any.\nBecause many of our investment securities are financed through repurchase agreements, a significant portion of the proceeds from any sales or principal payments of our investment securities could be used to repay balances under these financing sources. Similarly, all or a significant portion of cash flows from principal payments of loans at consolidated securitization entities would generally be used to repay ABS issued by those entities.\nDuring 2019, we deployed capital into several new investments, including the acquisitions of 5 Arches and CoreVest, multifamily and re-performing residential loan securities, business purpose residential loans, shared home appreciation options, and a limited partnership to acquire light-renovation multifamily loans.\nAs presented in the \"Supplemental Noncash Information\" subsection of our consolidated statements of cash flows, during 2019, 2018, and 2017, we transferred residential loans between held-for-sale and held-for-investment classification, retained securities from Sequoia securitizations we sponsored, and consolidated certain multifamily and re-performing residential securitization trusts which represent significant non-cash transactions that were not included in cash flows from investing activities.\nCash Flows from Financing Activities\nDuring 2019, our net cash provided by financing activities was $225 million. This primarily resulted from proceeds of $1.40 billion from the issuance of asset-backed securities from our Sequoia Choice and CAFL securitizations, proceeds of $451 million from the issuance of common stock, and proceeds of $387 million from the issuance of exchangeable notes and borrowings under our subordinate securities financing facility. These cash inflows were partially offset by $1.12 billion of repayments of ABS issued, $741 million of net repayments of short-term debt, and the distribution of $129 million of dividends.\nIn February 2020, the Board of Directors declared a regular dividend of $0.32 per share for the first quarter of 2020, which is payable on March 30, 2020 to shareholders of record on March 16, 2020.\nIn accordance with the terms of our outstanding deferred stock units and restricted stock units, which are stock-based compensation awards, each time we declare and pay a dividend on our common stock, we are required to make a dividend equivalent payment in that same per share amount on each outstanding deferred stock unit and restricted stock unit.\nRepurchase Authorization\nIn February 2018, our Board of Directors approved an authorization for the repurchase of our common stock, increasing the total amount authorized for repurchases of common stock to $100 million, and also authorized the repurchase of outstanding debt securities, including convertible and exchangeable debt. This authorization increased the previous share repurchase authorization approved in February 2016 and has no expiration date. This repurchase authorization does not obligate us to acquire any specific number of shares or securities. Under this authorization, shares or securities may be repurchased in privately negotiated and/or open market transactions, including under plans complying with Rule 10b5-1 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. At December 31, 2019, $100 million of the current authorization remained available for the repurchase of shares of our common stock. Like other investments we may make, any repurchases of our common stock or debt securities under this authorization would reduce our available capital described above.\nLeverage\nOur debt-to-equity leverage ratio increased during 2019, as we increased the amount of borrowings we utilized to finance our investments, including through additional short-term and long-term borrowings. Additionally, our leverage ratio is impacted by the amount of loans we hold for sale at our mortgage banking businesses and our amount of undeployed capital available for investment. At December 31, 2019, we estimate we had approximately $260 million of capital available for investment. As this capital is deployed, our leverage ratio is expected to increase, all other factors being equal, as we generally make investments in loans, securities, and other assets with a combination of capital and borrowings secured by the assets we invest in. In general, higher leverage creates greater liquidity risk as the amount of our equity relative to borrowings decreases, including liquidity risks of the types described in Part I, Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K under the heading Risk Factors,\u201d and in Part II,", "item_7_truncated": "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nINTRODUCTION\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations ( MD&A\u201d) is intended to provide a reader of our financial statements with a narrative from the perspective of our management on our financial condition, results of operations, liquidity and certain other factors that may affect our future results. Our MD&A is presented in six main sections:\n \u2022 Overview \n \u2022 Results of Operations \n \u2022 Consolidated Results \n \u2022 Segment Results \n \u2022 Investments \n \u2022 Consolidated VIEs \n \u2022 Tax Provision and Taxable Income \n \u2022 Liquidity and Capital Resources \n \u2022 Off Balance Sheet Arrangements and Contractual Obligations \n \u2022 Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates \n \u2022 New Accounting Standards  Our MD&A should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements and related Notes included in Part II, Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. References herein to Redwood,\u201d the company,\u201d we,\u201d us,\u201d and our\u201d include Redwood Trust, Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries, unless the context otherwise requires. The discussion in this MD&A contains forward-looking statements that involve substantial risks and uncertainties. Our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of various factors, such as those discussed in the Cautionary Statement in Part 1, Item 1, Business and in Part 1, Item 1A, Risk Factors of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nOVERVIEW\nOur Business\nRedwood Trust, Inc., together with its subsidiaries, is a specialty finance company focused on making credit-sensitive investments in single-family residential and multifamily mortgages and related assets and engaging in mortgage banking activities. Our goal is to provide attractive returns to shareholders through a stable and growing stream of earnings and dividends, as well as through capital appreciation. We operate our business in four segments: Residential Lending, Business Purpose Lending, Multifamily Investments, and Third-Party Residential Investments. Our segments are based on our organizational and management structure, which aligns with how our results are monitored and performance is assessed.\nOur primary sources of income are net interest income from our investments and non-interest income from our mortgage banking activities. Net interest income consists of the interest income we earn on investments less the interest expense we incur on borrowed funds and other liabilities. Income from mortgage banking activities is generated through the acquisition and origination of loans and their subsequent sale, securitization, or transfer to our investment portfolios.\nRedwood Trust, Inc. has elected to be taxed as a real estate investment trust ( REIT\u201d). We generally refer, collectively, to Redwood Trust, Inc. and those of its subsidiaries that are not subject to subsidiary-level corporate income tax as the REIT\u201d or our REIT.\u201d We generally refer to subsidiaries of Redwood Trust, Inc. that are subject to subsidiary-level corporate income tax as our operating subsidiaries\u201d or our taxable REIT subsidiaries\u201d or TRS.\u201d\nFor additional information on our business, refer to Part I, Item 1, Business of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nBusiness Update\nRedwood ended 2019 on a strong note, with solid earnings and sustained momentum across our business lines. Our earnings were $0.38 per share for the fourth quarter and we ended the year with earnings of $1.46 per share. Our earnings for the full year were comprised of a healthy balance of investment returns and income from mortgage banking operations, and we made $1.09 billion of investments through a combination of organic and acquisition activity that we believe will help us deliver increased returns to our shareholders in the coming quarters and years.\nWe recently announced a 6.7% increase to our regular quarterly dividend to shareholders to $0.32 per share for the first quarter of 2020. Our ability to raise our dividend despite the market volatility we experienced over the past year is significant and we believe that it demonstrates the stability of our business model and the diversity of our revenues.\nDuring 2019, we made significant progress on our strategic priorities. Enabled in part by two acquisitions, it was a historic year for our business that set a new foundation for our participation in several distinct areas of housing credit, and allowed our consolidated portfolio of investments to evolve to incorporate a diverse mix of residential, business purpose, and multifamily investments. We now operate out of four principal geographic locations across the United States, and our earnings power is supported by organically created investments and the associated platforms that produce them. Our risk-minded culture and our values, which emphasize passion, integrity, change, relationships, and results, underlie our methodical pursuit to become one of the nation's most innovative investors in housing credit. We continue to look ahead and our strategic priorities for 2020 are focused on capitalizing on regulatory changes and technological innovations to continue to advance our overall relevance to the housing market.\nWe recently reorganized our business to create a more scalable infrastructure. We believe this will allow us to better manage the evolving opportunities and risks facing our business and to create better visibility into the earnings power of our operating platforms and the investments they create. We now manage our business through four segments. Our new structure provides for centralized strategic decision-making that drives the activities of these segments. In turn, our businesses can operate end-to-end in their respective sectors while benefiting from corporate risk oversight and traditional shared services. Each of our segments currently operates at a slightly different stage of maturity, creating a mix of earnings generation and future prospects.\nReflecting on the macro environment in 2019, it was an unexpected, record year for residential mortgage refinance activity. The Federal Reserve kept interest rates low after three interest rate cuts in 2019 amid global trade tensions and signs of economic weakness. Inflation, meanwhile, remained low and the U.S. consumer balance sheet remained strong, in part driven by an increased propensity to save that is, in turn, putting downward pressure on benchmark interest rates. As we proceed further into 2020, interest rates on 30-year conforming mortgages have fallen once again. This continues to bolster refinance activity, which has increased loan origination volumes year-to-date in 2020. Low rates have also contributed to increased borrower spending power, something that should in theory increase home purchase demand among the cohort of the population that is now entering their prime home buying years.\nHowever, buying power is less impactful when there is limited housing stock. While the interest rate environment has contributed to consistent home price appreciation over the last decade, it also conceals trends that continue to garner our close attention. Most notably, the supply of quality, affordable homes in the United States badly trails new household formation. While this imbalance has greatly supported rising home prices, it has made access to desirable housing more challenging for many - especially low to moderate income families, many of whom are would-be first-time home buyers. An expedient solution being discussed in Washington, D.C. is to relax underwriting standards and make it easier to offer loans with lower down payments to borrowers with higher debt-to-income ratios. While we support expanding homeownership opportunities for all Americans who desire to own their own homes, lowering underwriting standards had significant consequences leading up to the 2008 financial crisis and beyond. Additionally, these solutions ignore the fundamental problem - not enough homes.\nAt Redwood, our approach to residential mortgage loan underwriting remains unchanged. We emphasize safe, well-structured loans that borrowers can reliably afford. But more importantly, we are advocating for solutions in our business lines that offer more high quality and accessible housing for consumers. For instance, our business purpose lending initiatives focus not only on stabilized rentals, but also bridge lending - where homes are renovated, upgraded, and brought up to current building codes before getting resold or rented to consumers. We are actively expanding our bridge loan lending business to include more robust construction/redevelopment opportunities, including market-leading financing programs for build-to-rent communities, urban infill development, and modular home development, among others. These strategies all complement our residential lending business.\nAs we look ahead into 2020, we are closely watching the U.S. housing finance regulator (Federal Housing Finance Agency), where its new director is focused on exiting Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac out of conservatorship, reducing their size and impact across the housing sector, and creating a level playing field for private capital to participate in a larger part of the market. We see this regulatory shift as a major opportunity for our residential lending business, and the catalyst for us to invest in our platform to support higher levels of growth. We are now applying recent technological innovations to reimagine our non-agency loan production and distribution workstream. We plan to transform our correspondent loan acquisition platform to be more component-based, allowing us to implement new technologies as they become available rather than through comprehensive systems that remain the standard in the industry. We are also working to automate the revalidation of underwriting data to significantly reduce the time it takes us to purchase non-agency loans from originators, allowing them to recycle capital faster and make more loans. At the moment, technology to assist loan sellers in originating conventional loans that can be seamlessly sold exists only in the Agency origination space. Our goal is to make it a reality in the private sector.\nWe also see compelling opportunities in our business-purpose lending segment. The business purpose lending platforms we acquired last year originated a total of $2.4 billion of loans in 2019. We also have an active SFR securitization platform which should support our goal to grow profitably and organically generate assets with attractive risk adjusted returns. We have begun the process of combining the 5 Arches and CoreVest platforms under a unified leadership structure, taking the best features from both businesses to position this segment for profitable future growth. Once fully integrated, our platform will possess a wide breadth of financing products and depth of expertise to deliver all-inclusive and customized solutions to residential real estate investors. A unified platform will also allow us to apply our technology advantage to a full suite of products and in the process remove redundant external costs in the day-to-day operation of the business. Importantly, we are still just beginning to understand how business-purpose lending can leverage the broader Redwood platform. For example, we have begun the process of offering single-family rental loan products to our residential loan sellers, secured the ability to pledge single-family rental loans on our FHLB borrowing facility, and lowered our cost of funds through both warehouse financing and securitization.\nOur multifamily initiative continues to grow and expand and is quickly emerging as a strategic and complementary aspect of our housing finance strategy. We now designate multifamily investing as a core business at Redwood, with over $475 million of capital invested since 2017. We originate small-balance multifamily loans (both term and bridge) in our business-purpose lending segment - an area of desired growth - however, capital deployment in traditional multifamily has been almost exclusively in programs offered by Freddie Mac. To date, we remain one of the only investors in newly issued Freddie Mac multifamily B-pieces (first loss credit risk) that is not also a multifamily operator. Given recent changes implemented by the FHFA, we are now exploring ways to expand how we provide liquidity to this rapidly growing market.\nWhile we anticipate most of our investing activities to originate from within our residential, business-purpose, and multifamily segments, we continue to dedicate meaningful resources to other third-party investment activities. For over a quarter century, our role as an active investor and liquidity provider has been highly relevant to the mortgage capital markets. This effort will operate in coordination with our other businesses and focus on third-party opportunities that we find attractive, including non-agency RMBS, agency CRT bonds, securities backed by re-performing loans, and other investments. Importantly, this segment also allows us to continue tracking the pertinent markets and manage our capital both opportunistically and for liquidity management purposes.\nOver the past two years we believe we have made meaningful progress in diversifying revenues, integrating resources, and positioning Redwood for growth in the years ahead. Our business segments now encompass production and earnings generation potential across a breadth of sectors and collaborate toward a unifying vision of being one of the market's most innovative mortgage investors.\n2019 Financial Overview\nThis section includes an overview of our 2019 financial results. A detailed discussion of our results of operations is presented in the next section of this MD&A. The following table presents selected financial highlights from 2019 and 2018.\nTable 1 - Key Earnings and Return Metrics\nTable 94: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Years Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(In Thousands, except per Share Data)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>169,183\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>119,600\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Earnings per share (diluted EPS)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1.46\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1.34\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Return on equity (ROE)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10.6\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9.3\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Book value per share\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>15.98\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>15.89\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Economic return on book value (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8.1\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7.8\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>REIT taxable income per share\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1.28\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1.38\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Dividends per share\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1.20\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1.18\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n (1) Economic return on book value is based on the periodic change in GAAP book value per common share plus dividends declared per common share during the period.  Our 2019 results benefited from the continued expansion of our businesses across the broader housing market, including our acquisitions of 5 Arches and CoreVest in the business purpose residential lending space, and further capital deployment into multifamily investments. Through these acquisitions, we established our business purpose loan origination capabilities, which helped drive higher mortgage banking income in 2019, and also deployed a significant amount of capital into attractive business purpose lending (\"BPL\") investments, which helped drive higher investment returns. Our results also benefited from a recovery in asset prices in the first quarter of 2019, after a significant decrease in value during the fourth quarter of 2018, which negatively impacted our 2018 results. Investment fair values also benefited in 2019 from spread tightening across many investment types, which also created opportunities to sell lower-yielding assets and realize gains. After rotating a significant amount of capital out of lower yielding assets (through sales) and redeploying that capital into higher yielding investments in business purpose, multifamily and reperforming loan assets, we expect our net interest income to grow and the pace and overall amount of securities sales and resulting gains to decrease in 2020, given current market conditions. Although REIT taxable income per share decreased in 2019, we earned a growing amount of more stable net interest income from investments at our REIT, which is an important contributor to supporting our dividend.\nTable 2 - Key Operational Metrics\nTable 96: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Years Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(In Thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Capital Deployed\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,085,994\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>810,203\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Residential Loans Purchased\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>5,901,802\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>7,133,558\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Business Purpose Residential Loans Originated\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,015,157\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nDuring 2019, we raised $451 million of equity capital, and replaced $201 million of exchangeable debt that matured with new exchangeable debt maturing in six years. We used the proceeds from these issuances along with proceeds from portfolio optimization to increase our capital deployment to $1.09 billion in 2019, which included approximately $530 million deployed into our two acquisitions (including associated financial assets) and the remainder into investment assets. As in the prior year, we continued to deploy a meaningful amount of our capital into business purpose residential loans, multifamily investments, and re-performing loan investments, expanding further into these areas of housing.\nOur residential mortgage banking business saw loan purchases decrease in 2019, impacted primarily by increased competition. However, we operated this business with lower capital in 2019, helping to improve its return on equity. Additionally, we saw acquisition volumes begin to increase late in the year and we expect purchase volumes to increase in 2020 given the current interest rate environment. In 2019, through our Sequoia platform, we completed five Select securitizations and three Choice securitizations, which were supplemented by an increasing proportion of whole loans sales.\nOur business purpose mortgage banking business, which began in earnest early in 2019 through our acquisition of 5 Arches, steadily grew origination volume throughout the year and saw a significant boost in the fourth quarter when we acquired CoreVest. With the origination capabilities of the combined platforms, we believe origination volume from this business can increase in 2020 as compared to 2019.\nBook Value per Share\nThe following table sets forth the changes in our book value per share for the year ended December 31, 2019.\nTable 3 - Changes in Book Value per Share\nTable 97: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(In Dollars, per share basis)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>December 31, 2019\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Beginning book value per share\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>15.89\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net income (diluted EPS)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.46\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Changes in unrealized gains on securities, net from:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Realized gains recognized in net income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(0.15\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Amortization income recognized in net income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(0.06\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Mark-to-market adjustments, net\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.25\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total change in unrealized gains on securities, net\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.04\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Dividends\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1.20\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Issuance of common stock\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(0.06\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>CoreVest acquisition equity consideration\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(0.08\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Changes in unrealized losses on derivatives hedging long-term debt\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(0.17\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other, net (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.10\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Ending Book Value per Share\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>15.98\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n (1) Primarily represents income earned on actual shares outstanding, as we include diluted earnings per common share as a line item within table.  Our GAAP book value per share increased $0.09 per share to $15.98 per share during 2019. This increase was driven primarily by earnings exceeding our dividend payments.\nUnrealized gains on our available-for-sale securities increased $0.04 per share during 2019. This decrease primarily resulted from $0.15 per share of previously unrealized net gains that were realized as income from the sale of securities, as well as $0.06 per share of discount accretion income recognized in earnings from the appreciation in the amortized cost basis of our available-for-sale securities. These decreases were offset by positive mark-to-market adjustments on available-for-sale securities primarily resulting from overall credit spread tightening on these investments during 2019.\nLower benchmark interest rates during 2019 resulted in a $0.17 per share decrease to book value from unrealized losses on the derivatives hedging a portion of our long-term debt. At December 31, 2019, the cumulative unrealized loss on these derivatives, which is included in our GAAP book value per share, was $0.45 per share. During 2019, we issued common stock for net proceeds that on a per share basis were lower than our book value per share and were, therefore, slightly dilutive to book value. Additionally, included in the change in book value per share for 2019 was an $0.08 per share decrease from the issuance of restricted common stock related to our acquisition of CoreVest.\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nConsolidated Results of Operations\nWithin this Results of Operations section, we provide commentary that compares results year-over-year for 2019, 2018, and 2017. Most tables include \"changes\" columns that show the amounts by which the year's results are greater or less than the results from the prior year.

This improvement was partially offset by a decrease in net interest income from residential loans held-for-sale at our residential lending segment, as the average balance of loans in inventory awaiting sale or securitization declined in 2019 as compared with 2018. Additionally, higher interest expense on long-term debt in 2019 from a higher average balance of convertible debt further offset the increase from net capital deployment.\nWe utilize hedges to manage interest rate risk in our investment portfolio and the net interest expense from these instruments is a component of our Investment fair value changes line item, which is discussed below. Net hedge interest expense associated with investment hedges increased in 2019 and on a combined basis, net interest income plus net interest expense on hedges increased by $5 million in 2019, compared to 2018.\nNet interest income in 2018 was consistent with 2017, as higher interest income from net capital deployment and higher average yields in 2018 was offset by higher interest expense on short-term floating rate debt facilities and FHLB borrowings from rising benchmark interest rates.\nAdditional detail on changes in net interest income is provided in the Net Interest Income\u201d section that follows.\nMortgage Banking Activities, Net\nIncome from mortgage banking activities, net includes results from both our residential and business purpose mortgage banking operations. The $28 million increase in 2019 was due to a $40 million increase from business purpose mortgage banking, partially offset by a $12 million decrease from residential mortgage banking. The increase from business purpose mortgage banking resulted from our acquisitions of 5 Arches and CoreVest in 2019 and the income generated from those operations. The decrease from residential mortgage banking was primarily due to lower gross margins on slightly higher loan purchase commitments in 2019, relative to 2018. The $6 million increase in 2018 was primarily due to an increase in residential loan purchase volume in 2018, relative to 2017, on similar gross margins.\nAdditional analysis of the changes in this line item is included in the Results of Operations by Segment\u201d section that follows.\nInvestment Fair Value Changes, Net\nInvestment fair value changes, net, is primarily comprised of the change in fair values of our investments accounted for under the fair value option and interest rate hedges associated with these investments.\nDuring 2019, the positive investment fair value changes primarily resulted from tightening credit spreads in several investment classes. During 2018, the negative investment fair value changes primarily resulted from widening credit spreads during the fourth quarter, which impacted both our residential securities and our residential loans held-for-investment.\nAdditional analysis of the changes in this line item is included in the Results of Operations by Segment\u201d section that follows.\nOther Income\nThe $6 million increase in Other income in 2019 primarily resulted from $4 million of business purpose loan administration fee income earned at 5 Arches, as well as a $2 million gain associated with the re-measurement of our initial minority investment and purchase option in 5 Arches upon its acquisition. This increase was partially offset by a decrease in income from our MSR investments as the notional balance of these investments continued to pay down. Details on the composition of Other income is included in Note 21 in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K\nRealized Gains, Net\nFor 2019, we realized gains of $24 million, primarily from the sale of $110 million of AFS securities and the call of a seasoned Sequoia securitization in the first quarter. For 2018, we realized gains of $27 million, primarily from the sale of $144 million of AFS securities. For 2017, we realized gains of $13 million, primarily from the sale of $90 million of AFS securities.\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses\nThe $36 million increase in general and administrative expenses in 2019 primarily resulted from $28 million of additional expenses from the operations of 5 Arches and CoreVest, which were acquired in March and October of 2019, respectively. The remainder of the increase was primarily due to $7 million in higher compensation expense at the Redwood parent entity (exclusive of 5 Arches and CoreVest), as well as higher systems, consulting, accounting, and legal costs, driven mostly by the acquisition-related expenses associated with 5 Arches and CoreVest. The higher compensation expense at the Redwood parent entity was primarily driven by higher variable compensation, commensurate with improved results in 2019, as well as a higher average employee count in 2019.\nThe increase in general and administrative expenses in 2018 primarily resulted from higher loan acquisition costs due to higher loan purchase volume in 2018, as well as higher expenses associated with implementing new investment initiatives, including higher personnel costs and legal fees. These increases were partially offset by lower variable compensation expense commensurate with a decline in net income in 2018.\nOther Expenses\nOther expenses in 2019 primarily consisted of amortization expense from intangible assets and contingent consideration we recorded in connection with acquisition activity during 2019.\nProvision for Income Taxes\nOur provision for income taxes is almost entirely related to activity at our taxable REIT subsidiaries, which primarily includes our mortgage banking activities, MSR investments, as well as certain other investment and hedging activities associated with these investments.\nThe decrease in the provision for income taxes for 2019 was driven primarily by lower GAAP income earned at our TRS. Additionally, the provision for 2019 included a $2 million tax benefit resulting from the purchase of 5 Arches.\nThe decrease in the provision for income taxes for 2018 resulted primarily from a lower corporate tax rate, and lower investment portfolio income at our TRS during the year. The increase in the provision for income taxes in 2017 resulted primarily from higher mortgage banking income in 2017, compared to 2016. This increase was offset by a tax benefit of $8 million from the reduction of our net federal deferred tax liabilities as a result of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (the \"Tax Act\") that was enacted in December 2017. For additional detail on income taxes, see the Tax Provision and Taxable Income\u201d section that follows.\nNet Interest Income\nThe following tables present the components of net interest income for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018, and 2017.\nTable 5 -

The decreases in net interest income from Corporate/Other during 2019 and 2018 were primarily due to lower net interest income from consolidated Legacy Sequoia entities, as loans in these securitizations continued to pay down. Details regarding consolidated Legacy Sequoia entities are included in the \"Results of Consolidated Legacy Sequoia Entities\" section that follows.\nResults of Operations by Segment\nWe report on our business using four segments: Residential Lending, Business Purpose Lending, Multifamily Investments, and Third-Party Residential Investments.

These increases were partially offset by a $2 million gain associated with the re-measurement of our initial minority investment and purchase option in 5 Arches. The increase in corporate general and administrative expenses in 2019 was primarily due to $7 million in higher compensation expense, driven mostly by higher variable compensation commensurate with improved results in 2019, as well as higher systems, consulting, accounting, and legal costs, driven mostly by the acquisitions of 5 Arches and CoreVest.\nThe $9 million improvement from Corporate/Other in 2018 primarily resulted from lower variable compensation expense commensurate with lower GAAP earnings, as well as higher earnings from our consolidated Legacy Sequoia entities in 2018. Details regarding consolidated Legacy Sequoia entities are included in the \"Results of Consolidated Legacy Sequoia Entities\" section that follows.\nResidential Lending Segment\nOur Residential Lending segment primarily consists of a mortgage loan conduit that acquires residential loans from third-party originators for subsequent sale, securitization, or transfer to our investment portfolio, as well as the investments we retain from these activities. We typically acquire prime, jumbo mortgages and the related mortgage servicing rights on a flow basis from our network of loan sellers and distribute those loans through our Sequoia private-label securitization program or to institutions that acquire pools of whole loans. Our investments in this segment primarily consist of residential mortgage-backed securities (\"RMBS\") retained from our Sequoia securitizations (some of which we consolidate for GAAP purposes), jumbo whole loans we retained and finance through our Federal Home Loan Bank of Chicago (\"FHLBC\") member subsidiary, as well as MSRs retained from jumbo whole loans we sold.\nThe following table presents the components of segment contribution for the Residential Lending segment for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018, and 2017.\nTable 9 -

For GAAP purposes, we consolidated $2.29 billion of loans and $2.04 billion of ABS issued associated with these investments at December 31, 2019.  See the Investments and Consolidated VIEs sections that follow for additional details on these investments.\nOverview\nSegment contribution from our Residential Lending segment decreased during 2019, driven both by lower mortgage banking income and lower overall investment returns. Mortgage banking income decreased due to a lower average balance of loans carried during 2019, resulting in lower net interest income, as well as lower mortgage banking activities income resulting from lower profit margins due to increased competition. Although the overall income from these operations decreased, we ran these operations with less capital in 2019 than 2018, resulting in higher returns on allocated capital year-over-year. The decrease in income from investing activities was primarily due to a lower average balance of investments in this segment in 2019, as we shifted capital from this segment into other segments. For example, as jumbo residential loans that we had financed with FHLB debt paid off, we pledged single-family rental loans to collateralize an increasing portion of our FHLB debt. In addition, as mortgage rates decreased throughout much of the year, we experienced increased loan prepayment rates, which negatively impacted the fair value of our investments held at a premium (including our residential loans at Redwood and our interest only securities), which resulted in higher negative investment fair value changes in 2019.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2019, our residential mortgage loan conduit purchased $5.86 billion of predominately prime residential jumbo loans, securitized $1.92 billion of jumbo Select loans that were accounted for as sales, and sold $3.22 billion of jumbo loans to third parties. Additionally, we transferred $1.08 billion of jumbo Choice loans that did not qualify for sales accounting treatment under GAAP to Sequoia securitization entities and we had net transfers of $69 million of residential jumbo loans into our Residential Lending investment portfolio that were financed with borrowings from the FHLBC. Our pipeline of loans identified for purchase at December 31, 2019 included $1.83 billion of jumbo loans. At December 31, 2019, our residential mortgage loan conduit had 492 loan sellers, including 184 jumbo sellers and 308 sellers from various FHLB districts participating in the FHLB's MPF Direct program.\nWe utilize a combination of capital and our residential loan warehouse facilities to manage our inventory of residential loans held-for-sale. At December 31, 2019, we had $186 million of warehouse debt outstanding to fund our residential loans held-for-sale. Jumbo loan warehouse capacity at December 31, 2019 totaled $1.43 billion across four separate counterparties, which should continue to provide sufficient liquidity to fund our residential mortgage banking operations in the near-term.\nNet Interest Income\nNet interest income from our Residential Lending segment is primarily comprised of net interest income earned from our residential loans held for investment and financed with FHLB debt, net interest income from securities retained from our Sequoia securitizations, and net interest income from our inventory of residential loans held-for-sale prior to sale or securitization.\nNet interest income from residential lending investments decreased in 2019, due primarily to higher interest costs on our variable-rate long-term FHLB borrowings during 2019, from higher benchmark interest rates. Additionally, the average balance of our investment portfolio at this segment declined, as capital freed-up from sales and paydowns within this segment were redeployed in our business purpose lending and multifamily investments segments. Residential securities at Redwood decreased from the sale of lower-yielding Sequoia mezzanine securities, and residential securities at consolidated Sequoia Choice entities increased due to the retention of securities from Choice securitizations that were issued in 2019.\nThe $6 million decrease in 2018 in net interest income was primarily attributable to higher interest expense in 2018 related to our variable-rate borrowings on our residential lending investments, including from FHLB borrowings.\nWe use a combination of swaps and other derivatives to hedge our exposure to interest rates on our fixed-rate loan and securities investments and their associated variable-rate debt. The interest expense or benefit associated with these hedges is included in our Investment fair value changes, net line item on our financial statements. Including the impact of this hedge interest, our combined net interest income for residential lending investments was $60 million, $62 million, and $59 million in 2019, 2018, and 2017, respectively.\nMortgage Banking Activities, Net\nMortgage banking activities, net, includes the changes in market value of both the loans we hold for sale and commitments for loans we intend to purchase (collectively, our loan pipeline), as well as the effect of derivative instruments we utilize to manage risks associated with our loan pipeline. Our loan sale profit margins are measured over the period from when we commit to purchase a loan and subsequently sell or securitize the loan. Accordingly, these profit margins may encompass positive or negative market valuation adjustments on loans, hedging gains or losses associated with our loan pipeline, and any other related transaction expenses, and may be realized over the course of one or more quarters for financial reporting purposes.\nThe following table presents the components of residential mortgage banking activities, net. Amounts presented include both the changes in market values for loans that were sold and associated derivative positions that were settled during the periods presented, as well as changes in market values of loans and derivatives outstanding at the end of each period.\nTable 12 - Components of Residential Mortgage Banking Activities, Net\nTable 112: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Years Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Changes\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(In Thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>'19/'18\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>'18/'17\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Residential Mortgage Banking Activities, Net\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Changes in fair value of:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Residential loans, at fair value (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>63,527\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>21,808\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>69,373\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>41,719\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(47,565\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Risk management derivatives (2)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(17,519\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>35,248\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(17,529\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(52,767\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>52,777\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other income (3)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,735\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,567\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,064\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(832\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>503\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total residential mortgage banking activities, net\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>47,743\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>59,623\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>53,908\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(11,880\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>5,715\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n (1) Includes changes in fair value for loan purchase and forward sale commitments. \n (2) Represents market valuation changes of derivatives that are used to manage risks associated with our accumulation of residential loans. \n (3) Amounts in this line include other fee income from loan acquisitions and the provision for repurchase expense, presented net.  The decrease in residential mortgage banking activities, net in 2019 was primarily due to lower gross margins on somewhat higher loan purchase commitments in 2019, compared to 2018. Gross margins were towards the higher end of our long-term expectations in 2019, though below our 2018 gross margins, which benefited from significant spread tightening on AAA securities experienced early in 2018. The spread tightening benefited both loan production and the high balance of loans in inventory at the end of 2017, which were subsequently sold in early 2018. The increase in mortgage banking activities, net in 2018 was primarily due to higher loan purchase commitments on similar gross margins in 2018 compared to 2017. We define gross margins as net interest income plus income from mortgage banking activities, divided by loan purchase commitments (\"LPCs\"). LPCs, adjusted for fallout expectations, were $7.01 billion, $6.44 billion, and $5.89 billion for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018, and 2017, respectively.\nAt December 31, 2019, we had a repurchase reserve of $4 million outstanding related to residential loans sold through this segment. For the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, we recorded $0.3 million of repurchase provisions and $0.3 million of reversals of provision for repurchases, respectively, that were included in income from mortgage banking activities, net, in this segment. We review our loan repurchase reserves each quarter and adjust them as necessary based on current information available at each reporting date.\nInvestment Fair Value Changes, Net\nThe following table presents the components of investment fair value changes for our Residential Lending segment by investment type for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018, and 2017.\nTable 13 - Investment Fair Value Changes, Net from Residential Lending\nTable 116: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Years Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(In Thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Investment Fair Value Changes, Net\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Changes in fair value of:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Residential loans held-for-investment, at Redwood\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>58,891\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(29,573\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(5,765\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Trading securities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(14,675\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(3,281\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(5,600\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net investments in Sequoia Choice entities (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6,947\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>443\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(323\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Risk-sharing and other investments\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(166\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(434\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1,484\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Risk management derivatives, net\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(78,917\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11,159\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(12,294\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Investment Fair Value Changes, Net\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(27,920\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(21,686\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(25,466\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n (1) Includes changes in fair value of the loans held-for-investment and the ABS issued at the entities, which netted together represent the change in value of our investments (senior and subordinate securities) at the consolidated VIEs.  For 2019, the negative investment fair value changes primarily resulted from interest rate volatility, which increased prepayment rates on loans held-for-investments, IO securities, and other premium securities, adversely impacting valuations, net of associated hedges. This decline was partially offset by spread tightening on certain of our net investments in Sequoia Choice entities.\nFor 2018, the negative investment fair value changes primarily resulted from credit spread widening that occurred in the fourth quarter, impacting both our residential loans and residential trading securities.\nIncluded in the risk management derivatives component of investment fair value changes, net is net interest expense from derivative instruments used to hedge interest rate risk on our financed investments. Net hedge interest expense associated with investment hedges was income of $3 million in 2019, an expense of $0.5 million in 2018, and an expense of $12 million in 2017.\nOther Income\nOther income was primarily comprised of MSR income and income from our residential loan risk-sharing arrangements with Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. The $3 million decrease in Other income in 2019 was primarily due to a decrease in income from our MSR investments, as the notional balance of underlying loans continued to pay down.\nRealized Gains, Net\nRealized gains, net result from sales of available-for-sale securities within this segment. We generally sell securities when their yields fall below our return thresholds and we see opportunities to redeploy the capital into other investments with more attractive risk-adjusted returns. During the past three years, the majority of the securities we sold in this segment were mezzanine securities we retained from Sequoia Select securitizations that experienced significant credit spread tightening as the securitizations have paid-down and experienced minimal losses.\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses\nGeneral and administrative expenses for this segment primarily include costs associated with the underwriting, purchase and sale of residential loans, as well as costs associated with managing the segment's investment portfolio. General and administrative expenses decreased $1 million during 2019, primarily related to a decrease in loan acquisition costs associated with lower loan purchase volume in 2019 relative to 2018, as well as lower variable compensation expense commensurate with lower returns for this segment in 2019 relative to 2018. General and administrative expenses increased $4 million during 2018, primarily related to an increase in loan acquisition costs associated with the increase in loan purchase volume in 2018 relative to 2017, as well as higher compensation expense as we increased headcount in 2018 and paid higher variable compensation tied to higher earnings in 2018.\nProvision for Income Taxes\nThe provision for income taxes for this segment primarily result from its mortgage banking activities, which are performed at our taxable REIT subsidiary, and is generally correlated to the amount of this segment's contribution before income taxes in relation to the TRS's overall GAAP income and associated tax provision. For 2019, the decrease in the tax provision primarily resulted from decreased TRS GAAP earnings at this segment and, in 2018, the increase primarily resulted from increased TRS GAAP earnings at this segment. For additional detail on income taxes, see the \"Tax Provision and Taxable Income\" section that follows.\nBusiness Purpose Lending Segment\nOur Business Purpose Lending segment consists of a platform that originates and acquires business purpose residential loans for subsequent securitization or transfer into our investment portfolio, as well as the investments we retain from these activities. We typically originate single-family rental and residential bridge loans and distribute certain single-family loans through our CoreVest American Finance Lender (\"CAFL\") private-label securitization program and retain others for investment along with our residential bridge loans. Single-family rental loans are business purpose residential mortgage loans to investors in single-family (1-4 unit) rental properties. Residential bridge loans are business purpose residential mortgage loans to investors rehabilitating and reselling or renting residential properties. Our investments in this segment primarily consist of securities retained from CAFL securitizations (which we consolidate for GAAP purposes), residential bridge loans, and single-family rental loans we finance through our FHLBC member subsidiary.\nThe following table presents the components of segment contribution for the Business Purpose Lending segment for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018, and 2017.\nTable 14 -

For GAAP purposes, we consolidated $2.19 billion of loans and $2.00 billion of ABS issued associated with these investments at December 31, 2019.  See the Investments and Consolidated VIEs sections that follow for additional details on these investments.\nOverview\nPrior to our acquisitions of CoreVest and 5 Arches in 2019, we did not have significant investments in business purpose residential loans and had only acquired a limited amount of business purpose residential loans from 5 Arches in 2018, while we held a minority investment in 5 Arches. Through our acquisition of 5 Arches in March of 2019, we began originating business purpose loans, of which the SFR loans were generally initially held in inventory for future securitization and the bridge loans were generally transferred into our BPL investment portfolio. Later in 2019, we transferred nearly all of the 5 Arches originated SFR loans into our BPL investment portfolio, where they were financed through our FHLB member subsidiary. In October of 2019, we acquired CoreVest and obtained its inventory of single-family rental loans held-for-sale, along with an investment portfolio comprised of bridge loans and retained securities from CAFL securitizations it had previously issued. In November 2019, we issued our first securitization under the CAFL program and retained certain subordinate securities (for GAAP purposes, CAFL securitizations are not treated as sales and we consolidate all CAFL securitization entities onto our balance sheet). In the future, we expect to securitize a portion of our SFR loan originations and transfer a portion into our BPL investment portfolio. In the near-term, we generally expect to transfer the majority of newly originated bridge loans into our BPL investment portfolio.\nResults from this segment in 2019 were driven by our BPL mortgage banking operations as well as from our BPL investment portfolio, which both increased meaningfully relative to 2018, due to the acquisitions of 5 Arches and CoreVest. Mortgage banking results for this segment also benefited from spread tightening in the fourth quarter of 2019, as we experienced strong execution on the first securitization we issued under the CAFL program.\nDuring the first two months of 2019, prior to our acquisition of 5 Arches on March 1, 2019, we purchased $19 million of single-family rental loans from 5 Arches. During the period from March 1, 2019 to December 31, 2019, we funded $514 million of single-family rental loans, of which $238 million were transferred to our investment portfolio and financed with FHLB borrowings, and the remaining loans were held-for-sale. During the period from March 1, 2019 to December 31, 2019, we funded $501 million of residential bridge loans, of which $56 million were sold to a third party and the remaining loans were transferred to our BPL investment portfolio.\nWe utilize a combination of capital and our business purpose loan warehouse facilities to manage our inventory of business purpose residential loans held-for-sale and our business purpose loan investments. Our business purpose residential loan warehouse capacity totaled $1.48 billion across six separate counterparties. In addition, at December 31, 2019, we finance a portion of the CAFL securities we own through a securities repurchase facility.\nNet Interest Income\nNet interest income from our Business Purpose Lending segment is primarily comprised of net interest income earned from our BPL investments, and to a lesser extent from our inventory of SFR loans held-for-sale from the time we originate or acquire the loans to when securitize them or transfer them to our investment portfolio.\nThe $16 million increase in net interest income in 2019 was primarily due to a higher average balance of BPL investments during 2019 relative to 2018, as we retained SFR and residential bridge loans from 5 Arches and CoreVest production during 2019 and also acquired the in-place portfolio of residential bridge loans and retained SFR securities from CoreVest during the fourth quarter of 2019. The increase was also driven by a higher average balance of loans held-for-sale during 2019 relative to 2018.\nMortgage Banking Activities, Net\nMortgage banking activities, net, includes loan origination fees and the changes in market value of both the loans we hold for sale and our interest rate lock commitments (collectively, our loan pipeline), as well as the derivative instruments we utilize to manage risks associated with our loan pipeline, from the time we lock a loan with a borrower to when we subsequently securitize the loan or transfer it to our BPL investment portfolio. Accordingly, these profit margins may encompass positive or negative market valuation adjustments on loans, hedging gains or losses associated with our loan pipeline, and any other related transaction expenses, and may be realized over the course of one or more quarters for financial reporting purposes.\nThe following table presents the components of business purpose mortgage banking activities, net. Amounts presented include both the changes in market values for loans that were sold and associated derivative positions that were settled during the periods presented, as well as changes in market values of loans and derivatives outstanding at the end of each period.\nTable 17 - Components of Business Purpose Mortgage Banking Activities, Net\nTable 125: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Years Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Changes\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(In Thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>'19/'18\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>'18/'17\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Business Purpose Mortgage Banking Activities, Net\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Changes in fair value of:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Single-family rental loans, at fair value(1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>17,004\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>453\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>16,551\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>453\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Risk management derivatives (2)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,796\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(510\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,306\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(510\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Residential bridge loans, at fair value(3)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,518\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,518\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other income (4)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>16,205\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>16,205\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total business purpose mortgage banking activities, net\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>39,523\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(57\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>39,580\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(57\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n (1) Includes changes in fair value for interest rate lock commitments. \n (2) Represents market valuation changes of derivatives that are used to manage risks associated with our accumulation of loans. \n (3) Represents the change in fair market value from origination at our TRS to when the loan is sold or transferred to our REIT. \n (4) Amounts in this line primarily include loan origination fees.  Increasing origination volumes drove higher income from mortgage banking activities in both 2019 and 2018. Business purpose mortgage banking activities for 2019 included $30 million earned in the fourth quarter, driven both by new origination activity from CoreVest, increased origination activity from 5 Arches, as well as a benefit from spread-tightening on securitization execution for the SFR loans we acquired from CoreVest. We generally would not expect the same spread-tightening in subsequent quarters, dependent on market conditions.\nInvestment Fair Value Changes, Net\nThe following table presents the components of investment fair value changes for our Business Purpose Lending segment by investment type for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018, and 2017.\nTable 18 - Investment Fair Value Changes, Net from Business Purpose Lending\nTable 130: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Years Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(In Thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Investment Fair Value Changes, Net\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Single-family rental loans held-for-investment\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>272\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Residential bridge loans held-for-investment\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(2,139\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(29\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>REO\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1,045\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net investments in CAFL entities (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(3,636\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(174\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Investment Fair Value Changes, Net\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(6,722\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(29\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n (1) Includes changes in fair value of the loans held-for-investment and the ABS issued at the entities, which netted together represent the change in value of our economic investments (senior and subordinate securities) in securities at the consolidated VIEs.  Residential bridge loans are carried at fair value and generally transferred to our REIT at a premium, which diminishes as the loans mature and ultimately repay, resulting in negative fair value changes over the life of the loans. The change in fair value for our net investments in CAFL entities represents the change in fair value of the underlying securities we own in these consolidated entities and was negative in 2019, primarily due to the receipt of expected cash flows on IO securities we own. During 2019, we recorded $1 million of negative fair value changes related to residential business purpose loans we foreclosed on and carried as REO.\nOther Income\nOther income at this segment is primarily comprised of fee income earned from the administration of loans for a third-party legacy fund, which is winding down.\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses\nGeneral and administrative expenses for this segment include costs associated with the origination, purchase and securitization of business purpose residential loans, as well as the management of our BPL investment portfolio. General and administrative expenses increased during 2019 due to the acquisitions of 5 Arches and CoreVest. We expect these expenses to increase in 2020 as we incur a full year of expenses for these operations.\nOther Expenses\nOther expenses for this segment includes amortization expense from intangible assets we recorded in connection with the acquisitions of 5 Arches and CoreVest for the periods we owned each company during 2019.\nProvision for Income Taxes\nThe provision for income taxes for this segment primarily result from its mortgage banking activities, which are performed at our taxable REIT subsidiary, and is generally correlated to the amount of this segment's contribution before income taxes in relation to the TRS's overall GAAP income and associated tax provision. For 2019, the increase in the tax provision primarily resulted from increased TRS GAAP earnings at this segment. For additional detail on income taxes, see the \"Tax Provision and Taxable Income\" section that follows.\nMultifamily Investments Segment\nOur Multifamily Investments segment consists of investments in securities collateralized by multifamily mortgage loans, as well as other investments in multifamily mortgages and related assets. The securities in this segment are primarily comprised of investments in Freddie Mac K-Series securitizations.\nThe following table presents the components of segment contribution for the Multifamily Investments segment for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018, and 2017.\nTable 19 - Multifamily Investments Segment Contribution\nTable 132: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Years Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Changes\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(In Thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>'19/'18\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>'18/'17\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net interest income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>9,712\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>5,726\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,063\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,986\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,663\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Non-interest income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Investment fair value changes, net\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>27,097\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,979\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>16,196\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>23,118\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(12,217\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,484\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,484\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Realized gains, net\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>134\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>134\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total non-interest income, net\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>28,715\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,979\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>16,196\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>24,736\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(12,217\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>General and administrative expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1,498\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(869\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(425\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(629\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(444\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Segment contribution before income taxes\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>36,929\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8,836\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>18,834\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>28,093\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(9,998\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Provision for income taxes\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(11\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(16\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(238\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>222\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total Segment Contribution\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>36,918\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>8,820\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>18,596\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>28,098\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(9,776\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe following table presents details of the investments in our Multifamily Investments segment at December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018.\nTable 20 - Multifamily Investments Table 133: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(In Thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>December 31, 2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>December 31, 2018\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Multifamily securities at Redwood\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>404,128\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>429,079\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Multifamily securities at consolidated Freddie Mac K-Series entities (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>252,285\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>125,523\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other investments\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>61,018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>15,092\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total Segment Investments\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>717,431\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>569,694\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n (1) Represents our economic investment in securities issued by consolidated Freddie Mac K-Series securitization entities. For GAAP purposes, we consolidated $4.41 billion of loans and $4.16 billion of ABS issued associated with these investments at December 31, 2019.  See the Investments and Consolidated VIEs sections that follow for additional details on these investments.\nOverview\nSegment contribution from Multifamily Investments increased in 2019, primarily as a result of positive market valuation changes driven by tightening credit spreads, as well as higher net interest income from a higher average balance of investments.\nBeginning in 2018, we began investing in subordinate securities issued from Freddie Mac sponsored K-Series multifamily securitizations. Due to certain rights given to the subordinate securities, we consolidate these securitizations for GAAP purposes and we consolidated three such securitizations in 2018 and two in 2019 as result of securities we purchased in those years. We also invest in mezzanine securities issued by Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae, which represent securities subordinate to senior securities, but senior to the most subordinate bonds in a securitization. While we continued to invest in new mezzanine multifamily securities during 2019, on a net basis we reduced our investment in these assets, as we sold several seasoned securities that had appreciated in price (contributing to higher investment fair value changes in 2019) and had lower current returns. We account for most of the securities in this segment under the fair value option and gains are reflected in investment fair value changes rather than realized gains.\nIn addition to our multifamily securities investments, our other investments are primarily comprised of an investment in a limited partnership created to acquire multifamily loans from Freddie Mac, and investments in multifamily excess MSRs.\nNet Interest Income\nThe increases in 2019 and 2018 in net interest income from multifamily investments were primarily driven by a higher average balance of investments in each sequential year, as we increased our investments in Freddie Mac K-Series subordinate securities in both years.\nInvestment Fair Value Changes, Net\nThe following table presents the components of investment fair value changes for our Multifamily segment by investment type for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018, and 2017.\nTable 21 - Investment Fair Value Changes, Net from Multifamily Investments\nTable 135: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Years Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(In Thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Investment Fair Value Changes, Net\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Changes in fair value of:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Trading securities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>33,233\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,825\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>15,798\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Excess MSRs\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(3,570\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(313\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net investments in Freddie Mac K-Series entities (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>21,430\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>931\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Risk management derivatives, net\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(23,996\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(464\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>98\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Valuation adjustments on commercial loans held-for-sale\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>300\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Investment Fair Value Changes, Net\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>27,097\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,979\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>16,196\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n (1) Includes changes in fair value of the loans held-for-investment and the ABS issued at the entities, which netted together represent the change in value of our investments (subordinate securities) at the consolidated VIEs.  The net positive investment fair value changes for 2019 were primarily driven by tightening credit spreads in our mezzanine securities as well as the subordinate securities we own in the consolidated Freddie Mac K-Series entities. The mezzanine trading securities saw price appreciation from both tightening credit spreads and lower benchmark interest rates in 2019. Nearly all of our risk management derivatives at this segment are used to manage interest rate risk on our mezzanine securities, and in 2019 they decreased in value as a result of declining benchmark interest rates. Our excess MSRs saw negative fair value changes in 2019 primarily related to the receipt of expected cash flows.\nOther Income\nOther income in this segment includes income from our investment in a multifamily loan fund, which we entered into in January 2019.\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses\nGeneral and administrative expenses increased over the last two years as we hired additional personnel to manage our growing investment portfolio.\nProvision for Income Taxes\nThe provision for income taxes is generally correlated to the amount of this segment's contribution before income taxes in relation to the TRS's overall GAAP income and associated tax provision. For 2019, the TRS GAAP income earned at this segment was consistent with the prior year.\nThird-Party Residential Investments Segment\nOur Third-Party Residential Investments segment consists of investments in RMBS issued by third parties, investments in Freddie Mac SLST securitizations (which we consolidate for GAAP purposes), our servicer advance investments, and other residential credit investments not generated through our Residential Lending segment.\nThe following table presents the components of segment contribution for the Third-Party Residential Investments segment for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018, and 2017.\nTable 22 -

For GAAP purposes, we consolidated $2.37 billion of loans and $1.92 billion of ABS issued associated with these investments at December 31, 2019.  See the Investments and Consolidated VIEs sections that follows for additional details on these investments.\nOverview\nSegment contribution from Third-Party Residential Investments increased during 2019, primarily due to positive investment fair value changes on our investments resulting from tightening credit spreads across much of this portfolio. This increase was partially offset by lower net interest income in 2019 resulting from lower discount accretion on available-for-sale securities, and lower realized gains as we sold fewer AFS securities in 2019.\nNet Interest Income\nNet interest income from our third-party residential investments decreased $7 million in 2019, primarily due to lower discount accretion from legacy available-for-sale securities, resulting from lower average balances of these investments during 2019. This decline was partially offset by an increase in net interest income from additional investments made in Freddie Mac SLST securities during 2019. Our net investments in these entities (i.e., the securities issued by these entities that we own) are accounted for under the fair value method and a portion of their economic return (related to the discount we purchased these securities at that we expect to receive in the future) is recognized through investment fair value changes.\nInvestment Fair Value Changes, Net\nThe following table presents the components of investment fair value changes for our Third-Party Residential Investments segment by investment type for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018, and 2017.\nTable 24 - Investment Fair Value Changes, Net from Third-Party Residential Investments\nTable 140: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Years Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(In Thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Investment Fair Value Changes, Net\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Changes in fair value of:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Trading securities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>37,488\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(8,599\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>29,328\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Servicer advance investments\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,001\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(701\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Excess MSRs\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>310\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,136\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Shared home appreciation options\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>842\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net investment in Freddie Mac SLST entities (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>27,206\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,271\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Risk management derivatives, net\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(24,185\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(975\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(633\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Impairments on AFS securities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(89\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1,011\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Investment Fair Value Changes, Net\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>44,662\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(6,957\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>27,684\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n (1) Includes changes in fair value of the loans held-for-investment and the ABS issued at the entities, which netted together represent the change in value of our investments (subordinate securities) at the consolidated VIEs.

Our portfolio of third-party AFS securities has decreased due to these sales and most of the new securities we purchase are accounted for under the fair value option. As such, we expect fewer realized gains from this portfolio in the future.\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses\nGeneral and administrative expenses in this segment are mostly comprised of personnel costs to manage this portfolio and have remained relatively consistent over the past two years.\nOther Expenses\nOther expenses in 2019 consisted of $1 million of income allocable to co-investors in our servicing advance investments.\nProvision for Income Taxes\nThe provision for income taxes is generally correlated to the amount of this segment's contribution before income taxes in relation to the TRS's overall GAAP income and associated tax provision. For 2019, while the TRS GAAP income earned at this segment increased from the prior year, the decrease in the tax provision primarily resulted from the decrease in our overall tax provision.\nInvestments\nThis section presents additional details on our investment assets and their activity during 2019 and 2018.\nResidential Loans Held-for-Investment at Redwood Portfolio\nThe following table provides the activity of residential loans held-for-investment at Redwood during the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018.\nTable 25 - Residential Loans Held-for-Investment at Redwood - Activity\nTable 142: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Years Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(In Thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Fair value at beginning of period\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,383,932\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,434,386\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Acquisitions\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>39,269\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Sales\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(9,421\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Transfers between portfolios (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>69,431\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>269,883\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Principal repayments\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(430,205\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(290,327\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Changes in fair value, net\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>58,891\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(30,010\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Fair Value at End of Period\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,111,897\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,383,932\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n (1) Represents the net transfers of loans into our Investment Portfolio segment from our Mortgage Banking segment and their reclassification from held-for-sale to held-for-investment.

At December 31, 2019, we had short-term debt incurred through repurchase facilities of $1.18 billion, which was secured by $1.49 billion of real estate securities (including securities owned in consolidated securitization entities). Our repo borrowings were made under facilities with 10 different counterparties, and the weighted average cost of funds for these facilities during 2019 was approximately 3.35%. Additionally, at December 31, 2019, real estate securities with a fair value of $39 million were financed with long-term FHLBC debt, and real estate securities with a fair value of $250 million (including securities owned in consolidated Sequoia Choice securitization entities), were financed with long-term, non-mark-to-market recourse repurchase debt through our subordinate securities financing facility. The remaining $471 million of our securities, including certain securities we own that were issued by consolidated securitization entities, were financed with capital.\nAt December 31, 2019, the credit performance on the securities we financed through repurchase facilities generally continued to perform in line with, or better than our expectations. In addition to the allocated capital listed in the table above that directly supports our repurchase facilities (the \"financing haircut\u201d), we continue to hold a designated amount of supplemental risk capital available for potential margin calls or future obligations relating to these borrowings.\nThe following table presents our real estate securities at December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018, categorized by portfolio vintage (the years the securities were issued), and by priority of cash flows (senior, mezzanine, and subordinate).

Portfolio\nOur MSRs are held and managed at our taxable REIT subsidiary and typically are acquired together with loans from originators and then separately recognized under GAAP when the MSR is retained and the associated loan is sold to a third party or transferred to a Sequoia residential securitization sponsored by us that meets the GAAP criteria for sale. Although we own the rights to service loans, we contract with sub-servicers to perform these activities.

At securitization, the weighted average FICO score of borrowers backing these loans was 600 and the weighted average LTV ratio of these loans was 73%. At December 31, 2019, 587 of these loans with an aggregate unpaid principal balance of $135 million were greater than 90 days delinquent and 208 of these loans with an aggregate unpaid principal balance of $33 million were in foreclosure. At December 31, 2018, 306 of these loans with an aggregate unpaid principal balance of $51 million were greater than 90 days delinquent and none of these loans were in foreclosure. Due to the credit profile of re-performing and non-performing loans, our investment in the subordinate securities issued by the Freddie Mac SLST entities was made based on an expectation of defaults and credit losses that will occur on the underlying pool of residential mortgage loans, which was reflected in our purchase price yield. At December 31, 2019, delinquencies and credit losses in the portfolio remained in line with our expectations.\nConsolidated Freddie Mac K-Series Entities\nBeginning in 2018, we invested in certain subordinate securities issued by Freddie Mac K-Series securitization entities and were required to consolidate these entities for financial reporting purposes in accordance with GAAP. Each of these entities is independent of Redwood and of each other and the assets and liabilities of these entities are not, respectively, owned by us or legal obligations of ours. We record the assets and liabilities of the consolidated Freddie Mac K-Series entities at fair value, based on the estimated fair value of the debt securities (ABS) issued from the securitizations, in accordance with GAAP provisions for collateralized financing entities. At December 31, 2019, our economic investment in the consolidated Freddie Mac K-Series entities had an estimated fair value of $253 million, and was comprised of subordinate securities.\nThe following tables present the statements of income for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018, and 2017 and the balance sheets of the consolidated Freddie Mac K-Series entities at December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018.

Taxable Income Distribution Requirement\nAs a REIT, we are required to distribute at least 90% of our taxable income, after the application of available federal net operating loss carryforwards (NOLs), to our shareholders. For 2019, our estimated REIT taxable income of $136 million exceeded our available NOLs by $98 million, and therefore our minimum dividend distribution requirement was $88 million.

In order to utilize these carryforwards, taxable income must exceed our dividend distributions. During 2019, we distributed $126 million to shareholders, which was less than our estimated taxable income of $136 million. We therefore expect to report REIT taxable income on our 2019 federal income tax return after the application of a dividends paid deduction. As a result, we expect $10 million of our federal NOLs at the REIT level to be utilized in 2019. Federal NOLs at the REIT level do not expire until 2029.\nThe Tax Act created a limitation on the annual usage of REIT NOLs to 80% of REIT taxable income, effective with respect to NOLs arising in taxable years beginning after December 31, 2017. We do not expect this to materially impact our REIT.\nOur TRS NOL carryforwards were acquired in the 5 Arches acquisition. They were generated after December 31, 2017 and therefore carry forward indefinitely. These NOLs are subject to the Separate Return Limitation Year (\"SRLY\") rules, which can limit the usage of the NOLs. However, we do not expect this to prevent us from utilizing these NOLs over time.\nTax Characteristics of Distributions to Shareholders\nFor the year ended December 31, 2019, we declared and distributed four regular quarterly dividends totaling $126 million ($1.20 per share). Under the federal income tax rules applicable to REITs, the taxable portion of any distribution to shareholders is determined by (i) taxable income of the REIT, exclusive of the dividends paid deduction and NOLs; and (ii) net capital gains recognized by the REIT, exclusive of capital loss carryforwards. The income or loss generated at our TRS does not directly affect the tax characterization of our dividends.\nOur 2019 dividend distributions are expected to be characterized for federal income tax purposes as 73% ordinary dividend income and 27% long-term capital gain dividend income. Under the federal income tax rules applicable to REITs, none of the 2019 dividend distributions are expected to be characterized as a return of capital or qualified dividends.\nBeginning in 2018, the Tax Act provides that individual taxpayers may generally deduct 20% of their ordinary REIT dividends from taxable income. This results in a maximum federal effective tax rate of 29.6% on an individual taxpayer's ordinary REIT dividends, compared to the highest marginal rate of 37%. This deduction does not apply to REIT dividends classified as qualified dividends or long-term capital gains dividends, as those dividends are taxed at a maximum rate of 20% for individuals.\nDifferences between Estimated Total Taxable Income and GAAP Income\nDifferences between estimated taxable income and GAAP income are largely due to the following: (i) we cannot establish loss reserves for future anticipated events for tax but we can for GAAP, as realized credit losses are expensed when incurred for tax and these losses can be anticipated through lower yields on assets or through loss provisions for GAAP; (ii) the timing, and possibly the amount, of some expenses (e.g., certain compensation expenses) are different for tax than for GAAP; (iii) since amortization and impairments differ for tax and GAAP, the tax and GAAP gains and losses on sales may differ, resulting in differences in realized gains on sale; (iv) at the REIT and certain TRS entities, unrealized gains and losses on market valuation adjustments of loans, securities and derivatives are not recognized for tax until the instrument is sold or extinguished; (v) for tax, basis may not be assigned to mortgage servicing rights retained when whole loans are sold resulting in lower tax gain on sale; (vi) for tax, we do not consolidate securitization entities as we do under GAAP; and, (vii) dividend distributions to our REIT from our TRS are included in REIT taxable income, but not GAAP income. As a result of these differences in accounting, our estimated taxable income can vary significantly from our GAAP income during certain reporting periods.\nFor tax years beginning after December 31, 2018, the Tax Act may require acceleration of discount accretion for federal income tax purposes for debt instruments with original issue discount. We have evaluated the effects of this change, and it did not have a material income tax effect for us.\nThe tax basis in assets and liabilities at the REIT was $6.35 billion and $4.68 billion, respectively, at December 31, 2019. The GAAP basis in assets and liabilities at the REIT was $16.22 billion and $14.52 billion, respectively, at December 31, 2019. The primary difference in both the tax and GAAP assets and liabilities is attributable to securitization entities that are consolidated for GAAP reporting purposes but not for tax purposes.\nThe tables below reconcile our estimated total taxable income to our GAAP income for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018, and 2017.\nTable 53 - Differences between Estimated Total Taxable Income and

Potential Taxable Income Volatility\nWe expect period-to-period volatility in our estimated taxable income. A description of the factors that can cause this volatility is provided below.\nRecognition of Gains and Losses on Sale\nSince the computation of amortization and impairments on assets may differ for tax and GAAP and many of our assets held for investment purposes are marked-to-market for GAAP, but not for tax, the tax and GAAP basis on assets sold or called may differ, resulting in differences in gains and losses on sale or call. In addition, capital losses in excess of capital gains are generally disallowed and carry forward to future tax years. Subsequent capital gains realized for tax may be offset by prior capital losses and, thus, not affect taxable income. At December 31, 2019, we had no capital loss carryforwards at the REIT or TRS level.\nPrepayments on Securities\nWe have retained certain IO securities since the time they were issued from Sequoia securitizations we sponsored and purchased additional third-party IO securities. Our tax basis in these securities was $159 million at December 31, 2019. The return on IOs is sensitive to prepayments and, to the extent prepayments vary period to period, income from these IOs will vary. Typically, fast prepayments reduce yields and slow prepayments increase yields. We are not permitted to recognize a negative yield under tax accounting rules, so during periods of fast prepayments our periodic premium expense for tax purposes can be relatively low and the tax cost basis for these securities may not be significantly reduced. Currently, our tax basis is above the fair values for these IOs in the aggregate. If a securitization is called, the remaining tax basis in the IO is expensed, creating an ordinary loss at the call date.\nPrepayments also affect the taxable income recognition on other securities we own. For tax purposes, we are required to use particular prepayment assumptions for the remaining lives of each security. As actual prepayment speeds vary, the yield we recognize for tax purposes will be adjusted accordingly. Thus, to the extent actual prepayments differ from our long-term assumptions or vary from period to period, the yield recognized will also vary and this difference could be material.\nCredit Losses on Securities and Loans\nTo determine estimated taxable income, we are generally not permitted to anticipate, or reserve for, credit losses on investments which are generally purchased at a discount. For tax purposes, we accrue the entire purchase discount on a security into taxable income over the expected life of the security. Estimated taxable income is reduced when actual credit losses occur. As we have no credit reserves or allowances for tax, any future credit losses on securities or loans will have a more significant impact on tax earnings than on GAAP earnings and may create significant taxable income volatility to the extent the level of credit losses fluctuates during reporting periods. Credit losses are based on our tax basis, which differs from our basis for GAAP purposes. We anticipate an additional $14 million of credit losses for tax on securities, based on our projection of principal balance losses and assuming a similar tax basis as we have recently experienced, although the timing of actual losses is difficult to accurately project.\nOur estimated total taxable income for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018, and 2017 included $1 million, $2 million, and $3 million, respectively, in realized credit losses on investments.\nCompensation Expense\nThe total tax expense for equity award compensation is dependent upon varying factors such as the timing of payments of dividend equivalent rights, the distribution of deferred stock units and performance stock units, and the cash deferrals to and withdrawals from our Executive Deferred Compensation Plan. For GAAP purposes, the total expense associated with an equity award is determined at the award date and is recognized over the vesting period. For tax, the total expense is recognized at the date of distribution or exercise, not the award date. In addition, some compensation may not be deductible for tax if it exceeds certain levels. An exception may apply to performance-based compensation that is paid pursuant to a written and binding contract in effect before November 2, 2017. Thus, the total amount of compensation expense, as well as the timing, could be significantly different for tax than for GAAP.\nAs an example, for GAAP we expense the grant date fair value of performance stock units (PSUs) granted over the vesting term of those PSUs (regardless of the degree to which the performance conditions for vesting are ultimately satisfied, if at all), whereas for tax the value of the PSUs that actually vest in accordance with the performance conditions of those awards and are subsequently distributed to the award recipient is recorded as an expense on the date of distribution. For example, if no PSUs under a particular grant ultimately vest, due to the failure to satisfy the performance conditions, no tax expense will be recorded for those PSUs, even though we would have already recorded expense for GAAP equal to the grant date fair value of the PSU awards. Conversely, for example, if performance is such that a number of shares of common stock equal to 200% of the PSU award ultimately vest and are delivered to the award recipient, expense for tax will equal the common stock value on the date of distribution of 200% of the number of PSUs originally granted. This expense for tax could significantly exceed the recorded expense for GAAP.\nIn addition, since the timing of distributions of deferred stock units, performance stock units, or cash out of the Executive Deferred Compensation Plan is based on employees' deferral elections, it can be difficult to project when the tax expense will occur.\nMortgage Servicing Rights\nFor GAAP purposes, we recognize MSRs through the direct acquisition of servicing rights from third parties or through the retention of MSRs associated with residential loans that we have acquired and subsequently sold to non-consolidated securitization entities or to third parties. For tax purposes, basis in our MSR assets is recognized through the direct acquisition of servicing rights from third parties, or to the extent that a retained MSR entitles us to receive a servicing fee in excess of so-called normal servicing (or the right to receive reasonable compensation for services to be performed under the mortgage serving contract). Tax basis in our normal MSR assets is not recognized when MSRs are retained from sales of loans to non-consolidated securitization entities or to third parties, thereby creating a favorable temporary GAAP to tax difference from sale of the loans. For the year ended December 31, 2019, we retained $1 million of MSRs from jumbo loan sales for which no tax basis was recognized. No other material tax basis in our MSR assets was recognized in 2019.\nFor GAAP purposes, mortgage servicing fee income, net of servicing expense, as well as changes in the estimated fair value of our MSRs, is recognized on our consolidated statements of income over the life of the MSR asset. For tax purposes, only mortgage servicing fee income, net of servicing expense is recognized as taxable income. Any MSR where basis is recognized for tax purposes through acquisition is amortized as a tax expense over a finite life.\nPeriodic changes in the market values of MSRs are recorded through the income statement for GAAP purposes, but not for tax purposes. Only when MSRs are sold will a tax gain or loss be recognized. As tax basis is not recognized for retained MSRs and the rules for writing-off tax basis of purchased MSRs are restrictive, the tax gain from the sale of MSRs can be substantial.\nLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\nSummary\nIn addition to the proceeds from equity and debt capital-raising transactions, our principal sources of cash consist of borrowings under mortgage loan warehouse facilities, securities repurchase agreements, payments of principal and interest we receive from our investment portfolios, and cash generated from our operating activities. Our most significant uses of cash are to purchase and originate mortgage loans for our mortgage banking operations, to fund investments in residential loans, to purchase investment securities and make other investments, to repay principal and interest on our warehouse facilities, repurchase agreements, and long-term debt, to make dividend payments on our capital stock, and to fund our operations.\nAt December 31, 2019, our total capital was $2.60 billion and included $1.83 billion of equity capital and $0.79 billion of convertible notes and long-term debt on our consolidated balance sheet, including $245 million of convertible debt due in 2023, $200 million of convertible debt due in 2024, $201 million of exchangeable debt due in 2025, and $140 million of trust-preferred securities due in 2037.\nAs of December 31, 2019, our cash and liquidity capital included $260 million of capital available for investment. While we believe our available capital, together with additional liquidity we believe we can source through continued portfolio optimization (including collateralized borrowings or assets sales), is sufficient to fund our operations and currently contemplated investment activities and to repay existing debt, we may raise equity or debt capital from time to time to acquire assets and make long-term investments to expand our investment portfolio, including funding large purchases of portfolios of residential, multifamily, or business purpose residential loans or securities, or other portfolio investments, for acquisitions (which could include acquisitions to expand our mortgage banking operating platforms), or for other purposes. To the extent we seek to raise additional capital, our approach will continue to be based on what we believe to be in the best interests of our shareholders.\nWe are subject to risks relating to our liquidity and capital resources, including risks relating to incurring debt under residential loan warehouse facilities, securities repurchase facilities, and other short- and long-term debt facilities and other risks relating to our use of derivatives. A further discussion of these risks is set forth below under the heading Risks Relating to Debt Incurred under Short- and Long-Term Borrowing Facilities\" and in Part I, Item 1A - Risk Factors of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nCash Flows and Liquidity for the Year Ended December 31, 2019\nCash flows from our mortgage banking activities and our investments can be volatile from quarter to quarter depending on many factors, including the timing and amount of loan and securities acquisitions and sales and repayments, the profitability of mortgage banking activities, as well as changes in interest rates, prepayments, and credit losses. Therefore, cash flows generated in the current period are not necessarily reflective of the long-term cash flows we will receive from these investments or activities.\nCash Flows from Operating Activities\nCash flows from operating activities were negative $1.17 billion in 2019. This amount includes the net cash utilized during the period from the purchase and sale of residential mortgage loans associated with our mortgage banking activities. Purchases of loans are financed to a large extent with short-term debt, for which changes in cash are included as a component of financing activities. Excluding cash flows from the purchase, sale, and principal payments of loans classified as held-for-sale, cash flows from operating activities were negative $76 million in 2019, positive $100 million in 2018, and positive $37 million in 2017. The variance in these amounts from 2019 to 2018 was largely attributable to cash outflows for the net settlements of derivatives and payment of margin on derivatives agreements, which totaled $175 million in 2019, compared to net cash inflows of $35 million in 2018.\nCash Flows from Investing Activities\nDuring 2019, our net cash provided by investing activities was $1.03 billion and primarily resulted from proceeds from principal payments on loans held-for-investment and sales of real estate securities. Although we generally intend to hold our investment securities as long-term investments, we may sell certain of these securities in order to manage our interest rate risk and liquidity needs, to meet other operating objectives, and to adapt to market conditions. We cannot predict the timing and impact of future sales of investment securities, if any.\nBecause many of our investment securities are financed through repurchase agreements, a significant portion of the proceeds from any sales or principal payments of our investment securities could be used to repay balances under these financing sources. Similarly, all or a significant portion of cash flows from principal payments of loans at consolidated securitization entities would generally be used to repay ABS issued by those entities.\nDuring 2019, we deployed capital into several new investments, including the acquisitions of 5 Arches and CoreVest, multifamily and re-performing residential loan securities, business purpose residential loans, shared home appreciation options, and a limited partnership to acquire light-renovation multifamily loans.\nAs presented in the \"Supplemental Noncash Information\" subsection of our consolidated statements of cash flows, during 2019, 2018, and 2017, we transferred residential loans between held-for-sale and held-for-investment classification, retained securities from Sequoia securitizations we sponsored, and consolidated certain multifamily and re-performing residential securitization trusts which represent significant non-cash transactions that were not included in cash flows from investing activities.\nCash Flows from Financing Activities\nDuring 2019, our net cash provided by financing activities was $225 million. This primarily resulted from proceeds of $1.40 billion from the issuance of asset-backed securities from our Sequoia Choice and CAFL securitizations, proceeds of $451 million from the issuance of common stock, and proceeds of $387 million from the issuance of exchangeable notes and borrowings under our subordinate securities financing facility. These cash inflows were partially offset by $1.12 billion of repayments of ABS issued, $741 million of net repayments of short-term debt, and the distribution of $129 million of dividends.\nIn February 2020, the Board of Directors declared a regular dividend of $0.32 per share for the first quarter of 2020, which is payable on March 30, 2020 to shareholders of record on March 16, 2020.\nIn accordance with the terms of our outstanding deferred stock units and restricted stock units, which are stock-based compensation awards, each time we declare and pay a dividend on our common stock, we are required to make a dividend equivalent payment in that same per share amount on each outstanding deferred stock unit and restricted stock unit.\nRepurchase Authorization\nIn February 2018, our Board of Directors approved an authorization for the repurchase of our common stock, increasing the total amount authorized for repurchases of common stock to $100 million, and also authorized the repurchase of outstanding debt securities, including convertible and exchangeable debt. This authorization increased the previous share repurchase authorization approved in February 2016 and has no expiration date. This repurchase authorization does not obligate us to acquire any specific number of shares or securities. Under this authorization, shares or securities may be repurchased in privately negotiated and/or open market transactions, including under plans complying with Rule 10b5-1 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. At December 31, 2019, $100 million of the current authorization remained available for the repurchase of shares of our common stock. Like other investments we may make, any repurchases of our common stock or debt securities under this authorization would reduce our available capital described above.\nLeverage\nOur debt-to-equity leverage ratio increased during 2019, as we increased the amount of borrowings we utilized to finance our investments, including through additional short-term and long-term borrowings. Additionally, our leverage ratio is impacted by the amount of loans we hold for sale at our mortgage banking businesses and our amount of undeployed capital available for investment. At December 31, 2019, we estimate we had approximately $260 million of capital available for investment. As this capital is deployed, our leverage ratio is expected to increase, all other factors being equal, as we generally make investments in loans, securities, and other assets with a combination of capital and borrowings secured by the assets we invest in. In general, higher leverage creates greater liquidity risk as the amount of our equity relative to borrowings decreases, including liquidity risks of the types described in Part I, Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K under the heading Risk Factors,\u201d and in Part II,", "item_7_text": "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nINTRODUCTION\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations ( MD&A\u201d) is intended to provide a reader of our financial statements with a narrative from the perspective of our management on our financial condition, results of operations, liquidity and certain other factors that may affect our future results.

References herein to Redwood,\u201d the company,\u201d we,\u201d us,\u201d and our\u201d include Redwood Trust, Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries, unless the context otherwise requires. The discussion in this MD&A contains forward-looking statements that involve substantial risks and uncertainties. Our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of various factors, such as those discussed in the Cautionary Statement in Part 1, Item 1, Business and in Part 1, Item 1A, Risk Factors of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nOVERVIEW\nOur Business\nRedwood Trust, Inc., together with its subsidiaries, is a specialty finance company focused on making credit-sensitive investments in single-family residential and multifamily mortgages and related assets and engaging in mortgage banking activities. Our goal is to provide attractive returns to shareholders through a stable and growing stream of earnings and dividends, as well as through capital appreciation. We operate our business in four segments: Residential Lending, Business Purpose Lending, Multifamily Investments, and Third-Party Residential Investments. Our segments are based on our organizational and management structure, which aligns with how our results are monitored and performance is assessed.\nOur primary sources of income are net interest income from our investments and non-interest income from our mortgage banking activities. Net interest income consists of the interest income we earn on investments less the interest expense we incur on borrowed funds and other liabilities. Income from mortgage banking activities is generated through the acquisition and origination of loans and their subsequent sale, securitization, or transfer to our investment portfolios.\nRedwood Trust, Inc. has elected to be taxed as a real estate investment trust ( REIT\u201d). We generally refer, collectively, to Redwood Trust, Inc. and those of its subsidiaries that are not subject to subsidiary-level corporate income tax as the REIT\u201d or our REIT.\u201d We generally refer to subsidiaries of Redwood Trust, Inc. that are subject to subsidiary-level corporate income tax as our operating subsidiaries\u201d or our taxable REIT subsidiaries\u201d or TRS.\u201d\nFor additional information on our business, refer to Part I, Item 1, Business of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nBusiness Update\nRedwood ended 2019 on a strong note, with solid earnings and sustained momentum across our business lines. Our earnings were $0.38 per share for the fourth quarter and we ended the year with earnings of $1.46 per share. Our earnings for the full year were comprised of a healthy balance of investment returns and income from mortgage banking operations, and we made $1.09 billion of investments through a combination of organic and acquisition activity that we believe will help us deliver increased returns to our shareholders in the coming quarters and years.\nWe recently announced a 6.7% increase to our regular quarterly dividend to shareholders to $0.32 per share for the first quarter of 2020. Our ability to raise our dividend despite the market volatility we experienced over the past year is significant and we believe that it demonstrates the stability of our business model and the diversity of our revenues.\nDuring 2019, we made significant progress on our strategic priorities. Enabled in part by two acquisitions, it was a historic year for our business that set a new foundation for our participation in several distinct areas of housing credit, and allowed our consolidated portfolio of investments to evolve to incorporate a diverse mix of residential, business purpose, and multifamily investments. We now operate out of four principal geographic locations across the United States, and our earnings power is supported by organically created investments and the associated platforms that produce them. Our risk-minded culture and our values, which emphasize passion, integrity, change, relationships, and results, underlie our methodical pursuit to become one of the nation's most innovative investors in housing credit. We continue to look ahead and our strategic priorities for 2020 are focused on capitalizing on regulatory changes and technological innovations to continue to advance our overall relevance to the housing market.\nWe recently reorganized our business to create a more scalable infrastructure. We believe this will allow us to better manage the evolving opportunities and risks facing our business and to create better visibility into the earnings power of our operating platforms and the investments they create. We now manage our business through four segments. Our new structure provides for centralized strategic decision-making that drives the activities of these segments. In turn, our businesses can operate end-to-end in their respective sectors while benefiting from corporate risk oversight and traditional shared services. Each of our segments currently operates at a slightly different stage of maturity, creating a mix of earnings generation and future prospects.\nReflecting on the macro environment in 2019, it was an unexpected, record year for residential mortgage refinance activity. The Federal Reserve kept interest rates low after three interest rate cuts in 2019 amid global trade tensions and signs of economic weakness. Inflation, meanwhile, remained low and the U.S. consumer balance sheet remained strong, in part driven by an increased propensity to save that is, in turn, putting downward pressure on benchmark interest rates. As we proceed further into 2020, interest rates on 30-year conforming mortgages have fallen once again. This continues to bolster refinance activity, which has increased loan origination volumes year-to-date in 2020. Low rates have also contributed to increased borrower spending power, something that should in theory increase home purchase demand among the cohort of the population that is now entering their prime home buying years.\nHowever, buying power is less impactful when there is limited housing stock. While the interest rate environment has contributed to consistent home price appreciation over the last decade, it also conceals trends that continue to garner our close attention. Most notably, the supply of quality, affordable homes in the United States badly trails new household formation. While this imbalance has greatly supported rising home prices, it has made access to desirable housing more challenging for many - especially low to moderate income families, many of whom are would-be first-time home buyers. An expedient solution being discussed in Washington, D.C. is to relax underwriting standards and make it easier to offer loans with lower down payments to borrowers with higher debt-to-income ratios. While we support expanding homeownership opportunities for all Americans who desire to own their own homes, lowering underwriting standards had significant consequences leading up to the 2008 financial crisis and beyond. Additionally, these solutions ignore the fundamental problem - not enough homes.\nAt Redwood, our approach to residential mortgage loan underwriting remains unchanged. We emphasize safe, well-structured loans that borrowers can reliably afford. But more importantly, we are advocating for solutions in our business lines that offer more high quality and accessible housing for consumers. For instance, our business purpose lending initiatives focus not only on stabilized rentals, but also bridge lending - where homes are renovated, upgraded, and brought up to current building codes before getting resold or rented to consumers. We are actively expanding our bridge loan lending business to include more robust construction/redevelopment opportunities, including market-leading financing programs for build-to-rent communities, urban infill development, and modular home development, among others. These strategies all complement our residential lending business.\nAs we look ahead into 2020, we are closely watching the U.S. housing finance regulator (Federal Housing Finance Agency), where its new director is focused on exiting Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac out of conservatorship, reducing their size and impact across the housing sector, and creating a level playing field for private capital to participate in a larger part of the market. We see this regulatory shift as a major opportunity for our residential lending business, and the catalyst for us to invest in our platform to support higher levels of growth. We are now applying recent technological innovations to reimagine our non-agency loan production and distribution workstream. We plan to transform our correspondent loan acquisition platform to be more component-based, allowing us to implement new technologies as they become available rather than through comprehensive systems that remain the standard in the industry. We are also working to automate the revalidation of underwriting data to significantly reduce the time it takes us to purchase non-agency loans from originators, allowing them to recycle capital faster and make more loans. At the moment, technology to assist loan sellers in originating conventional loans that can be seamlessly sold exists only in the Agency origination space. Our goal is to make it a reality in the private sector.\nWe also see compelling opportunities in our business-purpose lending segment. The business purpose lending platforms we acquired last year originated a total of $2.4 billion of loans in 2019. We also have an active SFR securitization platform which should support our goal to grow profitably and organically generate assets with attractive risk adjusted returns. We have begun the process of combining the 5 Arches and CoreVest platforms under a unified leadership structure, taking the best features from both businesses to position this segment for profitable future growth. Once fully integrated, our platform will possess a wide breadth of financing products and depth of expertise to deliver all-inclusive and customized solutions to residential real estate investors. A unified platform will also allow us to apply our technology advantage to a full suite of products and in the process remove redundant external costs in the day-to-day operation of the business. Importantly, we are still just beginning to understand how business-purpose lending can leverage the broader Redwood platform. For example, we have begun the process of offering single-family rental loan products to our residential loan sellers, secured the ability to pledge single-family rental loans on our FHLB borrowing facility, and lowered our cost of funds through both warehouse financing and securitization.\nOur multifamily initiative continues to grow and expand and is quickly emerging as a strategic and complementary aspect of our housing finance strategy. We now designate multifamily investing as a core business at Redwood, with over $475 million of capital invested since 2017. We originate small-balance multifamily loans (both term and bridge) in our business-purpose lending segment - an area of desired growth - however, capital deployment in traditional multifamily has been almost exclusively in programs offered by Freddie Mac. To date, we remain one of the only investors in newly issued Freddie Mac multifamily B-pieces (first loss credit risk) that is not also a multifamily operator. Given recent changes implemented by the FHFA, we are now exploring ways to expand how we provide liquidity to this rapidly growing market.\nWhile we anticipate most of our investing activities to originate from within our residential, business-purpose, and multifamily segments, we continue to dedicate meaningful resources to other third-party investment activities. For over a quarter century, our role as an active investor and liquidity provider has been highly relevant to the mortgage capital markets. This effort will operate in coordination with our other businesses and focus on third-party opportunities that we find attractive, including non-agency RMBS, agency CRT bonds, securities backed by re-performing loans, and other investments. Importantly, this segment also allows us to continue tracking the pertinent markets and manage our capital both opportunistically and for liquidity management purposes.\nOver the past two years we believe we have made meaningful progress in diversifying revenues, integrating resources, and positioning Redwood for growth in the years ahead. Our business segments now encompass production and earnings generation potential across a breadth of sectors and collaborate toward a unifying vision of being one of the market's most innovative mortgage investors.\n2019 Financial Overview\nThis section includes an overview of our 2019 financial results. A detailed discussion of our results of operations is presented in the next section of this MD&A. The following table presents selected financial highlights from 2019 and 2018.\nTable 1 - Key Earnings and Return Metrics\n\n (1) Economic return on book value is based on the periodic change in GAAP book value per common share plus dividends declared per common share during the period.  Our 2019 results benefited from the continued expansion of our businesses across the broader housing market, including our acquisitions of 5 Arches and CoreVest in the business purpose residential lending space, and further capital deployment into multifamily investments. Through these acquisitions, we established our business purpose loan origination capabilities, which helped drive higher mortgage banking income in 2019, and also deployed a significant amount of capital into attractive business purpose lending (\"BPL\") investments, which helped drive higher investment returns. Our results also benefited from a recovery in asset prices in the first quarter of 2019, after a significant decrease in value during the fourth quarter of 2018, which negatively impacted our 2018 results. Investment fair values also benefited in 2019 from spread tightening across many investment types, which also created opportunities to sell lower-yielding assets and realize gains. After rotating a significant amount of capital out of lower yielding assets (through sales) and redeploying that capital into higher yielding investments in business purpose, multifamily and reperforming loan assets, we expect our net interest income to grow and the pace and overall amount of securities sales and resulting gains to decrease in 2020, given current market conditions. Although REIT taxable income per share decreased in 2019, we earned a growing amount of more stable net interest income from investments at our REIT, which is an important contributor to supporting our dividend.\nTable 2 - Key Operational Metrics\n\nDuring 2019, we raised $451 million of equity capital, and replaced $201 million of exchangeable debt that matured with new exchangeable debt maturing in six years. We used the proceeds from these issuances along with proceeds from portfolio optimization to increase our capital deployment to $1.09 billion in 2019, which included approximately $530 million deployed into our two acquisitions (including associated financial assets) and the remainder into investment assets. As in the prior year, we continued to deploy a meaningful amount of our capital into business purpose residential loans, multifamily investments, and re-performing loan investments, expanding further into these areas of housing.\nOur residential mortgage banking business saw loan purchases decrease in 2019, impacted primarily by increased competition. However, we operated this business with lower capital in 2019, helping to improve its return on equity. Additionally, we saw acquisition volumes begin to increase late in the year and we expect purchase volumes to increase in 2020 given the current interest rate environment. In 2019, through our Sequoia platform, we completed five Select securitizations and three Choice securitizations, which were supplemented by an increasing proportion of whole loans sales.\nOur business purpose mortgage banking business, which began in earnest early in 2019 through our acquisition of 5 Arches, steadily grew origination volume throughout the year and saw a significant boost in the fourth quarter when we acquired CoreVest. With the origination capabilities of the combined platforms, we believe origination volume from this business can increase in 2020 as compared to 2019.\nBook Value per Share\nThe following table sets forth the changes in our book value per share for the year ended December 31, 2019.\nTable 3 - Changes in Book Value per Share\n\n (1) Primarily represents income earned on actual shares outstanding, as we include diluted earnings per common share as a line item within table.  Our GAAP book value per share increased $0.09 per share to $15.98 per share during 2019. This increase was driven primarily by earnings exceeding our dividend payments.\nUnrealized gains on our available-for-sale securities increased $0.04 per share during 2019. This decrease primarily resulted from $0.15 per share of previously unrealized net gains that were realized as income from the sale of securities, as well as $0.06 per share of discount accretion income recognized in earnings from the appreciation in the amortized cost basis of our available-for-sale securities. These decreases were offset by positive mark-to-market adjustments on available-for-sale securities primarily resulting from overall credit spread tightening on these investments during 2019.\nLower benchmark interest rates during 2019 resulted in a $0.17 per share decrease to book value from unrealized losses on the derivatives hedging a portion of our long-term debt. At December 31, 2019, the cumulative unrealized loss on these derivatives, which is included in our GAAP book value per share, was $0.45 per share. During 2019, we issued common stock for net proceeds that on a per share basis were lower than our book value per share and were, therefore, slightly dilutive to book value. Additionally, included in the change in book value per share for 2019 was an $0.08 per share decrease from the issuance of restricted common stock related to our acquisition of CoreVest.\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nConsolidated Results of Operations\nWithin this Results of Operations section, we provide commentary that compares results year-over-year for 2019, 2018, and 2017. Most tables include \"changes\" columns that show the amounts by which the year's results are greater or less than the results from the prior year. Unless otherwise specified, references in this section to increases or decreases in 2019 refer to the change in results from 2018 to 2019, and increases or decreases in 2018 refer to the change in results from 2017 to 2018.\nThe following table presents the components of our net income for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018, and 2017.\nTable 4 - Net Income\n\nNet Interest Income\nNet interest income increased in 2019, as higher net capital deployment towards multifamily, third party, and business purpose lending investments improved net interest income. This improvement was partially offset by a decrease in net interest income from residential loans held-for-sale at our residential lending segment, as the average balance of loans in inventory awaiting sale or securitization declined in 2019 as compared with 2018. Additionally, higher interest expense on long-term debt in 2019 from a higher average balance of convertible debt further offset the increase from net capital deployment.\nWe utilize hedges to manage interest rate risk in our investment portfolio and the net interest expense from these instruments is a component of our Investment fair value changes line item, which is discussed below. Net hedge interest expense associated with investment hedges increased in 2019 and on a combined basis, net interest income plus net interest expense on hedges increased by $5 million in 2019, compared to 2018.\nNet interest income in 2018 was consistent with 2017, as higher interest income from net capital deployment and higher average yields in 2018 was offset by higher interest expense on short-term floating rate debt facilities and FHLB borrowings from rising benchmark interest rates.\nAdditional detail on changes in net interest income is provided in the Net Interest Income\u201d section that follows.\nMortgage Banking Activities, Net\nIncome from mortgage banking activities, net includes results from both our residential and business purpose mortgage banking operations. The $28 million increase in 2019 was due to a $40 million increase from business purpose mortgage banking, partially offset by a $12 million decrease from residential mortgage banking. The increase from business purpose mortgage banking resulted from our acquisitions of 5 Arches and CoreVest in 2019 and the income generated from those operations. The decrease from residential mortgage banking was primarily due to lower gross margins on slightly higher loan purchase commitments in 2019, relative to 2018. The $6 million increase in 2018 was primarily due to an increase in residential loan purchase volume in 2018, relative to 2017, on similar gross margins.\nAdditional analysis of the changes in this line item is included in the Results of Operations by Segment\u201d section that follows.\nInvestment Fair Value Changes, Net\nInvestment fair value changes, net, is primarily comprised of the change in fair values of our investments accounted for under the fair value option and interest rate hedges associated with these investments.\nDuring 2019, the positive investment fair value changes primarily resulted from tightening credit spreads in several investment classes. During 2018, the negative investment fair value changes primarily resulted from widening credit spreads during the fourth quarter, which impacted both our residential securities and our residential loans held-for-investment.\nAdditional analysis of the changes in this line item is included in the Results of Operations by Segment\u201d section that follows.\nOther Income\nThe $6 million increase in Other income in 2019 primarily resulted from $4 million of business purpose loan administration fee income earned at 5 Arches, as well as a $2 million gain associated with the re-measurement of our initial minority investment and purchase option in 5 Arches upon its acquisition. This increase was partially offset by a decrease in income from our MSR investments as the notional balance of these investments continued to pay down. Details on the composition of Other income is included in Note 21 in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K\nRealized Gains, Net\nFor 2019, we realized gains of $24 million, primarily from the sale of $110 million of AFS securities and the call of a seasoned Sequoia securitization in the first quarter. For 2018, we realized gains of $27 million, primarily from the sale of $144 million of AFS securities. For 2017, we realized gains of $13 million, primarily from the sale of $90 million of AFS securities.\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses\nThe $36 million increase in general and administrative expenses in 2019 primarily resulted from $28 million of additional expenses from the operations of 5 Arches and CoreVest, which were acquired in March and October of 2019, respectively. The remainder of the increase was primarily due to $7 million in higher compensation expense at the Redwood parent entity (exclusive of 5 Arches and CoreVest), as well as higher systems, consulting, accounting, and legal costs, driven mostly by the acquisition-related expenses associated with 5 Arches and CoreVest. The higher compensation expense at the Redwood parent entity was primarily driven by higher variable compensation, commensurate with improved results in 2019, as well as a higher average employee count in 2019.\nThe increase in general and administrative expenses in 2018 primarily resulted from higher loan acquisition costs due to higher loan purchase volume in 2018, as well as higher expenses associated with implementing new investment initiatives, including higher personnel costs and legal fees. These increases were partially offset by lower variable compensation expense commensurate with a decline in net income in 2018.\nOther Expenses\nOther expenses in 2019 primarily consisted of amortization expense from intangible assets and contingent consideration we recorded in connection with acquisition activity during 2019.\nProvision for Income Taxes\nOur provision for income taxes is almost entirely related to activity at our taxable REIT subsidiaries, which primarily includes our mortgage banking activities, MSR investments, as well as certain other investment and hedging activities associated with these investments.\nThe decrease in the provision for income taxes for 2019 was driven primarily by lower GAAP income earned at our TRS. Additionally, the provision for 2019 included a $2 million tax benefit resulting from the purchase of 5 Arches.\nThe decrease in the provision for income taxes for 2018 resulted primarily from a lower corporate tax rate, and lower investment portfolio income at our TRS during the year. The increase in the provision for income taxes in 2017 resulted primarily from higher mortgage banking income in 2017, compared to 2016. This increase was offset by a tax benefit of $8 million from the reduction of our net federal deferred tax liabilities as a result of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (the \"Tax Act\") that was enacted in December 2017. For additional detail on income taxes, see the Tax Provision and Taxable Income\u201d section that follows.\nNet Interest Income\nThe following tables present the components of net interest income for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018, and 2017.\nTable 5 - Net Interest Income\n\n (1) Average balances for residential loans held-for-sale, residential loans held-for-investment, business purpose residential loans, multifamily loans held-for-investment, and trading securities are calculated based upon carrying values, which represent estimated fair values. Average balances for available-for-sale securities and debt are calculated based upon amortized historical cost, except for ABS issued, which is based upon fair value. \n (2) Interest income from residential loans held-for-investment (\"HFI\") at Redwood exclude loans HFI at consolidated Sequoia or Freddie Mac SLST entities. Interest income from residential loans - HFI at Legacy Sequoia and the interest expense from ABS issued - Legacy Sequoia represent activity from our consolidated Legacy Sequoia entities. Interest income from residential loans - HFI at Sequoia Choice and the interest expense from ABS issued - Sequoia Choice represent activity from our consolidated Sequoia Choice entities. Interest income from residential loans - HFI at Freddie Mac SLST and the interest expense from ABS issued - Freddie Mac SLST represent activity from our consolidated Freddie Mac SLST entities. \nThe following table details how net interest income changed on a consolidated basis as a result of changes in average investment balances ( volume\u201d) and changes in interest yields ( rate\u201d).\nTable 6 - Net Interest Income - Volume and Rate Changes\n\nThe following table presents the components of net interest income by segment for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018, and 2017.\nTable 7 - Net Interest Income by Segment\n\nAdditional details regarding the activities impacting net interest income at each segment are included in the Results of Operations by Segment\u201d section that follows.\nThe Corporate/Other line item in the table above primarily includes net interest income from consolidated Legacy Sequoia entities. The decreases in net interest income from Corporate/Other during 2019 and 2018 were primarily due to lower net interest income from consolidated Legacy Sequoia entities, as loans in these securitizations continued to pay down. Details regarding consolidated Legacy Sequoia entities are included in the \"Results of Consolidated Legacy Sequoia Entities\" section that follows.\nResults of Operations by Segment\nWe report on our business using four segments: Residential Lending, Business Purpose Lending, Multifamily Investments, and Third-Party Residential Investments. Our segments are based on our organizational and management structure, which aligns with how our results are monitored and performance is assessed. For additional information on our segments, refer to Note 24 in Part II, Item 8 and Part I, Item 1 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The following table presents the segment contribution from our four segments reconciled to our consolidated net income for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018, and 2017.\nTable 8 - Segment Results Summary\n\nThe following sections provide a detailed discussion of the results of operations at each of our four business segments for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018, and 2017.\nThe $11 million increase in net expense from Corporate/Other in 2019 primarily resulted from a $9 million increase in corporate general and administrative expenses, as well as $3 million of contingent consideration expense associated with our acquisition of 5 Arches, recorded in Other expenses. These increases were partially offset by a $2 million gain associated with the re-measurement of our initial minority investment and purchase option in 5 Arches. The increase in corporate general and administrative expenses in 2019 was primarily due to $7 million in higher compensation expense, driven mostly by higher variable compensation commensurate with improved results in 2019, as well as higher systems, consulting, accounting, and legal costs, driven mostly by the acquisitions of 5 Arches and CoreVest.\nThe $9 million improvement from Corporate/Other in 2018 primarily resulted from lower variable compensation expense commensurate with lower GAAP earnings, as well as higher earnings from our consolidated Legacy Sequoia entities in 2018. Details regarding consolidated Legacy Sequoia entities are included in the \"Results of Consolidated Legacy Sequoia Entities\" section that follows.\nResidential Lending Segment\nOur Residential Lending segment primarily consists of a mortgage loan conduit that acquires residential loans from third-party originators for subsequent sale, securitization, or transfer to our investment portfolio, as well as the investments we retain from these activities. We typically acquire prime, jumbo mortgages and the related mortgage servicing rights on a flow basis from our network of loan sellers and distribute those loans through our Sequoia private-label securitization program or to institutions that acquire pools of whole loans. Our investments in this segment primarily consist of residential mortgage-backed securities (\"RMBS\") retained from our Sequoia securitizations (some of which we consolidate for GAAP purposes), jumbo whole loans we retained and finance through our Federal Home Loan Bank of Chicago (\"FHLBC\") member subsidiary, as well as MSRs retained from jumbo whole loans we sold.\nThe following table presents the components of segment contribution for the Residential Lending segment for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018, and 2017.\nTable 9 - Residential Lending Segment Contribution\n\nThe following table provides the activity of residential loans held-for-sale at Redwood during the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018.\nTable 10 - Residential Loans Held-for-Sale - Activity\n\n (1) Represents the net transfers of loans from held-for-sale to held-for-investment within our Residential Lending investment portfolio. Includes $1.08 billion and $1.78 billion of Choice loans securitized during the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively, which were not treated as sales for GAAP purposes and continue to be reported on our consolidated balance sheets within this segment's investment portfolio. \nThe following table presents details of our Residential Lending investment portfolio at December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018.\nTable 11 - Residential Lending Investments \n (1) Excludes Sequoia Choice loans that we consolidate for GAAP purposes. \n (2) Represents our retained economic investment in the consolidated Sequoia Choice securitization entities. For GAAP purposes, we consolidated $2.29 billion of loans and $2.04 billion of ABS issued associated with these investments at December 31, 2019.  See the Investments and Consolidated VIEs sections that follow for additional details on these investments.\nOverview\nSegment contribution from our Residential Lending segment decreased during 2019, driven both by lower mortgage banking income and lower overall investment returns. Mortgage banking income decreased due to a lower average balance of loans carried during 2019, resulting in lower net interest income, as well as lower mortgage banking activities income resulting from lower profit margins due to increased competition. Although the overall income from these operations decreased, we ran these operations with less capital in 2019 than 2018, resulting in higher returns on allocated capital year-over-year. The decrease in income from investing activities was primarily due to a lower average balance of investments in this segment in 2019, as we shifted capital from this segment into other segments. For example, as jumbo residential loans that we had financed with FHLB debt paid off, we pledged single-family rental loans to collateralize an increasing portion of our FHLB debt. In addition, as mortgage rates decreased throughout much of the year, we experienced increased loan prepayment rates, which negatively impacted the fair value of our investments held at a premium (including our residential loans at Redwood and our interest only securities), which resulted in higher negative investment fair value changes in 2019.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2019, our residential mortgage loan conduit purchased $5.86 billion of predominately prime residential jumbo loans, securitized $1.92 billion of jumbo Select loans that were accounted for as sales, and sold $3.22 billion of jumbo loans to third parties. Additionally, we transferred $1.08 billion of jumbo Choice loans that did not qualify for sales accounting treatment under GAAP to Sequoia securitization entities and we had net transfers of $69 million of residential jumbo loans into our Residential Lending investment portfolio that were financed with borrowings from the FHLBC. Our pipeline of loans identified for purchase at December 31, 2019 included $1.83 billion of jumbo loans. At December 31, 2019, our residential mortgage loan conduit had 492 loan sellers, including 184 jumbo sellers and 308 sellers from various FHLB districts participating in the FHLB's MPF Direct program.\nWe utilize a combination of capital and our residential loan warehouse facilities to manage our inventory of residential loans held-for-sale. At December 31, 2019, we had $186 million of warehouse debt outstanding to fund our residential loans held-for-sale. Jumbo loan warehouse capacity at December 31, 2019 totaled $1.43 billion across four separate counterparties, which should continue to provide sufficient liquidity to fund our residential mortgage banking operations in the near-term.\nNet Interest Income\nNet interest income from our Residential Lending segment is primarily comprised of net interest income earned from our residential loans held for investment and financed with FHLB debt, net interest income from securities retained from our Sequoia securitizations, and net interest income from our inventory of residential loans held-for-sale prior to sale or securitization.\nNet interest income from residential lending investments decreased in 2019, due primarily to higher interest costs on our variable-rate long-term FHLB borrowings during 2019, from higher benchmark interest rates. Additionally, the average balance of our investment portfolio at this segment declined, as capital freed-up from sales and paydowns within this segment were redeployed in our business purpose lending and multifamily investments segments. Residential securities at Redwood decreased from the sale of lower-yielding Sequoia mezzanine securities, and residential securities at consolidated Sequoia Choice entities increased due to the retention of securities from Choice securitizations that were issued in 2019.\nThe $6 million decrease in 2018 in net interest income was primarily attributable to higher interest expense in 2018 related to our variable-rate borrowings on our residential lending investments, including from FHLB borrowings.\nWe use a combination of swaps and other derivatives to hedge our exposure to interest rates on our fixed-rate loan and securities investments and their associated variable-rate debt. The interest expense or benefit associated with these hedges is included in our Investment fair value changes, net line item on our financial statements. Including the impact of this hedge interest, our combined net interest income for residential lending investments was $60 million, $62 million, and $59 million in 2019, 2018, and 2017, respectively.\nMortgage Banking Activities, Net\nMortgage banking activities, net, includes the changes in market value of both the loans we hold for sale and commitments for loans we intend to purchase (collectively, our loan pipeline), as well as the effect of derivative instruments we utilize to manage risks associated with our loan pipeline. Our loan sale profit margins are measured over the period from when we commit to purchase a loan and subsequently sell or securitize the loan. Accordingly, these profit margins may encompass positive or negative market valuation adjustments on loans, hedging gains or losses associated with our loan pipeline, and any other related transaction expenses, and may be realized over the course of one or more quarters for financial reporting purposes.\nThe following table presents the components of residential mortgage banking activities, net. Amounts presented include both the changes in market values for loans that were sold and associated derivative positions that were settled during the periods presented, as well as changes in market values of loans and derivatives outstanding at the end of each period.\nTable 12 - Components of Residential Mortgage Banking Activities, Net\n\n (1) Includes changes in fair value for loan purchase and forward sale commitments. \n (2) Represents market valuation changes of derivatives that are used to manage risks associated with our accumulation of residential loans. \n (3) Amounts in this line include other fee income from loan acquisitions and the provision for repurchase expense, presented net.  The decrease in residential mortgage banking activities, net in 2019 was primarily due to lower gross margins on somewhat higher loan purchase commitments in 2019, compared to 2018. Gross margins were towards the higher end of our long-term expectations in 2019, though below our 2018 gross margins, which benefited from significant spread tightening on AAA securities experienced early in 2018. The spread tightening benefited both loan production and the high balance of loans in inventory at the end of 2017, which were subsequently sold in early 2018. The increase in mortgage banking activities, net in 2018 was primarily due to higher loan purchase commitments on similar gross margins in 2018 compared to 2017. We define gross margins as net interest income plus income from mortgage banking activities, divided by loan purchase commitments (\"LPCs\"). LPCs, adjusted for fallout expectations, were $7.01 billion, $6.44 billion, and $5.89 billion for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018, and 2017, respectively.\nAt December 31, 2019, we had a repurchase reserve of $4 million outstanding related to residential loans sold through this segment. For the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, we recorded $0.3 million of repurchase provisions and $0.3 million of reversals of provision for repurchases, respectively, that were included in income from mortgage banking activities, net, in this segment. We review our loan repurchase reserves each quarter and adjust them as necessary based on current information available at each reporting date.\nInvestment Fair Value Changes, Net\nThe following table presents the components of investment fair value changes for our Residential Lending segment by investment type for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018, and 2017.\nTable 13 - Investment Fair Value Changes, Net from Residential Lending\n\n (1) Includes changes in fair value of the loans held-for-investment and the ABS issued at the entities, which netted together represent the change in value of our investments (senior and subordinate securities) at the consolidated VIEs.  For 2019, the negative investment fair value changes primarily resulted from interest rate volatility, which increased prepayment rates on loans held-for-investments, IO securities, and other premium securities, adversely impacting valuations, net of associated hedges. This decline was partially offset by spread tightening on certain of our net investments in Sequoia Choice entities.\nFor 2018, the negative investment fair value changes primarily resulted from credit spread widening that occurred in the fourth quarter, impacting both our residential loans and residential trading securities.\nIncluded in the risk management derivatives component of investment fair value changes, net is net interest expense from derivative instruments used to hedge interest rate risk on our financed investments. Net hedge interest expense associated with investment hedges was income of $3 million in 2019, an expense of $0.5 million in 2018, and an expense of $12 million in 2017.\nOther Income\nOther income was primarily comprised of MSR income and income from our residential loan risk-sharing arrangements with Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. The $3 million decrease in Other income in 2019 was primarily due to a decrease in income from our MSR investments, as the notional balance of underlying loans continued to pay down.\nRealized Gains, Net\nRealized gains, net result from sales of available-for-sale securities within this segment. We generally sell securities when their yields fall below our return thresholds and we see opportunities to redeploy the capital into other investments with more attractive risk-adjusted returns. During the past three years, the majority of the securities we sold in this segment were mezzanine securities we retained from Sequoia Select securitizations that experienced significant credit spread tightening as the securitizations have paid-down and experienced minimal losses.\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses\nGeneral and administrative expenses for this segment primarily include costs associated with the underwriting, purchase and sale of residential loans, as well as costs associated with managing the segment's investment portfolio. General and administrative expenses decreased $1 million during 2019, primarily related to a decrease in loan acquisition costs associated with lower loan purchase volume in 2019 relative to 2018, as well as lower variable compensation expense commensurate with lower returns for this segment in 2019 relative to 2018. General and administrative expenses increased $4 million during 2018, primarily related to an increase in loan acquisition costs associated with the increase in loan purchase volume in 2018 relative to 2017, as well as higher compensation expense as we increased headcount in 2018 and paid higher variable compensation tied to higher earnings in 2018.\nProvision for Income Taxes\nThe provision for income taxes for this segment primarily result from its mortgage banking activities, which are performed at our taxable REIT subsidiary, and is generally correlated to the amount of this segment's contribution before income taxes in relation to the TRS's overall GAAP income and associated tax provision. For 2019, the decrease in the tax provision primarily resulted from decreased TRS GAAP earnings at this segment and, in 2018, the increase primarily resulted from increased TRS GAAP earnings at this segment. For additional detail on income taxes, see the \"Tax Provision and Taxable Income\" section that follows.\nBusiness Purpose Lending Segment\nOur Business Purpose Lending segment consists of a platform that originates and acquires business purpose residential loans for subsequent securitization or transfer into our investment portfolio, as well as the investments we retain from these activities. We typically originate single-family rental and residential bridge loans and distribute certain single-family loans through our CoreVest American Finance Lender (\"CAFL\") private-label securitization program and retain others for investment along with our residential bridge loans. Single-family rental loans are business purpose residential mortgage loans to investors in single-family (1-4 unit) rental properties. Residential bridge loans are business purpose residential mortgage loans to investors rehabilitating and reselling or renting residential properties. Our investments in this segment primarily consist of securities retained from CAFL securitizations (which we consolidate for GAAP purposes), residential bridge loans, and single-family rental loans we finance through our FHLBC member subsidiary.\nThe following table presents the components of segment contribution for the Business Purpose Lending segment for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018, and 2017.\nTable 14 - Business Purpose Lending Segment Contribution\n\nThe following table provides the business purpose residential loans origination activity at Redwood during the year ended December 31, 2019.\nTable 15 - Business Purpose Residential Loans - Origination Activity\n\n (1) Our residential bridge loans are generally originated at our TRS and the majority are transferred to our REIT and a smaller portion sold. Origination fees and any mark-to-market changes on these loans prior to transfer are recognized as mortgage banking income. The loans held at our REIT are classified as held-for-investment, with subsequent fair value changes recorded through Investment fair value changes, net on our consolidated statements of income. For the carrying value and activity of our residential bridge loans held-for-investment, see the Investments section that follows. \n (2) For single-family rental loans, amounts represent transfers of loans from held-for-sale to held-for-investment, including when loans are securitized (and consolidated for GAAP purposes) or transferred from our TRS to our REIT with the intent to hold for long-term investment. For residential bridge loans, represents the transfer of loans from our TRS to REIT as described in preceding footnote.  The following table presents details of our Business Purpose Lending Investments portfolio at December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018.\nTable 16 - Business Purpose Lending Investments \n (1) Excludes loans that we consolidate for GAAP purposes. \n (2) Represents our economic investment in securities issued by consolidated CAFL securitization entities. For GAAP purposes, we consolidated $2.19 billion of loans and $2.00 billion of ABS issued associated with these investments at December 31, 2019.  See the Investments and Consolidated VIEs sections that follow for additional details on these investments.\nOverview\nPrior to our acquisitions of CoreVest and 5 Arches in 2019, we did not have significant investments in business purpose residential loans and had only acquired a limited amount of business purpose residential loans from 5 Arches in 2018, while we held a minority investment in 5 Arches. Through our acquisition of 5 Arches in March of 2019, we began originating business purpose loans, of which the SFR loans were generally initially held in inventory for future securitization and the bridge loans were generally transferred into our BPL investment portfolio. Later in 2019, we transferred nearly all of the 5 Arches originated SFR loans into our BPL investment portfolio, where they were financed through our FHLB member subsidiary. In October of 2019, we acquired CoreVest and obtained its inventory of single-family rental loans held-for-sale, along with an investment portfolio comprised of bridge loans and retained securities from CAFL securitizations it had previously issued. In November 2019, we issued our first securitization under the CAFL program and retained certain subordinate securities (for GAAP purposes, CAFL securitizations are not treated as sales and we consolidate all CAFL securitization entities onto our balance sheet). In the future, we expect to securitize a portion of our SFR loan originations and transfer a portion into our BPL investment portfolio. In the near-term, we generally expect to transfer the majority of newly originated bridge loans into our BPL investment portfolio.\nResults from this segment in 2019 were driven by our BPL mortgage banking operations as well as from our BPL investment portfolio, which both increased meaningfully relative to 2018, due to the acquisitions of 5 Arches and CoreVest. Mortgage banking results for this segment also benefited from spread tightening in the fourth quarter of 2019, as we experienced strong execution on the first securitization we issued under the CAFL program.\nDuring the first two months of 2019, prior to our acquisition of 5 Arches on March 1, 2019, we purchased $19 million of single-family rental loans from 5 Arches. During the period from March 1, 2019 to December 31, 2019, we funded $514 million of single-family rental loans, of which $238 million were transferred to our investment portfolio and financed with FHLB borrowings, and the remaining loans were held-for-sale. During the period from March 1, 2019 to December 31, 2019, we funded $501 million of residential bridge loans, of which $56 million were sold to a third party and the remaining loans were transferred to our BPL investment portfolio.\nWe utilize a combination of capital and our business purpose loan warehouse facilities to manage our inventory of business purpose residential loans held-for-sale and our business purpose loan investments. Our business purpose residential loan warehouse capacity totaled $1.48 billion across six separate counterparties. In addition, at December 31, 2019, we finance a portion of the CAFL securities we own through a securities repurchase facility.\nNet Interest Income\nNet interest income from our Business Purpose Lending segment is primarily comprised of net interest income earned from our BPL investments, and to a lesser extent from our inventory of SFR loans held-for-sale from the time we originate or acquire the loans to when securitize them or transfer them to our investment portfolio.\nThe $16 million increase in net interest income in 2019 was primarily due to a higher average balance of BPL investments during 2019 relative to 2018, as we retained SFR and residential bridge loans from 5 Arches and CoreVest production during 2019 and also acquired the in-place portfolio of residential bridge loans and retained SFR securities from CoreVest during the fourth quarter of 2019. The increase was also driven by a higher average balance of loans held-for-sale during 2019 relative to 2018.\nMortgage Banking Activities, Net\nMortgage banking activities, net, includes loan origination fees and the changes in market value of both the loans we hold for sale and our interest rate lock commitments (collectively, our loan pipeline), as well as the derivative instruments we utilize to manage risks associated with our loan pipeline, from the time we lock a loan with a borrower to when we subsequently securitize the loan or transfer it to our BPL investment portfolio. Accordingly, these profit margins may encompass positive or negative market valuation adjustments on loans, hedging gains or losses associated with our loan pipeline, and any other related transaction expenses, and may be realized over the course of one or more quarters for financial reporting purposes.\nThe following table presents the components of business purpose mortgage banking activities, net. Amounts presented include both the changes in market values for loans that were sold and associated derivative positions that were settled during the periods presented, as well as changes in market values of loans and derivatives outstanding at the end of each period.\nTable 17 - Components of Business Purpose Mortgage Banking Activities, Net\n\n (1) Includes changes in fair value for interest rate lock commitments. \n (2) Represents market valuation changes of derivatives that are used to manage risks associated with our accumulation of loans. \n (3) Represents the change in fair market value from origination at our TRS to when the loan is sold or transferred to our REIT. \n (4) Amounts in this line primarily include loan origination fees.  Increasing origination volumes drove higher income from mortgage banking activities in both 2019 and 2018. Business purpose mortgage banking activities for 2019 included $30 million earned in the fourth quarter, driven both by new origination activity from CoreVest, increased origination activity from 5 Arches, as well as a benefit from spread-tightening on securitization execution for the SFR loans we acquired from CoreVest. We generally would not expect the same spread-tightening in subsequent quarters, dependent on market conditions.\nInvestment Fair Value Changes, Net\nThe following table presents the components of investment fair value changes for our Business Purpose Lending segment by investment type for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018, and 2017.\nTable 18 - Investment Fair Value Changes, Net from Business Purpose Lending\n\n (1) Includes changes in fair value of the loans held-for-investment and the ABS issued at the entities, which netted together represent the change in value of our economic investments (senior and subordinate securities) in securities at the consolidated VIEs.  Residential bridge loans are carried at fair value and generally transferred to our REIT at a premium, which diminishes as the loans mature and ultimately repay, resulting in negative fair value changes over the life of the loans. The change in fair value for our net investments in CAFL entities represents the change in fair value of the underlying securities we own in these consolidated entities and was negative in 2019, primarily due to the receipt of expected cash flows on IO securities we own. During 2019, we recorded $1 million of negative fair value changes related to residential business purpose loans we foreclosed on and carried as REO.\nOther Income\nOther income at this segment is primarily comprised of fee income earned from the administration of loans for a third-party legacy fund, which is winding down.\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses\nGeneral and administrative expenses for this segment include costs associated with the origination, purchase and securitization of business purpose residential loans, as well as the management of our BPL investment portfolio. General and administrative expenses increased during 2019 due to the acquisitions of 5 Arches and CoreVest. We expect these expenses to increase in 2020 as we incur a full year of expenses for these operations.\nOther Expenses\nOther expenses for this segment includes amortization expense from intangible assets we recorded in connection with the acquisitions of 5 Arches and CoreVest for the periods we owned each company during 2019.\nProvision for Income Taxes\nThe provision for income taxes for this segment primarily result from its mortgage banking activities, which are performed at our taxable REIT subsidiary, and is generally correlated to the amount of this segment's contribution before income taxes in relation to the TRS's overall GAAP income and associated tax provision. For 2019, the increase in the tax provision primarily resulted from increased TRS GAAP earnings at this segment. For additional detail on income taxes, see the \"Tax Provision and Taxable Income\" section that follows.\nMultifamily Investments Segment\nOur Multifamily Investments segment consists of investments in securities collateralized by multifamily mortgage loans, as well as other investments in multifamily mortgages and related assets. The securities in this segment are primarily comprised of investments in Freddie Mac K-Series securitizations.\nThe following table presents the components of segment contribution for the Multifamily Investments segment for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018, and 2017.\nTable 19 - Multifamily Investments Segment Contribution\n\nThe following table presents details of the investments in our Multifamily Investments segment at December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018.\nTable 20 - Multifamily Investments \n (1) Represents our economic investment in securities issued by consolidated Freddie Mac K-Series securitization entities. For GAAP purposes, we consolidated $4.41 billion of loans and $4.16 billion of ABS issued associated with these investments at December 31, 2019.  See the Investments and Consolidated VIEs sections that follow for additional details on these investments.\nOverview\nSegment contribution from Multifamily Investments increased in 2019, primarily as a result of positive market valuation changes driven by tightening credit spreads, as well as higher net interest income from a higher average balance of investments.\nBeginning in 2018, we began investing in subordinate securities issued from Freddie Mac sponsored K-Series multifamily securitizations. Due to certain rights given to the subordinate securities, we consolidate these securitizations for GAAP purposes and we consolidated three such securitizations in 2018 and two in 2019 as result of securities we purchased in those years. We also invest in mezzanine securities issued by Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae, which represent securities subordinate to senior securities, but senior to the most subordinate bonds in a securitization. While we continued to invest in new mezzanine multifamily securities during 2019, on a net basis we reduced our investment in these assets, as we sold several seasoned securities that had appreciated in price (contributing to higher investment fair value changes in 2019) and had lower current returns. We account for most of the securities in this segment under the fair value option and gains are reflected in investment fair value changes rather than realized gains.\nIn addition to our multifamily securities investments, our other investments are primarily comprised of an investment in a limited partnership created to acquire multifamily loans from Freddie Mac, and investments in multifamily excess MSRs.\nNet Interest Income\nThe increases in 2019 and 2018 in net interest income from multifamily investments were primarily driven by a higher average balance of investments in each sequential year, as we increased our investments in Freddie Mac K-Series subordinate securities in both years.\nInvestment Fair Value Changes, Net\nThe following table presents the components of investment fair value changes for our Multifamily segment by investment type for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018, and 2017.\nTable 21 - Investment Fair Value Changes, Net from Multifamily Investments\n\n (1) Includes changes in fair value of the loans held-for-investment and the ABS issued at the entities, which netted together represent the change in value of our investments (subordinate securities) at the consolidated VIEs.  The net positive investment fair value changes for 2019 were primarily driven by tightening credit spreads in our mezzanine securities as well as the subordinate securities we own in the consolidated Freddie Mac K-Series entities. The mezzanine trading securities saw price appreciation from both tightening credit spreads and lower benchmark interest rates in 2019. Nearly all of our risk management derivatives at this segment are used to manage interest rate risk on our mezzanine securities, and in 2019 they decreased in value as a result of declining benchmark interest rates. Our excess MSRs saw negative fair value changes in 2019 primarily related to the receipt of expected cash flows.\nOther Income\nOther income in this segment includes income from our investment in a multifamily loan fund, which we entered into in January 2019.\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses\nGeneral and administrative expenses increased over the last two years as we hired additional personnel to manage our growing investment portfolio.\nProvision for Income Taxes\nThe provision for income taxes is generally correlated to the amount of this segment's contribution before income taxes in relation to the TRS's overall GAAP income and associated tax provision. For 2019, the TRS GAAP income earned at this segment was consistent with the prior year.\nThird-Party Residential Investments Segment\nOur Third-Party Residential Investments segment consists of investments in RMBS issued by third parties, investments in Freddie Mac SLST securitizations (which we consolidate for GAAP purposes), our servicer advance investments, and other residential credit investments not generated through our Residential Lending segment.\nThe following table presents the components of segment contribution for the Third-Party Residential Investments segment for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018, and 2017.\nTable 22 - Third-Party Residential Investments Segment Contribution\n\nThe following table presents details of the investments in our Third-Party Residential Investments segment at December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018.\nTable 23 - Third-Party Residential Investments \n (1) Represents our economic investment in securities issued by consolidated Freddie Mac SLST securitization entities. For GAAP purposes, we consolidated $2.37 billion of loans and $1.92 billion of ABS issued associated with these investments at December 31, 2019.  See the Investments and Consolidated VIEs sections that follows for additional details on these investments.\nOverview\nSegment contribution from Third-Party Residential Investments increased during 2019, primarily due to positive investment fair value changes on our investments resulting from tightening credit spreads across much of this portfolio. This increase was partially offset by lower net interest income in 2019 resulting from lower discount accretion on available-for-sale securities, and lower realized gains as we sold fewer AFS securities in 2019.\nNet Interest Income\nNet interest income from our third-party residential investments decreased $7 million in 2019, primarily due to lower discount accretion from legacy available-for-sale securities, resulting from lower average balances of these investments during 2019. This decline was partially offset by an increase in net interest income from additional investments made in Freddie Mac SLST securities during 2019. Our net investments in these entities (i.e., the securities issued by these entities that we own) are accounted for under the fair value method and a portion of their economic return (related to the discount we purchased these securities at that we expect to receive in the future) is recognized through investment fair value changes.\nInvestment Fair Value Changes, Net\nThe following table presents the components of investment fair value changes for our Third-Party Residential Investments segment by investment type for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018, and 2017.\nTable 24 - Investment Fair Value Changes, Net from Third-Party Residential Investments\n\n (1) Includes changes in fair value of the loans held-for-investment and the ABS issued at the entities, which netted together represent the change in value of our investments (subordinate securities) at the consolidated VIEs.  The net positive investment fair value changes for 2019 were primarily driven by tightening credit spreads in our trading securities as well as the subordinate securities we own in the consolidated Freddie Mac SLST entities. The trading securities saw price appreciation from both tightening credit spreads and lower benchmark interest rates in 2019. Nearly all of our risk management derivatives at this segment are used to manage interest rate risk on our trading securities, and in 2019 they decreased in value as a result of declining benchmark interest rates.\nThe net negative investment fair value changes for 2018 were primarily driven by widening credit spreads in the fourth quarter of 2018.\nRealized Gains, Net\nRealized gains in this segment resulted from the sale of third-party AFS securities. Our portfolio of third-party AFS securities has decreased due to these sales and most of the new securities we purchase are accounted for under the fair value option. As such, we expect fewer realized gains from this portfolio in the future.\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses\nGeneral and administrative expenses in this segment are mostly comprised of personnel costs to manage this portfolio and have remained relatively consistent over the past two years.\nOther Expenses\nOther expenses in 2019 consisted of $1 million of income allocable to co-investors in our servicing advance investments.\nProvision for Income Taxes\nThe provision for income taxes is generally correlated to the amount of this segment's contribution before income taxes in relation to the TRS's overall GAAP income and associated tax provision. For 2019, while the TRS GAAP income earned at this segment increased from the prior year, the decrease in the tax provision primarily resulted from the decrease in our overall tax provision.\nInvestments\nThis section presents additional details on our investment assets and their activity during 2019 and 2018.\nResidential Loans Held-for-Investment at Redwood Portfolio\nThe following table provides the activity of residential loans held-for-investment at Redwood during the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018.\nTable 25 - Residential Loans Held-for-Investment at Redwood - Activity\n\n (1) Represents the net transfers of loans into our Investment Portfolio segment from our Mortgage Banking segment and their reclassification from held-for-sale to held-for-investment.  The following table presents the unpaid principal balances and weighted average coupons for residential real estate loans held-for-investment at fair value by product type at December 31, 2019.\nTable 26 - Characteristics of Residential Real Estate Loans Held-for-Investment at Redwood\n\nThe outstanding residential loans held-for-investment at Redwood at December 31, 2019 were prime-quality, first-lien loans, of which 96% were originated between 2013 and 2019 and 4% were originated in 2012 and prior years. The weighted average FICO score of borrowers backing these loans was 768 (at origination) and the weighted average loan-to-value (\"LTV\") ratio was 66% (at origination). At December 31, 2019, two of these loans with an aggregate fair value of $1 million and an unpaid principal balance of $2 million were greater than 90 days delinquent and none of these loans were in foreclosure.\nAt December 31, 2019, $2.10 billion of residential loans were held by our FHLB-member subsidiary and financed with $1.78 billion of borrowings from the FHLBC. At December 31, 2019, the weighted average maturity of these FHLB borrowings was approximately six years and they had a weighted average cost of 1.88% per annum. While the interest costs on these borrowings is variable and resets every 13 weeks, we utilize various interest rate derivative instruments to hedge our interest rate risk in this portfolio.\nUnder a final rule published by the Federal Housing Finance Agency in January 2016, our FHLB-member subsidiary will remain an FHLB-member through the five-year transition period for captive insurance companies. Our FHLB-member subsidiary's existing $2.00 billion of FHLB debt, which matures beyond this transition period, is permitted to remain outstanding until its stated maturity. As residential loans pledged as collateral for this debt pay down, we are permitted to pledge additional loans or other eligible assets to collateralize this debt; however, we do not expect to be able to increase our subsidiary's FHLB debt above the existing $2.00 billion.\nBusiness Purpose Residential Loans Portfolio\nSingle-Family Rental Loans Held-for-Investment at Redwood\nThe following table provides the activity of single-family rental loans held-for-investment at Redwood during the year ended December 31, 2019.\nTable 27 -Single-Family Rental Loans Held-for-Investment at Redwood - Activity\n\nThe outstanding single-family rental loans held-for-investment at Redwood at December 31, 2019 were first-lien, fixed-rate loans with original maturities of five, seven, or ten years. At December 31, 2019, the weighted average coupon of our single-family rental loans was 4.89% and the weighted average remaining loan term was seven years. At origination, the weighted average LTV ratio of these loans was 68% and the weighted average DSCR was 1.36 times. At December 31, 2019, none of these loans were greater than 90 days delinquent or in foreclosure.\nAt December 31, 2019, $211 million of single-family rental loans were held by our FHLB-member subsidiary and financed with $185 million of borrowings from the FHLBC. At December 31, 2019, the weighted average maturity of these FHLB borrowings was approximately six years and they had a weighted average cost of 1.88% per annum.\nResidential Bridge Loans Held-for-Investment at Redwood\nThe following table provides the activity of residential bridge loans held-for-investment at Redwood during the year ended December 31, 2019.\nTable 28 - Residential Bridge Loans Held-for-Investment at Redwood - Activity\n\n (1) All of our residential bridge loans are originated at our TRS then transferred to our REIT. Origination fees and any mark-to-market changes on these loans prior to transfer are recognized as mortgage banking income. Once the loans are transferred to our REIT, they are classified as held-for-investment, with subsequent fair value changes recorded through Investment fair value changes, net on our consolidated statements of income.  Our $745 million of residential bridge loans held-for-investment at December 31, 2019 were comprised of first-lien, fixed-rate, interest-only loans with a weighted average coupon of 8.11% and original maturities of six to 24 months. At origination, the weighted average FICO score of borrowers backing these loans was 732 and the weighted average LTV ratio of these loans was 70%. At December 31, 2019, of the 2,653 loans in this portfolio, 31 loans with an aggregate fair value of $12 million and an unpaid principal balance of $14 million were in foreclosure, of which 15 of these loans with an aggregate fair value of $7 million and an unpaid principal balance of $9 million were greater than 90 days delinquent.\nTo finance our residential bridge loans, we had eight business purpose residential loan warehouse facilities with a total uncommitted borrowing limit of $1.48 billion at December 31, 2019. The weighted average cost of the borrowings outstanding under these facilities during 2019 was 5.09%.\nReal Estate Securities Portfolio\nThe following table sets forth our real estate securities activity by collateral type for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018.\nTable 29 - Real Estate Securities Activity by Collateral Type\n\n\n (1) Represents the derecognition of mezzanine securities we owned in Freddie Mac K-Series securitizations when we began to consolidate the securitizations upon the acquisition of subordinate interests in these entities. \n (2) The effect of principal payments reflects the change in fair value due to principal payments, which is calculated as the cash principal received on a given security during the period multiplied by the prior quarter ending price or acquisition price for that security. \n (3) At December 31, 2019, excludes $254 million and $191 million of securities retained from our consolidated Sequoia Choice and CAFL securitizations, respectively, as well as $449 million and $252 million of securities we owned that were issued by consolidated Freddie Mac SLST and Freddie Mac K-Series securitizations, respectively. For additional details on our Choice, CAFL, Freddie Mac SLST and multifamily loans, see the subsections titled \"Consolidated Sequoia Choice Entities,\" \"Consolidated CAFL Entities,\" \"Consolidated Freddie Mac SLST Entities,\" and \"Consolidated Freddie Mac K-Series Entities\" that follow.  During the year ended December 31, 2019, we sold $707 million of mostly lower-yielding securities as part of our ongoing portfolio optimization activities.\nAt December 31, 2019, our securities consisted of fixed-rate assets (86%), adjustable-rate assets (9%), hybrid assets that reset within the next year (4%), and hybrid assets that reset between 12 and 36 months (1%). For the portions of our securities portfolio that are sensitive to changes in interest rates, we seek to minimize this interest rate risk by using various derivative instruments.\nWe directly finance our holdings of real estate securities with a combination of capital and collateralized debt in the form of repurchase (or repo\u201d) financing. The following table presents the fair value of our residential securities that were financed with repurchase debt at December 31, 2019.\nTable 30 - Real Estate Securities Financed with Repurchase Debt \n (1) Amounts represent carrying value of securities, which are held at GAAP fair value. \n (2) GAAP fair value per $100 of principal. Weighted average price excludes IO securities. \n (3) Allocated capital divided by GAAP fair value. \n (4) Includes $111 million of securities we owned that were issued by consolidated Sequoia Choice securitizations, which we consolidate in accordance with GAAP. \n (5) Includes $382 million of securities we owned that were issued by consolidated Freddie Mac SLST securitizations, which we consolidate in accordance with GAAP. \n (6) Includes $252 million of securities we owned that were issued by consolidated Freddie Mac K-Series securitizations, which we consolidate in accordance with GAAP. \n (7) Includes $128 million of securities we owned that were issued by consolidated CAFL securitizations, which we consolidate in accordance with GAAP.  At December 31, 2019, we had short-term debt incurred through repurchase facilities of $1.18 billion, which was secured by $1.49 billion of real estate securities (including securities owned in consolidated securitization entities). Our repo borrowings were made under facilities with 10 different counterparties, and the weighted average cost of funds for these facilities during 2019 was approximately 3.35%. Additionally, at December 31, 2019, real estate securities with a fair value of $39 million were financed with long-term FHLBC debt, and real estate securities with a fair value of $250 million (including securities owned in consolidated Sequoia Choice securitization entities), were financed with long-term, non-mark-to-market recourse repurchase debt through our subordinate securities financing facility. The remaining $471 million of our securities, including certain securities we own that were issued by consolidated securitization entities, were financed with capital.\nAt December 31, 2019, the credit performance on the securities we financed through repurchase facilities generally continued to perform in line with, or better than our expectations. In addition to the allocated capital listed in the table above that directly supports our repurchase facilities (the \"financing haircut\u201d), we continue to hold a designated amount of supplemental risk capital available for potential margin calls or future obligations relating to these borrowings.\nThe following table presents our real estate securities at December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018, categorized by portfolio vintage (the years the securities were issued), and by priority of cash flows (senior, mezzanine, and subordinate). We have additionally separated securities issued through our Sequoia platform or by third parties, including the Agencies.\nTable 31 - Real Estate Securities by Vintage and Type\n\n\n (1) At December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018, senior Sequoia and third-party securities included $64 million and $82 million of IO securities, respectively. At December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018, subordinate third-party securities included $6 million and $12 million of IO securities, respectively. Our interest-only securities included $36 million and $43 million of A-IO-S securities at December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018, respectively, that we retained from certain of our Sequoia securitizations. These securities represent certificated servicing strips and therefore may be negatively impacted by the operating and funding costs related to servicing the associated securitized mortgage loans. \n (2) Mezzanine includes securities initially rated AA through BBB- and issued in 2012 or later. \n (3) At December 31, 2019, excluded $254 million, $449 million, $252 million, and $191 million of securities we owned that were issued by consolidated Sequoia Choice, Freddie Mac SLST, Freddie Mac K-Series, and CAFL securitizations, respectively. At December 31, 2018, excluded $194 million, $229 million, and $126 million of securities we owned that were issued by consolidated Sequoia Choice, Freddie Mac SLST, and Freddie Mac K-Series securitizations, respectively. For GAAP purposes we consolidated $11.26 billion of loans and $10.11 billion of non-recourse ABS debt associated with these retained securities. \nThe following tables present the components of the interest income we earned on AFS securities for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018, and 2017.\nTable 32 - Interest Income - AFS Securities \n\n\nMortgage Servicing Rights Portfolio\nOur MSRs are held and managed at our taxable REIT subsidiary and typically are acquired together with loans from originators and then separately recognized under GAAP when the MSR is retained and the associated loan is sold to a third party or transferred to a Sequoia residential securitization sponsored by us that meets the GAAP criteria for sale. Although we own the rights to service loans, we contract with sub-servicers to perform these activities. Our receipt of MSR income is not subject to any covenants other than customary performance obligations associated with servicing residential loans. If a sub-servicer we contract with was to fail to perform these obligations, our servicing rights could be terminated and we would evaluate our MSR asset for impairment at that time.\nThe following table provides the activity for MSRs for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018.\nTable 33 - MSR Activity\n\nThe following table presents characteristics of our MSR investments and their associated loans at December 31, 2019.\nTable 34 - Characteristics of MSR Investments Portfolio \n (1) Gross cash yield is calculated by dividing the gross servicing fees we received for the year ended December 31, 2019, by the weighted average notional balance of loans associated with MSRs we owned during the year.  At December 31, 2019, nearly all of our MSRs were comprised of base MSRs and within this portfolio we did not own any portion of a servicing right related to any loan where we did not own the entire servicing right. At December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018, we had $0.4 million and $1 million, respectively, of servicer advances outstanding related to our MSRs, which are presented in Other assets on our consolidated balance sheets.\nServicing Investments\nIn 2018, we invested in servicer advances and excess MSRs associated with legacy RMBS (See Note 10 in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K). At December 31, 2019, our servicer advance investments and excess MSRs associated with this investment had a carrying value of $169 million and $16 million, respectively. The following table presents characteristics of the residential mortgage loans underlying these investments at December 31, 2019.\nTable 35 - Characteristics of Servicing Investments \n (1) Includes unpaid principal balance of $467 million, or 6% of total portfolio, of loans in foreclosure or transferred to REO. \nConsolidated VIEs\nConsolidated Legacy Sequoia Entities\nWe sponsored Sequoia securitization entities prior to 2012 that are reported on our consolidated balance sheets for financial reporting purposes in accordance with GAAP. Each of these entities is independent of Redwood and of each other and the assets and liabilities of these entities are not, respectively, owned by us or legal obligations of ours. We record the assets and liabilities of the consolidated Legacy Sequoia entities at fair value, based on the estimated fair value of the debt securities (ABS) issued from the securitizations in accordance with GAAP provisions for collateralized financing entities. At December 31, 2019, the estimated fair value of our investments in the consolidated Legacy Sequoia entities was $6 million.\nThe following tables present the statements of income (loss) for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018, and 2017 and the balance sheets of the consolidated Legacy Sequoia entities at December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018. All amounts in the statements of income and balance sheets presented below are included in our consolidated financial statements and within the corporate/other section of our segment financial statements.\nTable 36 - Consolidated Legacy Sequoia Entities Statements of Income (Loss) \nTable 37 - Consolidated Legacy Sequoia Entities Balance Sheets \nNet Interest Income at Consolidated Legacy Sequoia Entities\nThe decreases in net interest income in 2019 and 2018 were primarily attributable to the continued paydown of loans at the consolidated entities.\nInvestment Fair Value Changes, net at Consolidated Legacy Sequoia Entities\nInvestment fair value changes, net at consolidated Legacy Sequoia entities includes the change in fair value of the residential loans held-for-investment, REO, and the ABS issued at the entities, which netted together represent the change in value of our retained investments in the consolidated Legacy Sequoia entities. The negative investment fair value changes in each of the years presented was primarily related to a decline in fair value on retained IO securities, as the basis of these assets continues to diminish.\nResidential Loans at Consolidated Legacy Sequoia Entities\nThe following table provides details of residential loan activity at consolidated Legacy Sequoia entities for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018.\nTable 38 - Residential Loans at Consolidated Legacy Sequoia Entities - Activity\n\nFirst lien adjustable rate mortgage (\"ARM\") and hybrid loans comprise all of the loans in the consolidated Legacy Sequoia entities and were primarily originated in 2006 or prior. For outstanding loans at consolidated Legacy Sequoia entities at December 31, 2019, the weighted average FICO score of borrowers backing these loans was 727 (at origination) and the weighted average original LTV ratio was 65% (at origination). At December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018, the unpaid principal balance of loans at consolidated Legacy Sequoia entities delinquent greater than 90 days was $10 million and $14 million, respectively, of which the unpaid principal balance of loans in foreclosure was $4 million and $5 million, respectively.\nConsolidated Sequoia Choice Entities\nAs of December 31, 2019, we had issued nine securitizations primarily comprised of expanded-prime Choice loans that we consolidate for financial reporting purposes in accordance with GAAP. These entities are independent of Redwood and the assets and liabilities of these entities are not, respectively, owned by us or legal obligations of ours. We record the assets and liabilities of the consolidated Sequoia Choice entities at fair value, based on the estimated fair value of the debt securities (ABS) issued from the securitizations, in accordance with GAAP provisions for collateralized financing entities. At December 31, 2019, our economic investment in the consolidated Sequoia Choice entities had an estimated fair value of $256 million. The securities retained from our consolidated Sequoia Choice entities included senior and subordinate securities of $13 million and $241 million, respectively, at December 31, 2019.\nThe following tables present the statements of income for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018, and 2017 and the balance sheets of the consolidated Sequoia Choice entities at December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018. All amounts in the statements of income and balance sheets presented below are included in our consolidated financial statements and are included in our Residential Lending segment.\nTable 39 - Consolidated Sequoia Choice Entities Statements of Income \nTable 40 - Consolidated Sequoia Choice Entities Balance Sheets \nThe following table presents residential loan activity at the consolidated Sequoia Choice entities for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018.\nTable 41 - Residential Loans Held-for-Investment at Consolidated Sequoia Choice Entities - Activity\n\nThe outstanding loans held-for-investment at our Sequoia Choice entities at December 31, 2019 were primarily comprised of prime-quality, first-lien, 30-year, fixed-rate loans originated in 2017 or 2018. The gross weighted average coupon of these loans was 4.73%, the weighted average FICO score of borrowers backing these loans was 744 (at origination) and the weighted average original LTV ratio was 75% (at origination). At December 31, 2019, nine of these loans with an aggregate unpaid principal balance of $7 million were greater than 90 days delinquent and three of these loans with an aggregate unpaid principal balance of $2 million was in foreclosure. At December 31, 2018, three of these loans with an aggregate unpaid principal balance of $2 million were greater than 90 days delinquent and none of these loans were in foreclosure.\nConsolidated Freddie Mac SLST Entities\nBeginning in 2018, we invested in certain subordinate securities backed by pools of seasoned re-performing and, to a lesser extent, non-performing residential mortgage loans that were issued by certain Freddie Mac SLST securitization entities and we were required to consolidate these entities for financial reporting purposes in accordance with GAAP. These entities are independent of Redwood and the assets and liabilities of these entities are not, respectively, owned by us or legal obligations of ours. We record the assets and liabilities of the consolidated Freddie Mac SLST entities at fair value, based on the estimated fair value of the debt securities (ABS) issued from the securitizations, in accordance with GAAP provisions for collateralized financing entities. At December 31, 2019, our economic investment in the consolidated Freddie Mac SLST entities had an estimated fair value of $451 million, and was comprised of subordinate securities.\nThe following tables present the statements of income for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018, and 2017 and the balance sheets of the consolidated Freddie Mac SLST entities at December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018. All amounts in the statements of income and balance sheets presented below are included in our consolidated financial statements and are included in our Third-Party Residential Investments segment.\nTable 42 - Consolidated Freddie Mac SLST Entities Statements of Income \nTable 43 - Consolidated Freddie Mac SLST Entities Balance Sheets\n\nThe following table presents residential loan activity at the consolidated Freddie Mac SLST entity for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018.\nTable 44 - Residential Loans Held-for-Investment at Consolidated Freddie Mac SLST Entities - Activity\n\nThe outstanding re-performing and non-performing residential loans held-for-investment at the Freddie Mac SLST entities at December 31, 2019 were first-lien, fixed- or step-rate loans that have been modified. At securitization, the weighted average FICO score of borrowers backing these loans was 600 and the weighted average LTV ratio of these loans was 73%. At December 31, 2019, 587 of these loans with an aggregate unpaid principal balance of $135 million were greater than 90 days delinquent and 208 of these loans with an aggregate unpaid principal balance of $33 million were in foreclosure. At December 31, 2018, 306 of these loans with an aggregate unpaid principal balance of $51 million were greater than 90 days delinquent and none of these loans were in foreclosure. Due to the credit profile of re-performing and non-performing loans, our investment in the subordinate securities issued by the Freddie Mac SLST entities was made based on an expectation of defaults and credit losses that will occur on the underlying pool of residential mortgage loans, which was reflected in our purchase price yield. At December 31, 2019, delinquencies and credit losses in the portfolio remained in line with our expectations.\nConsolidated Freddie Mac K-Series Entities\nBeginning in 2018, we invested in certain subordinate securities issued by Freddie Mac K-Series securitization entities and were required to consolidate these entities for financial reporting purposes in accordance with GAAP. Each of these entities is independent of Redwood and of each other and the assets and liabilities of these entities are not, respectively, owned by us or legal obligations of ours. We record the assets and liabilities of the consolidated Freddie Mac K-Series entities at fair value, based on the estimated fair value of the debt securities (ABS) issued from the securitizations, in accordance with GAAP provisions for collateralized financing entities. At December 31, 2019, our economic investment in the consolidated Freddie Mac K-Series entities had an estimated fair value of $253 million, and was comprised of subordinate securities.\nThe following tables present the statements of income for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018, and 2017 and the balance sheets of the consolidated Freddie Mac K-Series entities at December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018. All amounts in the statements of income and balance sheets presented below are included in our consolidated financial statements and are included in our Multifamily Investments segment.\nTable 45 - Consolidated Freddie Mac K-Series Entities Statements of Income \nTable 46 - Consolidated Freddie Mac K-Series Entities Balance Sheets\n\nThe following table presents multifamily loan activity at the consolidated Freddie Mac K-Series entities for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018.\nTable 47 - Multifamily Loans Held-for-Investment at Consolidated Freddie Mac K-Series Entities - Activity\n\nThe outstanding multifamily loans held-for-investment at the Freddie Mac K-Series entities at December 31, 2019 were first lien, fixed-rate loans that were primarily originated between 2015 and 2017 and had original loan terms of seven to ten years and an original weighted average LTV ratio of 69%. At December 31, 2019, the weighted average coupon of these loans was 4.13% and the weighted average loan term was six years. At both December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018, none of these loans were greater than 90 days delinquent or in foreclosure.\nConsolidated CAFL Entities\nAs a result of our acquisition of CoreVest in the fourth quarter of 2019, which included the acquisition of certain subordinate and IO securities in CAFL securitizations, we were required to consolidate certain CAFL entities for financial reporting purposes in accordance with GAAP. Each of these entities is independent of Redwood and of each other and the assets and liabilities of these entities are not, respectively, owned by us or legal obligations of ours. We record the assets and liabilities of the consolidated CAFL entities at fair value, based on the estimated fair value of the debt securities (ABS) issued from the securitizations, in accordance with GAAP provisions for collateralized financing entities. At December 31, 2019, our economic investment in the consolidated CAFL entities had an estimated fair value of $195 million, and was comprised of subordinate and interest-only securities.\nThe following tables present the statements of income for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018, and 2017 and the balance sheets of the consolidated CAFL entities at December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018. All amounts in the statements of income and balance sheets presented below are included in our consolidated financial statements and are included in our Business Purpose Lending segment.\nTable 48 - Consolidated CAFL Entities Statements of Income \nTable 49 - Consolidated CAFL Entities Balance Sheets\n\nThe following table presents single-family rental loan activity at the consolidated CAFL entities for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018.\nTable 50 - Single-Family Rental Loans Held-for-Investment at Consolidated CAFL Entities - Activity\n\nThe outstanding single-family rental loans held-for-investment at CAFL entities at December 31, 2019 were first lien, fixed-rate loans with original maturities of five, seven, or ten years. At December 31, 2019, the weighted average coupon of our single-family rental loans was 5.70% and the weighted average remaining loan term was seven years. At origination, the weighted average LTV ratio of these loans was 68% and the weighted average debt service coverage ratio was 1.35 times. At December 31, 2019, 18 of these loans with an aggregate unpaid principal balance of $29 million were greater than 90 days delinquent and five of these loans with an aggregate unpaid principal balance of $9 million were in foreclosure.\nTax Provision and Taxable Income\nTax Provision under GAAP\nFor the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018, and 2017, we recorded tax provisions of $7 million, $11 million, and $12 million, respectively. Our tax provision is primarily derived from GAAP net income or loss at our TRS, as we do not book a material tax provision associated with income generated at our REIT. Our TRS income is generally earned from our mortgage banking activities, MSRs, and other non-REIT eligible security investments.\nTaxable Income\nThe following table summarizes our taxable income and distributions to shareholders for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018, and 2017. For each of these periods, we had no undistributed REIT taxable income, after the application of net operating loss carryforwards.\nTable 51 - Taxable Income\n\n (1) Our tax results for the year ended December 31, 2019 are estimates until we file tax returns for 2019.  Taxable Income Distribution Requirement\nAs a REIT, we are required to distribute at least 90% of our taxable income, after the application of available federal net operating loss carryforwards (NOLs), to our shareholders. For 2019, our estimated REIT taxable income of $136 million exceeded our available NOLs by $98 million, and therefore our minimum dividend distribution requirement was $88 million. The following table details our federal NOLs and capital loss carryforwards available as of December 31, 2019.\nTable 52 - Federal Net Operating and Capital Loss Carryforwards \nAt December 31, 2018, we maintained $39 million of NOLs at the REIT level. In order to utilize these carryforwards, taxable income must exceed our dividend distributions. During 2019, we distributed $126 million to shareholders, which was less than our estimated taxable income of $136 million. We therefore expect to report REIT taxable income on our 2019 federal income tax return after the application of a dividends paid deduction. As a result, we expect $10 million of our federal NOLs at the REIT level to be utilized in 2019. Federal NOLs at the REIT level do not expire until 2029.\nThe Tax Act created a limitation on the annual usage of REIT NOLs to 80% of REIT taxable income, effective with respect to NOLs arising in taxable years beginning after December 31, 2017. We do not expect this to materially impact our REIT.\nOur TRS NOL carryforwards were acquired in the 5 Arches acquisition. They were generated after December 31, 2017 and therefore carry forward indefinitely. These NOLs are subject to the Separate Return Limitation Year (\"SRLY\") rules, which can limit the usage of the NOLs. However, we do not expect this to prevent us from utilizing these NOLs over time.\nTax Characteristics of Distributions to Shareholders\nFor the year ended December 31, 2019, we declared and distributed four regular quarterly dividends totaling $126 million ($1.20 per share). Under the federal income tax rules applicable to REITs, the taxable portion of any distribution to shareholders is determined by (i) taxable income of the REIT, exclusive of the dividends paid deduction and NOLs; and (ii) net capital gains recognized by the REIT, exclusive of capital loss carryforwards. The income or loss generated at our TRS does not directly affect the tax characterization of our dividends.\nOur 2019 dividend distributions are expected to be characterized for federal income tax purposes as 73% ordinary dividend income and 27% long-term capital gain dividend income. Under the federal income tax rules applicable to REITs, none of the 2019 dividend distributions are expected to be characterized as a return of capital or qualified dividends.\nBeginning in 2018, the Tax Act provides that individual taxpayers may generally deduct 20% of their ordinary REIT dividends from taxable income. This results in a maximum federal effective tax rate of 29.6% on an individual taxpayer's ordinary REIT dividends, compared to the highest marginal rate of 37%. This deduction does not apply to REIT dividends classified as qualified dividends or long-term capital gains dividends, as those dividends are taxed at a maximum rate of 20% for individuals.\nDifferences between Estimated Total Taxable Income and GAAP Income\nDifferences between estimated taxable income and GAAP income are largely due to the following: (i) we cannot establish loss reserves for future anticipated events for tax but we can for GAAP, as realized credit losses are expensed when incurred for tax and these losses can be anticipated through lower yields on assets or through loss provisions for GAAP; (ii) the timing, and possibly the amount, of some expenses (e.g., certain compensation expenses) are different for tax than for GAAP; (iii) since amortization and impairments differ for tax and GAAP, the tax and GAAP gains and losses on sales may differ, resulting in differences in realized gains on sale; (iv) at the REIT and certain TRS entities, unrealized gains and losses on market valuation adjustments of loans, securities and derivatives are not recognized for tax until the instrument is sold or extinguished; (v) for tax, basis may not be assigned to mortgage servicing rights retained when whole loans are sold resulting in lower tax gain on sale; (vi) for tax, we do not consolidate securitization entities as we do under GAAP; and, (vii) dividend distributions to our REIT from our TRS are included in REIT taxable income, but not GAAP income. As a result of these differences in accounting, our estimated taxable income can vary significantly from our GAAP income during certain reporting periods.\nFor tax years beginning after December 31, 2018, the Tax Act may require acceleration of discount accretion for federal income tax purposes for debt instruments with original issue discount. We have evaluated the effects of this change, and it did not have a material income tax effect for us.\nThe tax basis in assets and liabilities at the REIT was $6.35 billion and $4.68 billion, respectively, at December 31, 2019. The GAAP basis in assets and liabilities at the REIT was $16.22 billion and $14.52 billion, respectively, at December 31, 2019. The primary difference in both the tax and GAAP assets and liabilities is attributable to securitization entities that are consolidated for GAAP reporting purposes but not for tax purposes.\nThe tables below reconcile our estimated total taxable income to our GAAP income for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018, and 2017.\nTable 53 - Differences between Estimated Total Taxable Income and GAAP Net Income \n\n\n (1) For 2017, other income at the REIT is primarily comprised of dividend income from our TRS.  Potential Taxable Income Volatility\nWe expect period-to-period volatility in our estimated taxable income. A description of the factors that can cause this volatility is provided below.\nRecognition of Gains and Losses on Sale\nSince the computation of amortization and impairments on assets may differ for tax and GAAP and many of our assets held for investment purposes are marked-to-market for GAAP, but not for tax, the tax and GAAP basis on assets sold or called may differ, resulting in differences in gains and losses on sale or call. In addition, capital losses in excess of capital gains are generally disallowed and carry forward to future tax years. Subsequent capital gains realized for tax may be offset by prior capital losses and, thus, not affect taxable income. At December 31, 2019, we had no capital loss carryforwards at the REIT or TRS level.\nPrepayments on Securities\nWe have retained certain IO securities since the time they were issued from Sequoia securitizations we sponsored and purchased additional third-party IO securities. Our tax basis in these securities was $159 million at December 31, 2019. The return on IOs is sensitive to prepayments and, to the extent prepayments vary period to period, income from these IOs will vary. Typically, fast prepayments reduce yields and slow prepayments increase yields. We are not permitted to recognize a negative yield under tax accounting rules, so during periods of fast prepayments our periodic premium expense for tax purposes can be relatively low and the tax cost basis for these securities may not be significantly reduced. Currently, our tax basis is above the fair values for these IOs in the aggregate. If a securitization is called, the remaining tax basis in the IO is expensed, creating an ordinary loss at the call date.\nPrepayments also affect the taxable income recognition on other securities we own. For tax purposes, we are required to use particular prepayment assumptions for the remaining lives of each security. As actual prepayment speeds vary, the yield we recognize for tax purposes will be adjusted accordingly. Thus, to the extent actual prepayments differ from our long-term assumptions or vary from period to period, the yield recognized will also vary and this difference could be material.\nCredit Losses on Securities and Loans\nTo determine estimated taxable income, we are generally not permitted to anticipate, or reserve for, credit losses on investments which are generally purchased at a discount. For tax purposes, we accrue the entire purchase discount on a security into taxable income over the expected life of the security. Estimated taxable income is reduced when actual credit losses occur. As we have no credit reserves or allowances for tax, any future credit losses on securities or loans will have a more significant impact on tax earnings than on GAAP earnings and may create significant taxable income volatility to the extent the level of credit losses fluctuates during reporting periods. Credit losses are based on our tax basis, which differs from our basis for GAAP purposes. We anticipate an additional $14 million of credit losses for tax on securities, based on our projection of principal balance losses and assuming a similar tax basis as we have recently experienced, although the timing of actual losses is difficult to accurately project.\nOur estimated total taxable income for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018, and 2017 included $1 million, $2 million, and $3 million, respectively, in realized credit losses on investments.\nCompensation Expense\nThe total tax expense for equity award compensation is dependent upon varying factors such as the timing of payments of dividend equivalent rights, the distribution of deferred stock units and performance stock units, and the cash deferrals to and withdrawals from our Executive Deferred Compensation Plan. For GAAP purposes, the total expense associated with an equity award is determined at the award date and is recognized over the vesting period. For tax, the total expense is recognized at the date of distribution or exercise, not the award date. In addition, some compensation may not be deductible for tax if it exceeds certain levels. An exception may apply to performance-based compensation that is paid pursuant to a written and binding contract in effect before November 2, 2017. Thus, the total amount of compensation expense, as well as the timing, could be significantly different for tax than for GAAP.\nAs an example, for GAAP we expense the grant date fair value of performance stock units (PSUs) granted over the vesting term of those PSUs (regardless of the degree to which the performance conditions for vesting are ultimately satisfied, if at all), whereas for tax the value of the PSUs that actually vest in accordance with the performance conditions of those awards and are subsequently distributed to the award recipient is recorded as an expense on the date of distribution. For example, if no PSUs under a particular grant ultimately vest, due to the failure to satisfy the performance conditions, no tax expense will be recorded for those PSUs, even though we would have already recorded expense for GAAP equal to the grant date fair value of the PSU awards. Conversely, for example, if performance is such that a number of shares of common stock equal to 200% of the PSU award ultimately vest and are delivered to the award recipient, expense for tax will equal the common stock value on the date of distribution of 200% of the number of PSUs originally granted. This expense for tax could significantly exceed the recorded expense for GAAP.\nIn addition, since the timing of distributions of deferred stock units, performance stock units, or cash out of the Executive Deferred Compensation Plan is based on employees' deferral elections, it can be difficult to project when the tax expense will occur.\nMortgage Servicing Rights\nFor GAAP purposes, we recognize MSRs through the direct acquisition of servicing rights from third parties or through the retention of MSRs associated with residential loans that we have acquired and subsequently sold to non-consolidated securitization entities or to third parties. For tax purposes, basis in our MSR assets is recognized through the direct acquisition of servicing rights from third parties, or to the extent that a retained MSR entitles us to receive a servicing fee in excess of so-called normal servicing (or the right to receive reasonable compensation for services to be performed under the mortgage serving contract). Tax basis in our normal MSR assets is not recognized when MSRs are retained from sales of loans to non-consolidated securitization entities or to third parties, thereby creating a favorable temporary GAAP to tax difference from sale of the loans. For the year ended December 31, 2019, we retained $1 million of MSRs from jumbo loan sales for which no tax basis was recognized. No other material tax basis in our MSR assets was recognized in 2019.\nFor GAAP purposes, mortgage servicing fee income, net of servicing expense, as well as changes in the estimated fair value of our MSRs, is recognized on our consolidated statements of income over the life of the MSR asset. For tax purposes, only mortgage servicing fee income, net of servicing expense is recognized as taxable income. Any MSR where basis is recognized for tax purposes through acquisition is amortized as a tax expense over a finite life.\nPeriodic changes in the market values of MSRs are recorded through the income statement for GAAP purposes, but not for tax purposes. Only when MSRs are sold will a tax gain or loss be recognized. As tax basis is not recognized for retained MSRs and the rules for writing-off tax basis of purchased MSRs are restrictive, the tax gain from the sale of MSRs can be substantial.\nLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\nSummary\nIn addition to the proceeds from equity and debt capital-raising transactions, our principal sources of cash consist of borrowings under mortgage loan warehouse facilities, securities repurchase agreements, payments of principal and interest we receive from our investment portfolios, and cash generated from our operating activities. Our most significant uses of cash are to purchase and originate mortgage loans for our mortgage banking operations, to fund investments in residential loans, to purchase investment securities and make other investments, to repay principal and interest on our warehouse facilities, repurchase agreements, and long-term debt, to make dividend payments on our capital stock, and to fund our operations.\nAt December 31, 2019, our total capital was $2.60 billion and included $1.83 billion of equity capital and $0.79 billion of convertible notes and long-term debt on our consolidated balance sheet, including $245 million of convertible debt due in 2023, $200 million of convertible debt due in 2024, $201 million of exchangeable debt due in 2025, and $140 million of trust-preferred securities due in 2037.\nAs of December 31, 2019, our cash and liquidity capital included $260 million of capital available for investment. While we believe our available capital, together with additional liquidity we believe we can source through continued portfolio optimization (including collateralized borrowings or assets sales), is sufficient to fund our operations and currently contemplated investment activities and to repay existing debt, we may raise equity or debt capital from time to time to acquire assets and make long-term investments to expand our investment portfolio, including funding large purchases of portfolios of residential, multifamily, or business purpose residential loans or securities, or other portfolio investments, for acquisitions (which could include acquisitions to expand our mortgage banking operating platforms), or for other purposes. To the extent we seek to raise additional capital, our approach will continue to be based on what we believe to be in the best interests of our shareholders.\nWe are subject to risks relating to our liquidity and capital resources, including risks relating to incurring debt under residential loan warehouse facilities, securities repurchase facilities, and other short- and long-term debt facilities and other risks relating to our use of derivatives. A further discussion of these risks is set forth below under the heading Risks Relating to Debt Incurred under Short- and Long-Term Borrowing Facilities\" and in Part I, Item 1A - Risk Factors of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nCash Flows and Liquidity for the Year Ended December 31, 2019\nCash flows from our mortgage banking activities and our investments can be volatile from quarter to quarter depending on many factors, including the timing and amount of loan and securities acquisitions and sales and repayments, the profitability of mortgage banking activities, as well as changes in interest rates, prepayments, and credit losses. Therefore, cash flows generated in the current period are not necessarily reflective of the long-term cash flows we will receive from these investments or activities.\nCash Flows from Operating Activities\nCash flows from operating activities were negative $1.17 billion in 2019. This amount includes the net cash utilized during the period from the purchase and sale of residential mortgage loans associated with our mortgage banking activities. Purchases of loans are financed to a large extent with short-term debt, for which changes in cash are included as a component of financing activities. Excluding cash flows from the purchase, sale, and principal payments of loans classified as held-for-sale, cash flows from operating activities were negative $76 million in 2019, positive $100 million in 2018, and positive $37 million in 2017. The variance in these amounts from 2019 to 2018 was largely attributable to cash outflows for the net settlements of derivatives and payment of margin on derivatives agreements, which totaled $175 million in 2019, compared to net cash inflows of $35 million in 2018.\nCash Flows from Investing Activities\nDuring 2019, our net cash provided by investing activities was $1.03 billion and primarily resulted from proceeds from principal payments on loans held-for-investment and sales of real estate securities. Although we generally intend to hold our investment securities as long-term investments, we may sell certain of these securities in order to manage our interest rate risk and liquidity needs, to meet other operating objectives, and to adapt to market conditions. We cannot predict the timing and impact of future sales of investment securities, if any.\nBecause many of our investment securities are financed through repurchase agreements, a significant portion of the proceeds from any sales or principal payments of our investment securities could be used to repay balances under these financing sources. Similarly, all or a significant portion of cash flows from principal payments of loans at consolidated securitization entities would generally be used to repay ABS issued by those entities.\nDuring 2019, we deployed capital into several new investments, including the acquisitions of 5 Arches and CoreVest, multifamily and re-performing residential loan securities, business purpose residential loans, shared home appreciation options, and a limited partnership to acquire light-renovation multifamily loans.\nAs presented in the \"Supplemental Noncash Information\" subsection of our consolidated statements of cash flows, during 2019, 2018, and 2017, we transferred residential loans between held-for-sale and held-for-investment classification, retained securities from Sequoia securitizations we sponsored, and consolidated certain multifamily and re-performing residential securitization trusts which represent significant non-cash transactions that were not included in cash flows from investing activities.\nCash Flows from Financing Activities\nDuring 2019, our net cash provided by financing activities was $225 million. This primarily resulted from proceeds of $1.40 billion from the issuance of asset-backed securities from our Sequoia Choice and CAFL securitizations, proceeds of $451 million from the issuance of common stock, and proceeds of $387 million from the issuance of exchangeable notes and borrowings under our subordinate securities financing facility. These cash inflows were partially offset by $1.12 billion of repayments of ABS issued, $741 million of net repayments of short-term debt, and the distribution of $129 million of dividends.\nIn February 2020, the Board of Directors declared a regular dividend of $0.32 per share for the first quarter of 2020, which is payable on March 30, 2020 to shareholders of record on March 16, 2020.\nIn accordance with the terms of our outstanding deferred stock units and restricted stock units, which are stock-based compensation awards, each time we declare and pay a dividend on our common stock, we are required to make a dividend equivalent payment in that same per share amount on each outstanding deferred stock unit and restricted stock unit.\nRepurchase Authorization\nIn February 2018, our Board of Directors approved an authorization for the repurchase of our common stock, increasing the total amount authorized for repurchases of common stock to $100 million, and also authorized the repurchase of outstanding debt securities, including convertible and exchangeable debt. This authorization increased the previous share repurchase authorization approved in February 2016 and has no expiration date. This repurchase authorization does not obligate us to acquire any specific number of shares or securities. Under this authorization, shares or securities may be repurchased in privately negotiated and/or open market transactions, including under plans complying with Rule 10b5-1 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. At December 31, 2019, $100 million of the current authorization remained available for the repurchase of shares of our common stock. Like other investments we may make, any repurchases of our common stock or debt securities under this authorization would reduce our available capital described above.\nLeverage\nOur debt-to-equity leverage ratio increased during 2019, as we increased the amount of borrowings we utilized to finance our investments, including through additional short-term and long-term borrowings. Additionally, our leverage ratio is impacted by the amount of loans we hold for sale at our mortgage banking businesses and our amount of undeployed capital available for investment. At December 31, 2019, we estimate we had approximately $260 million of capital available for investment. As this capital is deployed, our leverage ratio is expected to increase, all other factors being equal, as we generally make investments in loans, securities, and other assets with a combination of capital and borrowings secured by the assets we invest in. In general, higher leverage creates greater liquidity risk as the amount of our equity relative to borrowings decreases, including liquidity risks of the types described in Part I, Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K under the heading Risk Factors,\u201d and in Part II,", "item_7_tables": "Table 94: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td>
