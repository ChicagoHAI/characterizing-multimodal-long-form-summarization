Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThis Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations is intended to assist in understanding and assessing the trends and significant changes in our results of operations and financial condition as of the dates and for the periods presented. Historical results may not indicate future performance. Our forward-looking statements, which reflect our current views about future events, are based on assumptions and are subject to known and unknown risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contemplated by these statements. Factors that may cause differences between actual results and those contemplated by forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, those discussed in Item 1A. Risk Factors,\u201d of this report on Form 10-K. This Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations should be read in conjunction with Selected Financial Data\u201d in Item 6 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K and our consolidated financial statements and related notes included in this report.\nBusiness Overview\nGenesis is a healthcare services holding company that through its subsidiaries owns and operates skilled nursing facilities, assisted/senior living facilities and a rehabilitation therapy business. We have an administrative service company that provides a full complement of administrative and consultative services that allows our affiliated operators and third-party operators with whom we contract to better focus on delivery of healthcare services. We provide inpatient services through 381 skilled nursing, assisted/senior living and behavioral health centers located in 26 states. Revenues of our owned, leased and otherwise consolidated centers constitute approximately 87% of our revenues.\nWe also provide a range of rehabilitation therapy services, including speech pathology, physical therapy, occupational therapy and respiratory therapy. These services are provided by rehabilitation therapists and assistants employed or contracted at substantially all of the centers operated by us, as well as by contract to healthcare facilities operated by others. After the elimination of intercompany revenues, the rehabilitation therapy services business constitutes approximately 10% of our revenues.\nWe provide an array of other specialty medical services, including management services, physician services, staffing services, and other healthcare related services, which comprise the balance of our revenues.\nStrategic Partnerships\nNext Partnership\nOn January 31, 2019, Welltower Inc. (Welltower) sold the real estate of 15 facilities to a real estate partnership (Next Partnership), of which we acquired a 46% membership interest for $16.0 million. The remaining interest is held by Next Healthcare (Next), a related party. See Note 16 - Related Party Transactions.\u201d In conjunction with the facility sales, we received aggregate annual rent credits of $17.2 million. We will continue to operate these facilities pursuant to a master lease with the Next Partnership. The term of the master lease is 15 years with two five-year renewal options available. We will pay annual rent of $19.5 million, with no rent escalators for the first five years and an escalator of 2% beginning in the sixth lease year and thereafter. We also obtained a fixed price purchase option to acquire all of the real property of the facilities. The purchase option is exercisable between lease years five and seven, reducing in price each successive year down to a 10% premium over the net price paid by the partnership to acquire the facilities from Welltower.\nWe have concluded the Next Partnership qualifies as a VIE and we are the primary beneficiary. As such, we have consolidated all of the accounts of the Next Partnership in the accompanying consolidated financial statements. The ROU assets and lease obligations related to the Next Partnership lease agreement have been fully eliminated in our consolidated financial statements. The Next Partnership acquired 22 skilled nursing facilities for a purchase price of $252.5 million but immediately sold seven of these facilities for $79.0 million. The initial consolidation of the remaining 15 facilities resulted in property and equipment of $173.5 million, non-recourse debt of $165.7 million, net of debt issuance costs, and non-controlling interest of $18.5 million. The impact of consolidation on the accompanying consolidated statement of operations was not material for the year ended December 31, 2019 apart from transaction costs of $5.3 million.\nVantage Point Partnership\nOn September 12, 2019, Welltower and Second Spring Healthcare Investments (Second Spring) sold the real estate of four and 14 facilities, respectively, to a real estate partnership (Vantage Point Partnership), in which we invested $37.5 million for an approximate 30% membership interest. The remaining membership interest is held by Vantage Point Capital, LLC (Vantage Point) for an investment of $85.3 million consisting of an equity investment of $8.5 million and a formation loan of $76.8 million. In conjunction with the facility sales, we received aggregate annual rent credits of $30.3 million. We will continue to operate these facilities pursuant to a new master lease with the Vantage Point Partnership. The term of the master lease is 15 years with two five-year renewal options available. We will pay annual rent of approximately $33.1 million, with no rent escalators for the first four years and an escalator of 2% beginning in the fifth lease year and thereafter. We also obtained a fixed price purchase option to acquire all of the real property of the facilities. The purchase option is exercisable during certain periods in fiscal years 2024 and 2025 for a 10% premium over the original purchase price. Further, Vantage Point holds a put option that would require us to acquire its membership interests in the Vantage Point Partnership. The put option becomes exercisable if we opt not to purchase the facilities or upon the occurrence of certain events of default.\nWe have concluded the Vantage Point Partnership qualifies as a VIE and we are the primary beneficiary. As such, we have consolidated all of the accounts of the Vantage Point Partnership in the accompanying financial statements. The ROU assets and lease obligations related to the Vantage Point Partnership lease agreement have been fully eliminated in our consolidated financial statements. The Vantage Point Partnership acquired all 18 skilled nursing facilities for a purchase price of $339.2 million. The initial consolidation primarily resulted in property and equipment of $339.2 million, non-recourse debt of $306.1 million, net of debt issuance costs, and non-controlling interest of $8.5 million. We have not finalized the analysis of the consideration and purchase price allocation and will continue to review this during the measurement period. Other than transaction costs of $11.0 million, the impact of consolidation on the accompanying consolidated statement of operations was not material for the year ended December 31, 2019.\nDuring the third quarter of 2019, we sold the real property of seven skilled nursing facilities and one assisted/senior living facility located in Georgia, New Jersey, Virginia, and Maryland to affiliates of Vantage Point for an aggregate purchase price of $91.8 million, using the majority of the proceeds to acquire our interest in the Vantage Point Partnership and repay indebtedness. The operations of seven of these facilities were also divested. Three of the facilities were subject to real estate loans and two were subject to loans insured by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD). See Note 9 - Property and Equipment\u201d and Note 12 - Long-Term Debt - Real Estate Loans\u201d and Long-Term Debt - HUD Insured Loans.\u201d We also divested the operations of an additional leased skilled nursing facility located in Georgia, marking an exit from the inpatient business in this state. The divested facilities had aggregate annual revenues of $84.1 million and annual pre-tax net income of $2.6 million. The divestitures resulted in an aggregate gain of $57.8 million.\nOn January 10, 2020, Welltower sold the real estate of one skilled nursing facility located in Massachusetts to Vantage Point Partnership. The sale represents the final component of the transaction that was initiated on September 12, 2019. We will receive an annual rent credit of $0.7 million from Welltower as a result of the lease termination. The Vantage Point Partnership acquired this skilled nursing facility for a purchase price of $9.1 million. The initial consolidation of this one additional skilled nursing facility primarily resulted in property and equipment of $9.1 million, non-recourse debt of $7.3 million with the balance of the purchase price settled primarily with proceeds held in escrow from the September 12, 2019 closing. We will continue to operate the facility under the master lease agreement with Vantage Point Partnership along with the other 18 facilities. The addition of this one skilled nursing facility resulted in an increase of annual rent of $0.9 million. See Note 4 - Significant Transactions and Events - Strategic Partnerships - Vantage Point Partnership.\u201d\nNewGen Partnership\nOn February 1, 2020, we transitioned operational responsibility for 19 facilities in the states of California, Washington and Nevada to New Generation Health, LLC (NewGen). We sold the real estate and operations of six skilled nursing facilities and transferred the leasehold rights to 13 skilled nursing, behavioral health and assisted living facilities for a total of $78.9 million. We will retain a 50% interest in the facilities. Net transaction proceeds were used by us to repay indebtedness, including prepayment fees, of $33.7 million, fund our initial equity contribution and working capital requirement of approximately $15.0 million, and provide financing to the partnership of $9.0 million. Concurrently, the facilities have entered, or will enter upon regulatory approval, into management services agreements with NewGen for the day-to-day operations of the facilities. We will continue to provide administrative and back office services to the facilities pursuant to administrative support agreements, as well as therapy services pursuant to therapy services\nagreements. We are currently assessing whether we will continue to consolidate the financial statements of these facilities for financial reporting purposes.\nDivestiture of Non-Strategic Facilities\n2020 Divestitures\nOn January 31, 2020, Omega sold the real estate of one skilled nursing facility located in Massachusetts. We leased the facility under a master lease agreement, but closed the facility on July 1, 2019. The sale resulted in the lease termination of the facility and an annual rent credit of $0.4 million.\nOn February 1, 2020, we sold two owned skilled nursing facilities in North Carolina and one owned skilled nursing facility in Maryland for $61.8 million. Proceeds were used to retire $29.1 million of HUD financed debt. The three facilities generated revenues of $38.7 million and pre-tax income of $0.5 million.\nOn February 26, 2020, we completed the sale of one owned HUD-insured skilled nursing facility in California for $20.8 million. The facility had been classified as an asset held for sale as of December 31, 2019. Proceeds were used to retire $20.5 million of HUD financed debt. The facility generated revenues of $14.0 million and pre-tax loss of $0.1 million. See Note 20 - Assets Held for Sale.\u201d\nOn March 4, 2020, we divested the operations of one leased assisted/senior living facility in Montana. The lease termination resulted in an annual rent credit of $0.7 million. The facility generated revenues of $2.5 million and pre-tax income of $0.1 million.\nWe are currently assessing the impact the 2020 divestitures and lease amendments will have on our consolidated financial statements.\n2019 Divestitures\nCalifornia Divestitures\nDuring the second quarter of 2019, we sold the real property and divested the operations of five skilled nursing facilities in California for a sale price of $56.5 million. Loan repayments of $41.8 million were paid on the facilities at closing. See Note 9 - Property and Equipment\u201d and Note 12 - Long-Term Debt - Real Estate Loans\u201d and Long-Term Debt - HUD Insured Loans.\u201d We incurred prepayment penalties and other closing costs of $2.4 million at settlement. The facilities generated annual revenues of $53.0 million and pre-tax net income of $1.6 million. The divestiture resulted in a gain of $25.0 million. We also divested the operations of one behavioral health center located in California upon the lease's expiration in the second quarter of 2019. The center generated annual revenues of $3.1 million and pre-tax net loss of $0.3 million. The divestiture resulted in a loss of $0.1 million.\nDuring the third quarter of 2019, we sold the real property and divested the operations of one additional skilled nursing facility and one assisted/senior living facility in California for an aggregate sale price of $11.5 million. Loan repayments of $9.6 million were paid on the facilities at closing. See Note 9 - Property and Equipment\u201d and Note 12 - Long-Term Debt - HUD Insured Loans.\u201d The facilities generated annual revenues of $10.4 million and pre-tax net income of less than $0.1 million. The divestiture resulted in an aggregate gain of $0.6 million.\nTexas Divestitures\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2019, we sold the real property of seven facilities in Texas for a sales price of $20.1 million. The net proceeds were used principally to repay the indebtedness of the facilities. We recognized a net gain of $3.3 million associated with the sale of the facilities. We recognized a gain on early extinguishment of debt of $2.6 million associated with the write off of the debt premiums and issuance costs on the underlying HUD loans. These seven facilities had been classified as held for sale as of December 31, 2018. See Note 20 - Assets Held for Sale.\u201d\nOther Divestitures\nDuring the first quarter of 2019, we divested the operations of nine facilities located in New Jersey and Ohio that were subject to the master lease with Welltower (the Welltower Master Lease). The nine divested facilities had aggregate annual revenues of $90.2 million and annual pre-tax net loss of $6.0 million. We recognized a loss on exit reserves of $3.5 million. We also completed the closure of one facility located in Ohio. The facility generated annual revenues of $7.7 million and pre-tax net loss of $1.6 million. The closure resulted in a loss of $0.2 million.\nDuring the second quarter of 2019, we divested the operations of three leased skilled nursing facilities. Two of the facilities were located in Connecticut and subject to the Welltower Master Lease, while the third was located in Ohio. The facilities generated annual revenues of $24.7 million and pre-tax net loss of $2.9 million. The divestitures resulted in a loss of $1.1 million.\nDuring the third quarter of 2019, we divested the operations of 11 leased skilled nursing facilities and completed the closure of a twelfth facility. Nine of the facilities were located in Ohio, marking an exit from the inpatient business in this state, while the remaining three were located in Massachusetts, Utah, and Idaho. Four of the facilities were subject to a master lease with Omega Healthcare Investors, Inc. (Omega), three of which were removed from the lease, resulting in an annual rent credit of $1.9 million, with the fourth, the closed facility, remaining subject to the lease. The twelve facilities generated annual revenues of $75.6 million and pre-tax loss of $4.6 million. The divestitures resulted in a loss of $3.5 million.\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2019, we divested the operations of one leased skilled nursing facility in New Jersey. The facility generated annual revenues of $19.0 million and pre-tax net loss of $1.2 million. The divestiture resulted in a loss of $0.9 million, which was primarily attributable to exit costs.\n2018 Divestitures\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2018, we divested the operations of 54 skilled nursing facilities and one assisted/senior living facility. These divestitures resulted in net gains of $34.8 million, which are included in other income on the consolidated statements of operations. See Note 18 - Other Income.\u201d\nTexas Divestitures\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2018, we divested the operations of 23 skilled nursing facilities located in Texas, consisting of 22 owned facilities and one leased facility. We sold the real property associated with 15 of the owned facilities, with the real property of the remaining seven owned facilities being classified as held for sale at December 31, 2018. Sale proceeds of approximately $89.4 million, net of transaction costs, were used principally to repay the indebtedness of the facilities. We recognized a gain of $3.4 million primarily attributable to the derecognition of financing lease assets and obligations offset by a loss of $4.6 million for exit costs. Debt premiums and issuance costs of $9.4 million associated with underlying HUD loans were written off as a gain on early extinguishment of debt.\nOther Divestitures\nDuring the first quarter of 2018, we closed one leased skilled nursing facility located in Massachusetts. The facility remained subject to a master lease with Welltower until its sale in the second quarter of 2019. The facility generated annual revenues of $9.0 million and pre-tax net loss of $2.7 million. The closure resulted in a loss of $0.3 million.\nDuring the second quarter of 2018, we divested 19 leased skilled nursing facilities, one of which had previously been closed during 2017. The facilities were located across the states of California, Kentucky, Massachusetts, New Jersey, and Pennsylvania. Twelve of the facilities were subject to a master lease with Second Spring and six were subject to a master lease with Sabra Health Care REIT, Inc. (Sabra). The facilities generated annual revenues of $182.7 million and pre-tax loss of $23.8 million. We recorded a gain of $22.5 million on the divestitures, offset by a loss on exit costs of $8.4 million. Additionally, we recognized a capital lease net asset and obligation write-down of $16.8 million, a financing obligation net asset write-down of $113.3 million and a financing obligation write-down of $134.5 million associated with 12 of the facilities. We recorded accelerated depreciation expense of $5.3 million associated with the divestitures.\nDuring the third quarter of 2018, we divested seven leased facilities, consisting of six skilled nursing facilities and one behavioral health clinic. The facilities were located across the states of California, Indiana, Maryland, Pennsylvania, Ohio, and Texas. Three of the facilities were subject to a master lease with Welltower, while two others were subject to master leases with Second Spring and Sabra. The facilities generated annual revenues of $71.7 million and pre-tax loss of $9.7 million. We recorded a gain of $27.9 million on the divestitures, offset by a loss on exit costs of $3.1 million. Additionally, we recognized capital lease and financing obligation net asset write-downs of $44.5 million and capital lease and financing obligation write-downs of $77.0 million associated with four of the facilities. We recorded accelerated depreciation expense of $7.3 million associated with the divestitures. We received an annual rent credit of $0.6 million associated with the divestiture of one of the facilities.\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2018, we divested 6 facilities, consisting of five leased skilled nursing facilities and one owned assisted/senior living facility. The facilities were located across the states of Georgia, Idaho, Montana, and Nevada. Four of the facilities were subject to a master lease with Sabra. The facilities generated annual revenues of $36.8 million and pre-tax income of $3.1 million. We recorded a gain of $0.4 million on the divestitures, offset by a loss on exit costs of $1.1 million. We received an annual rent credit of $0.3 million associated with the divestiture of one of the leased facilities. The owned facility was sold for $2.2 million with net proceeds of $1.9 million being primarily used to pay down indebtedness. Additionally, we recorded a loss of $1.9 million for exit costs associated with the pending closure of certain clinics associated with our rehabilitation services business.\nAcquisitions\nOn June 1, 2019, we acquired the operations of one skilled nursing facility in New Mexico. The new facility has 80 licensed beds and generates approximate annual net revenue of $3.4 million. The facility is leased from Omega and is classified as an operating lease. The facility's 2019 pre-tax net income was de minimis.\nOn November 1, 2018, we acquired the operations of eight skilled nursing facilities and one assisted/senior living facility in New Mexico and Arizona. The nine new facilities have approximately 1,000 beds and generate approximate annual net revenue of $60.0 million. The facilities are leased from Omega. Four of the facilities were classified as capital leases and resulted in an initial capital lease asset and obligation gross up of $14.6 million. The remaining five facilities were initially classified as operating leases.\nLease Transactions\nGains, losses and termination charges associated with master lease terminations and amendments are recorded as non-recurring charges. These amendments and terminations resulted in net gains of $93.8 million and net losses of $21.9 million for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. These gains and losses are included in other income on the consolidated statements of operations.\nWelltower\nDuring the first quarter of 2019, we amended the Welltower Master Lease several times to reflect the lease termination of 24 facilities, including the 15 facilities sold and now leased from the Next Partnership. As a result of the lease termination on the 24 facilities, we received annual rent credits of approximately $23.4 million. A lease modification analysis was performed and the remaining 49 facilities subject to the master lease were reclassified from finance leases to operating leases. Finance lease ROU assets and obligations of $61.5 million and $130.2 million, respectively, were written off. On a net basis, operating lease ROU assets and obligations of $159.8 million and $111.3 million, respectively, were written down, resulting in a gain of $20.3 million.\nDuring the second quarter of 2019, we amended the Welltower Master Lease to reflect the lease termination of two facilities and received annual rent credits of $0.6 million. Operating lease ROU assets and lease obligations of $5.1 million and $5.6 million, respectively, were written off, resulting in a gain of $0.5 million.\nDuring the third quarter of 2019, we amended the Welltower Master Lease to reflect the lease termination of four facilities and received annual rent credits of $1.9 million. Operating lease ROU assets and lease obligations of $102.0 million and $74.4 million, respectively, were written off, resulting in a gain of $27.6 million.\nOmega\nDuring the third quarter of 2019, we amended our master lease with Omega to reflect the lease termination of three facilities subject to the lease and received annual rent credits of $1.9 million. In conjunction with the lease termination, finance lease ROU assets and lease obligations of $10.1 million and $16.8 million, respectively, were written off. Additionally, for those facilities remaining under the master lease, we reassessed the likelihood of exercising our renewal options and concluded that it no longer met the reasonably certain threshold. Consequently, the remaining facilities subject to the master lease were reclassified from finance leases to operating leases and the corresponding ROU assets and liabilities were reduced by $164.6 million and $181.3 million, respectively. The lease termination and remeasurement resulted in an aggregate gain of $23.4 million.\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2019, we amended our master lease with Omega to reflect the inclusion of nine skilled nursing facilities and one assisted living facility in New Mexico and Arizona. These facilities were previously leased from Omega, following the terms of a separate lease agreement, and all facilities were classified as operating leases. There was no change in base rent for the 10 facilities upon addition to master lease. The lease assessment and measurement resulted in operating lease classification with a $10.6 million ROU asset and lease liability gross up. In addition, we received $15.0 million as a short-term note payable in full to Omega by April 30, 2020. See Note 12 - Long-Term Debt - Notes Payable.\u201d\nSecond Spring\nDuring the third quarter of 2019, we amended our master lease with Second Spring to reflect the lease termination of 14 facilities subject to the lease and received annual rent credits of $28.4 million. In conjunction with the lease termination, finance lease ROU assets and lease obligations of $5.9 million and $8.8 million, respectively, were written off and operating lease ROU assets and lease obligations of $202.7 million and $205.4 million, respectively, were written off. Additionally, for those facilities remaining under the master lease, we reassessed the likelihood of exercising our renewal options and concluded that it no longer met the reasonably certain threshold. Consequently, the remaining facilities subject to the master lease were reclassified from finance leases to operating leases and the corresponding ROU assets and liabilities were increased by $54.4 million and $33.3 million, respectively. The lease termination and remeasurement resulted in an aggregate gain of $26.9 million.\nSabra\nWe are party to an agreement with Sabra resulting in permanent and unconditional annual cash rent savings of $19 million effective January 1, 2018. Sabra has pursued and we have supported Sabra's previously announced sale of our leased assets. At the closing of such sales, we have entered into lease agreements with new landlords for a majority of the assets currently leased with Sabra. During the year ended December 31, 2018, Sabra completed the sale of 34 facilities to third party landlords with whom we have entered into new lease agreements. Those transactions are summarized below.\nDuring the second quarter of 2018, Sabra completed the sale and lease termination of 21 facilities, consisting of 20 skilled nursing facilities and one assisted/senior living facility. The facilities were located across nine states. As a result of the sales, we will receive an annual rent credit of $19.4 million for the remainder of the lease term. We continue to operate 12 of the facilities under a new lease with a new landlord, Next Healthcare Capital (Next), as described in Note 16 - \"Related Party Transactions.\" We continue to operate the other nine facilities under a separate lease with a new landlord. The new lease has a ten-year initial term, one five-year renewal option and initial annual rent of $7.4 million. We recognized accelerated depreciation expense of $9.6 million associated with the property and equipment sold and a gain on the write off of certain lease liabilities of $9.9 million.\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2018, Sabra completed the sale and lease termination of 13 skilled nursing facilities located in California, Colorado, Connecticut, and New Mexico. As a result of the sales, we will receive an annual rent credit of $6.7 million for the remainder of the lease term. We continue to operate four of the facilities under a lease agreement with a new landlord. The new lease has a 9.5 year initial term, one five-year renewal option and initial annual rent of $3.4 million. We continue to operate the other nine facilities under a lease agreement with a new landlord. The new lease has a ten-year initial term, one five-year renewal option, and initial annual rent of $3.3 million. We recognized accelerated depreciation expense of $7.4 million associated with the property and equipment sold and a gain on the write off of certain lease liabilities of $6.2 million.\nAs a result of the amendments and lease terminations noted above, we recorded a lease termination charge of $34.1 million in the year ended December 31, 2018, with an offsetting obligation recorded in other long-term liabilities. The charge represents the\ndiscounted residual rents we will continue to pay Sabra on the facilities that have been terminated due to either divestiture or sale to a new landlord. On an undiscounted basis, we were obligated to pay Sabra approximately $41.0 million as of December 31, 2018. This obligation will be repaid over a period of approximately four years ending in 2023.\nOther\nDuring the first quarter of 2019, we amended a master lease agreement for 19 skilled nursing facilities. The amendment extended the lease term by five years through October 31, 2026, removed our option to purchase certain facilities under the lease and adjusted certain financial covenants. We had previously determined that the renewal option period was not reasonably certain of exercise. Upon execution of the amendment, the operating lease ROU assets and obligations were remeasured, resulting in an increase of $77.2 million to both operating lease ROU assets and obligations.\nDuring the third quarter of 2019, we amended a master lease agreement to reflect the lease termination of six facilities subject to the lease. In conjunction with the lease termination, operating lease ROU assets of $4.9 million were written off, resulting in a loss of $4.9 million.\nDuring the second quarter of 2018, we negotiated the extensions of four separate lease agreements resulting in the derecognition of certain lease assets totaling $1.9 million.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2018, the cease to use asset associated with a leased facility divestiture initially recorded during 2017 was further adjusted to reflect changes in the sublease assumption, resulting in a loss of $2.0 million.\nRestructuring Transactions\nOverview\nDuring the first quarter of 2018, we entered into a number of agreements, amendments and new financing facilities further described below in an effort to strengthen significantly our capital structure. In total, the Restructuring Transactions reduced our annual cash fixed charges by approximately $62.0 million beginning in 2018 and also provided $70.0 million of additional cash and borrowing availability, increasing our liquidity and financial flexibility.\nIn connection with the Restructuring Transactions, we entered into a new asset based lending facility agreement, replacing our prior revolving credit facilities, expanding our term loan borrowings, amending our real estate loans with Welltower while refinancing some of those loan amounts through new real estate loans. The new asset based lending facility agreement and real estate loans are financed through MidCap Funding IV Trust and MidCap Financial Trust (collectively, MidCap), respectively. See Note 12 - Long-Term Debt.\u201d We also amended the financial covenants in all of our material loan agreements and all but two of our material master leases. Financial covenants were amended to account for changes in our capital structure as a result of the Restructuring Transactions and to account for the current business climate.\nWelltower Master Lease Amendment\nDuring the first quarter of 2018, we entered into a definitive agreement with Welltower to amend the Welltower Master Lease (the Welltower Master Lease Amendment). The Welltower Master Lease Amendment reduced our annual base rent payment by $35.0 million effective as of January 1, 2018, reduced the annual rent escalator from approximately 2.9% to 2.5% effective on April 1, 2018 and further reduced the annual rent escalator to 2.0% beginning January 1, 2019. In addition, the Welltower Master Lease Amendment extended the initial term of the master lease by five years to January 31, 2037 and extended the optional renewal term of the master lease by five years to December 31, 2048. The Welltower Master Lease Amendment also provides a potential upward rent reset, conditioned upon achievement of certain upside operating metrics, effective January 1, 2023. If triggered, the incremental rent from the reset is capped at $35.0 million.\nOmnibus Agreement\nDuring the first quarter of 2018, we entered into an Omnibus Agreement with Welltower and Omega, pursuant to which Welltower and Omega committed to provide up to $40.0 million in new term loans and amend the current term loan agreement to, among other things, accommodate a refinancing of our existing asset based credit facility, in each case subject to certain conditions, including the completion of a restructuring of certain of our other material debt and lease obligations.\nThe Omnibus Agreement also provided that upon satisfying certain conditions, including raising new capital that is used to pay down certain indebtedness owed to Welltower and Omega, (a) $50.0 million of outstanding indebtedness owed to Welltower would be written off and (b) we may request conversion of not more than $50.0 million of the outstanding balance of our Welltower Real Estate Loans into equity. If the proposed equity conversion would result in any adverse REIT qualification, status or compliance consequences to Welltower, then the debt that would otherwise be converted to equity shall instead be converted into a loan incurring paid in kind interest at 2% per annum compounded quarterly, with a term of ten years commencing on the date the applicable conditions precedent to the equity conversion have been satisfied. Moreover, we agreed to support Welltower in connection with the sale of certain of Welltower's interests in facilities covered by the Welltower Master Lease, including negotiating and entering into definitive new master lease agreements with third party buyers. The conditions described above have not been satisfied as of December 31, 2019.\nIn connection with the Omnibus Agreement, we agreed to issue warrants to Welltower and Omega to purchase 900,000 shares and 600,000 shares, respectively, of our Class A Common Stock at an exercise price equal to $1.33 per share. Issuance of the warrant to Welltower is subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions, which had not occurred as of December 31, 2019. The warrants may be exercised at any time during the period commencing six months from the date of issuance and ending five years from the date of issuance.\nSettlement Agreement\nDuring 2017, we and the U.S. Department of Justice (the DOJ) entered into a settlement agreement regarding four matters arising out of the activities of Skilled Healthcare Group, Inc. (Skilled) or Sun Healthcare Group, Inc. prior to their operations becoming part of our operations (collectively, the Successor Matters). We agreed to the settlement in order to resolve the allegations underlying the Successor Matters and to avoid the uncertainty and expense of litigation.\nThe settlement agreement calls for payment of a collective settlement amount of $52.7 million (the Settlement Amount), including separate Medicaid repayment agreements with each affected state Medicaid program. We will continue to remit the Settlement Amount through January 1, 2022. The remaining outstanding Settlement Amount at December 31, 2019 was $25.7 million, of which $12.1 million is recorded in accrued expenses and $13.6 million is recorded in other long-term liabilities.\nCritical Accounting Policies\nThe consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (U.S. GAAP), which requires us to consolidate company financial information and make informed estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. The most significant estimates in our consolidated financial statements relate to valuation of accounts receivable, self-insured liabilities, income taxes, long-lived assets and goodwill, and other contingencies. Actual results could differ from those estimates.\nRevenue Recognition\nWe adopted Accounting Standards Codification Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606), effective January 1, 2018, using the modified retrospective transition method. There was no cumulative effect on the opening balance of accumulated deficit as a result of adopting the standard as of January 1, 2018. Results for reporting periods beginning after January 1, 2018 are presented under Topic 606, while comparative information has not been restated and continues to be reported under the accounting standards in effect for those periods. See Note 5 - Net Revenues and Accounts Receivable.\u201d\nImpairment of Long-Lived Assets\nOur long-lived assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. Recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to the future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset. If the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its estimated future undiscounted cash flows, an impairment charge is recognized to the extent the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the fair value of the asset. Assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of the carrying amount or the fair value, less costs to sell. See Note 19 - Asset Impairment Charges.\u201d\nSelf-Insurance Reserves\nWe provide for self-insurance reserves for both general and professional liability and workers' compensation claims based on estimates of the ultimate costs for both reported claims and claims incurred but not reported. Estimated losses from asserted and incurred but not reported claims are accrued based on our estimate of the ultimate costs of the claims, which include costs associated with litigating or settling claims, and the relationship of past reported incidents to eventual claims payments. All relevant information, including our own historical experience, the nature and extent of existing asserted claims and reported incidents, and independent actuarial analyses of this information is used in estimating the expected amount of claims. The reserves for loss for workers' compensation risks are discounted based on actuarial estimates of claim payment patterns whereas the reserves for general and professional liability are recorded on an undiscounted basis. We also consider amounts that may be recovered from excess insurance carriers in estimating the ultimate net liability for such risks. See Note 21 - Commitments and Contingencies - Loss Reserves For Certain Self-Insured Programs - General and Professional Liability and Workers' Compensation.\u201d\nIncome Taxes\nOur effective tax rate is based on pretax income, statutory tax rates and tax planning opportunities available in the various jurisdictions in which we operate. We account for income taxes in accordance with applicable guidance on accounting for income taxes, which requires that deferred tax assets and liabilities be recognized using enacted tax rates for the effect of temporary differences between book and tax bases on recorded assets and liabilities. Accounting guidance also requires that deferred tax assets be reduced by a valuation allowance, when it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will not be realized.\nThe recognition and measurement of a tax position is based on management's best judgment given the facts, circumstances and information available at the reporting date. We evaluate tax positions to determine whether the benefits of tax positions are more likely than not of being sustained upon audit based on the technical merits of the tax position. For tax positions that are more likely than not of being sustained upon audit, we recognize the largest amount of the benefit that is greater than 50% likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement in the financial statements. For tax positions that are not more likely than not of being sustained upon audit, we do not recognize any portion of the benefit in the financial statements. If the more likely than not threshold is not met in the period for which a tax position is taken, we may subsequently recognize the benefit of that tax position if the tax matter is effectively settled, the statute of limitations expires, or if the more likely than not threshold is met in a subsequent period.\nWe evaluate, on a quarterly basis, our ability to realize deferred tax assets by assessing our valuation allowance and by adjusting the amount of such allowance, if necessary. The factors used to assess the likelihood of realization are our forecast of pre-tax earnings, our forecast of future taxable income and available tax planning strategies that could be implemented to realize the net deferred tax assets. To the extent we prevail in matters for which reserves have been established, or are required to pay amounts in excess of our reserves, our effective tax rate in a given financial statement period could be materially affected. An unfavorable tax settlement would require use of cash and result in an increase in the effective tax rate in the year of resolution. A favorable tax settlement would be recognized as a reduction in our effective tax rate in the year of resolution. We record accrued interest and penalties associated with uncertain tax\npositions as income tax expense in the consolidated statement of operations.\nLeases\nWe adopted a new leasing standard, FASB ASC Topic 842, Leases (Topic 842), on January 1, 2019 and elected the option to apply the transition requirements thereof at the effective date with the effects of initially applying the new standard recognized as a cumulative-effect adjustment to accumulated deficit in the period of adoption. Consequently, financial information has not been updated for periods prior to January 1, 2019. See Note 2 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies - Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements.\u201d\nWe lease skilled nursing facilities and assisted/senior living facilities, as well as certain office space, land, and equipment. Under Topic 842, we evaluate at contract inception whether a lease exists and recognizes a lease liability and right-of-use (ROU) asset for all leases with a term greater than 12 months. Leases are classified as either finance or operating. While many of our facilities are subject to master lease agreements, leases are assessed, classified, and measured at the facility level.\nAll lease liabilities are measured as the present value of the future lease payments using a discount rate, which is generally our incremental borrowing rate for collateralized borrowings. The future lease payments used to measure the lease liability include both fixed and variable payments that depend on a rate or index, as well as the exercise price of any options to purchase the underlying asset that have been deemed reasonably certain of being exercised. Future lease payments for optional renewal periods that are not reasonably certain of being exercised are excluded from the measurement of the lease liability. Regarding variable payments that depend on a rate or index, the lease liability is measured using the applicable rate or index as of lease commencement and is only remeasured under certain circumstances, such as a change in the lease term. Lease incentives serve to reduce the amount of future lease payments included in the measurement of the lease liability. For all leases, the ROU asset is initially derived from the measurement of the lease liability and adjusted for certain items, such as initial direct costs and lease incentives received. ROU assets are subject to long-lived asset impairment testing.\nAmortization of finance lease ROU assets, which is generally recognized on a straight-line basis over the lesser of the lease term and the estimated useful life of the asset, is included within depreciation and amortization expense in the consolidated statements of operations. Interest expense associated with finance lease liabilities is included within interest expense in the consolidated statements of operations. Operating lease expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term and included within lease expense in the consolidation statements of operations. The lease term is determined based on the date we acquire control of the leased premises through the end of the lease term. Optional renewals periods are not initially included in the lease term unless they are deemed to be reasonably certain of being exercised at lease commencement. For further discussion, see Note 10 - Leases.\u201d\nBusiness Combinations\nOur acquisition strategy is to identify facilities for purchase or lease that are complementary to our current affiliated facilities, accretive to our business or otherwise advance our strategy. The results of all of our operating subsidiaries are included in the accompanying financial statements subsequent to the date of acquisition. Acquisitions are accounted for using the acquisition method of accounting and include leasing and other financing arrangements as well as cash transactions. Assets and liabilities of the acquired entities are recorded at their estimated fair values at the acquisition date. Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of net assets, including the amount assigned to identifiable intangible assets. Given the time it takes to obtain pertinent information to finalize the acquired company's balance sheet, the initial fair value might not be finalized up to one year after the date of acquisition.\nIn developing estimates of fair values for long-lived assets, we utilize a variety of factors including market data, cash flows, growth rates, and replacement costs. Determining the fair value for specifically identified intangible assets involves significant judgment, estimates and projections related to the valuation to be applied to intangible assets such as favorable leases, customer relationships, management contracts and trade names. The subjective nature of management's assumptions increases the risk associated with estimates surrounding the projected performance of the acquired entity. In transactions where significant judgment or other assumptions could have a material impact on the conclusion, we may engage third party specialists to assist in the valuation of the acquired assets and liabilities. Additionally, as we amortize definite-lived acquired intangible assets over time, the purchase accounting allocation directly impacts the amortization expense recorded on the financial statements.\nKey Performance and Valuation Measures\nIn order to assess our financial performance between periods, we evaluate certain key performance and valuation measures for each of our operating segments separately for the periods presented. Results and statistics may not be comparable period-over-period due to the impact of acquisitions and dispositions, or the impact of new and lost therapy contracts.\nThe following is a glossary of terms for some of our key performance and valuation measures and non-GAAP measures:\nActual Patient Days\u201d is defined as the number of residents occupying a bed (or units in the case of an assisted/senior living center) for one qualifying day in that period.\nAdjusted EBITDA\u201d is defined as EBITDA adjusted for newly acquired or constructed businesses with start-up losses and other adjustments to provide a supplemental performance measure. See Reasons for Non-GAAP Financial Disclosure\u201d for an explanation of the adjustments and a description of our uses of, and the limitations associated with, non-GAAP measures.\nAdjusted EBITDAR\u201d is defined as EBITDAR adjusted for newly acquired or constructed businesses with start-up losses and other adjustments to provide a supplemental valuation measure. See Reasons for Non-GAAP Financial Disclosure\u201d for an explanation of the adjustments and a description of our uses of, and the limitations associated with, non-GAAP measures.\nAvailable Patient Days\u201d is defined as the number of available beds (or units in the case of an assisted/senior living center) multiplied by the number of days in that period.\nAverage Daily Census\u201d or ADC\u201d is the number of residents occupying a bed (or units in the case of an assisted/senior living center) over a period of time, divided by the number of calendar days in that period.\nEBITDA\u201d is defined as EBITDAR less lease expense. See Reasons for Non-GAAP Financial Disclosure\u201d for an explanation of the adjustments and a description of our uses of, and the limitations associated with non-GAAP measures.\nEBITDAR\u201d is defined as net income or loss attributable to Genesis Healthcare, Inc. before net income or loss of non-controlling interests, net income or loss from discontinued operations, depreciation and amortization expense, interest expense and lease expense. See Reasons for Non-GAAP Financial Disclosure\u201d for an explanation of the adjustments and a description of our uses of, and the limitations associated with non-GAAP measures.\nInsurance\u201d refers collectively to commercial insurance and managed care payor sources, including Medicare Advantage beneficiaries, but does not include managed care payors serving Medicaid residents, which are included in the Medicaid category.\nOccupancy Percentage\u201d is measured as the percentage of Actual Patient Days relative to the Available Patient Days.\nSkilled Mix\u201d refers collectively to Medicare and Insurance payor sources.\nTherapist Efficiency\u201d is computed by dividing billable labor minutes related to patient care and customer value added services by total labor minutes for the period.\nKey performance and valuation measures for our businesses are set forth below, followed by a comparison and analysis of our financial results:\nTable 38: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nYear ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nFinancial Results (in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nFinancial Performance Measures:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nNet revenues (GAAP)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n4,565,834\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n4,976,650\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nNet income (loss) attributable to Genesis Healthcare, Inc.

respiratory therapy services.\nReasons for Non-GAAP Financial Disclosure\nThe following discussion includes references to Adjusted EBITDAR, EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA, which are non-GAAP financial measures (collectively, Non-GAAP Financial Measures). A Non-GAAP Financial Measure is a numerical measure of a registrant's value, historical or future financial performance, financial position and cash flows that excludes amounts, or is subject to adjustments that have the effect of excluding amounts, that are included in the most directly comparable financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP in the statement of operations, balance sheet or statement of cash flows (or equivalent statements) of the registrant; or includes amounts, or is subject to adjustments that have the effect of including amounts, that are excluded from the most directly comparable financial measure so calculated and presented. In this regard, GAAP refers to generally accepted accounting principles in the United States. We have provided reconciliations of the Non-GAAP Financial Measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures.\nWe believe the presentation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures provides useful information to investors regarding our results of operations because these financial measures are useful for trending, analyzing and benchmarking the performance and value of our business. By excluding certain expenses and other items that may not be indicative of our core business operating results, these Non-GAAP Financial Measures:\n\uf0b7allow investors to evaluate our performance from management's perspective, resulting in greater transparency with respect to supplemental information used by us in our financial and operational decision making;\n\uf0b7facilitate comparisons with prior periods and reflect the principal basis on which management monitors financial performance;\n\uf0b7facilitate comparisons with the performance of others in the post-acute industry;\n\uf0b7provide better transparency as to the measures used by management and others who follow our industry to estimate the value of our company; and\n\uf0b7allow investors to view our financial performance and condition in the same manner as our significant landlords and lenders require us to report financial information to them in connection with determining our compliance with financial covenants.\nWe use two Non-GAAP Financial Measures primarily (EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA) as performance measures and believe that the GAAP financial measure most directly comparable to these two Non-GAAP Financial Measures is net income (loss) attributable to Genesis Healthcare, Inc. We use one Non-GAAP Financial Measure (Adjusted EBITDAR) as a valuation measure and believe that the GAAP financial measure most directly comparable to this Non-GAAP Financial Measure is net income (loss) attributable to Genesis Healthcare, Inc. We use Non-GAAP Financial Measures to assess the value of our business and the performance of our operating businesses, as well as the employees responsible for operating such businesses. Non-GAAP Financial Measures are useful in this regard because they do not include such costs as interest expense, income taxes and depreciation and amortization expense which may vary from business unit to business unit depending upon such factors as the method used to finance the original purchase of the business unit or the tax law in the state in which a business unit operates. By excluding such factors when measuring financial performance, many of which are outside of the control of the employees responsible for operating our business units, we are better able to evaluate value and the operating performance of the business unit and the employees responsible for business unit performance. Consequently, we use these\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures to determine the extent to which our employees have met performance goals, and therefore the extent to which they may or may not be eligible for incentive compensation awards.\nWe also use Non-GAAP Financial Measures in our annual budget process. We believe these Non-GAAP Financial Measures facilitate internal comparisons to historical operating performance of prior periods and external comparisons to competitors' historical operating performance. The presentation of these Non-GAAP Financial Measures is consistent with our past practice and we believe these measures further enable investors and analysts to compare current non-GAAP measures with non-GAAP measures presented in prior periods.\nAlthough we use Non-GAAP Financial Measures as financial measures to assess value and the performance of our business, the use of these Non-GAAP Financial Measures is limited because they do not consider certain material costs necessary to operate the business. These costs include our lease expense (only in the case of Adjusted EBITDAR), the cost to service debt, the depreciation and amortization associated with our long-lived assets, gains (losses) on early extinguishment of debt, transaction costs, long-lived asset impairment charges, federal and state income tax expenses, the operating results of our discontinued businesses and the loss attributable to non-controlling interests. Because Non-GAAP Financial Measures do not consider these important elements of our cost structure, a user of our financial information who relies on Non-GAAP Financial Measures as the only measures of our performance could draw an incomplete or misleading conclusion regarding our financial performance. Consequently, a user of our financial information should consider net income (loss) attributable to Genesis Healthcare, Inc. as an important measure of its financial performance because it provides the most complete measure of our performance.\nOther companies may define Non-GAAP Financial Measures differently and, as a result, our Non-GAAP Financial Measures may not be directly comparable to those of other companies. Non-GAAP Financial Measures do not represent net income (loss), as defined by GAAP. Non-GAAP Financial Measures should be considered in addition to, not a substitute for, or superior to, GAAP Financial Measures.\nWe use the following Non-GAAP Financial Measures that we believe are useful to investors as key valuation and operating performance measures:\nEBITDA\nWe believe EBITDA is useful to an investor in evaluating our operating performance because it helps investors evaluate and compare the results of our operations from period to period by removing the impact of our capital structure (interest expense) and our asset base (depreciation and amortization expense) from our operating results. In addition, financial covenants in our debt agreements use EBITDA as a measure of compliance.\nAdjustments to EBITDA\nWe adjust EBITDA when evaluating our performance because we believe that the exclusion of certain additional items described below provides useful supplemental information to investors regarding our ongoing operating performance, in the case of Adjusted EBITDA. We believe that the presentation of Adjusted EBITDA, when combined with GAAP net income (loss) attributable to Genesis Healthcare, Inc., and EBITDA, is beneficial to an investor's complete understanding of our operating performance. In addition, such adjustments are substantially similar to the adjustments to EBITDA provided for in the financial covenant calculations contained in our lease and debt agreements.\nWe adjust EBITDA for the following items:\nTable 41: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(Gain) loss on early extinguishment of debt. We recognize gains or losses on the early extinguishment of debt when we refinance our debt prior to its original term, requiring us to write-off any unamortized deferred financing fees. We exclude the effect of gains or losses recorded on the early extinguishment of debt because we believe these gains and losses do not accurately reflect the underlying performance of our operating businesses.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 42: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nOther income.

We exclude non-cash long-lived asset impairment charges because we believe including them does not reflect the ongoing operating performance of our operating businesses.

We exclude severance costs from planned reduction in force initiatives associated with restructuring activities intended to adjust our cost structure in response to changes in the business environment.

The acquisition and construction of new businesses is an element of our growth strategy. Many of the businesses we acquire have a history of operating losses and continue to generate operating losses in the months that follow our acquisition. Newly constructed or developed businesses also generate losses while in their start-up phase. We view these losses as both temporary and an expected component of our long-term investment in the new venture. We adjust these losses when computing Adjusted EBITDA in order to better analyze the performance of our mature ongoing business. The activities of such businesses are adjusted when computing Adjusted EBITDA until such time as a new business generates positive Adjusted EBITDA. The operating performance of new businesses is no longer adjusted when computing Adjusted EBITDA beginning in the period in which a new business generates positive Adjusted EBITDA and all periods thereafter. The divestiture of underperforming or non-strategic facilities is also an element of our business strategy. We eliminate the results of divested facilities beginning in the quarter in which they become divested. We view the losses associated with the wind-down of such divested facilities as not indicative of the performance of our ongoing operating businesses.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 48: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nStock-based compensation.

This incentive was estimated to be earned and recognized between 2015 and 2016 within our physician services line of business. We do not believe the excluded costs are recurring or reflect the underlying performance of our operating businesses.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nAdjusted EBITDAR\nWe use Adjusted EBITDAR as one measure in determining the value of our business and the value of prospective acquisitions or divestitures. Adjusted EBITDAR is also a commonly used measure to estimate the enterprise value of businesses in the healthcare and other industries. In addition, financial covenants in our lease agreements use Adjusted EBITDAR as a measure of compliance. The adjustments made and previously described in the computation of Adjusted EBITDA are also made when computing Adjusted EBITDAR. See the reconciliation of net loss attributable to Genesis Healthcare, Inc. included herein.\nSupplemental Information\nWe provide supplemental information about certain capital costs we believe are beneficial to an investor's understanding of our capital structure and cash flows. This supplemental information includes (1) cash interest payments on our recourse and HUD guaranteed indebtedness (2) cash rent payments made to partially owned real estate joint ventures that is eliminated in consolidation, net of any distributions returned to us, and (3) total cash lease payments made pursuant to operating leases, finance leases and financing obligations.\nThis supplemental information is used by us to evaluate our leverage, fixed charge coverage and cash flow.

expansion in core markets and operating segments which we believe will enhance the value of our business in the ever-changing landscape of national healthcare. We are also focused on right-sizing\u201d our operations to fit that new environment and to divest underperforming and non-strategic assets.\nWe define our same-store inpatient operations as those skilled nursing and assisted/senior living centers which have been operated by us, in a steady-state, for each comparable period in this Results of Operations discussion. We exclude from that definition those skilled nursing and assisted/senior living facilities recently acquired that were not operated by us for the entire period, as well as those that were divested prior to or during the most recent period presented. In cases where we are developing new skilled nursing or\nassisted/senior living centers, those operations are excluded from our same-store\u201d inpatient operations until the revenue driven by operating patient census is stable in the comparable periods.\nBecause our rehabilitation therapy services operations experiences a high volume of both new and terminated contracts in an annual cycle, and the scale and significance of those contracts can be very different to both the revenue and operating expenses of that business, a same-store presentation based solely on the contract or gym count does not provide an accurate depiction of the business. Accordingly, we do not reference same-store figures in this MD&A with regard to that business.\nThe volume of services delivered in our other services businesses can also be affected by strategic transactional activity. To the extent there are businesses to be excluded to achieve same-store comparability those will be noted in the context of the Results of Operations discussion.\nYear Ended December 31, 2019 Compared

December 31, 2018 decreased by $410.8 million, or 8.3%.\nInpatient Services - Revenue decreased $340.8 million, or 7.9%, for the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared with the same period in 2018. On a same-store basis, inpatient services revenue increased $64.0 million, or 1.8%, excluding 99 divested underperforming facilities and the acquisition or development of 12 additional facilities. Included in the same-store revenue increase is $19.0 million related to a new provider tax program in the state of New Mexico for the period July 1, 2019 through December 31, 2019, which was not in place for the corresponding period in 2018. An additional $10.0 million of the increase in the year ended December 31, 2019 is attributed to the transition from RUGs based reimbursement to the PDPM reimbursement methodology in the fourth fiscal quarter of 2019. The remaining $35.0 million same-store increase is due to increasing census volume and payor rates, primarily in our Medicaid population, partially offset by continued decline in the skilled mix of our inpatient facilities. For the past several years, census and skilled mix trends have been affected by healthcare reforms resulting in lower lengths of stay among our skilled patient population and lower admissions caused by initiatives among acute care providers, managed care payors and conveners to divert certain skilled nursing referrals to home health or other community-based care settings. While overall census is recovering as compared with the\npreceding year, the skilled mix continued to decline. We believe population demographics will present opportunities in the near future to recapture census, and to some extent skilled mix, where it was lost through reform measures. Over the course of the year ended December 31, 2019, we saw overall same-store occupancy rates exceed that of the same period in 2018 by over 90 basis points. However, at the same time, same-store skilled mix in the year ended December 31, 2019 lagged the same period in 2018 by nearly 90 basis points.\nFor an expanded discussion regarding the factors influencing our census trends, see Item 1, Business - Recent Legislative, Regulatory and other Governmental Actions Affecting Revenue\u201d in this Form 10-K, as well as the Key Performance and Valuation Measures in this Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations for quantification of the census trends and revenue per patient day.\nRehabilitation Therapy Services - Revenue decreased $85.4 million, or 15.6% for the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared with the same period in 2018. Of that decrease, $67.0 million is due to lost contract business, offset by $21.5 million attributed to new contracts. The remaining decrease of $39.9 million is principally due to reduced volume of services provided to existing customers and amended customer pricing terms in connection with the implementation of PDPM.\nOther Services - Revenue increased $15.4 million, or 11.7% for the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared with the same period in 2018. Our other services revenue is comprised mainly of our physician services and staffing services businesses, in addition to our ACO. In the year ended December 31, 2019, the ACO recognized revenue of $10.8 million under MSSP. There was no MSSP revenue recognized in the comparable period in 2018. Revenue in our physician services business increased $8.8 million in the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared with the same period in 2018. Our staffing services business accounts for the remaining decrease in other services revenue of $4.2 million. While the staffing business gross revenue has increased 19.5% in the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared with the same period in 2018, its revenue from external customers has decreased 4.2% over that same period. This decrease is the result of a shift in focus of that business to expand its services to our affiliated nursing facilities and therapy gyms. Prioritizing our internal staffing needs is a strategic goal for our staffing business, amid record low unemployment nationally.\nEBITDA\nEBITDA for the year ended December 31, 2019 increased by $3.0 million, or 1.0% as compared with the same period in 2018. Excluding the impact of (gain) loss on early extinguishment of debt, other (income) loss, transaction costs, long-lived asset impairments, and goodwill and identifiable intangible asset impairments, EBITDA decreased $255.3 million, or 58.3% when compared with the same period in 2018. The contributing factors for this net increase are described in our discussion below of segment results and corporate overhead.\nInpatient Services - EBITDA decreased $23.1 million, or 5.9% in the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared with the same period in 2018. Excluding the impact of other (income) loss, long-lived asset impairments and goodwill and identifiable intangible asset impairments, EBITDA decreased $272.5 million, or 55.8% when compared with the same period in 2018. On a same-store basis, the inpatient EBITDA decreased $243.1 million. Of that same-store decline, lease expense increased $254.6 million, principally resulting from the adoption of Topic 842, which became effective on January 1, 2019. The impact to our financial position and statements of operation from the adoption of this accounting standard is more fully described in Note 2 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies - Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements.\u201d See also Note 10 - Leases.\u201d Our self-insurance programs resulted in an increase of $4.1 million EBITDA in the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared with the same period in 2018. While our self-insurance programs are performing as anticipated with reduced volumes related to the implementation of our portfolio optimization strategies and within normal claims reporting patterns of our same-store operations, we are also seeing reduced pressures particularly in our general and professional liability claims experience. The reduction in the provision for general and professional liability for the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared with the same period in 2018 is the result of favorable prior year claim development and lower current year loss exposures. The favorable development is due to the combination of the ongoing impact of tort reform, claim settlements, and other risk management initiatives. Offsetting some of the positive trends in professional liability experience, self-insured health benefits on the same-store population saw an increase over the prior year due to some singularly large claims that presented throughout 2019. Same-store staffing costs, net of nursing agency and other purchased services, increased $40.9 million. Nursing wage inflation increased 4.2% while non-nursing wage inflation increased 2.6% in the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared with the same period in 2018. The introduction of the new provider tax program in New Mexico for period July 1, 2019 through December 31, 2019 resulting in an increase of EBITDA of $10.5 million compared to the same period in 2018 before the program was enacted. The remaining $37.8 million increase in EBITDA, as adjusted, of the segment is attributed to ongoing expense\nmanagement, reduced therapy services cost due to the implementation of PDPM and increased census volume in our skilled nursing facilities, partially offset by the continued pressures on skilled mix of our inpatient facilities described above under Net Revenues.\u201d\nRehabilitation Therapy Services - EBITDA decreased by $9.3 million or 9.1% for the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared with the same period in 2018. Excluding the impact of other (income) loss, EBITDA decreased $12.2 million when compared with the same period in 2018. Lost therapy contracts exceeded new contracts and service fees by $10.7 million. The remaining decrease of $1.5 million is principally attributed to the net impact of amended customer pricing terms in connection with the implementation of PDPM offset by a reduction in force of employed therapist, further offset with reductions in overhead and reductions of start-up losses in our operations in China. Therapist efficiency improved to 68.0% in the year ended December 31, 2019 compared with 63.7% in the comparable period in the prior year.\nOther Services - EBITDA increased $23.1 million or 217.3% for the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared with the same period in 2018. Of this amount, the ACO contributed $4.2 million, most of which was due to the low cost structure and no revenue recognized in that business in the comparable 2018 period. The remaining increase of $18.9 million pertains to our physician services business. The year ended December 31, 2018 included charges of $13.0 million to write down accounts receivable to its realizable fair value. Those charges did not recur in 2019. The remaining increase of $5.9 million in our physician services business was principally driven by increased physician and nurse practitioner encounters, coupled with improved reimbursement rates, partially offset by increased administrative costs of practice management.\nCorporate and Eliminations - EBITDA increased $12.3 million or 7.0% in the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared with the same period in 2018. EBITDA of our corporate function includes (gains) losses on early extinguishment of debt and losses associated with transactions that are outside of the scope of our reportable segments. These and other transactions, which are separately captioned in our consolidated statements of operations and described more fully above in our Reasons for Non-GAAP Financial Disclosure, contributed $6.0 million of the net decrease in Corporate and Eliminations EBITDA. Corporate overhead costs decreased $4.7 million, or 3.2%, in the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared with the same period in 2018. The remaining increase in EBITDA of $1.6 million is primarily the result of an increase in investment earnings from our unconsolidated affiliates accounted for on the equity method and other investments.\nOther income - In the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, we completed multiple transactions, including the divestitures of numerous owned assets and the termination and refinancing of certain facilities subject to lease agreements. See Note 4 - Significant Transactions and Events.\u201d These transactions resulted in net gains of $173.5 million and $12.9 million for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. See Note 18 - Other Income.\u201d\nTransaction costs - In the normal course of business, we evaluate strategic acquisition, disposition and business development opportunities. The costs to pursue these opportunities, when incurred, vary from period to period depending on the nature of the transaction pursued and if those transactions are ever completed. Transaction costs incurred for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 were $26.4 million and $32.0 million, respectively.\nLong-lived asset impairments - In the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, we recognized impairments of property and equipment of $16.9 million and $105.0 million, respectively. For more information about the conditions of the business which contributed to these impairments, see Note 19 - Asset Impairment Charges - Long-Lived Assets with a Definite Useful Life.\u201d\nGoodwill and identifiable intangible asset impairments - In the year ended December 31, 2018, we recognized impairment of identifiable intangible favorable lease assets of $3.5 million. For more information about the conditions of the business which contributed to these impairments, see Industry Trends and Recent Regulatory Governmental Actions Affecting Revenue\u201d and Financial Condition and Liquidity Considerations\u201d in this MD&A, as well as Note 19 - Asset Impairment Charges - Identifiable Intangible Assets with a Definite Useful Life.\u201d\nOther Expense\nThe following discussion applies to the expense categories between EBITDA and income (loss) of all reportable segments and corporate and eliminations in our consolidating statement of operations for the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared with the same period in 2018.\nDepreciation and amortization - Each of our reportable segments and corporate overhead have depreciating property, plant and equipment, including amortization of finance leased ROU assets. Our rehabilitation therapy services and other services have identifiable intangible assets which amortize over the estimated life of those identifiable assets. Depreciation and amortization expense decreased $97.7 million in the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared with the same period in 2018. On a same-store basis, depreciation and amortization decreased $75.4 million in the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared with the same period in 2018. Of this decrease, approximately $75.4 million resulted from the adoption of Topic 842, which was effective on January 1, 2019. The impact to our financial position and statements of operation from the adoption of this accounting standard is more fully described in Note 2 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies - Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements\u201d and Note 10 - Leases.\u201d\nInterest expense - Interest expense includes the cash interest and non-cash adjustments required to account for our debt instruments, as well as the expense associated with leases accounted for as finance leases or financing obligations. Interest expense decreased $283.3 million in the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared with the same period in 2018. On a same-store basis, interest expense decreased $259.6 million in the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared with the same period in 2018. Of this decrease, approximately $282.6 million resulted from the adoption of Topic 842, which was effective on January 1, 2019. The impact to our financial position and statements of operation from the adoption of this accounting standard is more fully described in Note 2 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies - Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements\u201d and Note 10 - Leases.\u201d The decrease was offset by $23.0 million that is principally the result of higher rates of interest incurred in the year ended December 31, 2019 on the debt instruments impacted by the financial restructuring, which was not fully realized in the prior year period, in addition to consolidating debt and the associated interest expense of two real-estate partnerships in 2019, which were determined to be VIEs of which we are the primary beneficiary. See Note 1 - General Information - Basis of Presentation\u201d and Note 12 - Long-Term Debt.\u201d\nIncome tax expense (benefit) - For the year ended December 31, 2019, we recorded income tax expense of $1.8 million, representing an effective tax rate of 19.0% compared to an income tax benefit of $2.4 million, representing an effective tax rate of 0.7% for the same period in 2018. There is a full valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets, excluding our deferred tax asset on our Bermuda captive insurance company's discounted unpaid loss reserve. Previously, in assessing the requirement for, and amount of, a valuation allowance in accordance with the standard, we determined it was more likely than not we would not realize our deferred tax assets and established a valuation allowance against the deferred tax assets. As of December 31, 2019, we have determined that the valuation allowance is still necessary.\nNet Loss Attributable to Genesis Healthcare, Inc.\nThe following discussion applies to categories between net income (loss) and net income (loss) attributable to Genesis Healthcare, Inc. in our consolidated statements of operations for the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared with the same period in 2018.\nNet loss attributable to noncontrolling interests - Following the combination of Skilled and FC-GEN Operations Investment, LLC (FC-GEN), direct noncontrolling economic interest was recorded as noncontrolling interest in the financial statements of the combined entity. The direct noncontrolling economic interest is in the form of Class C common stock of FC-GEN that are exchangeable on a 1-to-1 basis to our public shares. The direct noncontrolling economic interest will continue to decrease as Class C common stock of FC-GEN are exchanged for public shares. Since the combination, there have been conversions of 8.3 million Class C common stock reducing the initial, approximately 42% direct noncontrolling economic interest to 33.9% at December 31, 2019. For the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, income (loss) of $2.8 million and $(139.2) million, respectively, has been attributed to the Class C common stock.\nIn addition to the noncontrolling interests attributable to the Class C common stock holders, our consolidated financial statements include the accounts of all entities controlled by us through our ownership of a majority voting interest and the accounts of any variable interest entities (VIEs) where we are subject to a majority of the risk of loss from the VIE's activities, or entitled to receive a majority of the entity's residual returns, or both. We adjust net income attributable to Genesis Healthcare, Inc. to exclude the net income attributable to the third party ownership interests of the VIEs. For the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, (loss) income of $(9.9) million and $2.0 million, respectively, has been attributed to these unaffiliated third parties.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nThe following table presents selected data from our consolidated statements of cash flows (in thousands):\nTable 56: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nYear ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nNet cash (used in) provided by operating activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n(7,166)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n18,584\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nNet cash (used in) provided by investing activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(387,003)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n11,876\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nNet cash provided by financing activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n377,699\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n53,178\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nNet (decrease) increase in cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash and equivalents\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(16,470)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n83,638\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nBeginning of period\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n142,276\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n58,638\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nEnd of period\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n125,806\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n142,276\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nNet cash used in operating activities in the year ended December 31, 2019 of $7.2 million was unfavorably impacted by funded transaction costs of approximately $22.3 million. Adjusted for transaction costs, net cash provided by operating activities in the year ended December 31, 2019 would have been approximately $15.1 million. Net cash provided by operating activities in the year ended December 31, 2018 was unfavorably impacted by funded transaction costs of approximately $32.0 million. Adjusted for funded transaction costs, net cash provided by operating activities in the year ended December 31, 2018 would have been $50.6 million. In addition to transaction costs, operating cash flow activities in the year ended December 31, 2019 were unfavorably impacted by the timing associated with the collection of outstanding accounts receivable and payments of certain self-insured liabilities.\nNet cash used in investing activities in the year ended December 31, 2019 was $387.0 million, compared to cash provided by investing activities of $11.9 million in the year ended December 31, 2018. Cash used for routine capital expenditures for the year ended December 31, 2019 increased from the same period in the prior year by $11.6 million. Net sales and maturities of marketable securities of $0.9 million in 2019 exceeded net purchases of marketable securities of $10.5 million in 2018, resulting in a net reduction in cash used of $11.3 million. In the year ended December 31, 2019, there were asset purchases of $252.5 million as a result of the consolidation of the Next Partnership and its acquisition of 22 skilled nursing facilities and asset sale proceeds of $79.0 million resulting from the simultaneous sale of seven skilled nursing facilities as described in Significant Transaction and Events - Strategic Partnerships - Next Partnership.\u201d In the year ended December 31, 2019, there were asset purchases of $339.2 million as a result of the consolidation of the Vantage Point Partnership and its acquisition of 18 skilled nursing facilities as described in Significant Transaction and Events - Strategic Partnerships - Vantage Point Partnership.\u201d In the year ended December 31, 2018, there were no asset purchases. The year ended December 31, 2019 also included $66.9 million in proceeds from the sale of seven facilities in California, $91.7 million in proceeds from the sale of eight facilities in Georgia, New Jersey, Virginia and Maryland and $20.2 million from the sale of seven facilities in Texas. The year ended December 31, 2018, included proceeds of $74.4 million from the sale of 15 owned skilled nursing facilities in Texas and one assisted/senior living facility in Nevada. The year ended December 31, 2019 also included the receipt of a $12.0 million payment of a note receivable. The remaining incremental use of cash from investing activities of $2.4 million in the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared with the same period in 2018 is principally due to an increase in restricted deposit payments.\nNet cash provided by financing activities in the year ended December 31, 2019 was $377.7 million compared to net cash provided by financing activities of $53.2 million in the year ended December 31, 2018. The net increase in cash provided by financing activities of $324.5 million is principally attributed to debt borrowings exceeding debt repayments in the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared to the same period in 2018. In the year ended December 31, 2019, we received proceeds from the issuance of debt of $538.5 million, consisting primarily of $479.4 from the consolidation of the Next Partnership and Vantage Point Partnership, $41.7 million due to the refinancing of three facilities within the Next Partnership with HUD financing and $15.0 million due to a short-term loan from Omega. In the year ended December 31, 2018, we received proceeds from the issuance of debt of $574.2 million, consisting primarily of $438.0 million from the ABL Credit Facilities, $83.0 million from proceeds from the MidCap Real Estate Loans, $40.0 million from the expanded Term Loan Agreement and $10.9 million from the refinancing of a bridge loan with a HUD insured loan. Repayment of long-term debt in the year ended December 31, 2019 was $199.6 million compared to $544.1 million in the same period of the prior year. In the year ended December 31, 2019, we repaid $39.8 million in MidCap Real Estate Loans and $65.6 million in HUD-insured loans using proceeds from the sale of 19 facilities; reduced the term loan facility of the ABL Credit Facilities by $40.0 million while increasing the revolving credit facilities by the same amount; and the Next Partnership reduced its term loan by $38.8 million refinancing three facilities through HUD. In the year ended December 31, 2018, we repaid $363.2 million in the retirement of our prior revolving credit facilities, $85.5 million in the paydown of Welltower Real Estate Loans, $51.9 million in the retirement of HUD insured loans for divested skilled nursing facilities, $10.0 million in the retirement of a mortgage on a corporate office building and $9.9 million in the payoff of a bridge loan with the proceeds from a HUD-insured refinancing. The remaining decrease in cash used to repay long-term debt of $8.2 million relates to a decrease in routine debt payments. In the year ended December 31, 2019, we had net\nborrowings under the revolving credit facilities of $30.3 million as compared with $42.6 million of net repayments under the revolving credit facilities in the same period in 2018. In the year ended December 31, 2019, we paid debt issuance costs of $10.2 million resulting from financing activities associated with the consolidation of the Next Partnership and the Vantage Point Partnership compared to debt issuance costs of $17.0 million, which includes $13.6 million in fees for the ABL Credit Facilities and $3.2 million in fees for the MidCap Real Estate Loans in 2018. In the year ended December 31, 2019, we received contributions from a noncontrolling interest for $18.5 million and $8.5 million resulting from the consolidation of the aforementioned Next Partnership and Vantage Point Partnership, respectively, compared to no contributions from noncontrolling interests in 2018. The remaining net increase in cash used in financing activities of $5.9 million in the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to the same period in 2018 is primarily due to an increase in distributions to noncontrolling interests and repayments of finance lease obligations offset by a reduction in debt settlement costs.\nOur primary sources of liquidity are cash on hand, cash flows from operations, and borrowings under our ABL Credit Facilities.\nThe objectives of our capital planning strategy are to ensure we maintain adequate liquidity and flexibility. Pursuing and achieving those objectives allows us to support the execution of our operating and strategic plans and weather temporary disruptions in the capital markets and general business environment. Maintaining adequate liquidity is a function of our results of operations, restricted and unrestricted cash and cash equivalents and our available borrowing capacity.\nAt December 31, 2019, we had total liquidity of $90.0 million consisting of cash on hand of $74.5 million and available borrowings under our ABL Credit Facilities of $15.5 million. During the year ended December 31, 2019, we maintained liquidity sufficient to meet our working capital, capital expenditure and development activities.\nRecent Developments Potentially Affecting our Results of Operations\nAs the recent outbreak of the coronavirus (COVID-19) continues to spread throughout areas in which we operate, we believe the outbreak has the potential to have a negative impact on our operating results and financial condition. The extent of the impact of COVID-19 on our operational and financial performance will depend on certain developments, including the duration and spread of the outbreak, impact on our patients, employees and vendors, all of which are uncertain and cannot be predicted. Given these uncertainties, we cannot reasonably estimate the related impact to our business, operating results and financial condition, if any.\nStrategic Partnerships\nNext Partnership\nOn January 31, 2019, Welltower sold the real estate of 15 facilities to the Next Partnership, of which we acquired a 46% membership interest for $16.0 million. The remaining interest is held by Next, a related party. See Note 16 - Related Party Transactions.\u201d In conjunction with the facility sales, we received aggregate annual rent credits of $17.2 million. We continue to operate these facilities pursuant to a new master lease with the Next Partnership. The term of the master lease is 15 years with two five-year renewal options available. We will pay annual rent of $19.5 million, with no rent escalators for the first five years and an escalator of 2% beginning in the sixth lease year and thereafter. We also obtained a fixed price purchase option to acquire all of the real property of the facilities. The purchase option is exercisable between lease years five and seven, reducing in price each successive year down to a 10% premium over the original purchase price.\nVantage Point Partnership\nOn September 12, 2019, Welltower and Second Spring sold the real estate of four and 14 facilities, respectively, to the Vantage Point Partnership, in which we invested $37.5 million for an approximate 30% membership interest. The remaining membership interest is held by Vantage Point for an investment of $85.3 million consisting of an equity investment of $8.5 million and a formation loan of $76.8 million. In conjunction with the facility sales, we received aggregate annual rent credits of $30.3 million. We continue to operate these facilities pursuant to a new master lease with the Vantage Point Partnership. The term of the master lease is 15 years with two five-year renewal options available. We will pay annual rent of approximately $33.1 million, with no rent escalators for the first four years and an escalator of 2% beginning in the fifth lease year and thereafter. We also obtained a fixed price purchase option to acquire all of the real property of the facilities. The purchase option is exercisable during certain periods in fiscal years 2024 and 2025 for a 10% premium over the original purchase price. Further, Vantage Point holds a put option that would require us to acquire its\nmembership interests in the Vantage Point Partnership. The put option becomes exercisable if we opt not to purchase the facilities or upon the occurrence of certain events of default.\nNewGen Partnership\nOn February 1, 2020, we transitioned operational responsibility for 19 facilities in the states of California, Washington and Nevada to NewGen. We sold the real estate and operations of six skilled nursing facilities and transferred the leasehold rights to 13 skilled nursing, behavioral health and assisted living facilities for a total of $78.9 million. We will retain a 50% interest in the facilities. Net transaction proceeds were used by us to repay indebtedness, including prepayment fees, of $33.7 million, fund our initial equity contribution and working capital requirement of approximately $15.0 million, and provide financing to the partnership of $9.0 million. Concurrently, the facilities have entered, or will enter upon regulatory approval, into management services agreements with NewGen for the day-to-day operations of the facilities. We will continue to provide administrative and back office services to the facilities pursuant to administrative support agreements, as well as therapy services pursuant to therapy services agreements. We are currently assessing whether we will continue to consolidate the financial statements of these facilities for financial reporting purposes.\nRestructuring Transactions\nOverview\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2018, we entered into a number of agreements, amendments and new financing facilities further described below in an effort to strengthen significantly our capital structure. In total, the Restructuring Transactions are estimated to reduce our annual cash fixed charges by approximately $62.0 million beginning in 2018 and provided $70.0 million of additional cash and borrowing availability, increasing our liquidity and financial flexibility.\nIn connection with the Restructuring Transactions, we entered into a new asset based lending facility agreement, replacing our prior revolving credit facilities and eliminating its forbearance agreement. Also in connection with the Restructuring Transactions, we amended the financial covenants in all of our material loan agreements and all but two of our material master leases. Financial covenants beginning in 2018 were amended to account for changes in our capital structure as a result of the Restructuring Transactions and to account for the current business climate.\nAsset Based Lending Facilities\nOn March 6, 2018, we entered into the ABL Credit Facilities agreement with MidCap. The agreement provides for a $555 million asset based lending facility comprised of (a) a $325 million first lien term loan facility, (b) a $200 million first lien revolving credit facility and (c) a $30 million delayed draw term loan facility. The commitments under the delayed draw term loan facility will be reduced to $20 million in the year 2020. Proceeds were used to replace and repay in full our existing $525 million revolving credit facilities.\nOn June 5, 2019, the ABL Credit Facilities were amended to simultaneously increase the aggregate revolving credit facility commitment by $40.0 million and partially prepay the first lien term loan facility by $40.0 million. The resulting commitment levels of the revolving credit facility and first lien term loan facility were $240.0 million and $285.0 million, respectively.\nThe ABL Credit Facilities have a five-year term set to mature on March 6, 2023. The ABL Credit Facilities include a springing maturity clause that would accelerate its maturity 90 days prior to the maturity of the Term Loan Agreements, Welltower Real Estate Loans or MidCap Real Estate Loans, in the event those agreements are not extended or refinanced. The revolving credit facility includes a swinging lockbox arrangement whereby we transfer all funds deposited within its designated lockboxes to MidCap on a daily basis and then draw from the revolving credit facility as needed. We have presented the entire revolving credit facility borrowings balance of $136.0 million in current installments of long-term debt at December 31, 2019 and 2018. Despite this classification, we expect that we will have the ability to borrow and repay on the revolving credit facility through its maturity date. Cash proceeds of $50.6 million received under the ABL Credit Facilities remain in a restricted account. This amount is pledged to cash collateralize letters of credit previously issued under the retired revolving credit facilities. We have classified this deposit and all cash account balances subject to deposit account control agreements that were sprung under the ABL Credit Facilities as restricted cash and equivalents within the consolidated balance sheets at December 31, 2019 and 2018.\nBorrowings under the term loan and revolving credit facility components of the ABL Credit Facilities bear interest at a 90-day LIBOR rate (subject to a floor of 0.5%) plus an applicable margin of 6%. Borrowings under the delayed draw component bear interest at a 90-day LIBOR rate (subject to a floor of 1%) plus an applicable margin of 11%. Borrowing levels under the term loan and revolving credit facility components of the ABL Credit Facilities are limited to a borrowing base that is computed based upon the level of eligible accounts receivable.\nIn addition to paying interest on the outstanding principal borrowed under the revolving credit facility, we are required to pay a commitment fee to the lenders for any unutilized commitments. The commitment fee rate equals 0.5% per annum on the revolving credit facility and 2% on the delayed draw term loan facility.\nThe term loan facility and revolving credit facility include a termination fee equal to 2% if the loans are prepaid within the first year, 1% if the loans are prepaid after year one and before year two, and 0.5% thereafter. The term loan facility and revolving credit facility include an exit fee equal to $1.6 million and $1.0 million, respectively, due and payable on the earlier of the loan's retirement or on the maturity date.\nThe ABL Credit Facilities contain representations and warranties, affirmative covenants, negative covenants, financial covenants and events of default and security interests that are customarily required for similar financings. Financial covenants include a minimum consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio, a maximum senior leverage ratio and minimum liquidity.\nTerm Loan Amendments\nOn March 6, 2018, we entered into an amendment to the term loan with affiliates of Welltower and Omega (the Term Loan Amendment) pursuant to which we borrowed an additional $40 million to be used for certain debt repayment and general corporate purposes. The additional $40 million term loan bears interest at a rate equal to 10.0% per annum, with up to 5% per annum to be paid in kind. The Term Loan Amendment also changed the interest rate applicable to the initial loans funded on July 29, 2016 to be equal to 14% per annum, with up to 9% per annum to be paid in kind. Among other things, the Term Loan Amendment eliminates any principal amortization payments on any of the loans prior to maturity and modifies the financial covenants beginning in 2018.\nOn May 9, 2019, the Term Loan Agreement was further amended extending the maturity date from July 29, 2020 to November 30, 2021.\nWelltower Master Lease Amendment\nOn February 21, 2018, we entered into a definitive agreement with Welltower to amend the Welltower Master Lease (the Welltower Master Lease Amendment). The Welltower Master Lease Amendment reduces our annual base rent payment by $35 million effective retroactively as of January 1, 2018, reduces the annual rent escalator from approximately 2.9% to 2.5% on April 1, 2018 and further reduces the annual rent escalator to 2.0% beginning January 1, 2019. In addition, the Welltower Master Lease Amendment extends the initial term of the master lease by five years to January 31, 2037 and extends the renewal term of the master lease by five years to December 31, 2048. The Welltower Master Lease Amendment also provides a potential upward rent reset, conditioned upon achievement of certain upside operating metrics, effective January 1, 2023. If triggered, the incremental rent from the rent reset is capped at $35 million.\nOmnibus Agreement\nOn February 21, 2018, we entered into an Omnibus Agreement with Welltower and Omega, pursuant to which Welltower and Omega committed to provide up to $40 million in new term loans and amend the current term loan to, among other things, accommodate a refinancing of our existing asset based credit facility, in each case subject to certain conditions, including the completion of a restructuring of certain of our other material debt and lease obligations. See Term Loan Amendment above.\nThe Omnibus Agreement also provides that upon satisfying certain conditions, including raising new capital that is used to pay down certain indebtedness owed to Welltower and Omega, (a) $50 million of outstanding indebtedness owed to Welltower will be written off and (b) we may request conversion of not more than $50 million of the outstanding balance of our Welltower real estate loans into equity. If the proposed equity conversion would result in any adverse REIT qualification, status or compliance consequences to Welltower, then the debt that would otherwise be converted to equity shall instead be converted into a loan incurring paid in kind\ninterest at 2% per annum compounded quarterly, with a term of ten years commencing on the date the applicable conditions precedent to the equity conversion have been satisfied. Moreover, we agreed to support Welltower in connection with the sale of certain of Welltower's interests in facilities covered by the Welltower Master Lease, including negotiating and entering into definitive new master lease agreements with third party buyers.\nIn connection with the Omnibus Agreement, we agreed to issue warrants to Welltower and Omega to purchase 900,000 shares and 600,000 shares, respectively, of our Class A Common Stock at an exercise price equal to $1.33 per share. Issuance of the warrant to Welltower is subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions. The warrants may be exercised at any time during the period commencing six months from the date of issuance and ending five years from the date of issuance.\nWelltower Real Estate Loans Amendment\nOn February 21, 2018, we entered into amendments (the Real Estate Loan Amendments) to the Welltower real estate loan (Welltower Real Estate Loans) agreements. The Real Estate Loan Amendments adjust the annual interest rate beginning February 15, 2018 to 12%, of which 7% will be paid in cash and 5% will be paid in kind. Previously, these loans carried a 10.25% cash pay interest rate that increased by 0.25% annually on January 1.\nWe agreed to make commercially reasonable efforts to secure commitments to repay no less than $105.0 million of the Welltower Real Estate Loan obligations. As of December 31, 2019, we have not yet secured the total required repayments or commitments. As a result, the annual cash component of the interest payments was increased by approximately $2.0 million with a corresponding decrease in the paid in kind component of interest.\nMidCap Real Estate Loans\nOn March 30, 2018, we entered into the MidCap Real Estate Loans which had combined available proceeds of $75.0 million, $73.0 million of which was drawn as of December 31, 2018. The MidCap Real Estate Loans are secured by 12 skilled nursing facilities and are subject to a five-year term maturing on March 30, 2023. The maturity of the MidCap Real Estate Loans will accelerate in the event the ABL Credit Facilities are repaid in full and terminated. The loans, which were interest only in the first year, are subject to an annual interest rate equal to LIBOR (subject to a floor of 1.5%) plus an applicable margin of 5.85%. Beginning April 1, 2019, mandatory principal payments commenced with the balance of the loans to be repaid at maturity. Proceeds from the MidCap Real Estate Loans were used to repay partially the Welltower Real Estate Loans.\nOn November 8, 2018, one of the MidCap Real Estate Loans was amended with an additional borrowing of $10.0 million. The proceeds were used to retire a maturing mortgage loan on a corporate office building. The office building has been added as collateral and the loan maturity remains March 30, 2023. The $10.0 million additional loan is subject to an annual interest rate equal to 30-day LIBOR (subject to a floor of 2.0%) plus an applicable margin of 6.25% with principal amortizing immediately and the balance due at maturity.\nOn May 1, 2019, we divested the real property and operations of five skilled nursing facilities in California, three of which were subject to the MidCap Real Estate Loans. We used the sale proceeds to repay $27.7 million on the MidCap Real Estate Loans. During the third quarter of 2019, we divested the real property of two skilled nursing facilities in New Jersey and one skilled nursing facility in Maryland that were subject to the MidCap Real Estate Loans and used the sale proceeds to repay $12.1 million on the loans. See Note 4 - Significant Transactions and Events - Strategic Partnerships - Vantage Point Partnership.\u201d The MidCap Real Estate Loans had an outstanding principal balance of $42.2 million and $83.0 million at December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively.\nSabra Master Leases\nIn 2017, we entered into a definitive agreement with Sabra resulting in permanent and unconditional annual cash rent savings of $19.0 million, which became effective January 1, 2018. For the year ended December 31, 2018, we terminated the Sabra lease agreement for 33 skilled nursing facilities and one assisted/senior living facility but continue to operate these facilities under new lease arrangements with different landlords and terminated the Sabra lease agreement associated with nine divested skilled nursing facilities.\nAs a result of the amendments and lease terminations noted above, we recorded a lease termination charge of $34.1 million in the year ended December 31, 2018. The charge represented the discounted residual rents due to Sabra on the skilled nursing facilities that\nhave been terminated due to either divestiture or sale to a new landlord. As of December 31, 2019, there remains an obligation of $26.7 million, $18.4 million recorded in other long-term liabilities and $8.3 million recorded in accrued expenses, to be repaid through 2023.\nOther Financing Activities\nMortgages and other secured debt (non-recourse) refinancings\nIn December 2019, a portion of the Next Partnership's term loan facility was refinanced via three new HUD insured loans. The new loans had an aggregate initial principal balance of $41.7 million, all of which remained outstanding as of December 31, 2019. The loans have an original amortization term of 35 years and a fixed interest rate of 3.15%. Proceeds were principally used to repay a portion of the term loan associated with the Next Partnership and fees.\nDivestiture of Non-Strategic Facilities\nConsistent with our strategy to divest assets in non-strategic markets, we have exited the inpatient operations of 111 skilled nursing facilities, five assisted/senior living facilities and seven behavioral outpatient clinics in 17 states since January 1, 2018, including:\nTable 57: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nThe closure of one skilled nursing facility located in Massachusetts on February 28, 2018 that was subject to a master lease agreement with Welltower.

At December 31, 2019, we were in compliance with all of the financial covenants contained in the Credit Facilities.\nWe have master lease agreements with Welltower, Sabra, Omega and Second Spring (collectively, the Master Lease Agreements). Our Master Lease Agreements each contain a number of financial, affirmative and negative covenants, including a maximum leverage\nratio, a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio, and minimum liquidity. At December 31, 2019, we were in compliance with the covenants contained in the Master Lease Agreements.\nWe have two master lease agreements with Cindat Best Years Welltower JV LLC involving 28 of our facilities. We did not meet certain financial covenants contained in one of the master lease agreements involving two of our facilities at December 31, 2019. On March 9, 2020, we received a waiver for these covenant breaches through April 1, 2021. At December 31, 2019, we are in compliance with the financial covenants contained in the other master lease agreement.\nAt December 31, 2019, we did not meet certain financial covenants contained in one lease related to two of our facilities. We are and expect to continue to be current in the timely payment of our obligations under the lease. This lease does not have cross default provisions, nor does it trigger cross default provisions in any of our other loan or lease agreements. We will continue to work with the related credit party to amend the lease and the related financial covenants. We do not believe the breach of such financial covenants has a material adverse impact on us at December 31, 2019.\nOur ability to maintain compliance with our covenants depends in part on management's ability to increase revenue and control costs. Due to continuing changes in the healthcare industry, as well as the uncertainty with respect to changing referral patterns, patient mix, and reimbursement rates, it is possible that future operating performance may not generate sufficient operating results to maintain compliance with our quarterly covenant compliance requirements. Should we fail to comply with our covenants at a future measurement date, we would, absent necessary and timely waivers and/or amendments, be in default under certain of our existing credit agreements. To the extent any cross-default provisions may apply, the default would have an even more significant impact on our financial position.\nConcentration of Credit Risk\nWe are exposed to the credit risk of our third-party customers, many of whom are in similar lines of business as us and are exposed to the same systemic industry risks of operations, as we, resulting in a concentration of risk. These include organizations that utilize our rehabilitation services, staffing services and physician service offerings, engaged in similar business activities or having economic features that would cause their ability to meet contractual obligations, including those to us, to be similarly affected by changes in regulatory and systemic industry conditions.\nManagement assesses its exposure to loss on accounts at the customer level. The greatest concentration of risk exists in our rehabilitation therapy services business where it has over 140 distinct customers, many being chain operators with more than one location. One of our customers, a related party, comprises $28.9 million, approximately 34%, of the gross outstanding contract receivables in the rehabilitation services business at December 31, 2019. See Note 16 - Related Party Transactions.\u201d Additionally, one former customer comprises $7.0 million, approximately 8%, of the gross outstanding contract receivables in the rehabilitation therapy services business at December 31, 2019. An adverse event impacting the solvency of these large customers resulting in their insolvency or other economic distress would have a material impact on us.\nFinancial Condition and Liquidity Considerations\nThe accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared on the basis that we will continue as a going concern, which contemplates the realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business.\nIn evaluating our ability to continue as a going concern, management considered the conditions and events that could raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern for 12 months following the date our financial statements were issued (March 16, 2020). Management considered the recent results of operations as well as our current financial condition and liquidity sources, including current funds available, forecasted future cash flows and our conditional and unconditional obligations due before March 16, 2021. Based upon such considerations, management determined that there are no known or knowable conditions or events that raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern for 12 months following the date of issuance of these financial statements (March 16, 2020).\nOur results of operations continue to be negatively impacted by the persistent pressure of healthcare reforms enacted in recent years. This challenging operating environment has been most acute in our inpatient segment, but also has had a detrimental effect on our rehabilitation therapy segment and its customers. In recent years, we have implemented a number of cost mitigation strategies to\noffset the negative financial implications of this challenging operating environment. These strategies have been successful in recent years, however, the negative impact of continued reductions in skilled patient admissions, shortening lengths of stay, escalating wage inflation and professional liability losses, combined with the increased cost of capital through escalating lease payments, persists.\nIn response to these issues, we entered into the Restructuring Transactions, exited the operations of 99 non-strategic facilities and restructured/terminated certain leases during the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018. See Note 4 - Significant Transactions and Events\u201d for further detail. We expect to continue to pursue cost mitigation and other strategies in 2020 in response to the operating environment and liquidity requirements. During 2018 and 2019, we also amended, or obtained waivers related to, the financial covenants of all of our material debt and lease agreements to account for these ongoing changes in our capital structure and business conditions.\nRisk and Uncertainties\nShould we fail to comply with our debt and lease covenants at a future measurement date, we could, absent necessary and timely waivers and/or amendments, be in default under certain of our existing debt and lease agreements. To the extent any cross-default provisions may apply, the default could have an even more significant impact on our financial position.\nAlthough we are in compliance and project to be in compliance with our material debt and lease covenants through March 31, 2021, the ongoing uncertainty related to the impact of healthcare reform initiatives may have an adverse impact on our ability to remain in compliance with our covenants. Such uncertainty includes, changes in reimbursement patterns, patient admission patterns, bundled payment arrangements, as well as potential changes to the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010 currently being considered in Congress, among others.\nThere can be no assurance that the confluence of these and other factors will not impede our ability to meet our debt and lease covenants in the future.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nAs of December 31, 2019 and 2018, we are not involved in any off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a material current or future impact on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenue or expense, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures, or capital resources.", "item_7_truncated": "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThis Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations is intended to assist in understanding and assessing the trends and significant changes in our results of operations and financial condition as of the dates and for the periods presented. Historical results may not indicate future performance. Our forward-looking statements, which reflect our current views about future events, are based on assumptions and are subject to known and unknown risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contemplated by these statements. Factors that may cause differences between actual results and those contemplated by forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, those discussed in Item 1A. Risk Factors,\u201d of this report on Form 10-K. This Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations should be read in conjunction with Selected Financial Data\u201d in Item 6 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K and our consolidated financial statements and related notes included in this report.\nBusiness Overview\nGenesis is a healthcare services holding company that through its subsidiaries owns and operates skilled nursing facilities, assisted/senior living facilities and a rehabilitation therapy business. We have an administrative service company that provides a full complement of administrative and consultative services that allows our affiliated operators and third-party operators with whom we contract to better focus on delivery of healthcare services. We provide inpatient services through 381 skilled nursing, assisted/senior living and behavioral health centers located in 26 states. Revenues of our owned, leased and otherwise consolidated centers constitute approximately 87% of our revenues.\nWe also provide a range of rehabilitation therapy services, including speech pathology, physical therapy, occupational therapy and respiratory therapy. These services are provided by rehabilitation therapists and assistants employed or contracted at substantially all of the centers operated by us, as well as by contract to healthcare facilities operated by others. After the elimination of intercompany revenues, the rehabilitation therapy services business constitutes approximately 10% of our revenues.\nWe provide an array of other specialty medical services, including management services, physician services, staffing services, and other healthcare related services, which comprise the balance of our revenues.\nStrategic Partnerships\nNext Partnership\nOn January 31, 2019, Welltower Inc. (Welltower) sold the real estate of 15 facilities to a real estate partnership (Next Partnership), of which we acquired a 46% membership interest for $16.0 million. The remaining interest is held by Next Healthcare (Next), a related party. See Note 16 - Related Party Transactions.\u201d In conjunction with the facility sales, we received aggregate annual rent credits of $17.2 million. We will continue to operate these facilities pursuant to a master lease with the Next Partnership. The term of the master lease is 15 years with two five-year renewal options available. We will pay annual rent of $19.5 million, with no rent escalators for the first five years and an escalator of 2% beginning in the sixth lease year and thereafter. We also obtained a fixed price purchase option to acquire all of the real property of the facilities. The purchase option is exercisable between lease years five and seven, reducing in price each successive year down to a 10% premium over the net price paid by the partnership to acquire the facilities from Welltower.\nWe have concluded the Next Partnership qualifies as a VIE and we are the primary beneficiary. As such, we have consolidated all of the accounts of the Next Partnership in the accompanying consolidated financial statements. The ROU assets and lease obligations related to the Next Partnership lease agreement have been fully eliminated in our consolidated financial statements. The Next Partnership acquired 22 skilled nursing facilities for a purchase price of $252.5 million but immediately sold seven of these facilities for $79.0 million. The initial consolidation of the remaining 15 facilities resulted in property and equipment of $173.5 million, non-recourse debt of $165.7 million, net of debt issuance costs, and non-controlling interest of $18.5 million. The impact of consolidation on the accompanying consolidated statement of operations was not material for the year ended December 31, 2019 apart from transaction costs of $5.3 million.\nVantage Point Partnership\nOn September 12, 2019, Welltower and Second Spring Healthcare Investments (Second Spring) sold the real estate of four and 14 facilities, respectively, to a real estate partnership (Vantage Point Partnership), in which we invested $37.5 million for an approximate 30% membership interest. The remaining membership interest is held by Vantage Point Capital, LLC (Vantage Point) for an investment of $85.3 million consisting of an equity investment of $8.5 million and a formation loan of $76.8 million. In conjunction with the facility sales, we received aggregate annual rent credits of $30.3 million. We will continue to operate these facilities pursuant to a new master lease with the Vantage Point Partnership. The term of the master lease is 15 years with two five-year renewal options available. We will pay annual rent of approximately $33.1 million, with no rent escalators for the first four years and an escalator of 2% beginning in the fifth lease year and thereafter. We also obtained a fixed price purchase option to acquire all of the real property of the facilities. The purchase option is exercisable during certain periods in fiscal years 2024 and 2025 for a 10% premium over the original purchase price. Further, Vantage Point holds a put option that would require us to acquire its membership interests in the Vantage Point Partnership. The put option becomes exercisable if we opt not to purchase the facilities or upon the occurrence of certain events of default.\nWe have concluded the Vantage Point Partnership qualifies as a VIE and we are the primary beneficiary. As such, we have consolidated all of the accounts of the Vantage Point Partnership in the accompanying financial statements. The ROU assets and lease obligations related to the Vantage Point Partnership lease agreement have been fully eliminated in our consolidated financial statements. The Vantage Point Partnership acquired all 18 skilled nursing facilities for a purchase price of $339.2 million. The initial consolidation primarily resulted in property and equipment of $339.2 million, non-recourse debt of $306.1 million, net of debt issuance costs, and non-controlling interest of $8.5 million. We have not finalized the analysis of the consideration and purchase price allocation and will continue to review this during the measurement period. Other than transaction costs of $11.0 million, the impact of consolidation on the accompanying consolidated statement of operations was not material for the year ended December 31, 2019.\nDuring the third quarter of 2019, we sold the real property of seven skilled nursing facilities and one assisted/senior living facility located in Georgia, New Jersey, Virginia, and Maryland to affiliates of Vantage Point for an aggregate purchase price of $91.8 million, using the majority of the proceeds to acquire our interest in the Vantage Point Partnership and repay indebtedness. The operations of seven of these facilities were also divested. Three of the facilities were subject to real estate loans and two were subject to loans insured by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD). See Note 9 - Property and Equipment\u201d and Note 12 - Long-Term Debt - Real Estate Loans\u201d and Long-Term Debt - HUD Insured Loans.\u201d We also divested the operations of an additional leased skilled nursing facility located in Georgia, marking an exit from the inpatient business in this state. The divested facilities had aggregate annual revenues of $84.1 million and annual pre-tax net income of $2.6 million. The divestitures resulted in an aggregate gain of $57.8 million.\nOn January 10, 2020, Welltower sold the real estate of one skilled nursing facility located in Massachusetts to Vantage Point Partnership. The sale represents the final component of the transaction that was initiated on September 12, 2019. We will receive an annual rent credit of $0.7 million from Welltower as a result of the lease termination. The Vantage Point Partnership acquired this skilled nursing facility for a purchase price of $9.1 million. The initial consolidation of this one additional skilled nursing facility primarily resulted in property and equipment of $9.1 million, non-recourse debt of $7.3 million with the balance of the purchase price settled primarily with proceeds held in escrow from the September 12, 2019 closing. We will continue to operate the facility under the master lease agreement with Vantage Point Partnership along with the other 18 facilities. The addition of this one skilled nursing facility resulted in an increase of annual rent of $0.9 million. See Note 4 - Significant Transactions and Events - Strategic Partnerships - Vantage Point Partnership.\u201d\nNewGen Partnership\nOn February 1, 2020, we transitioned operational responsibility for 19 facilities in the states of California, Washington and Nevada to New Generation Health, LLC (NewGen). We sold the real estate and operations of six skilled nursing facilities and transferred the leasehold rights to 13 skilled nursing, behavioral health and assisted living facilities for a total of $78.9 million. We will retain a 50% interest in the facilities. Net transaction proceeds were used by us to repay indebtedness, including prepayment fees, of $33.7 million, fund our initial equity contribution and working capital requirement of approximately $15.0 million, and provide financing to the partnership of $9.0 million. Concurrently, the facilities have entered, or will enter upon regulatory approval, into management services agreements with NewGen for the day-to-day operations of the facilities. We will continue to provide administrative and back office services to the facilities pursuant to administrative support agreements, as well as therapy services pursuant to therapy services\nagreements. We are currently assessing whether we will continue to consolidate the financial statements of these facilities for financial reporting purposes.\nDivestiture of Non-Strategic Facilities\n2020 Divestitures\nOn January 31, 2020, Omega sold the real estate of one skilled nursing facility located in Massachusetts. We leased the facility under a master lease agreement, but closed the facility on July 1, 2019. The sale resulted in the lease termination of the facility and an annual rent credit of $0.4 million.\nOn February 1, 2020, we sold two owned skilled nursing facilities in North Carolina and one owned skilled nursing facility in Maryland for $61.8 million. Proceeds were used to retire $29.1 million of HUD financed debt. The three facilities generated revenues of $38.7 million and pre-tax income of $0.5 million.\nOn February 26, 2020, we completed the sale of one owned HUD-insured skilled nursing facility in California for $20.8 million. The facility had been classified as an asset held for sale as of December 31, 2019. Proceeds were used to retire $20.5 million of HUD financed debt. The facility generated revenues of $14.0 million and pre-tax loss of $0.1 million. See Note 20 - Assets Held for Sale.\u201d\nOn March 4, 2020, we divested the operations of one leased assisted/senior living facility in Montana. The lease termination resulted in an annual rent credit of $0.7 million. The facility generated revenues of $2.5 million and pre-tax income of $0.1 million.\nWe are currently assessing the impact the 2020 divestitures and lease amendments will have on our consolidated financial statements.\n2019 Divestitures\nCalifornia Divestitures\nDuring the second quarter of 2019, we sold the real property and divested the operations of five skilled nursing facilities in California for a sale price of $56.5 million. Loan repayments of $41.8 million were paid on the facilities at closing. See Note 9 - Property and Equipment\u201d and Note 12 - Long-Term Debt - Real Estate Loans\u201d and Long-Term Debt - HUD Insured Loans.\u201d We incurred prepayment penalties and other closing costs of $2.4 million at settlement. The facilities generated annual revenues of $53.0 million and pre-tax net income of $1.6 million. The divestiture resulted in a gain of $25.0 million. We also divested the operations of one behavioral health center located in California upon the lease's expiration in the second quarter of 2019. The center generated annual revenues of $3.1 million and pre-tax net loss of $0.3 million. The divestiture resulted in a loss of $0.1 million.\nDuring the third quarter of 2019, we sold the real property and divested the operations of one additional skilled nursing facility and one assisted/senior living facility in California for an aggregate sale price of $11.5 million. Loan repayments of $9.6 million were paid on the facilities at closing. See Note 9 - Property and Equipment\u201d and Note 12 - Long-Term Debt - HUD Insured Loans.\u201d The facilities generated annual revenues of $10.4 million and pre-tax net income of less than $0.1 million. The divestiture resulted in an aggregate gain of $0.6 million.\nTexas Divestitures\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2019, we sold the real property of seven facilities in Texas for a sales price of $20.1 million. The net proceeds were used principally to repay the indebtedness of the facilities. We recognized a net gain of $3.3 million associated with the sale of the facilities. We recognized a gain on early extinguishment of debt of $2.6 million associated with the write off of the debt premiums and issuance costs on the underlying HUD loans. These seven facilities had been classified as held for sale as of December 31, 2018. See Note 20 - Assets Held for Sale.\u201d\nOther Divestitures\nDuring the first quarter of 2019, we divested the operations of nine facilities located in New Jersey and Ohio that were subject to the master lease with Welltower (the Welltower Master Lease). The nine divested facilities had aggregate annual revenues of $90.2 million and annual pre-tax net loss of $6.0 million. We recognized a loss on exit reserves of $3.5 million. We also completed the closure of one facility located in Ohio. The facility generated annual revenues of $7.7 million and pre-tax net loss of $1.6 million. The closure resulted in a loss of $0.2 million.\nDuring the second quarter of 2019, we divested the operations of three leased skilled nursing facilities. Two of the facilities were located in Connecticut and subject to the Welltower Master Lease, while the third was located in Ohio. The facilities generated annual revenues of $24.7 million and pre-tax net loss of $2.9 million. The divestitures resulted in a loss of $1.1 million.\nDuring the third quarter of 2019, we divested the operations of 11 leased skilled nursing facilities and completed the closure of a twelfth facility. Nine of the facilities were located in Ohio, marking an exit from the inpatient business in this state, while the remaining three were located in Massachusetts, Utah, and Idaho. Four of the facilities were subject to a master lease with Omega Healthcare Investors, Inc. (Omega), three of which were removed from the lease, resulting in an annual rent credit of $1.9 million, with the fourth, the closed facility, remaining subject to the lease. The twelve facilities generated annual revenues of $75.6 million and pre-tax loss of $4.6 million. The divestitures resulted in a loss of $3.5 million.\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2019, we divested the operations of one leased skilled nursing facility in New Jersey. The facility generated annual revenues of $19.0 million and pre-tax net loss of $1.2 million. The divestiture resulted in a loss of $0.9 million, which was primarily attributable to exit costs.\n2018 Divestitures\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2018, we divested the operations of 54 skilled nursing facilities and one assisted/senior living facility. These divestitures resulted in net gains of $34.8 million, which are included in other income on the consolidated statements of operations. See Note 18 - Other Income.\u201d\nTexas Divestitures\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2018, we divested the operations of 23 skilled nursing facilities located in Texas, consisting of 22 owned facilities and one leased facility. We sold the real property associated with 15 of the owned facilities, with the real property of the remaining seven owned facilities being classified as held for sale at December 31, 2018. Sale proceeds of approximately $89.4 million, net of transaction costs, were used principally to repay the indebtedness of the facilities. We recognized a gain of $3.4 million primarily attributable to the derecognition of financing lease assets and obligations offset by a loss of $4.6 million for exit costs. Debt premiums and issuance costs of $9.4 million associated with underlying HUD loans were written off as a gain on early extinguishment of debt.\nOther Divestitures\nDuring the first quarter of 2018, we closed one leased skilled nursing facility located in Massachusetts. The facility remained subject to a master lease with Welltower until its sale in the second quarter of 2019. The facility generated annual revenues of $9.0 million and pre-tax net loss of $2.7 million. The closure resulted in a loss of $0.3 million.\nDuring the second quarter of 2018, we divested 19 leased skilled nursing facilities, one of which had previously been closed during 2017. The facilities were located across the states of California, Kentucky, Massachusetts, New Jersey, and Pennsylvania. Twelve of the facilities were subject to a master lease with Second Spring and six were subject to a master lease with Sabra Health Care REIT, Inc. (Sabra). The facilities generated annual revenues of $182.7 million and pre-tax loss of $23.8 million. We recorded a gain of $22.5 million on the divestitures, offset by a loss on exit costs of $8.4 million. Additionally, we recognized a capital lease net asset and obligation write-down of $16.8 million, a financing obligation net asset write-down of $113.3 million and a financing obligation write-down of $134.5 million associated with 12 of the facilities. We recorded accelerated depreciation expense of $5.3 million associated with the divestitures.\nDuring the third quarter of 2018, we divested seven leased facilities, consisting of six skilled nursing facilities and one behavioral health clinic. The facilities were located across the states of California, Indiana, Maryland, Pennsylvania, Ohio, and Texas. Three of the facilities were subject to a master lease with Welltower, while two others were subject to master leases with Second Spring and Sabra. The facilities generated annual revenues of $71.7 million and pre-tax loss of $9.7 million. We recorded a gain of $27.9 million on the divestitures, offset by a loss on exit costs of $3.1 million. Additionally, we recognized capital lease and financing obligation net asset write-downs of $44.5 million and capital lease and financing obligation write-downs of $77.0 million associated with four of the facilities. We recorded accelerated depreciation expense of $7.3 million associated with the divestitures. We received an annual rent credit of $0.6 million associated with the divestiture of one of the facilities.\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2018, we divested 6 facilities, consisting of five leased skilled nursing facilities and one owned assisted/senior living facility. The facilities were located across the states of Georgia, Idaho, Montana, and Nevada. Four of the facilities were subject to a master lease with Sabra. The facilities generated annual revenues of $36.8 million and pre-tax income of $3.1 million. We recorded a gain of $0.4 million on the divestitures, offset by a loss on exit costs of $1.1 million. We received an annual rent credit of $0.3 million associated with the divestiture of one of the leased facilities. The owned facility was sold for $2.2 million with net proceeds of $1.9 million being primarily used to pay down indebtedness. Additionally, we recorded a loss of $1.9 million for exit costs associated with the pending closure of certain clinics associated with our rehabilitation services business.\nAcquisitions\nOn June 1, 2019, we acquired the operations of one skilled nursing facility in New Mexico. The new facility has 80 licensed beds and generates approximate annual net revenue of $3.4 million. The facility is leased from Omega and is classified as an operating lease. The facility's 2019 pre-tax net income was de minimis.\nOn November 1, 2018, we acquired the operations of eight skilled nursing facilities and one assisted/senior living facility in New Mexico and Arizona. The nine new facilities have approximately 1,000 beds and generate approximate annual net revenue of $60.0 million. The facilities are leased from Omega. Four of the facilities were classified as capital leases and resulted in an initial capital lease asset and obligation gross up of $14.6 million. The remaining five facilities were initially classified as operating leases.\nLease Transactions\nGains, losses and termination charges associated with master lease terminations and amendments are recorded as non-recurring charges. These amendments and terminations resulted in net gains of $93.8 million and net losses of $21.9 million for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. These gains and losses are included in other income on the consolidated statements of operations.\nWelltower\nDuring the first quarter of 2019, we amended the Welltower Master Lease several times to reflect the lease termination of 24 facilities, including the 15 facilities sold and now leased from the Next Partnership. As a result of the lease termination on the 24 facilities, we received annual rent credits of approximately $23.4 million. A lease modification analysis was performed and the remaining 49 facilities subject to the master lease were reclassified from finance leases to operating leases. Finance lease ROU assets and obligations of $61.5 million and $130.2 million, respectively, were written off. On a net basis, operating lease ROU assets and obligations of $159.8 million and $111.3 million, respectively, were written down, resulting in a gain of $20.3 million.\nDuring the second quarter of 2019, we amended the Welltower Master Lease to reflect the lease termination of two facilities and received annual rent credits of $0.6 million. Operating lease ROU assets and lease obligations of $5.1 million and $5.6 million, respectively, were written off, resulting in a gain of $0.5 million.\nDuring the third quarter of 2019, we amended the Welltower Master Lease to reflect the lease termination of four facilities and received annual rent credits of $1.9 million. Operating lease ROU assets and lease obligations of $102.0 million and $74.4 million, respectively, were written off, resulting in a gain of $27.6 million.\nOmega\nDuring the third quarter of 2019, we amended our master lease with Omega to reflect the lease termination of three facilities subject to the lease and received annual rent credits of $1.9 million. In conjunction with the lease termination, finance lease ROU assets and lease obligations of $10.1 million and $16.8 million, respectively, were written off. Additionally, for those facilities remaining under the master lease, we reassessed the likelihood of exercising our renewal options and concluded that it no longer met the reasonably certain threshold. Consequently, the remaining facilities subject to the master lease were reclassified from finance leases to operating leases and the corresponding ROU assets and liabilities were reduced by $164.6 million and $181.3 million, respectively. The lease termination and remeasurement resulted in an aggregate gain of $23.4 million.\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2019, we amended our master lease with Omega to reflect the inclusion of nine skilled nursing facilities and one assisted living facility in New Mexico and Arizona. These facilities were previously leased from Omega, following the terms of a separate lease agreement, and all facilities were classified as operating leases. There was no change in base rent for the 10 facilities upon addition to master lease. The lease assessment and measurement resulted in operating lease classification with a $10.6 million ROU asset and lease liability gross up. In addition, we received $15.0 million as a short-term note payable in full to Omega by April 30, 2020. See Note 12 - Long-Term Debt - Notes Payable.\u201d\nSecond Spring\nDuring the third quarter of 2019, we amended our master lease with Second Spring to reflect the lease termination of 14 facilities subject to the lease and received annual rent credits of $28.4 million. In conjunction with the lease termination, finance lease ROU assets and lease obligations of $5.9 million and $8.8 million, respectively, were written off and operating lease ROU assets and lease obligations of $202.7 million and $205.4 million, respectively, were written off. Additionally, for those facilities remaining under the master lease, we reassessed the likelihood of exercising our renewal options and concluded that it no longer met the reasonably certain threshold. Consequently, the remaining facilities subject to the master lease were reclassified from finance leases to operating leases and the corresponding ROU assets and liabilities were increased by $54.4 million and $33.3 million, respectively. The lease termination and remeasurement resulted in an aggregate gain of $26.9 million.\nSabra\nWe are party to an agreement with Sabra resulting in permanent and unconditional annual cash rent savings of $19 million effective January 1, 2018. Sabra has pursued and we have supported Sabra's previously announced sale of our leased assets. At the closing of such sales, we have entered into lease agreements with new landlords for a majority of the assets currently leased with Sabra. During the year ended December 31, 2018, Sabra completed the sale of 34 facilities to third party landlords with whom we have entered into new lease agreements. Those transactions are summarized below.\nDuring the second quarter of 2018, Sabra completed the sale and lease termination of 21 facilities, consisting of 20 skilled nursing facilities and one assisted/senior living facility. The facilities were located across nine states. As a result of the sales, we will receive an annual rent credit of $19.4 million for the remainder of the lease term. We continue to operate 12 of the facilities under a new lease with a new landlord, Next Healthcare Capital (Next), as described in Note 16 - \"Related Party Transactions.\" We continue to operate the other nine facilities under a separate lease with a new landlord. The new lease has a ten-year initial term, one five-year renewal option and initial annual rent of $7.4 million. We recognized accelerated depreciation expense of $9.6 million associated with the property and equipment sold and a gain on the write off of certain lease liabilities of $9.9 million.\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2018, Sabra completed the sale and lease termination of 13 skilled nursing facilities located in California, Colorado, Connecticut, and New Mexico. As a result of the sales, we will receive an annual rent credit of $6.7 million for the remainder of the lease term. We continue to operate four of the facilities under a lease agreement with a new landlord. The new lease has a 9.5 year initial term, one five-year renewal option and initial annual rent of $3.4 million. We continue to operate the other nine facilities under a lease agreement with a new landlord. The new lease has a ten-year initial term, one five-year renewal option, and initial annual rent of $3.3 million. We recognized accelerated depreciation expense of $7.4 million associated with the property and equipment sold and a gain on the write off of certain lease liabilities of $6.2 million.\nAs a result of the amendments and lease terminations noted above, we recorded a lease termination charge of $34.1 million in the year ended December 31, 2018, with an offsetting obligation recorded in other long-term liabilities. The charge represents the\ndiscounted residual rents we will continue to pay Sabra on the facilities that have been terminated due to either divestiture or sale to a new landlord. On an undiscounted basis, we were obligated to pay Sabra approximately $41.0 million as of December 31, 2018. This obligation will be repaid over a period of approximately four years ending in 2023.\nOther\nDuring the first quarter of 2019, we amended a master lease agreement for 19 skilled nursing facilities. The amendment extended the lease term by five years through October 31, 2026, removed our option to purchase certain facilities under the lease and adjusted certain financial covenants. We had previously determined that the renewal option period was not reasonably certain of exercise. Upon execution of the amendment, the operating lease ROU assets and obligations were remeasured, resulting in an increase of $77.2 million to both operating lease ROU assets and obligations.\nDuring the third quarter of 2019, we amended a master lease agreement to reflect the lease termination of six facilities subject to the lease. In conjunction with the lease termination, operating lease ROU assets of $4.9 million were written off, resulting in a loss of $4.9 million.\nDuring the second quarter of 2018, we negotiated the extensions of four separate lease agreements resulting in the derecognition of certain lease assets totaling $1.9 million.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2018, the cease to use asset associated with a leased facility divestiture initially recorded during 2017 was further adjusted to reflect changes in the sublease assumption, resulting in a loss of $2.0 million.\nRestructuring Transactions\nOverview\nDuring the first quarter of 2018, we entered into a number of agreements, amendments and new financing facilities further described below in an effort to strengthen significantly our capital structure. In total, the Restructuring Transactions reduced our annual cash fixed charges by approximately $62.0 million beginning in 2018 and also provided $70.0 million of additional cash and borrowing availability, increasing our liquidity and financial flexibility.\nIn connection with the Restructuring Transactions, we entered into a new asset based lending facility agreement, replacing our prior revolving credit facilities, expanding our term loan borrowings, amending our real estate loans with Welltower while refinancing some of those loan amounts through new real estate loans. The new asset based lending facility agreement and real estate loans are financed through MidCap Funding IV Trust and MidCap Financial Trust (collectively, MidCap), respectively. See Note 12 - Long-Term Debt.\u201d We also amended the financial covenants in all of our material loan agreements and all but two of our material master leases. Financial covenants were amended to account for changes in our capital structure as a result of the Restructuring Transactions and to account for the current business climate.\nWelltower Master Lease Amendment\nDuring the first quarter of 2018, we entered into a definitive agreement with Welltower to amend the Welltower Master Lease (the Welltower Master Lease Amendment). The Welltower Master Lease Amendment reduced our annual base rent payment by $35.0 million effective as of January 1, 2018, reduced the annual rent escalator from approximately 2.9% to 2.5% effective on April 1, 2018 and further reduced the annual rent escalator to 2.0% beginning January 1, 2019. In addition, the Welltower Master Lease Amendment extended the initial term of the master lease by five years to January 31, 2037 and extended the optional renewal term of the master lease by five years to December 31, 2048. The Welltower Master Lease Amendment also provides a potential upward rent reset, conditioned upon achievement of certain upside operating metrics, effective January 1, 2023. If triggered, the incremental rent from the reset is capped at $35.0 million.\nOmnibus Agreement\nDuring the first quarter of 2018, we entered into an Omnibus Agreement with Welltower and Omega, pursuant to which Welltower and Omega committed to provide up to $40.0 million in new term loans and amend the current term loan agreement to, among other things, accommodate a refinancing of our existing asset based credit facility, in each case subject to certain conditions, including the completion of a restructuring of certain of our other material debt and lease obligations.\nThe Omnibus Agreement also provided that upon satisfying certain conditions, including raising new capital that is used to pay down certain indebtedness owed to Welltower and Omega, (a) $50.0 million of outstanding indebtedness owed to Welltower would be written off and (b) we may request conversion of not more than $50.0 million of the outstanding balance of our Welltower Real Estate Loans into equity. If the proposed equity conversion would result in any adverse REIT qualification, status or compliance consequences to Welltower, then the debt that would otherwise be converted to equity shall instead be converted into a loan incurring paid in kind interest at 2% per annum compounded quarterly, with a term of ten years commencing on the date the applicable conditions precedent to the equity conversion have been satisfied. Moreover, we agreed to support Welltower in connection with the sale of certain of Welltower's interests in facilities covered by the Welltower Master Lease, including negotiating and entering into definitive new master lease agreements with third party buyers. The conditions described above have not been satisfied as of December 31, 2019.\nIn connection with the Omnibus Agreement, we agreed to issue warrants to Welltower and Omega to purchase 900,000 shares and 600,000 shares, respectively, of our Class A Common Stock at an exercise price equal to $1.33 per share. Issuance of the warrant to Welltower is subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions, which had not occurred as of December 31, 2019. The warrants may be exercised at any time during the period commencing six months from the date of issuance and ending five years from the date of issuance.\nSettlement Agreement\nDuring 2017, we and the U.S. Department of Justice (the DOJ) entered into a settlement agreement regarding four matters arising out of the activities of Skilled Healthcare Group, Inc. (Skilled) or Sun Healthcare Group, Inc. prior to their operations becoming part of our operations (collectively, the Successor Matters). We agreed to the settlement in order to resolve the allegations underlying the Successor Matters and to avoid the uncertainty and expense of litigation.\nThe settlement agreement calls for payment of a collective settlement amount of $52.7 million (the Settlement Amount), including separate Medicaid repayment agreements with each affected state Medicaid program. We will continue to remit the Settlement Amount through January 1, 2022. The remaining outstanding Settlement Amount at December 31, 2019 was $25.7 million, of which $12.1 million is recorded in accrued expenses and $13.6 million is recorded in other long-term liabilities.\nCritical Accounting Policies\nThe consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (U.S. GAAP), which requires us to consolidate company financial information and make informed estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. The most significant estimates in our consolidated financial statements relate to valuation of accounts receivable, self-insured liabilities, income taxes, long-lived assets and goodwill, and other contingencies. Actual results could differ from those estimates.\nRevenue Recognition\nWe adopted Accounting Standards Codification Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606), effective January 1, 2018, using the modified retrospective transition method. There was no cumulative effect on the opening balance of accumulated deficit as a result of adopting the standard as of January 1, 2018. Results for reporting periods beginning after January 1, 2018 are presented under Topic 606, while comparative information has not been restated and continues to be reported under the accounting standards in effect for those periods. See Note 5 - Net Revenues and Accounts Receivable.\u201d\nImpairment of Long-Lived Assets\nOur long-lived assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. Recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to the future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset. If the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its estimated future undiscounted cash flows, an impairment charge is recognized to the extent the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the fair value of the asset. Assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of the carrying amount or the fair value, less costs to sell. See Note 19 - Asset Impairment Charges.\u201d\nSelf-Insurance Reserves\nWe provide for self-insurance reserves for both general and professional liability and workers' compensation claims based on estimates of the ultimate costs for both reported claims and claims incurred but not reported. Estimated losses from asserted and incurred but not reported claims are accrued based on our estimate of the ultimate costs of the claims, which include costs associated with litigating or settling claims, and the relationship of past reported incidents to eventual claims payments. All relevant information, including our own historical experience, the nature and extent of existing asserted claims and reported incidents, and independent actuarial analyses of this information is used in estimating the expected amount of claims. The reserves for loss for workers' compensation risks are discounted based on actuarial estimates of claim payment patterns whereas the reserves for general and professional liability are recorded on an undiscounted basis. We also consider amounts that may be recovered from excess insurance carriers in estimating the ultimate net liability for such risks. See Note 21 - Commitments and Contingencies - Loss Reserves For Certain Self-Insured Programs - General and Professional Liability and Workers' Compensation.\u201d\nIncome Taxes\nOur effective tax rate is based on pretax income, statutory tax rates and tax planning opportunities available in the various jurisdictions in which we operate. We account for income taxes in accordance with applicable guidance on accounting for income taxes, which requires that deferred tax assets and liabilities be recognized using enacted tax rates for the effect of temporary differences between book and tax bases on recorded assets and liabilities. Accounting guidance also requires that deferred tax assets be reduced by a valuation allowance, when it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will not be realized.\nThe recognition and measurement of a tax position is based on management's best judgment given the facts, circumstances and information available at the reporting date. We evaluate tax positions to determine whether the benefits of tax positions are more likely than not of being sustained upon audit based on the technical merits of the tax position. For tax positions that are more likely than not of being sustained upon audit, we recognize the largest amount of the benefit that is greater than 50% likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement in the financial statements. For tax positions that are not more likely than not of being sustained upon audit, we do not recognize any portion of the benefit in the financial statements. If the more likely than not threshold is not met in the period for which a tax position is taken, we may subsequently recognize the benefit of that tax position if the tax matter is effectively settled, the statute of limitations expires, or if the more likely than not threshold is met in a subsequent period.\nWe evaluate, on a quarterly basis, our ability to realize deferred tax assets by assessing our valuation allowance and by adjusting the amount of such allowance, if necessary. The factors used to assess the likelihood of realization are our forecast of pre-tax earnings, our forecast of future taxable income and available tax planning strategies that could be implemented to realize the net deferred tax assets. To the extent we prevail in matters for which reserves have been established, or are required to pay amounts in excess of our reserves, our effective tax rate in a given financial statement period could be materially affected. An unfavorable tax settlement would require use of cash and result in an increase in the effective tax rate in the year of resolution. A favorable tax settlement would be recognized as a reduction in our effective tax rate in the year of resolution. We record accrued interest and penalties associated with uncertain tax\npositions as income tax expense in the consolidated statement of operations.\nLeases\nWe adopted a new leasing standard, FASB ASC Topic 842, Leases (Topic 842), on January 1, 2019 and elected the option to apply the transition requirements thereof at the effective date with the effects of initially applying the new standard recognized as a cumulative-effect adjustment to accumulated deficit in the period of adoption. Consequently, financial information has not been updated for periods prior to January 1, 2019. See Note 2 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies - Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements.\u201d\nWe lease skilled nursing facilities and assisted/senior living facilities, as well as certain office space, land, and equipment. Under Topic 842, we evaluate at contract inception whether a lease exists and recognizes a lease liability and right-of-use (ROU) asset for all leases with a term greater than 12 months. Leases are classified as either finance or operating. While many of our facilities are subject to master lease agreements, leases are assessed, classified, and measured at the facility level.\nAll lease liabilities are measured as the present value of the future lease payments using a discount rate, which is generally our incremental borrowing rate for collateralized borrowings. The future lease payments used to measure the lease liability include both fixed and variable payments that depend on a rate or index, as well as the exercise price of any options to purchase the underlying asset that have been deemed reasonably certain of being exercised. Future lease payments for optional renewal periods that are not reasonably certain of being exercised are excluded from the measurement of the lease liability. Regarding variable payments that depend on a rate or index, the lease liability is measured using the applicable rate or index as of lease commencement and is only remeasured under certain circumstances, such as a change in the lease term. Lease incentives serve to reduce the amount of future lease payments included in the measurement of the lease liability. For all leases, the ROU asset is initially derived from the measurement of the lease liability and adjusted for certain items, such as initial direct costs and lease incentives received. ROU assets are subject to long-lived asset impairment testing.\nAmortization of finance lease ROU assets, which is generally recognized on a straight-line basis over the lesser of the lease term and the estimated useful life of the asset, is included within depreciation and amortization expense in the consolidated statements of operations. Interest expense associated with finance lease liabilities is included within interest expense in the consolidated statements of operations. Operating lease expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term and included within lease expense in the consolidation statements of operations. The lease term is determined based on the date we acquire control of the leased premises through the end of the lease term. Optional renewals periods are not initially included in the lease term unless they are deemed to be reasonably certain of being exercised at lease commencement. For further discussion, see Note 10 - Leases.\u201d\nBusiness Combinations\nOur acquisition strategy is to identify facilities for purchase or lease that are complementary to our current affiliated facilities, accretive to our business or otherwise advance our strategy. The results of all of our operating subsidiaries are included in the accompanying financial statements subsequent to the date of acquisition. Acquisitions are accounted for using the acquisition method of accounting and include leasing and other financing arrangements as well as cash transactions. Assets and liabilities of the acquired entities are recorded at their estimated fair values at the acquisition date. Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of net assets, including the amount assigned to identifiable intangible assets. Given the time it takes to obtain pertinent information to finalize the acquired company's balance sheet, the initial fair value might not be finalized up to one year after the date of acquisition.\nIn developing estimates of fair values for long-lived assets, we utilize a variety of factors including market data, cash flows, growth rates, and replacement costs. Determining the fair value for specifically identified intangible assets involves significant judgment, estimates and projections related to the valuation to be applied to intangible assets such as favorable leases, customer relationships, management contracts and trade names. The subjective nature of management's assumptions increases the risk associated with estimates surrounding the projected performance of the acquired entity. In transactions where significant judgment or other assumptions could have a material impact on the conclusion, we may engage third party specialists to assist in the valuation of the acquired assets and liabilities. Additionally, as we amortize definite-lived acquired intangible assets over time, the purchase accounting allocation directly impacts the amortization expense recorded on the financial statements.\nKey Performance and Valuation Measures\nIn order to assess our financial performance between periods, we evaluate certain key performance and valuation measures for each of our operating segments separately for the periods presented. Results and statistics may not be comparable period-over-period due to the impact of acquisitions and dispositions, or the impact of new and lost therapy contracts.\nThe following is a glossary of terms for some of our key performance and valuation measures and non-GAAP measures:\nActual Patient Days\u201d is defined as the number of residents occupying a bed (or units in the case of an assisted/senior living center) for one qualifying day in that period.\nAdjusted EBITDA\u201d is defined as EBITDA adjusted for newly acquired or constructed businesses with start-up losses and other adjustments to provide a supplemental performance measure. See Reasons for Non-GAAP Financial Disclosure\u201d for an explanation of the adjustments and a description of our uses of, and the limitations associated with, non-GAAP measures.\nAdjusted EBITDAR\u201d is defined as EBITDAR adjusted for newly acquired or constructed businesses with start-up losses and other adjustments to provide a supplemental valuation measure. See Reasons for Non-GAAP Financial Disclosure\u201d for an explanation of the adjustments and a description of our uses of, and the limitations associated with, non-GAAP measures.\nAvailable Patient Days\u201d is defined as the number of available beds (or units in the case of an assisted/senior living center) multiplied by the number of days in that period.\nAverage Daily Census\u201d or ADC\u201d is the number of residents occupying a bed (or units in the case of an assisted/senior living center) over a period of time, divided by the number of calendar days in that period.\nEBITDA\u201d is defined as EBITDAR less lease expense. See Reasons for Non-GAAP Financial Disclosure\u201d for an explanation of the adjustments and a description of our uses of, and the limitations associated with non-GAAP measures.\nEBITDAR\u201d is defined as net income or loss attributable to Genesis Healthcare, Inc. before net income or loss of non-controlling interests, net income or loss from discontinued operations, depreciation and amortization expense, interest expense and lease expense. See Reasons for Non-GAAP Financial Disclosure\u201d for an explanation of the adjustments and a description of our uses of, and the limitations associated with non-GAAP measures.\nInsurance\u201d refers collectively to commercial insurance and managed care payor sources, including Medicare Advantage beneficiaries, but does not include managed care payors serving Medicaid residents, which are included in the Medicaid category.\nOccupancy Percentage\u201d is measured as the percentage of Actual Patient Days relative to the Available Patient Days.\nSkilled Mix\u201d refers collectively to Medicare and Insurance payor sources.\nTherapist Efficiency\u201d is computed by dividing billable labor minutes related to patient care and customer value added services by total labor minutes for the period.\nKey performance and valuation measures for our businesses are set forth below, followed by a comparison and analysis of our financial results:\nTable 38: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nYear ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nFinancial Results (in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nFinancial Performance Measures:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nNet revenues (GAAP)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n4,565,834\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n4,976,650\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nNet income (loss) attributable to Genesis Healthcare, Inc.

respiratory therapy services.\nReasons for Non-GAAP Financial Disclosure\nThe following discussion includes references to Adjusted EBITDAR, EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA, which are non-GAAP financial measures (collectively, Non-GAAP Financial Measures). A Non-GAAP Financial Measure is a numerical measure of a registrant's value, historical or future financial performance, financial position and cash flows that excludes amounts, or is subject to adjustments that have the effect of excluding amounts, that are included in the most directly comparable financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP in the statement of operations, balance sheet or statement of cash flows (or equivalent statements) of the registrant; or includes amounts, or is subject to adjustments that have the effect of including amounts, that are excluded from the most directly comparable financial measure so calculated and presented. In this regard, GAAP refers to generally accepted accounting principles in the United States. We have provided reconciliations of the Non-GAAP Financial Measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures.\nWe believe the presentation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures provides useful information to investors regarding our results of operations because these financial measures are useful for trending, analyzing and benchmarking the performance and value of our business. By excluding certain expenses and other items that may not be indicative of our core business operating results, these Non-GAAP Financial Measures:\n\uf0b7allow investors to evaluate our performance from management's perspective, resulting in greater transparency with respect to supplemental information used by us in our financial and operational decision making;\n\uf0b7facilitate comparisons with prior periods and reflect the principal basis on which management monitors financial performance;\n\uf0b7facilitate comparisons with the performance of others in the post-acute industry;\n\uf0b7provide better transparency as to the measures used by management and others who follow our industry to estimate the value of our company; and\n\uf0b7allow investors to view our financial performance and condition in the same manner as our significant landlords and lenders require us to report financial information to them in connection with determining our compliance with financial covenants.\nWe use two Non-GAAP Financial Measures primarily (EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA) as performance measures and believe that the GAAP financial measure most directly comparable to these two Non-GAAP Financial Measures is net income (loss) attributable to Genesis Healthcare, Inc. We use one Non-GAAP Financial Measure (Adjusted EBITDAR) as a valuation measure and believe that the GAAP financial measure most directly comparable to this Non-GAAP Financial Measure is net income (loss) attributable to Genesis Healthcare, Inc. We use Non-GAAP Financial Measures to assess the value of our business and the performance of our operating businesses, as well as the employees responsible for operating such businesses. Non-GAAP Financial Measures are useful in this regard because they do not include such costs as interest expense, income taxes and depreciation and amortization expense which may vary from business unit to business unit depending upon such factors as the method used to finance the original purchase of the business unit or the tax law in the state in which a business unit operates. By excluding such factors when measuring financial performance, many of which are outside of the control of the employees responsible for operating our business units, we are better able to evaluate value and the operating performance of the business unit and the employees responsible for business unit performance. Consequently, we use these\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures to determine the extent to which our employees have met performance goals, and therefore the extent to which they may or may not be eligible for incentive compensation awards.\nWe also use Non-GAAP Financial Measures in our annual budget process. We believe these Non-GAAP Financial Measures facilitate internal comparisons to historical operating performance of prior periods and external comparisons to competitors' historical operating performance. The presentation of these Non-GAAP Financial Measures is consistent with our past practice and we believe these measures further enable investors and analysts to compare current non-GAAP measures with non-GAAP measures presented in prior periods.\nAlthough we use Non-GAAP Financial Measures as financial measures to assess value and the performance of our business, the use of these Non-GAAP Financial Measures is limited because they do not consider certain material costs necessary to operate the business. These costs include our lease expense (only in the case of Adjusted EBITDAR), the cost to service debt, the depreciation and amortization associated with our long-lived assets, gains (losses) on early extinguishment of debt, transaction costs, long-lived asset impairment charges, federal and state income tax expenses, the operating results of our discontinued businesses and the loss attributable to non-controlling interests. Because Non-GAAP Financial Measures do not consider these important elements of our cost structure, a user of our financial information who relies on Non-GAAP Financial Measures as the only measures of our performance could draw an incomplete or misleading conclusion regarding our financial performance. Consequently, a user of our financial information should consider net income (loss) attributable to Genesis Healthcare, Inc. as an important measure of its financial performance because it provides the most complete measure of our performance.\nOther companies may define Non-GAAP Financial Measures differently and, as a result, our Non-GAAP Financial Measures may not be directly comparable to those of other companies. Non-GAAP Financial Measures do not represent net income (loss), as defined by GAAP. Non-GAAP Financial Measures should be considered in addition to, not a substitute for, or superior to, GAAP Financial Measures.\nWe use the following Non-GAAP Financial Measures that we believe are useful to investors as key valuation and operating performance measures:\nEBITDA\nWe believe EBITDA is useful to an investor in evaluating our operating performance because it helps investors evaluate and compare the results of our operations from period to period by removing the impact of our capital structure (interest expense) and our asset base (depreciation and amortization expense) from our operating results. In addition, financial covenants in our debt agreements use EBITDA as a measure of compliance.\nAdjustments to EBITDA\nWe adjust EBITDA when evaluating our performance because we believe that the exclusion of certain additional items described below provides useful supplemental information to investors regarding our ongoing operating performance, in the case of Adjusted EBITDA. We believe that the presentation of Adjusted EBITDA, when combined with GAAP net income (loss) attributable to Genesis Healthcare, Inc., and EBITDA, is beneficial to an investor's complete understanding of our operating performance. In addition, such adjustments are substantially similar to the adjustments to EBITDA provided for in the financial covenant calculations contained in our lease and debt agreements.\nWe adjust EBITDA for the following items:\n \u00b7 (Gain) loss on early extinguishment of debt. We recognize gains or losses on the early extinguishment of debt when we refinance our debt prior to its original term, requiring us to write-off any unamortized deferred financing fees. We exclude the effect of gains or losses recorded on the early extinguishment of debt because we believe these gains and losses do not accurately reflect the underlying performance of our operating businesses. \n \u00b7 Other income. We primarily use this income statement caption to capture gains and losses on the sale or disposition of assets. We exclude the effect of such gains and losses because we believe they do not accurately reflect the underlying performance of our operating businesses. \n \u00b7 Transaction costs. In connection with our acquisition and disposition transactions, we incur costs consisting of investment banking, legal, transaction-based compensation and other professional service costs. We exclude acquisition and disposition related transaction costs expensed during the period because we believe these costs do not reflect the underlying performance of our operating businesses. \n \u00b7 Long-lived asset impairments. We exclude non-cash long-lived asset impairment charges because we believe including them does not reflect the ongoing operating performance of our operating businesses. Additionally, such impairment charges represent accelerated depreciation expense, and depreciation expense is excluded from EBITDA. \n \u00b7 Goodwill and identifiable intangible asset impairments. We exclude non-cash goodwill and identifiable intangible asset impairment charges because we believe including them does not reflect the ongoing operating performance of our operating businesses. \n \u00b7 Severance and restructuring. We exclude severance costs from planned reduction in force initiatives associated with restructuring activities intended to adjust our cost structure in response to changes in the business environment. We believe these costs do not reflect the underlying performance of our operating businesses. We do not exclude severance costs that are not associated with such restructuring activities. \n \u00b7 Losses of newly acquired, constructed or divested businesses. The acquisition and construction of new businesses is an element of our growth strategy. Many of the businesses we acquire have a history of operating losses and continue to generate operating losses in the months that follow our acquisition. Newly constructed or developed businesses also generate losses while in their start-up phase. We view these losses as both temporary and an expected component of our long-term investment in the new venture. We adjust these losses when computing Adjusted EBITDA in order to better analyze the performance of our mature ongoing business. The activities of such businesses are adjusted when computing Adjusted EBITDA until such time as a new business generates positive Adjusted EBITDA. The operating performance of new businesses is no longer adjusted when computing Adjusted EBITDA beginning in the period in which a new business generates positive Adjusted EBITDA and all periods thereafter. The divestiture of underperforming or non-strategic facilities is also an element of our business strategy. We eliminate the results of divested facilities beginning in the quarter in which they become divested. We view the losses associated with the wind-down of such divested facilities as not indicative of the performance of our ongoing operating businesses. \n \u00b7 Stock-based compensation. We exclude stock-based compensation expense because it does not result in an outlay of cash and such non-cash expenses do not reflect the underlying operating performance of our operating businesses. \n \u00b7 Regulatory defense and related costs - We exclude the costs of investigating and defending the inherited legal matters associated with prior transactions. We also exclude costs of disputed settlements with state agencies. We believe these costs are non-recurring in nature as they will no longer be recognized following the final settlement of these matters. Also, we do not believe the excluded costs reflect the underlying performance of our operating businesses. \n \u00b7 Other non-recurring costs - In the year ended December 31, 2019, we excluded $1.1 million in insurance recoveries and costs related to 2017 hurricane damage and the partial recovery of receivables written down in 2018. In the year ended December 31, 2018, we excluded $13.0 million of costs attributable to the write down of receivables in our non-core physician services business and the impairment of unrealized incentives associated with a government program rewarding the meaningful use of technology in delivery of healthcare. This incentive was estimated to be earned and recognized between 2015 and 2016 within our physician services line of business. We do not believe the excluded costs are recurring or reflect the underlying performance of our operating businesses. \nAdjusted EBITDAR\nWe use Adjusted EBITDAR as one measure in determining the value of our business and the value of prospective acquisitions or divestitures. Adjusted EBITDAR is also a commonly used measure to estimate the enterprise value of businesses in the healthcare and other industries. In addition, financial covenants in our lease agreements use Adjusted EBITDAR as a measure of compliance. The adjustments made and previously described in the computation of Adjusted EBITDA are also made when computing Adjusted EBITDAR. See the reconciliation of net loss attributable to Genesis Healthcare, Inc. included herein.\nSupplemental Information\nWe provide supplemental information about certain capital costs we believe are beneficial to an investor's understanding of our capital structure and cash flows. This supplemental information includes (1) cash interest payments on our recourse and HUD guaranteed indebtedness (2) cash rent payments made to partially owned real estate joint ventures that is eliminated in consolidation, net of any distributions returned to us, and (3) total cash lease payments made pursuant to operating leases, finance leases and financing obligations.\nThis supplemental information is used by us to evaluate our leverage, fixed charge coverage and cash flow. This supplemental information is consistent with information used by our major creditors in evaluating compliance with financial covenants contained in our material lease and loan agreements.\nThe

expansion in core markets and operating segments which we believe will enhance the value of our business in the ever-changing landscape of national healthcare. We are also focused on right-sizing\u201d our operations to fit that new environment and to divest underperforming and non-strategic assets.\nWe define our same-store inpatient operations as those skilled nursing and assisted/senior living centers which have been operated by us, in a steady-state, for each comparable period in this Results of Operations discussion. We exclude from that definition those skilled nursing and assisted/senior living facilities recently acquired that were not operated by us for the entire period, as well as those that were divested prior to or during the most recent period presented. In cases where we are developing new skilled nursing or\nassisted/senior living centers, those operations are excluded from our same-store\u201d inpatient operations until the revenue driven by operating patient census is stable in the comparable periods.\nBecause our rehabilitation therapy services operations experiences a high volume of both new and terminated contracts in an annual cycle, and the scale and significance of those contracts can be very different to both the revenue and operating expenses of that business, a same-store presentation based solely on the contract or gym count does not provide an accurate depiction of the business. Accordingly, we do not reference same-store figures in this MD&A with regard to that business.\nThe volume of services delivered in our other services businesses can also be affected by strategic transactional activity. To the extent there are businesses to be excluded to achieve same-store comparability those will be noted in the context of the Results of Operations discussion.\nYear Ended December 31, 2019 Compared

December 31, 2018 decreased by $410.8 million, or 8.3%.\nInpatient Services - Revenue decreased $340.8 million, or 7.9%, for the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared with the same period in 2018. On a same-store basis, inpatient services revenue increased $64.0 million, or 1.8%, excluding 99 divested underperforming facilities and the acquisition or development of 12 additional facilities. Included in the same-store revenue increase is $19.0 million related to a new provider tax program in the state of New Mexico for the period July 1, 2019 through December 31, 2019, which was not in place for the corresponding period in 2018. An additional $10.0 million of the increase in the year ended December 31, 2019 is attributed to the transition from RUGs based reimbursement to the PDPM reimbursement methodology in the fourth fiscal quarter of 2019. The remaining $35.0 million same-store increase is due to increasing census volume and payor rates, primarily in our Medicaid population, partially offset by continued decline in the skilled mix of our inpatient facilities. For the past several years, census and skilled mix trends have been affected by healthcare reforms resulting in lower lengths of stay among our skilled patient population and lower admissions caused by initiatives among acute care providers, managed care payors and conveners to divert certain skilled nursing referrals to home health or other community-based care settings. While overall census is recovering as compared with the\npreceding year, the skilled mix continued to decline. We believe population demographics will present opportunities in the near future to recapture census, and to some extent skilled mix, where it was lost through reform measures. Over the course of the year ended December 31, 2019, we saw overall same-store occupancy rates exceed that of the same period in 2018 by over 90 basis points. However, at the same time, same-store skilled mix in the year ended December 31, 2019 lagged the same period in 2018 by nearly 90 basis points.\nFor an expanded discussion regarding the factors influencing our census trends, see Item 1, Business - Recent Legislative, Regulatory and other Governmental Actions Affecting Revenue\u201d in this Form 10-K, as well as the Key Performance and Valuation Measures in this Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations for quantification of the census trends and revenue per patient day.\nRehabilitation Therapy Services - Revenue decreased $85.4 million, or 15.6% for the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared with the same period in 2018. Of that decrease, $67.0 million is due to lost contract business, offset by $21.5 million attributed to new contracts. The remaining decrease of $39.9 million is principally due to reduced volume of services provided to existing customers and amended customer pricing terms in connection with the implementation of PDPM.\nOther Services - Revenue increased $15.4 million, or 11.7% for the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared with the same period in 2018. Our other services revenue is comprised mainly of our physician services and staffing services businesses, in addition to our ACO. In the year ended December 31, 2019, the ACO recognized revenue of $10.8 million under MSSP. There was no MSSP revenue recognized in the comparable period in 2018. Revenue in our physician services business increased $8.8 million in the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared with the same period in 2018. Our staffing services business accounts for the remaining decrease in other services revenue of $4.2 million. While the staffing business gross revenue has increased 19.5% in the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared with the same period in 2018, its revenue from external customers has decreased 4.2% over that same period. This decrease is the result of a shift in focus of that business to expand its services to our affiliated nursing facilities and therapy gyms. Prioritizing our internal staffing needs is a strategic goal for our staffing business, amid record low unemployment nationally.\nEBITDA\nEBITDA for the year ended December 31, 2019 increased by $3.0 million, or 1.0% as compared with the same period in 2018. Excluding the impact of (gain) loss on early extinguishment of debt, other (income) loss, transaction costs, long-lived asset impairments, and goodwill and identifiable intangible asset impairments, EBITDA decreased $255.3 million, or 58.3% when compared with the same period in 2018. The contributing factors for this net increase are described in our discussion below of segment results and corporate overhead.\nInpatient Services - EBITDA decreased $23.1 million, or 5.9% in the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared with the same period in 2018. Excluding the impact of other (income) loss, long-lived asset impairments and goodwill and identifiable intangible asset impairments, EBITDA decreased $272.5 million, or 55.8% when compared with the same period in 2018. On a same-store basis, the inpatient EBITDA decreased $243.1 million. Of that same-store decline, lease expense increased $254.6 million, principally resulting from the adoption of Topic 842, which became effective on January 1, 2019. The impact to our financial position and statements of operation from the adoption of this accounting standard is more fully described in Note 2 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies - Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements.\u201d See also Note 10 - Leases.\u201d Our self-insurance programs resulted in an increase of $4.1 million EBITDA in the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared with the same period in 2018. While our self-insurance programs are performing as anticipated with reduced volumes related to the implementation of our portfolio optimization strategies and within normal claims reporting patterns of our same-store operations, we are also seeing reduced pressures particularly in our general and professional liability claims experience. The reduction in the provision for general and professional liability for the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared with the same period in 2018 is the result of favorable prior year claim development and lower current year loss exposures. The favorable development is due to the combination of the ongoing impact of tort reform, claim settlements, and other risk management initiatives. Offsetting some of the positive trends in professional liability experience, self-insured health benefits on the same-store population saw an increase over the prior year due to some singularly large claims that presented throughout 2019. Same-store staffing costs, net of nursing agency and other purchased services, increased $40.9 million. Nursing wage inflation increased 4.2% while non-nursing wage inflation increased 2.6% in the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared with the same period in 2018. The introduction of the new provider tax program in New Mexico for period July 1, 2019 through December 31, 2019 resulting in an increase of EBITDA of $10.5 million compared to the same period in 2018 before the program was enacted. The remaining $37.8 million increase in EBITDA, as adjusted, of the segment is attributed to ongoing expense\nmanagement, reduced therapy services cost due to the implementation of PDPM and increased census volume in our skilled nursing facilities, partially offset by the continued pressures on skilled mix of our inpatient facilities described above under Net Revenues.\u201d\nRehabilitation Therapy Services - EBITDA decreased by $9.3 million or 9.1% for the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared with the same period in 2018. Excluding the impact of other (income) loss, EBITDA decreased $12.2 million when compared with the same period in 2018. Lost therapy contracts exceeded new contracts and service fees by $10.7 million. The remaining decrease of $1.5 million is principally attributed to the net impact of amended customer pricing terms in connection with the implementation of PDPM offset by a reduction in force of employed therapist, further offset with reductions in overhead and reductions of start-up losses in our operations in China. Therapist efficiency improved to 68.0% in the year ended December 31, 2019 compared with 63.7% in the comparable period in the prior year.\nOther Services - EBITDA increased $23.1 million or 217.3% for the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared with the same period in 2018. Of this amount, the ACO contributed $4.2 million, most of which was due to the low cost structure and no revenue recognized in that business in the comparable 2018 period. The remaining increase of $18.9 million pertains to our physician services business. The year ended December 31, 2018 included charges of $13.0 million to write down accounts receivable to its realizable fair value. Those charges did not recur in 2019. The remaining increase of $5.9 million in our physician services business was principally driven by increased physician and nurse practitioner encounters, coupled with improved reimbursement rates, partially offset by increased administrative costs of practice management.\nCorporate and Eliminations - EBITDA increased $12.3 million or 7.0% in the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared with the same period in 2018. EBITDA of our corporate function includes (gains) losses on early extinguishment of debt and losses associated with transactions that are outside of the scope of our reportable segments. These and other transactions, which are separately captioned in our consolidated statements of operations and described more fully above in our Reasons for Non-GAAP Financial Disclosure, contributed $6.0 million of the net decrease in Corporate and Eliminations EBITDA. Corporate overhead costs decreased $4.7 million, or 3.2%, in the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared with the same period in 2018. The remaining increase in EBITDA of $1.6 million is primarily the result of an increase in investment earnings from our unconsolidated affiliates accounted for on the equity method and other investments.\nOther income - In the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, we completed multiple transactions, including the divestitures of numerous owned assets and the termination and refinancing of certain facilities subject to lease agreements. See Note 4 - Significant Transactions and Events.\u201d These transactions resulted in net gains of $173.5 million and $12.9 million for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. See Note 18 - Other Income.\u201d\nTransaction costs - In the normal course of business, we evaluate strategic acquisition, disposition and business development opportunities. The costs to pursue these opportunities, when incurred, vary from period to period depending on the nature of the transaction pursued and if those transactions are ever completed. Transaction costs incurred for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 were $26.4 million and $32.0 million, respectively.\nLong-lived asset impairments - In the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, we recognized impairments of property and equipment of $16.9 million and $105.0 million, respectively. For more information about the conditions of the business which contributed to these impairments, see Note 19 - Asset Impairment Charges - Long-Lived Assets with a Definite Useful Life.\u201d\nGoodwill and identifiable intangible asset impairments - In the year ended December 31, 2018, we recognized impairment of identifiable intangible favorable lease assets of $3.5 million. For more information about the conditions of the business which contributed to these impairments, see Industry Trends and Recent Regulatory Governmental Actions Affecting Revenue\u201d and Financial Condition and Liquidity Considerations\u201d in this MD&A, as well as Note 19 - Asset Impairment Charges - Identifiable Intangible Assets with a Definite Useful Life.\u201d\nOther Expense\nThe following discussion applies to the expense categories between EBITDA and income (loss) of all reportable segments and corporate and eliminations in our consolidating statement of operations for the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared with the same period in 2018.\nDepreciation and amortization - Each of our reportable segments and corporate overhead have depreciating property, plant and equipment, including amortization of finance leased ROU assets. Our rehabilitation therapy services and other services have identifiable intangible assets which amortize over the estimated life of those identifiable assets. Depreciation and amortization expense decreased $97.7 million in the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared with the same period in 2018. On a same-store basis, depreciation and amortization decreased $75.4 million in the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared with the same period in 2018. Of this decrease, approximately $75.4 million resulted from the adoption of Topic 842, which was effective on January 1, 2019. The impact to our financial position and statements of operation from the adoption of this accounting standard is more fully described in Note 2 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies - Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements\u201d and Note 10 - Leases.\u201d\nInterest expense - Interest expense includes the cash interest and non-cash adjustments required to account for our debt instruments, as well as the expense associated with leases accounted for as finance leases or financing obligations. Interest expense decreased $283.3 million in the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared with the same period in 2018. On a same-store basis, interest expense decreased $259.6 million in the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared with the same period in 2018. Of this decrease, approximately $282.6 million resulted from the adoption of Topic 842, which was effective on January 1, 2019. The impact to our financial position and statements of operation from the adoption of this accounting standard is more fully described in Note 2 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies - Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements\u201d and Note 10 - Leases.\u201d The decrease was offset by $23.0 million that is principally the result of higher rates of interest incurred in the year ended December 31, 2019 on the debt instruments impacted by the financial restructuring, which was not fully realized in the prior year period, in addition to consolidating debt and the associated interest expense of two real-estate partnerships in 2019, which were determined to be VIEs of which we are the primary beneficiary. See Note 1 - General Information - Basis of Presentation\u201d and Note 12 - Long-Term Debt.\u201d\nIncome tax expense (benefit) - For the year ended December 31, 2019, we recorded income tax expense of $1.8 million, representing an effective tax rate of 19.0% compared to an income tax benefit of $2.4 million, representing an effective tax rate of 0.7% for the same period in 2018. There is a full valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets, excluding our deferred tax asset on our Bermuda captive insurance company's discounted unpaid loss reserve. Previously, in assessing the requirement for, and amount of, a valuation allowance in accordance with the standard, we determined it was more likely than not we would not realize our deferred tax assets and established a valuation allowance against the deferred tax assets. As of December 31, 2019, we have determined that the valuation allowance is still necessary.\nNet Loss Attributable to Genesis Healthcare, Inc.\nThe following discussion applies to categories between net income (loss) and net income (loss) attributable to Genesis Healthcare, Inc. in our consolidated statements of operations for the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared with the same period in 2018.\nNet loss attributable to noncontrolling interests - Following the combination of Skilled and FC-GEN Operations Investment, LLC (FC-GEN), direct noncontrolling economic interest was recorded as noncontrolling interest in the financial statements of the combined entity. The direct noncontrolling economic interest is in the form of Class C common stock of FC-GEN that are exchangeable on a 1-to-1 basis to our public shares. The direct noncontrolling economic interest will continue to decrease as Class C common stock of FC-GEN are exchanged for public shares. Since the combination, there have been conversions of 8.3 million Class C common stock reducing the initial, approximately 42% direct noncontrolling economic interest to 33.9% at December 31, 2019. For the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, income (loss) of $2.8 million and $(139.2) million, respectively, has been attributed to the Class C common stock.\nIn addition to the noncontrolling interests attributable to the Class C common stock holders, our consolidated financial statements include the accounts of all entities controlled by us through our ownership of a majority voting interest and the accounts of any variable interest entities (VIEs) where we are subject to a majority of the risk of loss from the VIE's activities, or entitled to receive a majority of the entity's residual returns, or both. We adjust net income attributable to Genesis Healthcare, Inc. to exclude the net income attributable to the third party ownership interests of the VIEs. For the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, (loss) income of $(9.9) million and $2.0 million, respectively, has been attributed to these unaffiliated third parties.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nThe following table presents selected data from our consolidated statements of cash flows (in thousands):\nTable 56: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nYear ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nNet cash (used in) provided by operating activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n(7,166)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n18,584\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nNet cash (used in) provided by investing activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(387,003)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n11,876\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nNet cash provided by financing activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n377,699\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n53,178\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nNet (decrease) increase in cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash and equivalents\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(16,470)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n83,638\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nBeginning of period\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n142,276\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n58,638\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nEnd of period\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n125,806\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n142,276\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nNet cash used in operating activities in the year ended December 31, 2019 of $7.2 million was unfavorably impacted by funded transaction costs of approximately $22.3 million. Adjusted for transaction costs, net cash provided by operating activities in the year ended December 31, 2019 would have been approximately $15.1 million. Net cash provided by operating activities in the year ended December 31, 2018 was unfavorably impacted by funded transaction costs of approximately $32.0 million. Adjusted for funded transaction costs, net cash provided by operating activities in the year ended December 31, 2018 would have been $50.6 million. In addition to transaction costs, operating cash flow activities in the year ended December 31, 2019 were unfavorably impacted by the timing associated with the collection of outstanding accounts receivable and payments of certain self-insured liabilities.\nNet cash used in investing activities in the year ended December 31, 2019 was $387.0 million, compared to cash provided by investing activities of $11.9 million in the year ended December 31, 2018. Cash used for routine capital expenditures for the year ended December 31, 2019 increased from the same period in the prior year by $11.6 million. Net sales and maturities of marketable securities of $0.9 million in 2019 exceeded net purchases of marketable securities of $10.5 million in 2018, resulting in a net reduction in cash used of $11.3 million. In the year ended December 31, 2019, there were asset purchases of $252.5 million as a result of the consolidation of the Next Partnership and its acquisition of 22 skilled nursing facilities and asset sale proceeds of $79.0 million resulting from the simultaneous sale of seven skilled nursing facilities as described in Significant Transaction and Events - Strategic Partnerships - Next Partnership.\u201d In the year ended December 31, 2019, there were asset purchases of $339.2 million as a result of the consolidation of the Vantage Point Partnership and its acquisition of 18 skilled nursing facilities as described in Significant Transaction and Events - Strategic Partnerships - Vantage Point Partnership.\u201d In the year ended December 31, 2018, there were no asset purchases. The year ended December 31, 2019 also included $66.9 million in proceeds from the sale of seven facilities in California, $91.7 million in proceeds from the sale of eight facilities in Georgia, New Jersey, Virginia and Maryland and $20.2 million from the sale of seven facilities in Texas. The year ended December 31, 2018, included proceeds of $74.4 million from the sale of 15 owned skilled nursing facilities in Texas and one assisted/senior living facility in Nevada. The year ended December 31, 2019 also included the receipt of a $12.0 million payment of a note receivable. The remaining incremental use of cash from investing activities of $2.4 million in the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared with the same period in 2018 is principally due to an increase in restricted deposit payments.\nNet cash provided by financing activities in the year ended December 31, 2019 was $377.7 million compared to net cash provided by financing activities of $53.2 million in the year ended December 31, 2018. The net increase in cash provided by financing activities of $324.5 million is principally attributed to debt borrowings exceeding debt repayments in the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared to the same period in 2018. In the year ended December 31, 2019, we received proceeds from the issuance of debt of $538.5 million, consisting primarily of $479.4 from the consolidation of the Next Partnership and Vantage Point Partnership, $41.7 million due to the refinancing of three facilities within the Next Partnership with HUD financing and $15.0 million due to a short-term loan from Omega. In the year ended December 31, 2018, we received proceeds from the issuance of debt of $574.2 million, consisting primarily of $438.0 million from the ABL Credit Facilities, $83.0 million from proceeds from the MidCap Real Estate Loans, $40.0 million from the expanded Term Loan Agreement and $10.9 million from the refinancing of a bridge loan with a HUD insured loan. Repayment of long-term debt in the year ended December 31, 2019 was $199.6 million compared to $544.1 million in the same period of the prior year. In the year ended December 31, 2019, we repaid $39.8 million in MidCap Real Estate Loans and $65.6 million in HUD-insured loans using proceeds from the sale of 19 facilities; reduced the term loan facility of the ABL Credit Facilities by $40.0 million while increasing the revolving credit facilities by the same amount; and the Next Partnership reduced its term loan by $38.8 million refinancing three facilities through HUD. In the year ended December 31, 2018, we repaid $363.2 million in the retirement of our prior revolving credit facilities, $85.5 million in the paydown of Welltower Real Estate Loans, $51.9 million in the retirement of HUD insured loans for divested skilled nursing facilities, $10.0 million in the retirement of a mortgage on a corporate office building and $9.9 million in the payoff of a bridge loan with the proceeds from a HUD-insured refinancing. The remaining decrease in cash used to repay long-term debt of $8.2 million relates to a decrease in routine debt payments. In the year ended December 31, 2019, we had net\nborrowings under the revolving credit facilities of $30.3 million as compared with $42.6 million of net repayments under the revolving credit facilities in the same period in 2018. In the year ended December 31, 2019, we paid debt issuance costs of $10.2 million resulting from financing activities associated with the consolidation of the Next Partnership and the Vantage Point Partnership compared to debt issuance costs of $17.0 million, which includes $13.6 million in fees for the ABL Credit Facilities and $3.2 million in fees for the MidCap Real Estate Loans in 2018. In the year ended December 31, 2019, we received contributions from a noncontrolling interest for $18.5 million and $8.5 million resulting from the consolidation of the aforementioned Next Partnership and Vantage Point Partnership, respectively, compared to no contributions from noncontrolling interests in 2018. The remaining net increase in cash used in financing activities of $5.9 million in the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to the same period in 2018 is primarily due to an increase in distributions to noncontrolling interests and repayments of finance lease obligations offset by a reduction in debt settlement costs.\nOur primary sources of liquidity are cash on hand, cash flows from operations, and borrowings under our ABL Credit Facilities.\nThe objectives of our capital planning strategy are to ensure we maintain adequate liquidity and flexibility. Pursuing and achieving those objectives allows us to support the execution of our operating and strategic plans and weather temporary disruptions in the capital markets and general business environment. Maintaining adequate liquidity is a function of our results of operations, restricted and unrestricted cash and cash equivalents and our available borrowing capacity.\nAt December 31, 2019, we had total liquidity of $90.0 million consisting of cash on hand of $74.5 million and available borrowings under our ABL Credit Facilities of $15.5 million. During the year ended December 31, 2019, we maintained liquidity sufficient to meet our working capital, capital expenditure and development activities.\nRecent Developments Potentially Affecting our Results of Operations\nAs the recent outbreak of the coronavirus (COVID-19) continues to spread throughout areas in which we operate, we believe the outbreak has the potential to have a negative impact on our operating results and financial condition. The extent of the impact of COVID-19 on our operational and financial performance will depend on certain developments, including the duration and spread of the outbreak, impact on our patients, employees and vendors, all of which are uncertain and cannot be predicted. Given these uncertainties, we cannot reasonably estimate the related impact to our business, operating results and financial condition, if any.\nStrategic Partnerships\nNext Partnership\nOn January 31, 2019, Welltower sold the real estate of 15 facilities to the Next Partnership, of which we acquired a 46% membership interest for $16.0 million. The remaining interest is held by Next, a related party. See Note 16 - Related Party Transactions.\u201d In conjunction with the facility sales, we received aggregate annual rent credits of $17.2 million. We continue to operate these facilities pursuant to a new master lease with the Next Partnership. The term of the master lease is 15 years with two five-year renewal options available. We will pay annual rent of $19.5 million, with no rent escalators for the first five years and an escalator of 2% beginning in the sixth lease year and thereafter. We also obtained a fixed price purchase option to acquire all of the real property of the facilities. The purchase option is exercisable between lease years five and seven, reducing in price each successive year down to a 10% premium over the original purchase price.\nVantage Point Partnership\nOn September 12, 2019, Welltower and Second Spring sold the real estate of four and 14 facilities, respectively, to the Vantage Point Partnership, in which we invested $37.5 million for an approximate 30% membership interest. The remaining membership interest is held by Vantage Point for an investment of $85.3 million consisting of an equity investment of $8.5 million and a formation loan of $76.8 million. In conjunction with the facility sales, we received aggregate annual rent credits of $30.3 million. We continue to operate these facilities pursuant to a new master lease with the Vantage Point Partnership. The term of the master lease is 15 years with two five-year renewal options available. We will pay annual rent of approximately $33.1 million, with no rent escalators for the first four years and an escalator of 2% beginning in the fifth lease year and thereafter. We also obtained a fixed price purchase option to acquire all of the real property of the facilities. The purchase option is exercisable during certain periods in fiscal years 2024 and 2025 for a 10% premium over the original purchase price. Further, Vantage Point holds a put option that would require us to acquire its\nmembership interests in the Vantage Point Partnership. The put option becomes exercisable if we opt not to purchase the facilities or upon the occurrence of certain events of default.\nNewGen Partnership\nOn February 1, 2020, we transitioned operational responsibility for 19 facilities in the states of California, Washington and Nevada to NewGen. We sold the real estate and operations of six skilled nursing facilities and transferred the leasehold rights to 13 skilled nursing, behavioral health and assisted living facilities for a total of $78.9 million. We will retain a 50% interest in the facilities. Net transaction proceeds were used by us to repay indebtedness, including prepayment fees, of $33.7 million, fund our initial equity contribution and working capital requirement of approximately $15.0 million, and provide financing to the partnership of $9.0 million. Concurrently, the facilities have entered, or will enter upon regulatory approval, into management services agreements with NewGen for the day-to-day operations of the facilities. We will continue to provide administrative and back office services to the facilities pursuant to administrative support agreements, as well as therapy services pursuant to therapy services agreements. We are currently assessing whether we will continue to consolidate the financial statements of these facilities for financial reporting purposes.\nRestructuring Transactions\nOverview\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2018, we entered into a number of agreements, amendments and new financing facilities further described below in an effort to strengthen significantly our capital structure. In total, the Restructuring Transactions are estimated to reduce our annual cash fixed charges by approximately $62.0 million beginning in 2018 and provided $70.0 million of additional cash and borrowing availability, increasing our liquidity and financial flexibility.\nIn connection with the Restructuring Transactions, we entered into a new asset based lending facility agreement, replacing our prior revolving credit facilities and eliminating its forbearance agreement. Also in connection with the Restructuring Transactions, we amended the financial covenants in all of our material loan agreements and all but two of our material master leases. Financial covenants beginning in 2018 were amended to account for changes in our capital structure as a result of the Restructuring Transactions and to account for the current business climate.\nAsset Based Lending Facilities\nOn March 6, 2018, we entered into the ABL Credit Facilities agreement with MidCap. The agreement provides for a $555 million asset based lending facility comprised of (a) a $325 million first lien term loan facility, (b) a $200 million first lien revolving credit facility and (c) a $30 million delayed draw term loan facility. The commitments under the delayed draw term loan facility will be reduced to $20 million in the year 2020. Proceeds were used to replace and repay in full our existing $525 million revolving credit facilities.\nOn June 5, 2019, the ABL Credit Facilities were amended to simultaneously increase the aggregate revolving credit facility commitment by $40.0 million and partially prepay the first lien term loan facility by $40.0 million. The resulting commitment levels of the revolving credit facility and first lien term loan facility were $240.0 million and $285.0 million, respectively.\nThe ABL Credit Facilities have a five-year term set to mature on March 6, 2023. The ABL Credit Facilities include a springing maturity clause that would accelerate its maturity 90 days prior to the maturity of the Term Loan Agreements, Welltower Real Estate Loans or MidCap Real Estate Loans, in the event those agreements are not extended or refinanced. The revolving credit facility includes a swinging lockbox arrangement whereby we transfer all funds deposited within its designated lockboxes to MidCap on a daily basis and then draw from the revolving credit facility as needed. We have presented the entire revolving credit facility borrowings balance of $136.0 million in current installments of long-term debt at December 31, 2019 and 2018. Despite this classification, we expect that we will have the ability to borrow and repay on the revolving credit facility through its maturity date. Cash proceeds of $50.6 million received under the ABL Credit Facilities remain in a restricted account. This amount is pledged to cash collateralize letters of credit previously issued under the retired revolving credit facilities. We have classified this deposit and all cash account balances subject to deposit account control agreements that were sprung under the ABL Credit Facilities as restricted cash and equivalents within the consolidated balance sheets at December 31, 2019 and 2018.\nBorrowings under the term loan and revolving credit facility components of the ABL Credit Facilities bear interest at a 90-day LIBOR rate (subject to a floor of 0.5%) plus an applicable margin of 6%. Borrowings under the delayed draw component bear interest at a 90-day LIBOR rate (subject to a floor of 1%) plus an applicable margin of 11%. Borrowing levels under the term loan and revolving credit facility components of the ABL Credit Facilities are limited to a borrowing base that is computed based upon the level of eligible accounts receivable.\nIn addition to paying interest on the outstanding principal borrowed under the revolving credit facility, we are required to pay a commitment fee to the lenders for any unutilized commitments. The commitment fee rate equals 0.5% per annum on the revolving credit facility and 2% on the delayed draw term loan facility.\nThe term loan facility and revolving credit facility include a termination fee equal to 2% if the loans are prepaid within the first year, 1% if the loans are prepaid after year one and before year two, and 0.5% thereafter. The term loan facility and revolving credit facility include an exit fee equal to $1.6 million and $1.0 million, respectively, due and payable on the earlier of the loan's retirement or on the maturity date.\nThe ABL Credit Facilities contain representations and warranties, affirmative covenants, negative covenants, financial covenants and events of default and security interests that are customarily required for similar financings. Financial covenants include a minimum consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio, a maximum senior leverage ratio and minimum liquidity.\nTerm Loan Amendments\nOn March 6, 2018, we entered into an amendment to the term loan with affiliates of Welltower and Omega (the Term Loan Amendment) pursuant to which we borrowed an additional $40 million to be used for certain debt repayment and general corporate purposes. The additional $40 million term loan bears interest at a rate equal to 10.0% per annum, with up to 5% per annum to be paid in kind. The Term Loan Amendment also changed the interest rate applicable to the initial loans funded on July 29, 2016 to be equal to 14% per annum, with up to 9% per annum to be paid in kind. Among other things, the Term Loan Amendment eliminates any principal amortization payments on any of the loans prior to maturity and modifies the financial covenants beginning in 2018.\nOn May 9, 2019, the Term Loan Agreement was further amended extending the maturity date from July 29, 2020 to November 30, 2021.\nWelltower Master Lease Amendment\nOn February 21, 2018, we entered into a definitive agreement with Welltower to amend the Welltower Master Lease (the Welltower Master Lease Amendment). The Welltower Master Lease Amendment reduces our annual base rent payment by $35 million effective retroactively as of January 1, 2018, reduces the annual rent escalator from approximately 2.9% to 2.5% on April 1, 2018 and further reduces the annual rent escalator to 2.0% beginning January 1, 2019. In addition, the Welltower Master Lease Amendment extends the initial term of the master lease by five years to January 31, 2037 and extends the renewal term of the master lease by five years to December 31, 2048. The Welltower Master Lease Amendment also provides a potential upward rent reset, conditioned upon achievement of certain upside operating metrics, effective January 1, 2023. If triggered, the incremental rent from the rent reset is capped at $35 million.\nOmnibus Agreement\nOn February 21, 2018, we entered into an Omnibus Agreement with Welltower and Omega, pursuant to which Welltower and Omega committed to provide up to $40 million in new term loans and amend the current term loan to, among other things, accommodate a refinancing of our existing asset based credit facility, in each case subject to certain conditions, including the completion of a restructuring of certain of our other material debt and lease obligations. See Term Loan Amendment above.\nThe Omnibus Agreement also provides that upon satisfying certain conditions, including raising new capital that is used to pay down certain indebtedness owed to Welltower and Omega, (a) $50 million of outstanding indebtedness owed to Welltower will be written off and (b) we may request conversion of not more than $50 million of the outstanding balance of our Welltower real estate loans into equity. If the proposed equity conversion would result in any adverse REIT qualification, status or compliance consequences to Welltower, then the debt that would otherwise be converted to equity shall instead be converted into a loan incurring paid in kind\ninterest at 2% per annum compounded quarterly, with a term of ten years commencing on the date the applicable conditions precedent to the equity conversion have been satisfied. Moreover, we agreed to support Welltower in connection with the sale of certain of Welltower's interests in facilities covered by the Welltower Master Lease, including negotiating and entering into definitive new master lease agreements with third party buyers.\nIn connection with the Omnibus Agreement, we agreed to issue warrants to Welltower and Omega to purchase 900,000 shares and 600,000 shares, respectively, of our Class A Common Stock at an exercise price equal to $1.33 per share. Issuance of the warrant to Welltower is subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions. The warrants may be exercised at any time during the period commencing six months from the date of issuance and ending five years from the date of issuance.\nWelltower Real Estate Loans Amendment\nOn February 21, 2018, we entered into amendments (the Real Estate Loan Amendments) to the Welltower real estate loan (Welltower Real Estate Loans) agreements. The Real Estate Loan Amendments adjust the annual interest rate beginning February 15, 2018 to 12%, of which 7% will be paid in cash and 5% will be paid in kind. Previously, these loans carried a 10.25% cash pay interest rate that increased by 0.25% annually on January 1.\nWe agreed to make commercially reasonable efforts to secure commitments to repay no less than $105.0 million of the Welltower Real Estate Loan obligations. As of December 31, 2019, we have not yet secured the total required repayments or commitments. As a result, the annual cash component of the interest payments was increased by approximately $2.0 million with a corresponding decrease in the paid in kind component of interest.\nMidCap Real Estate Loans\nOn March 30, 2018, we entered into the MidCap Real Estate Loans which had combined available proceeds of $75.0 million, $73.0 million of which was drawn as of December 31, 2018. The MidCap Real Estate Loans are secured by 12 skilled nursing facilities and are subject to a five-year term maturing on March 30, 2023. The maturity of the MidCap Real Estate Loans will accelerate in the event the ABL Credit Facilities are repaid in full and terminated. The loans, which were interest only in the first year, are subject to an annual interest rate equal to LIBOR (subject to a floor of 1.5%) plus an applicable margin of 5.85%. Beginning April 1, 2019, mandatory principal payments commenced with the balance of the loans to be repaid at maturity. Proceeds from the MidCap Real Estate Loans were used to repay partially the Welltower Real Estate Loans.\nOn November 8, 2018, one of the MidCap Real Estate Loans was amended with an additional borrowing of $10.0 million. The proceeds were used to retire a maturing mortgage loan on a corporate office building. The office building has been added as collateral and the loan maturity remains March 30, 2023. The $10.0 million additional loan is subject to an annual interest rate equal to 30-day LIBOR (subject to a floor of 2.0%) plus an applicable margin of 6.25% with principal amortizing immediately and the balance due at maturity.\nOn May 1, 2019, we divested the real property and operations of five skilled nursing facilities in California, three of which were subject to the MidCap Real Estate Loans. We used the sale proceeds to repay $27.7 million on the MidCap Real Estate Loans. During the third quarter of 2019, we divested the real property of two skilled nursing facilities in New Jersey and one skilled nursing facility in Maryland that were subject to the MidCap Real Estate Loans and used the sale proceeds to repay $12.1 million on the loans. See Note 4 - Significant Transactions and Events - Strategic Partnerships - Vantage Point Partnership.\u201d The MidCap Real Estate Loans had an outstanding principal balance of $42.2 million and $83.0 million at December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively.\nSabra Master Leases\nIn 2017, we entered into a definitive agreement with Sabra resulting in permanent and unconditional annual cash rent savings of $19.0 million, which became effective January 1, 2018. For the year ended December 31, 2018, we terminated the Sabra lease agreement for 33 skilled nursing facilities and one assisted/senior living facility but continue to operate these facilities under new lease arrangements with different landlords and terminated the Sabra lease agreement associated with nine divested skilled nursing facilities.\nAs a result of the amendments and lease terminations noted above, we recorded a lease termination charge of $34.1 million in the year ended December 31, 2018. The charge represented the discounted residual rents due to Sabra on the skilled nursing facilities that\nhave been terminated due to either divestiture or sale to a new landlord. As of December 31, 2019, there remains an obligation of $26.7 million, $18.4 million recorded in other long-term liabilities and $8.3 million recorded in accrued expenses, to be repaid through 2023.\nOther Financing Activities\nMortgages and other secured debt (non-recourse) refinancings\nIn December 2019, a portion of the Next Partnership's term loan facility was refinanced via three new HUD insured loans. The new loans had an aggregate initial principal balance of $41.7 million, all of which remained outstanding as of December 31, 2019. The loans have an original amortization term of 35 years and a fixed interest rate of 3.15%. Proceeds were principally used to repay a portion of the term loan associated with the Next Partnership and fees.\nDivestiture of Non-Strategic Facilities\nConsistent with our strategy to divest assets in non-strategic markets, we have exited the inpatient operations of 111 skilled nursing facilities, five assisted/senior living facilities and seven behavioral outpatient clinics in 17 states since January 1, 2018, including:\n \u00b7 The closure of one skilled nursing facility located in Massachusetts on February 28, 2018 that was subject to a master lease agreement with Welltower. A loss was recognized totaling $0.3 million. \n \u00b7 The sale of five skilled nursing facilities located in Massachusetts and Kentucky on April 1, 2018 that were subject to a master lease agreement with Sabra. A gain was recognized totaling $0.2 million. \n \u00b7 The lease termination of one previously closed skilled nursing facility located in California on May 4, 2018 that was subject to a master lease agreement with Sabra. A gain was recognized totaling $0.5 million. \n \u00b7 The lease expiration of one skilled nursing facility located in California on June 1, 2018. A loss was recognized totaling $0.9 million. \n \u00b7 The sale and lease termination of eight skilled nursing facilities located in Pennsylvania and four skilled nursing facilities located in New Jersey on June 1, 2018 and June 13, 2018, respectively. These skilled nursing facilities were subject to a master lease agreement with Second Spring.

At December 31, 2019, we were in compliance with all of the financial covenants contained in the Credit Facilities.\nWe have master lease agreements with Welltower, Sabra, Omega and Second Spring (collectively, the Master Lease Agreements). Our Master Lease Agreements each contain a number of financial, affirmative and negative covenants, including a maximum leverage\nratio, a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio, and minimum liquidity. At December 31, 2019, we were in compliance with the covenants contained in the Master Lease Agreements.\nWe have two master lease agreements with Cindat Best Years Welltower JV LLC involving 28 of our facilities. We did not meet certain financial covenants contained in one of the master lease agreements involving two of our facilities at December 31, 2019. On March 9, 2020, we received a waiver for these covenant breaches through April 1, 2021. At December 31, 2019, we are in compliance with the financial covenants contained in the other master lease agreement.\nAt December 31, 2019, we did not meet certain financial covenants contained in one lease related to two of our facilities. We are and expect to continue to be current in the timely payment of our obligations under the lease. This lease does not have cross default provisions, nor does it trigger cross default provisions in any of our other loan or lease agreements. We will continue to work with the related credit party to amend the lease and the related financial covenants. We do not believe the breach of such financial covenants has a material adverse impact on us at December 31, 2019.\nOur ability to maintain compliance with our covenants depends in part on management's ability to increase revenue and control costs. Due to continuing changes in the healthcare industry, as well as the uncertainty with respect to changing referral patterns, patient mix, and reimbursement rates, it is possible that future operating performance may not generate sufficient operating results to maintain compliance with our quarterly covenant compliance requirements. Should we fail to comply with our covenants at a future measurement date, we would, absent necessary and timely waivers and/or amendments, be in default under certain of our existing credit agreements. To the extent any cross-default provisions may apply, the default would have an even more significant impact on our financial position.\nConcentration of Credit Risk\nWe are exposed to the credit risk of our third-party customers, many of whom are in similar lines of business as us and are exposed to the same systemic industry risks of operations, as we, resulting in a concentration of risk. These include organizations that utilize our rehabilitation services, staffing services and physician service offerings, engaged in similar business activities or having economic features that would cause their ability to meet contractual obligations, including those to us, to be similarly affected by changes in regulatory and systemic industry conditions.\nManagement assesses its exposure to loss on accounts at the customer level. The greatest concentration of risk exists in our rehabilitation therapy services business where it has over 140 distinct customers, many being chain operators with more than one location. One of our customers, a related party, comprises $28.9 million, approximately 34%, of the gross outstanding contract receivables in the rehabilitation services business at December 31, 2019. See Note 16 - Related Party Transactions.\u201d Additionally, one former customer comprises $7.0 million, approximately 8%, of the gross outstanding contract receivables in the rehabilitation therapy services business at December 31, 2019. An adverse event impacting the solvency of these large customers resulting in their insolvency or other economic distress would have a material impact on us.\nFinancial Condition and Liquidity Considerations\nThe accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared on the basis that we will continue as a going concern, which contemplates the realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business.\nIn evaluating our ability to continue as a going concern, management considered the conditions and events that could raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern for 12 months following the date our financial statements were issued (March 16, 2020). Management considered the recent results of operations as well as our current financial condition and liquidity sources, including current funds available, forecasted future cash flows and our conditional and unconditional obligations due before March 16, 2021. Based upon such considerations, management determined that there are no known or knowable conditions or events that raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern for 12 months following the date of issuance of these financial statements (March 16, 2020).\nOur results of operations continue to be negatively impacted by the persistent pressure of healthcare reforms enacted in recent years. This challenging operating environment has been most acute in our inpatient segment, but also has had a detrimental effect on our rehabilitation therapy segment and its customers. In recent years, we have implemented a number of cost mitigation strategies to\noffset the negative financial implications of this challenging operating environment. These strategies have been successful in recent years, however, the negative impact of continued reductions in skilled patient admissions, shortening lengths of stay, escalating wage inflation and professional liability losses, combined with the increased cost of capital through escalating lease payments, persists.\nIn response to these issues, we entered into the Restructuring Transactions, exited the operations of 99 non-strategic facilities and restructured/terminated certain leases during the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018. See Note 4 - Significant Transactions and Events\u201d for further detail. We expect to continue to pursue cost mitigation and other strategies in 2020 in response to the operating environment and liquidity requirements. During 2018 and 2019, we also amended, or obtained waivers related to, the financial covenants of all of our material debt and lease agreements to account for these ongoing changes in our capital structure and business conditions.\nRisk and Uncertainties\nShould we fail to comply with our debt and lease covenants at a future measurement date, we could, absent necessary and timely waivers and/or amendments, be in default under certain of our existing debt and lease agreements. To the extent any cross-default provisions may apply, the default could have an even more significant impact on our financial position.\nAlthough we are in compliance and project to be in compliance with our material debt and lease covenants through March 31, 2021, the ongoing uncertainty related to the impact of healthcare reform initiatives may have an adverse impact on our ability to remain in compliance with our covenants. Such uncertainty includes, changes in reimbursement patterns, patient admission patterns, bundled payment arrangements, as well as potential changes to the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010 currently being considered in Congress, among others.\nThere can be no assurance that the confluence of these and other factors will not impede our ability to meet our debt and lease covenants in the future.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nAs of December 31, 2019 and 2018, we are not involved in any off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a material current or future impact on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenue or expense, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures, or capital resources.", "item_7_text": "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThis Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations is intended to assist in understanding and assessing the trends and significant changes in our results of operations and financial condition as of the dates and for the periods presented. Historical results may not indicate future performance. Our forward-looking statements, which reflect our current views about future events, are based on assumptions and are subject to known and unknown risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contemplated by these statements. Factors that may cause differences between actual results and those contemplated by forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, those discussed in Item 1A. Risk Factors,\u201d of this report on Form 10-K. This Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations should be read in conjunction with Selected Financial Data\u201d in Item 6 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K and our consolidated financial statements and related notes included in this report.\nBusiness Overview\nGenesis is a healthcare services holding company that through its subsidiaries owns and operates skilled nursing facilities, assisted/senior living facilities and a rehabilitation therapy business. We have an administrative service company that provides a full complement of administrative and consultative services that allows our affiliated operators and third-party operators with whom we contract to better focus on delivery of healthcare services. We provide inpatient services through 381 skilled nursing, assisted/senior living and behavioral health centers located in 26 states. Revenues of our owned, leased and otherwise consolidated centers constitute approximately 87% of our revenues.\nWe also provide a range of rehabilitation therapy services, including speech pathology, physical therapy, occupational therapy and respiratory therapy. These services are provided by rehabilitation therapists and assistants employed or contracted at substantially all of the centers operated by us, as well as by contract to healthcare facilities operated by others. After the elimination of intercompany revenues, the rehabilitation therapy services business constitutes approximately 10% of our revenues.\nWe provide an array of other specialty medical services, including management services, physician services, staffing services, and other healthcare related services, which comprise the balance of our revenues.\nStrategic Partnerships\nNext Partnership\nOn January 31, 2019, Welltower Inc. (Welltower) sold the real estate of 15 facilities to a real estate partnership (Next Partnership), of which we acquired a 46% membership interest for $16.0 million. The remaining interest is held by Next Healthcare (Next), a related party. See Note 16 - Related Party Transactions.\u201d In conjunction with the facility sales, we received aggregate annual rent credits of $17.2 million. We will continue to operate these facilities pursuant to a master lease with the Next Partnership. The term of the master lease is 15 years with two five-year renewal options available. We will pay annual rent of $19.5 million, with no rent escalators for the first five years and an escalator of 2% beginning in the sixth lease year and thereafter. We also obtained a fixed price purchase option to acquire all of the real property of the facilities. The purchase option is exercisable between lease years five and seven, reducing in price each successive year down to a 10% premium over the net price paid by the partnership to acquire the facilities from Welltower.\nWe have concluded the Next Partnership qualifies as a VIE and we are the primary beneficiary. As such, we have consolidated all of the accounts of the Next Partnership in the accompanying consolidated financial statements. The ROU assets and lease obligations related to the Next Partnership lease agreement have been fully eliminated in our consolidated financial statements. The Next Partnership acquired 22 skilled nursing facilities for a purchase price of $252.5 million but immediately sold seven of these facilities for $79.0 million. The initial consolidation of the remaining 15 facilities resulted in property and equipment of $173.5 million, non-recourse debt of $165.7 million, net of debt issuance costs, and non-controlling interest of $18.5 million. The impact of consolidation on the accompanying consolidated statement of operations was not material for the year ended December 31, 2019 apart from transaction costs of $5.3 million.\nVantage Point Partnership\nOn September 12, 2019, Welltower and Second Spring Healthcare Investments (Second Spring) sold the real estate of four and 14 facilities, respectively, to a real estate partnership (Vantage Point Partnership), in which we invested $37.5 million for an approximate 30% membership interest. The remaining membership interest is held by Vantage Point Capital, LLC (Vantage Point) for an investment of $85.3 million consisting of an equity investment of $8.5 million and a formation loan of $76.8 million. In conjunction with the facility sales, we received aggregate annual rent credits of $30.3 million. We will continue to operate these facilities pursuant to a new master lease with the Vantage Point Partnership. The term of the master lease is 15 years with two five-year renewal options available. We will pay annual rent of approximately $33.1 million, with no rent escalators for the first four years and an escalator of 2% beginning in the fifth lease year and thereafter. We also obtained a fixed price purchase option to acquire all of the real property of the facilities. The purchase option is exercisable during certain periods in fiscal years 2024 and 2025 for a 10% premium over the original purchase price. Further, Vantage Point holds a put option that would require us to acquire its membership interests in the Vantage Point Partnership. The put option becomes exercisable if we opt not to purchase the facilities or upon the occurrence of certain events of default.\nWe have concluded the Vantage Point Partnership qualifies as a VIE and we are the primary beneficiary. As such, we have consolidated all of the accounts of the Vantage Point Partnership in the accompanying financial statements. The ROU assets and lease obligations related to the Vantage Point Partnership lease agreement have been fully eliminated in our consolidated financial statements. The Vantage Point Partnership acquired all 18 skilled nursing facilities for a purchase price of $339.2 million. The initial consolidation primarily resulted in property and equipment of $339.2 million, non-recourse debt of $306.1 million, net of debt issuance costs, and non-controlling interest of $8.5 million. We have not finalized the analysis of the consideration and purchase price allocation and will continue to review this during the measurement period. Other than transaction costs of $11.0 million, the impact of consolidation on the accompanying consolidated statement of operations was not material for the year ended December 31, 2019.\nDuring the third quarter of 2019, we sold the real property of seven skilled nursing facilities and one assisted/senior living facility located in Georgia, New Jersey, Virginia, and Maryland to affiliates of Vantage Point for an aggregate purchase price of $91.8 million, using the majority of the proceeds to acquire our interest in the Vantage Point Partnership and repay indebtedness. The operations of seven of these facilities were also divested. Three of the facilities were subject to real estate loans and two were subject to loans insured by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD). See Note 9 - Property and Equipment\u201d and Note 12 - Long-Term Debt - Real Estate Loans\u201d and Long-Term Debt - HUD Insured Loans.\u201d We also divested the operations of an additional leased skilled nursing facility located in Georgia, marking an exit from the inpatient business in this state. The divested facilities had aggregate annual revenues of $84.1 million and annual pre-tax net income of $2.6 million. The divestitures resulted in an aggregate gain of $57.8 million.\nOn January 10, 2020, Welltower sold the real estate of one skilled nursing facility located in Massachusetts to Vantage Point Partnership. The sale represents the final component of the transaction that was initiated on September 12, 2019. We will receive an annual rent credit of $0.7 million from Welltower as a result of the lease termination. The Vantage Point Partnership acquired this skilled nursing facility for a purchase price of $9.1 million. The initial consolidation of this one additional skilled nursing facility primarily resulted in property and equipment of $9.1 million, non-recourse debt of $7.3 million with the balance of the purchase price settled primarily with proceeds held in escrow from the September 12, 2019 closing. We will continue to operate the facility under the master lease agreement with Vantage Point Partnership along with the other 18 facilities. The addition of this one skilled nursing facility resulted in an increase of annual rent of $0.9 million. See Note 4 - Significant Transactions and Events - Strategic Partnerships - Vantage Point Partnership.\u201d\nNewGen Partnership\nOn February 1, 2020, we transitioned operational responsibility for 19 facilities in the states of California, Washington and Nevada to New Generation Health, LLC (NewGen). We sold the real estate and operations of six skilled nursing facilities and transferred the leasehold rights to 13 skilled nursing, behavioral health and assisted living facilities for a total of $78.9 million. We will retain a 50% interest in the facilities. Net transaction proceeds were used by us to repay indebtedness, including prepayment fees, of $33.7 million, fund our initial equity contribution and working capital requirement of approximately $15.0 million, and provide financing to the partnership of $9.0 million. Concurrently, the facilities have entered, or will enter upon regulatory approval, into management services agreements with NewGen for the day-to-day operations of the facilities. We will continue to provide administrative and back office services to the facilities pursuant to administrative support agreements, as well as therapy services pursuant to therapy services\nagreements. We are currently assessing whether we will continue to consolidate the financial statements of these facilities for financial reporting purposes.\nDivestiture of Non-Strategic Facilities\n2020 Divestitures\nOn January 31, 2020, Omega sold the real estate of one skilled nursing facility located in Massachusetts. We leased the facility under a master lease agreement, but closed the facility on July 1, 2019. The sale resulted in the lease termination of the facility and an annual rent credit of $0.4 million.\nOn February 1, 2020, we sold two owned skilled nursing facilities in North Carolina and one owned skilled nursing facility in Maryland for $61.8 million. Proceeds were used to retire $29.1 million of HUD financed debt. The three facilities generated revenues of $38.7 million and pre-tax income of $0.5 million.\nOn February 26, 2020, we completed the sale of one owned HUD-insured skilled nursing facility in California for $20.8 million. The facility had been classified as an asset held for sale as of December 31, 2019. Proceeds were used to retire $20.5 million of HUD financed debt. The facility generated revenues of $14.0 million and pre-tax loss of $0.1 million. See Note 20 - Assets Held for Sale.\u201d\nOn March 4, 2020, we divested the operations of one leased assisted/senior living facility in Montana. The lease termination resulted in an annual rent credit of $0.7 million. The facility generated revenues of $2.5 million and pre-tax income of $0.1 million.\nWe are currently assessing the impact the 2020 divestitures and lease amendments will have on our consolidated financial statements.\n2019 Divestitures\nCalifornia Divestitures\nDuring the second quarter of 2019, we sold the real property and divested the operations of five skilled nursing facilities in California for a sale price of $56.5 million. Loan repayments of $41.8 million were paid on the facilities at closing. See Note 9 - Property and Equipment\u201d and Note 12 - Long-Term Debt - Real Estate Loans\u201d and Long-Term Debt - HUD Insured Loans.\u201d We incurred prepayment penalties and other closing costs of $2.4 million at settlement. The facilities generated annual revenues of $53.0 million and pre-tax net income of $1.6 million. The divestiture resulted in a gain of $25.0 million. We also divested the operations of one behavioral health center located in California upon the lease's expiration in the second quarter of 2019. The center generated annual revenues of $3.1 million and pre-tax net loss of $0.3 million. The divestiture resulted in a loss of $0.1 million.\nDuring the third quarter of 2019, we sold the real property and divested the operations of one additional skilled nursing facility and one assisted/senior living facility in California for an aggregate sale price of $11.5 million. Loan repayments of $9.6 million were paid on the facilities at closing. See Note 9 - Property and Equipment\u201d and Note 12 - Long-Term Debt - HUD Insured Loans.\u201d The facilities generated annual revenues of $10.4 million and pre-tax net income of less than $0.1 million. The divestiture resulted in an aggregate gain of $0.6 million.\nTexas Divestitures\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2019, we sold the real property of seven facilities in Texas for a sales price of $20.1 million. The net proceeds were used principally to repay the indebtedness of the facilities. We recognized a net gain of $3.3 million associated with the sale of the facilities. We recognized a gain on early extinguishment of debt of $2.6 million associated with the write off of the debt premiums and issuance costs on the underlying HUD loans. These seven facilities had been classified as held for sale as of December 31, 2018. See Note 20 - Assets Held for Sale.\u201d\nOther Divestitures\nDuring the first quarter of 2019, we divested the operations of nine facilities located in New Jersey and Ohio that were subject to the master lease with Welltower (the Welltower Master Lease). The nine divested facilities had aggregate annual revenues of $90.2 million and annual pre-tax net loss of $6.0 million. We recognized a loss on exit reserves of $3.5 million. We also completed the closure of one facility located in Ohio. The facility generated annual revenues of $7.7 million and pre-tax net loss of $1.6 million. The closure resulted in a loss of $0.2 million.\nDuring the second quarter of 2019, we divested the operations of three leased skilled nursing facilities. Two of the facilities were located in Connecticut and subject to the Welltower Master Lease, while the third was located in Ohio. The facilities generated annual revenues of $24.7 million and pre-tax net loss of $2.9 million. The divestitures resulted in a loss of $1.1 million.\nDuring the third quarter of 2019, we divested the operations of 11 leased skilled nursing facilities and completed the closure of a twelfth facility. Nine of the facilities were located in Ohio, marking an exit from the inpatient business in this state, while the remaining three were located in Massachusetts, Utah, and Idaho. Four of the facilities were subject to a master lease with Omega Healthcare Investors, Inc. (Omega), three of which were removed from the lease, resulting in an annual rent credit of $1.9 million, with the fourth, the closed facility, remaining subject to the lease. The twelve facilities generated annual revenues of $75.6 million and pre-tax loss of $4.6 million. The divestitures resulted in a loss of $3.5 million.\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2019, we divested the operations of one leased skilled nursing facility in New Jersey. The facility generated annual revenues of $19.0 million and pre-tax net loss of $1.2 million. The divestiture resulted in a loss of $0.9 million, which was primarily attributable to exit costs.\n2018 Divestitures\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2018, we divested the operations of 54 skilled nursing facilities and one assisted/senior living facility. These divestitures resulted in net gains of $34.8 million, which are included in other income on the consolidated statements of operations. See Note 18 - Other Income.\u201d\nTexas Divestitures\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2018, we divested the operations of 23 skilled nursing facilities located in Texas, consisting of 22 owned facilities and one leased facility. We sold the real property associated with 15 of the owned facilities, with the real property of the remaining seven owned facilities being classified as held for sale at December 31, 2018. Sale proceeds of approximately $89.4 million, net of transaction costs, were used principally to repay the indebtedness of the facilities. We recognized a gain of $3.4 million primarily attributable to the derecognition of financing lease assets and obligations offset by a loss of $4.6 million for exit costs. Debt premiums and issuance costs of $9.4 million associated with underlying HUD loans were written off as a gain on early extinguishment of debt.\nOther Divestitures\nDuring the first quarter of 2018, we closed one leased skilled nursing facility located in Massachusetts. The facility remained subject to a master lease with Welltower until its sale in the second quarter of 2019. The facility generated annual revenues of $9.0 million and pre-tax net loss of $2.7 million. The closure resulted in a loss of $0.3 million.\nDuring the second quarter of 2018, we divested 19 leased skilled nursing facilities, one of which had previously been closed during 2017. The facilities were located across the states of California, Kentucky, Massachusetts, New Jersey, and Pennsylvania. Twelve of the facilities were subject to a master lease with Second Spring and six were subject to a master lease with Sabra Health Care REIT, Inc. (Sabra). The facilities generated annual revenues of $182.7 million and pre-tax loss of $23.8 million. We recorded a gain of $22.5 million on the divestitures, offset by a loss on exit costs of $8.4 million. Additionally, we recognized a capital lease net asset and obligation write-down of $16.8 million, a financing obligation net asset write-down of $113.3 million and a financing obligation write-down of $134.5 million associated with 12 of the facilities.

The facilities generated annual revenues of $71.7 million and pre-tax loss of $9.7 million. We recorded a gain of $27.9 million on the divestitures, offset by a loss on exit costs of $3.1 million. Additionally, we recognized capital lease and financing obligation net asset write-downs of $44.5 million and capital lease and financing obligation write-downs of $77.0 million associated with four of the facilities.

The facilities generated annual revenues of $36.8 million and pre-tax income of $3.1 million. We recorded a gain of $0.4 million on the divestitures, offset by a loss on exit costs of $1.1 million. We received an annual rent credit of $0.3 million associated with the divestiture of one of the leased facilities. The owned facility was sold for $2.2 million with net proceeds of $1.9 million being primarily used to pay down indebtedness. Additionally, we recorded a loss of $1.9 million for exit costs associated with the pending closure of certain clinics associated with our rehabilitation services business.\nAcquisitions\nOn June 1, 2019, we acquired the operations of one skilled nursing facility in New Mexico. The new facility has 80 licensed beds and generates approximate annual net revenue of $3.4 million. The facility is leased from Omega and is classified as an operating lease. The facility's 2019 pre-tax net income was de minimis.\nOn November 1, 2018, we acquired the operations of eight skilled nursing facilities and one assisted/senior living facility in New Mexico and Arizona. The nine new facilities have approximately 1,000 beds and generate approximate annual net revenue of $60.0 million. The facilities are leased from Omega. Four of the facilities were classified as capital leases and resulted in an initial capital lease asset and obligation gross up of $14.6 million. The remaining five facilities were initially classified as operating leases.\nLease Transactions\nGains, losses and termination charges associated with master lease terminations and amendments are recorded as non-recurring charges. These amendments and terminations resulted in net gains of $93.8 million and net losses of $21.9 million for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. These gains and losses are included in other income on the consolidated statements of operations.\nWelltower\nDuring the first quarter of 2019, we amended the Welltower Master Lease several times to reflect the lease termination of 24 facilities, including the 15 facilities sold and now leased from the Next Partnership. As a result of the lease termination on the 24 facilities, we received annual rent credits of approximately $23.4 million. A lease modification analysis was performed and the remaining 49 facilities subject to the master lease were reclassified from finance leases to operating leases. Finance lease ROU assets and obligations of $61.5 million and $130.2 million, respectively, were written off. On a net basis, operating lease ROU assets and obligations of $159.8 million and $111.3 million, respectively, were written down, resulting in a gain of $20.3 million.\nDuring the second quarter of 2019, we amended the Welltower Master Lease to reflect the lease termination of two facilities and received annual rent credits of $0.6 million. Operating lease ROU assets and lease obligations of $5.1 million and $5.6 million, respectively, were written off, resulting in a gain of $0.5 million.\nDuring the third quarter of 2019, we amended the Welltower Master Lease to reflect the lease termination of four facilities and received annual rent credits of $1.9 million. Operating lease ROU assets and lease obligations of $102.0 million and $74.4 million, respectively, were written off, resulting in a gain of $27.6 million.\nOmega\nDuring the third quarter of 2019, we amended our master lease with Omega to reflect the lease termination of three facilities subject to the lease and received annual rent credits of $1.9 million. In conjunction with the lease termination, finance lease ROU assets and lease obligations of $10.1 million and $16.8 million, respectively, were written off. Additionally, for those facilities remaining under the master lease, we reassessed the likelihood of exercising our renewal options and concluded that it no longer met the reasonably certain threshold. Consequently, the remaining facilities subject to the master lease were reclassified from finance leases to operating leases and the corresponding ROU assets and liabilities were reduced by $164.6 million and $181.3 million, respectively. The lease termination and remeasurement resulted in an aggregate gain of $23.4 million.\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2019, we amended our master lease with Omega to reflect the inclusion of nine skilled nursing facilities and one assisted living facility in New Mexico and Arizona. These facilities were previously leased from Omega, following the terms of a separate lease agreement, and all facilities were classified as operating leases. There was no change in base rent for the 10 facilities upon addition to master lease. The lease assessment and measurement resulted in operating lease classification with a $10.6 million ROU asset and lease liability gross up. In addition, we received $15.0 million as a short-term note payable in full to Omega by April 30, 2020. See Note 12 - Long-Term Debt - Notes Payable.\u201d\nSecond Spring\nDuring the third quarter of 2019, we amended our master lease with Second Spring to reflect the lease termination of 14 facilities subject to the lease and received annual rent credits of $28.4 million. In conjunction with the lease termination, finance lease ROU assets and lease obligations of $5.9 million and $8.8 million, respectively, were written off and operating lease ROU assets and lease obligations of $202.7 million and $205.4 million, respectively, were written off. Additionally, for those facilities remaining under the master lease, we reassessed the likelihood of exercising our renewal options and concluded that it no longer met the reasonably certain threshold. Consequently, the remaining facilities subject to the master lease were reclassified from finance leases to operating leases and the corresponding ROU assets and liabilities were increased by $54.4 million and $33.3 million, respectively. The lease termination and remeasurement resulted in an aggregate gain of $26.9 million.\nSabra\nWe are party to an agreement with Sabra resulting in permanent and unconditional annual cash rent savings of $19 million effective January 1, 2018. Sabra has pursued and we have supported Sabra's previously announced sale of our leased assets. At the closing of such sales, we have entered into lease agreements with new landlords for a majority of the assets currently leased with Sabra. During the year ended December 31, 2018, Sabra completed the sale of 34 facilities to third party landlords with whom we have entered into new lease agreements. Those transactions are summarized below.\nDuring the second quarter of 2018, Sabra completed the sale and lease termination of 21 facilities, consisting of 20 skilled nursing facilities and one assisted/senior living facility. The facilities were located across nine states. As a result of the sales, we will receive an annual rent credit of $19.4 million for the remainder of the lease term. We continue to operate 12 of the facilities under a new lease with a new landlord, Next Healthcare Capital (Next), as described in Note 16 - \"Related Party Transactions.\" We continue to operate the other nine facilities under a separate lease with a new landlord. The new lease has a ten-year initial term, one five-year renewal option and initial annual rent of $7.4 million. We recognized accelerated depreciation expense of $9.6 million associated with the property and equipment sold and a gain on the write off of certain lease liabilities of $9.9 million.\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2018, Sabra completed the sale and lease termination of 13 skilled nursing facilities located in California, Colorado, Connecticut, and New Mexico. As a result of the sales, we will receive an annual rent credit of $6.7 million for the remainder of the lease term. We continue to operate four of the facilities under a lease agreement with a new landlord. The new lease has a 9.5 year initial term, one five-year renewal option and initial annual rent of $3.4 million. We continue to operate the other nine facilities under a lease agreement with a new landlord. The new lease has a ten-year initial term, one five-year renewal option, and initial annual rent of $3.3 million. We recognized accelerated depreciation expense of $7.4 million associated with the property and equipment sold and a gain on the write off of certain lease liabilities of $6.2 million.\nAs a result of the amendments and lease terminations noted above, we recorded a lease termination charge of $34.1 million in the year ended December 31, 2018, with an offsetting obligation recorded in other long-term liabilities. The charge represents the\ndiscounted residual rents we will continue to pay Sabra on the facilities that have been terminated due to either divestiture or sale to a new landlord. On an undiscounted basis, we were obligated to pay Sabra approximately $41.0 million as of December 31, 2018. This obligation will be repaid over a period of approximately four years ending in 2023.\nOther\nDuring the first quarter of 2019, we amended a master lease agreement for 19 skilled nursing facilities. The amendment extended the lease term by five years through October 31, 2026, removed our option to purchase certain facilities under the lease and adjusted certain financial covenants. We had previously determined that the renewal option period was not reasonably certain of exercise. Upon execution of the amendment, the operating lease ROU assets and obligations were remeasured, resulting in an increase of $77.2 million to both operating lease ROU assets and obligations.\nDuring the third quarter of 2019, we amended a master lease agreement to reflect the lease termination of six facilities subject to the lease. In conjunction with the lease termination, operating lease ROU assets of $4.9 million were written off, resulting in a loss of $4.9 million.\nDuring the second quarter of 2018, we negotiated the extensions of four separate lease agreements resulting in the derecognition of certain lease assets totaling $1.9 million.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2018, the cease to use asset associated with a leased facility divestiture initially recorded during 2017 was further adjusted to reflect changes in the sublease assumption, resulting in a loss of $2.0 million.\nRestructuring Transactions\nOverview\nDuring the first quarter of 2018, we entered into a number of agreements, amendments and new financing facilities further described below in an effort to strengthen significantly our capital structure. In total, the Restructuring Transactions reduced our annual cash fixed charges by approximately $62.0 million beginning in 2018 and also provided $70.0 million of additional cash and borrowing availability, increasing our liquidity and financial flexibility.\nIn connection with the Restructuring Transactions, we entered into a new asset based lending facility agreement, replacing our prior revolving credit facilities, expanding our term loan borrowings, amending our real estate loans with Welltower while refinancing some of those loan amounts through new real estate loans. The new asset based lending facility agreement and real estate loans are financed through MidCap Funding IV Trust and MidCap Financial Trust (collectively, MidCap), respectively. See Note 12 - Long-Term Debt.\u201d We also amended the financial covenants in all of our material loan agreements and all but two of our material master leases. Financial covenants were amended to account for changes in our capital structure as a result of the Restructuring Transactions and to account for the current business climate.\nWelltower Master Lease Amendment\nDuring the first quarter of 2018, we entered into a definitive agreement with Welltower to amend the Welltower Master Lease (the Welltower Master Lease Amendment). The Welltower Master Lease Amendment reduced our annual base rent payment by $35.0 million effective as of January 1, 2018, reduced the annual rent escalator from approximately 2.9% to 2.5% effective on April 1, 2018 and further reduced the annual rent escalator to 2.0% beginning January 1, 2019. In addition, the Welltower Master Lease Amendment extended the initial term of the master lease by five years to January 31, 2037 and extended the optional renewal term of the master lease by five years to December 31, 2048. The Welltower Master Lease Amendment also provides a potential upward rent reset, conditioned upon achievement of certain upside operating metrics, effective January 1, 2023. If triggered, the incremental rent from the reset is capped at $35.0 million.\nOmnibus Agreement\nDuring the first quarter of 2018, we entered into an Omnibus Agreement with Welltower and Omega, pursuant to which Welltower and Omega committed to provide up to $40.0 million in new term loans and amend the current term loan agreement to, among other things, accommodate a refinancing of our existing asset based credit facility, in each case subject to certain conditions, including the completion of a restructuring of certain of our other material debt and lease obligations.\nThe Omnibus Agreement also provided that upon satisfying certain conditions, including raising new capital that is used to pay down certain indebtedness owed to Welltower and Omega, (a) $50.0 million of outstanding indebtedness owed to Welltower would be written off and (b) we may request conversion of not more than $50.0 million of the outstanding balance of our Welltower Real Estate Loans into equity. If the proposed equity conversion would result in any adverse REIT qualification, status or compliance consequences to Welltower, then the debt that would otherwise be converted to equity shall instead be converted into a loan incurring paid in kind interest at 2% per annum compounded quarterly, with a term of ten years commencing on the date the applicable conditions precedent to the equity conversion have been satisfied. Moreover, we agreed to support Welltower in connection with the sale of certain of Welltower's interests in facilities covered by the Welltower Master Lease, including negotiating and entering into definitive new master lease agreements with third party buyers. The conditions described above have not been satisfied as of December 31, 2019.\nIn connection with the Omnibus Agreement, we agreed to issue warrants to Welltower and Omega to purchase 900,000 shares and 600,000 shares, respectively, of our Class A Common Stock at an exercise price equal to $1.33 per share. Issuance of the warrant to Welltower is subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions, which had not occurred as of December 31, 2019. The warrants may be exercised at any time during the period commencing six months from the date of issuance and ending five years from the date of issuance.\nSettlement Agreement\nDuring 2017, we and the U.S. Department of Justice (the DOJ) entered into a settlement agreement regarding four matters arising out of the activities of Skilled Healthcare Group, Inc. (Skilled) or Sun Healthcare Group, Inc. prior to their operations becoming part of our operations (collectively, the Successor Matters). We agreed to the settlement in order to resolve the allegations underlying the Successor Matters and to avoid the uncertainty and expense of litigation.\nThe settlement agreement calls for payment of a collective settlement amount of $52.7 million (the Settlement Amount), including separate Medicaid repayment agreements with each affected state Medicaid program. We will continue to remit the Settlement Amount through January 1, 2022. The remaining outstanding Settlement Amount at December 31, 2019 was $25.7 million, of which $12.1 million is recorded in accrued expenses and $13.6 million is recorded in other long-term liabilities.\nCritical Accounting Policies\nThe consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (U.S. GAAP), which requires us to consolidate company financial information and make informed estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. The most significant estimates in our consolidated financial statements relate to valuation of accounts receivable, self-insured liabilities, income taxes, long-lived assets and goodwill, and other contingencies. Actual results could differ from those estimates.\nRevenue Recognition\nWe adopted Accounting Standards Codification Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606), effective January 1, 2018, using the modified retrospective transition method. There was no cumulative effect on the opening balance of accumulated deficit as a result of adopting the standard as of January 1, 2018. Results for reporting periods beginning after January 1, 2018 are presented under Topic 606, while comparative information has not been restated and continues to be reported under the accounting standards in effect for those periods. See Note 5 - Net Revenues and Accounts Receivable.\u201d\nImpairment of Long-Lived Assets\nOur long-lived assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. Recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to the future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset. If the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its estimated future undiscounted cash flows, an impairment charge is recognized to the extent the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the fair value of the asset. Assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of the carrying amount or the fair value, less costs to sell. See Note 19 - Asset Impairment Charges.\u201d\nSelf-Insurance Reserves\nWe provide for self-insurance reserves for both general and professional liability and workers' compensation claims based on estimates of the ultimate costs for both reported claims and claims incurred but not reported. Estimated losses from asserted and incurred but not reported claims are accrued based on our estimate of the ultimate costs of the claims, which include costs associated with litigating or settling claims, and the relationship of past reported incidents to eventual claims payments. All relevant information, including our own historical experience, the nature and extent of existing asserted claims and reported incidents, and independent actuarial analyses of this information is used in estimating the expected amount of claims. The reserves for loss for workers' compensation risks are discounted based on actuarial estimates of claim payment patterns whereas the reserves for general and professional liability are recorded on an undiscounted basis. We also consider amounts that may be recovered from excess insurance carriers in estimating the ultimate net liability for such risks. See Note 21 - Commitments and Contingencies - Loss Reserves For Certain Self-Insured Programs - General and Professional Liability and Workers' Compensation.\u201d\nIncome Taxes\nOur effective tax rate is based on pretax income, statutory tax rates and tax planning opportunities available in the various jurisdictions in which we operate. We account for income taxes in accordance with applicable guidance on accounting for income taxes, which requires that deferred tax assets and liabilities be recognized using enacted tax rates for the effect of temporary differences between book and tax bases on recorded assets and liabilities. Accounting guidance also requires that deferred tax assets be reduced by a valuation allowance, when it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will not be realized.\nThe recognition and measurement of a tax position is based on management's best judgment given the facts, circumstances and information available at the reporting date. We evaluate tax positions to determine whether the benefits of tax positions are more likely than not of being sustained upon audit based on the technical merits of the tax position. For tax positions that are more likely than not of being sustained upon audit, we recognize the largest amount of the benefit that is greater than 50% likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement in the financial statements. For tax positions that are not more likely than not of being sustained upon audit, we do not recognize any portion of the benefit in the financial statements. If the more likely than not threshold is not met in the period for which a tax position is taken, we may subsequently recognize the benefit of that tax position if the tax matter is effectively settled, the statute of limitations expires, or if the more likely than not threshold is met in a subsequent period.\nWe evaluate, on a quarterly basis, our ability to realize deferred tax assets by assessing our valuation allowance and by adjusting the amount of such allowance, if necessary. The factors used to assess the likelihood of realization are our forecast of pre-tax earnings, our forecast of future taxable income and available tax planning strategies that could be implemented to realize the net deferred tax assets. To the extent we prevail in matters for which reserves have been established, or are required to pay amounts in excess of our reserves, our effective tax rate in a given financial statement period could be materially affected. An unfavorable tax settlement would require use of cash and result in an increase in the effective tax rate in the year of resolution. A favorable tax settlement would be recognized as a reduction in our effective tax rate in the year of resolution. We record accrued interest and penalties associated with uncertain tax\npositions as income tax expense in the consolidated statement of operations.\nLeases\nWe adopted a new leasing standard, FASB ASC Topic 842, Leases (Topic 842), on January 1, 2019 and elected the option to apply the transition requirements thereof at the effective date with the effects of initially applying the new standard recognized as a cumulative-effect adjustment to accumulated deficit in the period of adoption. Consequently, financial information has not been updated for periods prior to January 1, 2019. See Note 2 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies - Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements.\u201d\nWe lease skilled nursing facilities and assisted/senior living facilities, as well as certain office space, land, and equipment. Under Topic 842, we evaluate at contract inception whether a lease exists and recognizes a lease liability and right-of-use (ROU) asset for all leases with a term greater than 12 months. Leases are classified as either finance or operating. While many of our facilities are subject to master lease agreements, leases are assessed, classified, and measured at the facility level.\nAll lease liabilities are measured as the present value of the future lease payments using a discount rate, which is generally our incremental borrowing rate for collateralized borrowings. The future lease payments used to measure the lease liability include both fixed and variable payments that depend on a rate or index, as well as the exercise price of any options to purchase the underlying asset that have been deemed reasonably certain of being exercised. Future lease payments for optional renewal periods that are not reasonably certain of being exercised are excluded from the measurement of the lease liability. Regarding variable payments that depend on a rate or index, the lease liability is measured using the applicable rate or index as of lease commencement and is only remeasured under certain circumstances, such as a change in the lease term. Lease incentives serve to reduce the amount of future lease payments included in the measurement of the lease liability. For all leases, the ROU asset is initially derived from the measurement of the lease liability and adjusted for certain items, such as initial direct costs and lease incentives received. ROU assets are subject to long-lived asset impairment testing.\nAmortization of finance lease ROU assets, which is generally recognized on a straight-line basis over the lesser of the lease term and the estimated useful life of the asset, is included within depreciation and amortization expense in the consolidated statements of operations. Interest expense associated with finance lease liabilities is included within interest expense in the consolidated statements of operations. Operating lease expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term and included within lease expense in the consolidation statements of operations. The lease term is determined based on the date we acquire control of the leased premises through the end of the lease term. Optional renewals periods are not initially included in the lease term unless they are deemed to be reasonably certain of being exercised at lease commencement. For further discussion, see Note 10 - Leases.\u201d\nBusiness Combinations\nOur acquisition strategy is to identify facilities for purchase or lease that are complementary to our current affiliated facilities, accretive to our business or otherwise advance our strategy. The results of all of our operating subsidiaries are included in the accompanying financial statements subsequent to the date of acquisition. Acquisitions are accounted for using the acquisition method of accounting and include leasing and other financing arrangements as well as cash transactions. Assets and liabilities of the acquired entities are recorded at their estimated fair values at the acquisition date. Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of net assets, including the amount assigned to identifiable intangible assets. Given the time it takes to obtain pertinent information to finalize the acquired company's balance sheet, the initial fair value might not be finalized up to one year after the date of acquisition.\nIn developing estimates of fair values for long-lived assets, we utilize a variety of factors including market data, cash flows, growth rates, and replacement costs. Determining the fair value for specifically identified intangible assets involves significant judgment, estimates and projections related to the valuation to be applied to intangible assets such as favorable leases, customer relationships, management contracts and trade names. The subjective nature of management's assumptions increases the risk associated with estimates surrounding the projected performance of the acquired entity. In transactions where significant judgment or other assumptions could have a material impact on the conclusion, we may engage third party specialists to assist in the valuation of the acquired assets and liabilities. Additionally, as we amortize definite-lived acquired intangible assets over time, the purchase accounting allocation directly impacts the amortization expense recorded on the financial statements.\nKey Performance and Valuation Measures\nIn order to assess our financial performance between periods, we evaluate certain key performance and valuation measures for each of our operating segments separately for the periods presented. Results and statistics may not be comparable period-over-period due to the impact of acquisitions and dispositions, or the impact of new and lost therapy contracts.\nThe following is a glossary of terms for some of our key performance and valuation measures and non-GAAP measures:\nActual Patient Days\u201d is defined as the number of residents occupying a bed (or units in the case of an assisted/senior living center) for one qualifying day in that period.\nAdjusted EBITDA\u201d is defined as EBITDA adjusted for newly acquired or constructed businesses with start-up losses and other adjustments to provide a supplemental performance measure. See Reasons for Non-GAAP Financial Disclosure\u201d for an explanation of the adjustments and a description of our uses of, and the limitations associated with, non-GAAP measures.\nAdjusted EBITDAR\u201d is defined as EBITDAR adjusted for newly acquired or constructed businesses with start-up losses and other adjustments to provide a supplemental valuation measure. See Reasons for Non-GAAP Financial Disclosure\u201d for an explanation of the adjustments and a description of our uses of, and the limitations associated with, non-GAAP measures.\nAvailable Patient Days\u201d is defined as the number of available beds (or units in the case of an assisted/senior living center) multiplied by the number of days in that period.\nAverage Daily Census\u201d or ADC\u201d is the number of residents occupying a bed (or units in the case of an assisted/senior living center) over a period of time, divided by the number of calendar days in that period.\nEBITDA\u201d is defined as EBITDAR less lease expense. See Reasons for Non-GAAP Financial Disclosure\u201d for an explanation of the adjustments and a description of our uses of, and the limitations associated with non-GAAP measures.\nEBITDAR\u201d is defined as net income or loss attributable to Genesis Healthcare, Inc. before net income or loss of non-controlling interests, net income or loss from discontinued operations, depreciation and amortization expense, interest expense and lease expense. See Reasons for Non-GAAP Financial Disclosure\u201d for an explanation of the adjustments and a description of our uses of, and the limitations associated with non-GAAP measures.\nInsurance\u201d refers collectively to commercial insurance and managed care payor sources, including Medicare Advantage beneficiaries, but does not include managed care payors serving Medicaid residents, which are included in the Medicaid category.\nOccupancy Percentage\u201d is measured as the percentage of Actual Patient Days relative to the Available Patient Days.\nSkilled Mix\u201d refers collectively to Medicare and Insurance payor sources.\nTherapist Efficiency\u201d is computed by dividing billable labor minutes related to patient care and customer value added services by total labor minutes for the period.\nKey performance and valuation measures for our businesses are set forth below, followed by a comparison and analysis of our financial results:\n\nINPATIENT SEGMENT:\n\nREHABILITATION THERAPY SEGMENT*:\n\n* Excludes respiratory therapy services.\nReasons for Non-GAAP Financial Disclosure\nThe following discussion includes references to Adjusted EBITDAR, EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA, which are non-GAAP financial measures (collectively, Non-GAAP Financial Measures). A Non-GAAP Financial Measure is a numerical measure of a registrant's value, historical or future financial performance, financial position and cash flows that excludes amounts, or is subject to adjustments that have the effect of excluding amounts, that are included in the most directly comparable financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP in the statement of operations, balance sheet or statement of cash flows (or equivalent statements) of the registrant; or includes amounts, or is subject to adjustments that have the effect of including amounts, that are excluded from the most directly comparable financial measure so calculated and presented. In this regard, GAAP refers to generally accepted accounting principles in the United States. We have provided reconciliations of the Non-GAAP Financial Measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures.\nWe believe the presentation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures provides useful information to investors regarding our results of operations because these financial measures are useful for trending, analyzing and benchmarking the performance and value of our business. By excluding certain expenses and other items that may not be indicative of our core business operating results, these Non-GAAP Financial Measures:\n\uf0b7allow investors to evaluate our performance from management's perspective, resulting in greater transparency with respect to supplemental information used by us in our financial and operational decision making;\n\uf0b7facilitate comparisons with prior periods and reflect the principal basis on which management monitors financial performance;\n\uf0b7facilitate comparisons with the performance of others in the post-acute industry;\n\uf0b7provide better transparency as to the measures used by management and others who follow our industry to estimate the value of our company; and\n\uf0b7allow investors to view our financial performance and condition in the same manner as our significant landlords and lenders require us to report financial information to them in connection with determining our compliance with financial covenants.\nWe use two Non-GAAP Financial Measures primarily (EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA) as performance measures and believe that the GAAP financial measure most directly comparable to these two Non-GAAP Financial Measures is net income (loss) attributable to Genesis Healthcare, Inc. We use one Non-GAAP Financial Measure (Adjusted EBITDAR) as a valuation measure and believe that the GAAP financial measure most directly comparable to this Non-GAAP Financial Measure is net income (loss) attributable to Genesis Healthcare, Inc. We use Non-GAAP Financial Measures to assess the value of our business and the performance of our operating businesses, as well as the employees responsible for operating such businesses. Non-GAAP Financial Measures are useful in this regard because they do not include such costs as interest expense, income taxes and depreciation and amortization expense which may vary from business unit to business unit depending upon such factors as the method used to finance the original purchase of the business unit or the tax law in the state in which a business unit operates. By excluding such factors when measuring financial performance, many of which are outside of the control of the employees responsible for operating our business units, we are better able to evaluate value and the operating performance of the business unit and the employees responsible for business unit performance. Consequently, we use these\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures to determine the extent to which our employees have met performance goals, and therefore the extent to which they may or may not be eligible for incentive compensation awards.\nWe also use Non-GAAP Financial Measures in our annual budget process. We believe these Non-GAAP Financial Measures facilitate internal comparisons to historical operating performance of prior periods and external comparisons to competitors' historical operating performance. The presentation of these Non-GAAP Financial Measures is consistent with our past practice and we believe these measures further enable investors and analysts to compare current non-GAAP measures with non-GAAP measures presented in prior periods.\nAlthough we use Non-GAAP Financial Measures as financial measures to assess value and the performance of our business, the use of these Non-GAAP Financial Measures is limited because they do not consider certain material costs necessary to operate the business. These costs include our lease expense (only in the case of Adjusted EBITDAR), the cost to service debt, the depreciation and amortization associated with our long-lived assets, gains (losses) on early extinguishment of debt, transaction costs, long-lived asset impairment charges, federal and state income tax expenses, the operating results of our discontinued businesses and the loss attributable to non-controlling interests. Because Non-GAAP Financial Measures do not consider these important elements of our cost structure, a user of our financial information who relies on Non-GAAP Financial Measures as the only measures of our performance could draw an incomplete or misleading conclusion regarding our financial performance. Consequently, a user of our financial information should consider net income (loss) attributable to Genesis Healthcare, Inc. as an important measure of its financial performance because it provides the most complete measure of our performance.\nOther companies may define Non-GAAP Financial Measures differently and, as a result, our Non-GAAP Financial Measures may not be directly comparable to those of other companies. Non-GAAP Financial Measures do not represent net income (loss), as defined by GAAP. Non-GAAP Financial Measures should be considered in addition to, not a substitute for, or superior to, GAAP Financial Measures.\nWe use the following Non-GAAP Financial Measures that we believe are useful to investors as key valuation and operating performance measures:\nEBITDA\nWe believe EBITDA is useful to an investor in evaluating our operating performance because it helps investors evaluate and compare the results of our operations from period to period by removing the impact of our capital structure (interest expense) and our asset base (depreciation and amortization expense) from our operating results. In addition, financial covenants in our debt agreements use EBITDA as a measure of compliance.\nAdjustments to EBITDA\nWe adjust EBITDA when evaluating our performance because we believe that the exclusion of certain additional items described below provides useful supplemental information to investors regarding our ongoing operating performance, in the case of Adjusted EBITDA. We believe that the presentation of Adjusted EBITDA, when combined with GAAP net income (loss) attributable to Genesis Healthcare, Inc., and EBITDA, is beneficial to an investor's complete understanding of our operating performance. In addition, such adjustments are substantially similar to the adjustments to EBITDA provided for in the financial covenant calculations contained in our lease and debt agreements.\nWe adjust EBITDA for the following items:\n \u00b7 (Gain) loss on early extinguishment of debt. We recognize gains or losses on the early extinguishment of debt when we refinance our debt prior to its original term, requiring us to write-off any unamortized deferred financing fees. We exclude the effect of gains or losses recorded on the early extinguishment of debt because we believe these gains and losses do not accurately reflect the underlying performance of our operating businesses. \n \u00b7 Other income. We primarily use this income statement caption to capture gains and losses on the sale or disposition of assets. We exclude the effect of such gains and losses because we believe they do not accurately reflect the underlying performance of our operating businesses. \n \u00b7 Transaction costs. In connection with our acquisition and disposition transactions, we incur costs consisting of investment banking, legal, transaction-based compensation and other professional service costs. We exclude acquisition and disposition related transaction costs expensed during the period because we believe these costs do not reflect the underlying performance of our operating businesses. \n \u00b7 Long-lived asset impairments. We exclude non-cash long-lived asset impairment charges because we believe including them does not reflect the ongoing operating performance of our operating businesses. Additionally, such impairment charges represent accelerated depreciation expense, and depreciation expense is excluded from EBITDA. \n \u00b7 Goodwill and identifiable intangible asset impairments. We exclude non-cash goodwill and identifiable intangible asset impairment charges because we believe including them does not reflect the ongoing operating performance of our operating businesses. \n \u00b7 Severance and restructuring. We exclude severance costs from planned reduction in force initiatives associated with restructuring activities intended to adjust our cost structure in response to changes in the business environment. We believe these costs do not reflect the underlying performance of our operating businesses. We do not exclude severance costs that are not associated with such restructuring activities. \n \u00b7 Losses of newly acquired, constructed or divested businesses. The acquisition and construction of new businesses is an element of our growth strategy. Many of the businesses we acquire have a history of operating losses and continue to generate operating losses in the months that follow our acquisition. Newly constructed or developed businesses also generate losses while in their start-up phase. We view these losses as both temporary and an expected component of our long-term investment in the new venture. We adjust these losses when computing Adjusted EBITDA in order to better analyze the performance of our mature ongoing business. The activities of such businesses are adjusted when computing Adjusted EBITDA until such time as a new business generates positive Adjusted EBITDA. The operating performance of new businesses is no longer adjusted when computing Adjusted EBITDA beginning in the period in which a new business generates positive Adjusted EBITDA and all periods thereafter. The divestiture of underperforming or non-strategic facilities is also an element of our business strategy. We eliminate the results of divested facilities beginning in the quarter in which they become divested. We view the losses associated with the wind-down of such divested facilities as not indicative of the performance of our ongoing operating businesses. \n \u00b7 Stock-based compensation. We exclude stock-based compensation expense because it does not result in an outlay of cash and such non-cash expenses do not reflect the underlying operating performance of our operating businesses. \n \u00b7 Regulatory defense and related costs - We exclude the costs of investigating and defending the inherited legal matters associated with prior transactions. We also exclude costs of disputed settlements with state agencies. We believe these costs are non-recurring in nature as they will no longer be recognized following the final settlement of these matters. Also, we do not believe the excluded costs reflect the underlying performance of our operating businesses. \n \u00b7 Other non-recurring costs - In the year ended December 31, 2019, we excluded $1.1 million in insurance recoveries and costs related to 2017 hurricane damage and the partial recovery of receivables written down in 2018. In the year ended December 31, 2018, we excluded $13.0 million of costs attributable to the write down of receivables in our non-core physician services business and the impairment of unrealized incentives associated with a government program rewarding the meaningful use of technology in delivery of healthcare. This incentive was estimated to be earned and recognized between 2015 and 2016 within our physician services line of business. We do not believe the excluded costs are recurring or reflect the underlying performance of our operating businesses. \nAdjusted EBITDAR\nWe use Adjusted EBITDAR as one measure in determining the value of our business and the value of prospective acquisitions or divestitures. Adjusted EBITDAR is also a commonly used measure to estimate the enterprise value of businesses in the healthcare and other industries. In addition, financial covenants in our lease agreements use Adjusted EBITDAR as a measure of compliance. The adjustments made and previously described in the computation of Adjusted EBITDA are also made when computing Adjusted EBITDAR. See the reconciliation of net loss attributable to Genesis Healthcare, Inc. included herein.\nSupplemental Information\nWe provide supplemental information about certain capital costs we believe are beneficial to an investor's understanding of our capital structure and cash flows. This supplemental information includes (1) cash interest payments on our recourse and HUD guaranteed indebtedness (2) cash rent payments made to partially owned real estate joint ventures that is eliminated in consolidation, net of any distributions returned to us, and (3) total cash lease payments made pursuant to operating leases, finance leases and financing obligations.\nThis supplemental information is used by us to evaluate our leverage, fixed charge coverage and cash flow. This supplemental information is consistent with information used by our major creditors in evaluating compliance with financial covenants contained in our material lease and loan agreements.\nThe following table provides a reconciliation of net income (loss) attributable to Genesis Healthcare, Inc. to Non-GAAP financial information (in thousands):\n\nResults of Operations\nSame-store Presentation\nWe continue to execute on a strategic plan which includes expansion in core markets and operating segments which we believe will enhance the value of our business in the ever-changing landscape of national healthcare. We are also focused on right-sizing\u201d our operations to fit that new environment and to divest underperforming and non-strategic assets.\nWe define our same-store inpatient operations as those skilled nursing and assisted/senior living centers which have been operated by us, in a steady-state, for each comparable period in this Results of Operations discussion. We exclude from that definition those skilled nursing and assisted/senior living facilities recently acquired that were not operated by us for the entire period, as well as those that were divested prior to or during the most recent period presented. In cases where we are developing new skilled nursing or\nassisted/senior living centers, those operations are excluded from our same-store\u201d inpatient operations until the revenue driven by operating patient census is stable in the comparable periods.\nBecause our rehabilitation therapy services operations experiences a high volume of both new and terminated contracts in an annual cycle, and the scale and significance of those contracts can be very different to both the revenue and operating expenses of that business, a same-store presentation based solely on the contract or gym count does not provide an accurate depiction of the business. Accordingly, we do not reference same-store figures in this MD&A with regard to that business.\nThe volume of services delivered in our other services businesses can also be affected by strategic transactional activity. To the extent there are businesses to be excluded to achieve same-store comparability those will be noted in the context of the Results of Operations discussion.\nYear Ended December 31, 2019 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2018\nA summary of our results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared with the same period in 2018 follows (in thousands, except percentages):\n\n\nA summary of our condensed consolidating statement of operations follows (in thousands):\n\n\nNet Revenues\nNet revenues for the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared with the year ended December 31, 2018 decreased by $410.8 million, or 8.3%.\nInpatient Services - Revenue decreased $340.8 million, or 7.9%, for the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared with the same period in 2018. On a same-store basis, inpatient services revenue increased $64.0 million, or 1.8%, excluding 99 divested underperforming facilities and the acquisition or development of 12 additional facilities. Included in the same-store revenue increase is $19.0 million related to a new provider tax program in the state of New Mexico for the period July 1, 2019 through December 31, 2019, which was not in place for the corresponding period in 2018. An additional $10.0 million of the increase in the year ended December 31, 2019 is attributed to the transition from RUGs based reimbursement to the PDPM reimbursement methodology in the fourth fiscal quarter of 2019. The remaining $35.0 million same-store increase is due to increasing census volume and payor rates, primarily in our Medicaid population, partially offset by continued decline in the skilled mix of our inpatient facilities. For the past several years, census and skilled mix trends have been affected by healthcare reforms resulting in lower lengths of stay among our skilled patient population and lower admissions caused by initiatives among acute care providers, managed care payors and conveners to divert certain skilled nursing referrals to home health or other community-based care settings. While overall census is recovering as compared with the\npreceding year, the skilled mix continued to decline. We believe population demographics will present opportunities in the near future to recapture census, and to some extent skilled mix, where it was lost through reform measures. Over the course of the year ended December 31, 2019, we saw overall same-store occupancy rates exceed that of the same period in 2018 by over 90 basis points. However, at the same time, same-store skilled mix in the year ended December 31, 2019 lagged the same period in 2018 by nearly 90 basis points.\nFor an expanded discussion regarding the factors influencing our census trends, see Item 1, Business - Recent Legislative, Regulatory and other Governmental Actions Affecting Revenue\u201d in this Form 10-K, as well as the Key Performance and Valuation Measures in this Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations for quantification of the census trends and revenue per patient day.\nRehabilitation Therapy Services - Revenue decreased $85.4 million, or 15.6% for the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared with the same period in 2018. Of that decrease, $67.0 million is due to lost contract business, offset by $21.5 million attributed to new contracts. The remaining decrease of $39.9 million is principally due to reduced volume of services provided to existing customers and amended customer pricing terms in connection with the implementation of PDPM.\nOther Services - Revenue increased $15.4 million, or 11.7% for the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared with the same period in 2018. Our other services revenue is comprised mainly of our physician services and staffing services businesses, in addition to our ACO. In the year ended December 31, 2019, the ACO recognized revenue of $10.8 million under MSSP. There was no MSSP revenue recognized in the comparable period in 2018. Revenue in our physician services business increased $8.8 million in the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared with the same period in 2018. Our staffing services business accounts for the remaining decrease in other services revenue of $4.2 million. While the staffing business gross revenue has increased 19.5% in the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared with the same period in 2018, its revenue from external customers has decreased 4.2% over that same period. This decrease is the result of a shift in focus of that business to expand its services to our affiliated nursing facilities and therapy gyms. Prioritizing our internal staffing needs is a strategic goal for our staffing business, amid record low unemployment nationally.\nEBITDA\nEBITDA for the year ended December 31, 2019 increased by $3.0 million, or 1.0% as compared with the same period in 2018. Excluding the impact of (gain) loss on early extinguishment of debt, other (income) loss, transaction costs, long-lived asset impairments, and goodwill and identifiable intangible asset impairments, EBITDA decreased $255.3 million, or 58.3% when compared with the same period in 2018. The contributing factors for this net increase are described in our discussion below of segment results and corporate overhead.\nInpatient Services - EBITDA decreased $23.1 million, or 5.9% in the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared with the same period in 2018. Excluding the impact of other (income) loss, long-lived asset impairments and goodwill and identifiable intangible asset impairments, EBITDA decreased $272.5 million, or 55.8% when compared with the same period in 2018. On a same-store basis, the inpatient EBITDA decreased $243.1 million. Of that same-store decline, lease expense increased $254.6 million, principally resulting from the adoption of Topic 842, which became effective on January 1, 2019. The impact to our financial position and statements of operation from the adoption of this accounting standard is more fully described in Note 2 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies - Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements.\u201d See also Note 10 - Leases.\u201d Our self-insurance programs resulted in an increase of $4.1 million EBITDA in the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared with the same period in 2018. While our self-insurance programs are performing as anticipated with reduced volumes related to the implementation of our portfolio optimization strategies and within normal claims reporting patterns of our same-store operations, we are also seeing reduced pressures particularly in our general and professional liability claims experience. The reduction in the provision for general and professional liability for the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared with the same period in 2018 is the result of favorable prior year claim development and lower current year loss exposures. The favorable development is due to the combination of the ongoing impact of tort reform, claim settlements, and other risk management initiatives. Offsetting some of the positive trends in professional liability experience, self-insured health benefits on the same-store population saw an increase over the prior year due to some singularly large claims that presented throughout 2019. Same-store staffing costs, net of nursing agency and other purchased services, increased $40.9 million. Nursing wage inflation increased 4.2% while non-nursing wage inflation increased 2.6% in the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared with the same period in 2018. The introduction of the new provider tax program in New Mexico for period July 1, 2019 through December 31, 2019 resulting in an increase of EBITDA of $10.5 million compared to the same period in 2018 before the program was enacted. The remaining $37.8 million increase in EBITDA, as adjusted, of the segment is attributed to ongoing expense\nmanagement, reduced therapy services cost due to the implementation of PDPM and increased census volume in our skilled nursing facilities, partially offset by the continued pressures on skilled mix of our inpatient facilities described above under Net Revenues.\u201d\nRehabilitation Therapy Services - EBITDA decreased by $9.3 million or 9.1% for the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared with the same period in 2018. Excluding the impact of other (income) loss, EBITDA decreased $12.2 million when compared with the same period in 2018. Lost therapy contracts exceeded new contracts and service fees by $10.7 million. The remaining decrease of $1.5 million is principally attributed to the net impact of amended customer pricing terms in connection with the implementation of PDPM offset by a reduction in force of employed therapist, further offset with reductions in overhead and reductions of start-up losses in our operations in China. Therapist efficiency improved to 68.0% in the year ended December 31, 2019 compared with 63.7% in the comparable period in the prior year.\nOther Services - EBITDA increased $23.1 million or 217.3% for the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared with the same period in 2018. Of this amount, the ACO contributed $4.2 million, most of which was due to the low cost structure and no revenue recognized in that business in the comparable 2018 period. The remaining increase of $18.9 million pertains to our physician services business. The year ended December 31, 2018 included charges of $13.0 million to write down accounts receivable to its realizable fair value. Those charges did not recur in 2019. The remaining increase of $5.9 million in our physician services business was principally driven by increased physician and nurse practitioner encounters, coupled with improved reimbursement rates, partially offset by increased administrative costs of practice management.\nCorporate and Eliminations - EBITDA increased $12.3 million or 7.0% in the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared with the same period in 2018. EBITDA of our corporate function includes (gains) losses on early extinguishment of debt and losses associated with transactions that are outside of the scope of our reportable segments. These and other transactions, which are separately captioned in our consolidated statements of operations and described more fully above in our Reasons for Non-GAAP Financial Disclosure, contributed $6.0 million of the net decrease in Corporate and Eliminations EBITDA. Corporate overhead costs decreased $4.7 million, or 3.2%, in the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared with the same period in 2018. The remaining increase in EBITDA of $1.6 million is primarily the result of an increase in investment earnings from our unconsolidated affiliates accounted for on the equity method and other investments.\nOther income - In the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, we completed multiple transactions, including the divestitures of numerous owned assets and the termination and refinancing of certain facilities subject to lease agreements. See Note 4 - Significant Transactions and Events.\u201d These transactions resulted in net gains of $173.5 million and $12.9 million for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. See Note 18 - Other Income.\u201d\nTransaction costs - In the normal course of business, we evaluate strategic acquisition, disposition and business development opportunities. The costs to pursue these opportunities, when incurred, vary from period to period depending on the nature of the transaction pursued and if those transactions are ever completed. Transaction costs incurred for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 were $26.4 million and $32.0 million, respectively.\nLong-lived asset impairments - In the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, we recognized impairments of property and equipment of $16.9 million and $105.0 million, respectively. For more information about the conditions of the business which contributed to these impairments, see Note 19 - Asset Impairment Charges - Long-Lived Assets with a Definite Useful Life.\u201d\nGoodwill and identifiable intangible asset impairments - In the year ended December 31, 2018, we recognized impairment of identifiable intangible favorable lease assets of $3.5 million. For more information about the conditions of the business which contributed to these impairments, see Industry Trends and Recent Regulatory Governmental Actions Affecting Revenue\u201d and Financial Condition and Liquidity Considerations\u201d in this MD&A, as well as Note 19 - Asset Impairment Charges - Identifiable Intangible Assets with a Definite Useful Life.\u201d\nOther Expense\nThe following discussion applies to the expense categories between EBITDA and income (loss) of all reportable segments and corporate and eliminations in our consolidating statement of operations for the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared with the same period in 2018.\nDepreciation and amortization - Each of our reportable segments and corporate overhead have depreciating property, plant and equipment, including amortization of finance leased ROU assets. Our rehabilitation therapy services and other services have identifiable intangible assets which amortize over the estimated life of those identifiable assets. Depreciation and amortization expense decreased $97.7 million in the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared with the same period in 2018. On a same-store basis, depreciation and amortization decreased $75.4 million in the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared with the same period in 2018. Of this decrease, approximately $75.4 million resulted from the adoption of Topic 842, which was effective on January 1, 2019. The impact to our financial position and statements of operation from the adoption of this accounting standard is more fully described in Note 2 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies - Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements\u201d and Note 10 - Leases.\u201d\nInterest expense - Interest expense includes the cash interest and non-cash adjustments required to account for our debt instruments, as well as the expense associated with leases accounted for as finance leases or financing obligations. Interest expense decreased $283.3 million in the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared with the same period in 2018. On a same-store basis, interest expense decreased $259.6 million in the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared with the same period in 2018. Of this decrease, approximately $282.6 million resulted from the adoption of Topic 842, which was effective on January 1, 2019. The impact to our financial position and statements of operation from the adoption of this accounting standard is more fully described in Note 2 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies - Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements\u201d and Note 10 - Leases.\u201d The decrease was offset by $23.0 million that is principally the result of higher rates of interest incurred in the year ended December 31, 2019 on the debt instruments impacted by the financial restructuring, which was not fully realized in the prior year period, in addition to consolidating debt and the associated interest expense of two real-estate partnerships in 2019, which were determined to be VIEs of which we are the primary beneficiary. See Note 1 - General Information - Basis of Presentation\u201d and Note 12 - Long-Term Debt.\u201d\nIncome tax expense (benefit) - For the year ended December 31, 2019, we recorded income tax expense of $1.8 million, representing an effective tax rate of 19.0% compared to an income tax benefit of $2.4 million, representing an effective tax rate of 0.7% for the same period in 2018. There is a full valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets, excluding our deferred tax asset on our Bermuda captive insurance company's discounted unpaid loss reserve. Previously, in assessing the requirement for, and amount of, a valuation allowance in accordance with the standard, we determined it was more likely than not we would not realize our deferred tax assets and established a valuation allowance against the deferred tax assets. As of December 31, 2019, we have determined that the valuation allowance is still necessary.\nNet Loss Attributable to Genesis Healthcare, Inc.\nThe following discussion applies to categories between net income (loss) and net income (loss) attributable to Genesis Healthcare, Inc. in our consolidated statements of operations for the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared with the same period in 2018.\nNet loss attributable to noncontrolling interests - Following the combination of Skilled and FC-GEN Operations Investment, LLC (FC-GEN), direct noncontrolling economic interest was recorded as noncontrolling interest in the financial statements of the combined entity. The direct noncontrolling economic interest is in the form of Class C common stock of FC-GEN that are exchangeable on a 1-to-1 basis to our public shares. The direct noncontrolling economic interest will continue to decrease as Class C common stock of FC-GEN are exchanged for public shares. Since the combination, there have been conversions of 8.3 million Class C common stock reducing the initial, approximately 42% direct noncontrolling economic interest to 33.9% at December 31, 2019. For the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, income (loss) of $2.8 million and $(139.2) million, respectively, has been attributed to the Class C common stock.\nIn addition to the noncontrolling interests attributable to the Class C common stock holders, our consolidated financial statements include the accounts of all entities controlled by us through our ownership of a majority voting interest and the accounts of any variable interest entities (VIEs) where we are subject to a majority of the risk of loss from the VIE's activities, or entitled to receive a majority of the entity's residual returns, or both. We adjust net income attributable to Genesis Healthcare, Inc. to exclude the net income attributable to the third party ownership interests of the VIEs. For the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, (loss) income of $(9.9) million and $2.0 million, respectively, has been attributed to these unaffiliated third parties.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nThe following table presents selected data from our consolidated statements of cash flows (in thousands):\n\nNet cash used in operating activities in the year ended December 31, 2019 of $7.2 million was unfavorably impacted by funded transaction costs of approximately $22.3 million. Adjusted for transaction costs, net cash provided by operating activities in the year ended December 31, 2019 would have been approximately $15.1 million. Net cash provided by operating activities in the year ended December 31, 2018 was unfavorably impacted by funded transaction costs of approximately $32.0 million. Adjusted for funded transaction costs, net cash provided by operating activities in the year ended December 31, 2018 would have been $50.6 million. In addition to transaction costs, operating cash flow activities in the year ended December 31, 2019 were unfavorably impacted by the timing associated with the collection of outstanding accounts receivable and payments of certain self-insured liabilities.\nNet cash used in investing activities in the year ended December 31, 2019 was $387.0 million, compared to cash provided by investing activities of $11.9 million in the year ended December 31, 2018. Cash used for routine capital expenditures for the year ended December 31, 2019 increased from the same period in the prior year by $11.6 million. Net sales and maturities of marketable securities of $0.9 million in 2019 exceeded net purchases of marketable securities of $10.5 million in 2018, resulting in a net reduction in cash used of $11.3 million. In the year ended December 31, 2019, there were asset purchases of $252.5 million as a result of the consolidation of the Next Partnership and its acquisition of 22 skilled nursing facilities and asset sale proceeds of $79.0 million resulting from the simultaneous sale of seven skilled nursing facilities as described in Significant Transaction and Events - Strategic Partnerships - Next Partnership.\u201d In the year ended December 31, 2019, there were asset purchases of $339.2 million as a result of the consolidation of the Vantage Point Partnership and its acquisition of 18 skilled nursing facilities as described in Significant Transaction and Events - Strategic Partnerships - Vantage Point Partnership.\u201d In the year ended December 31, 2018, there were no asset purchases. The year ended December 31, 2019 also included $66.9 million in proceeds from the sale of seven facilities in California, $91.7 million in proceeds from the sale of eight facilities in Georgia, New Jersey, Virginia and Maryland and $20.2 million from the sale of seven facilities in Texas. The year ended December 31, 2018, included proceeds of $74.4 million from the sale of 15 owned skilled nursing facilities in Texas and one assisted/senior living facility in Nevada. The year ended December 31, 2019 also included the receipt of a $12.0 million payment of a note receivable. The remaining incremental use of cash from investing activities of $2.4 million in the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared with the same period in 2018 is principally due to an increase in restricted deposit payments.\nNet cash provided by financing activities in the year ended December 31, 2019 was $377.7 million compared to net cash provided by financing activities of $53.2 million in the year ended December 31, 2018. The net increase in cash provided by financing activities of $324.5 million is principally attributed to debt borrowings exceeding debt repayments in the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared to the same period in 2018. In the year ended December 31, 2019, we received proceeds from the issuance of debt of $538.5 million, consisting primarily of $479.4 from the consolidation of the Next Partnership and Vantage Point Partnership, $41.7 million due to the refinancing of three facilities within the Next Partnership with HUD financing and $15.0 million due to a short-term loan from Omega. In the year ended December 31, 2018, we received proceeds from the issuance of debt of $574.2 million, consisting primarily of $438.0 million from the ABL Credit Facilities, $83.0 million from proceeds from the MidCap Real Estate Loans, $40.0 million from the expanded Term Loan Agreement and $10.9 million from the refinancing of a bridge loan with a HUD insured loan. Repayment of long-term debt in the year ended December 31, 2019 was $199.6 million compared to $544.1 million in the same period of the prior year. In the year ended December 31, 2019, we repaid $39.8 million in MidCap Real Estate Loans and $65.6 million in HUD-insured loans using proceeds from the sale of 19 facilities; reduced the term loan facility of the ABL Credit Facilities by $40.0 million while increasing the revolving credit facilities by the same amount; and the Next Partnership reduced its term loan by $38.8 million refinancing three facilities through HUD. In the year ended December 31, 2018, we repaid $363.2 million in the retirement of our prior revolving credit facilities, $85.5 million in the paydown of Welltower Real Estate Loans, $51.9 million in the retirement of HUD insured loans for divested skilled nursing facilities, $10.0 million in the retirement of a mortgage on a corporate office building and $9.9 million in the payoff of a bridge loan with the proceeds from a HUD-insured refinancing. The remaining decrease in cash used to repay long-term debt of $8.2 million relates to a decrease in routine debt payments. In the year ended December 31, 2019, we had net\nborrowings under the revolving credit facilities of $30.3 million as compared with $42.6 million of net repayments under the revolving credit facilities in the same period in 2018. In the year ended December 31, 2019, we paid debt issuance costs of $10.2 million resulting from financing activities associated with the consolidation of the Next Partnership and the Vantage Point Partnership compared to debt issuance costs of $17.0 million, which includes $13.6 million in fees for the ABL Credit Facilities and $3.2 million in fees for the MidCap Real Estate Loans in 2018. In the year ended December 31, 2019, we received contributions from a noncontrolling interest for $18.5 million and $8.5 million resulting from the consolidation of the aforementioned Next Partnership and Vantage Point Partnership, respectively, compared to no contributions from noncontrolling interests in 2018. The remaining net increase in cash used in financing activities of $5.9 million in the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to the same period in 2018 is primarily due to an increase in distributions to noncontrolling interests and repayments of finance lease obligations offset by a reduction in debt settlement costs.\nOur primary sources of liquidity are cash on hand, cash flows from operations, and borrowings under our ABL Credit Facilities.\nThe objectives of our capital planning strategy are to ensure we maintain adequate liquidity and flexibility. Pursuing and achieving those objectives allows us to support the execution of our operating and strategic plans and weather temporary disruptions in the capital markets and general business environment. Maintaining adequate liquidity is a function of our results of operations, restricted and unrestricted cash and cash equivalents and our available borrowing capacity.\nAt December 31, 2019, we had total liquidity of $90.0 million consisting of cash on hand of $74.5 million and available borrowings under our ABL Credit Facilities of $15.5 million. During the year ended December 31, 2019, we maintained liquidity sufficient to meet our working capital, capital expenditure and development activities.\nRecent Developments Potentially Affecting our Results of Operations\nAs the recent outbreak of the coronavirus (COVID-19) continues to spread throughout areas in which we operate, we believe the outbreak has the potential to have a negative impact on our operating results and financial condition. The extent of the impact of COVID-19 on our operational and financial performance will depend on certain developments, including the duration and spread of the outbreak, impact on our patients, employees and vendors, all of which are uncertain and cannot be predicted. Given these uncertainties, we cannot reasonably estimate the related impact to our business, operating results and financial condition, if any.\nStrategic Partnerships\nNext Partnership\nOn January 31, 2019, Welltower sold the real estate of 15 facilities to the Next Partnership, of which we acquired a 46% membership interest for $16.0 million. The remaining interest is held by Next, a related party. See Note 16 - Related Party Transactions.\u201d In conjunction with the facility sales, we received aggregate annual rent credits of $17.2 million. We continue to operate these facilities pursuant to a new master lease with the Next Partnership. The term of the master lease is 15 years with two five-year renewal options available. We will pay annual rent of $19.5 million, with no rent escalators for the first five years and an escalator of 2% beginning in the sixth lease year and thereafter. We also obtained a fixed price purchase option to acquire all of the real property of the facilities. The purchase option is exercisable between lease years five and seven, reducing in price each successive year down to a 10% premium over the original purchase price.\nVantage Point Partnership\nOn September 12, 2019, Welltower and Second Spring sold the real estate of four and 14 facilities, respectively, to the Vantage Point Partnership, in which we invested $37.5 million for an approximate 30% membership interest. The remaining membership interest is held by Vantage Point for an investment of $85.3 million consisting of an equity investment of $8.5 million and a formation loan of $76.8 million. In conjunction with the facility sales, we received aggregate annual rent credits of $30.3 million. We continue to operate these facilities pursuant to a new master lease with the Vantage Point Partnership. The term of the master lease is 15 years with two five-year renewal options available. We will pay annual rent of approximately $33.1 million, with no rent escalators for the first four years and an escalator of 2% beginning in the fifth lease year and thereafter. We also obtained a fixed price purchase option to acquire all of the real property of the facilities. The purchase option is exercisable during certain periods in fiscal years 2024 and 2025 for a 10% premium over the original purchase price. Further, Vantage Point holds a put option that would require us to acquire its\nmembership interests in the Vantage Point Partnership. The put option becomes exercisable if we opt not to purchase the facilities or upon the occurrence of certain events of default.\nNewGen Partnership\nOn February 1, 2020, we transitioned operational responsibility for 19 facilities in the states of California, Washington and Nevada to NewGen. We sold the real estate and operations of six skilled nursing facilities and transferred the leasehold rights to 13 skilled nursing, behavioral health and assisted living facilities for a total of $78.9 million. We will retain a 50% interest in the facilities. Net transaction proceeds were used by us to repay indebtedness, including prepayment fees, of $33.7 million, fund our initial equity contribution and working capital requirement of approximately $15.0 million, and provide financing to the partnership of $9.0 million. Concurrently, the facilities have entered, or will enter upon regulatory approval, into management services agreements with NewGen for the day-to-day operations of the facilities. We will continue to provide administrative and back office services to the facilities pursuant to administrative support agreements, as well as therapy services pursuant to therapy services agreements. We are currently assessing whether we will continue to consolidate the financial statements of these facilities for financial reporting purposes.\nRestructuring Transactions\nOverview\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2018, we entered into a number of agreements, amendments and new financing facilities further described below in an effort to strengthen significantly our capital structure. In total, the Restructuring Transactions are estimated to reduce our annual cash fixed charges by approximately $62.0 million beginning in 2018 and provided $70.0 million of additional cash and borrowing availability, increasing our liquidity and financial flexibility.\nIn connection with the Restructuring Transactions, we entered into a new asset based lending facility agreement, replacing our prior revolving credit facilities and eliminating its forbearance agreement. Also in connection with the Restructuring Transactions, we amended the financial covenants in all of our material loan agreements and all but two of our material master leases. Financial covenants beginning in 2018 were amended to account for changes in our capital structure as a result of the Restructuring Transactions and to account for the current business climate.\nAsset Based Lending Facilities\nOn March 6, 2018, we entered into the ABL Credit Facilities agreement with MidCap. The agreement provides for a $555 million asset based lending facility comprised of (a) a $325 million first lien term loan facility, (b) a $200 million first lien revolving credit facility and (c) a $30 million delayed draw term loan facility. The commitments under the delayed draw term loan facility will be reduced to $20 million in the year 2020. Proceeds were used to replace and repay in full our existing $525 million revolving credit facilities.\nOn June 5, 2019, the ABL Credit Facilities were amended to simultaneously increase the aggregate revolving credit facility commitment by $40.0 million and partially prepay the first lien term loan facility by $40.0 million. The resulting commitment levels of the revolving credit facility and first lien term loan facility were $240.0 million and $285.0 million, respectively.\nThe ABL Credit Facilities have a five-year term set to mature on March 6, 2023. The ABL Credit Facilities include a springing maturity clause that would accelerate its maturity 90 days prior to the maturity of the Term Loan Agreements, Welltower Real Estate Loans or MidCap Real Estate Loans, in the event those agreements are not extended or refinanced. The revolving credit facility includes a swinging lockbox arrangement whereby we transfer all funds deposited within its designated lockboxes to MidCap on a daily basis and then draw from the revolving credit facility as needed. We have presented the entire revolving credit facility borrowings balance of $136.0 million in current installments of long-term debt at December 31, 2019 and 2018. Despite this classification, we expect that we will have the ability to borrow and repay on the revolving credit facility through its maturity date. Cash proceeds of $50.6 million received under the ABL Credit Facilities remain in a restricted account. This amount is pledged to cash collateralize letters of credit previously issued under the retired revolving credit facilities. We have classified this deposit and all cash account balances subject to deposit account control agreements that were sprung under the ABL Credit Facilities as restricted cash and equivalents within the consolidated balance sheets at December 31, 2019 and 2018.\nBorrowings under the term loan and revolving credit facility components of the ABL Credit Facilities bear interest at a 90-day LIBOR rate (subject to a floor of 0.5%) plus an applicable margin of 6%. Borrowings under the delayed draw component bear interest at a 90-day LIBOR rate (subject to a floor of 1%) plus an applicable margin of 11%. Borrowing levels under the term loan and revolving credit facility components of the ABL Credit Facilities are limited to a borrowing base that is computed based upon the level of eligible accounts receivable.\nIn addition to paying interest on the outstanding principal borrowed under the revolving credit facility, we are required to pay a commitment fee to the lenders for any unutilized commitments. The commitment fee rate equals 0.5% per annum on the revolving credit facility and 2% on the delayed draw term loan facility.\nThe term loan facility and revolving credit facility include a termination fee equal to 2% if the loans are prepaid within the first year, 1% if the loans are prepaid after year one and before year two, and 0.5% thereafter. The term loan facility and revolving credit facility include an exit fee equal to $1.6 million and $1.0 million, respectively, due and payable on the earlier of the loan's retirement or on the maturity date.\nThe ABL Credit Facilities contain representations and warranties, affirmative covenants, negative covenants, financial covenants and events of default and security interests that are customarily required for similar financings. Financial covenants include a minimum consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio, a maximum senior leverage ratio and minimum liquidity.\nTerm Loan Amendments\nOn March 6, 2018, we entered into an amendment to the term loan with affiliates of Welltower and Omega (the Term Loan Amendment) pursuant to which we borrowed an additional $40 million to be used for certain debt repayment and general corporate purposes. The additional $40 million term loan bears interest at a rate equal to 10.0% per annum, with up to 5% per annum to be paid in kind. The Term Loan Amendment also changed the interest rate applicable to the initial loans funded on July 29, 2016 to be equal to 14% per annum, with up to 9% per annum to be paid in kind. Among other things, the Term Loan Amendment eliminates any principal amortization payments on any of the loans prior to maturity and modifies the financial covenants beginning in 2018.\nOn May 9, 2019, the Term Loan Agreement was further amended extending the maturity date from July 29, 2020 to November 30, 2021.\nWelltower Master Lease Amendment\nOn February 21, 2018, we entered into a definitive agreement with Welltower to amend the Welltower Master Lease (the Welltower Master Lease Amendment). The Welltower Master Lease Amendment reduces our annual base rent payment by $35 million effective retroactively as of January 1, 2018, reduces the annual rent escalator from approximately 2.9% to 2.5% on April 1, 2018 and further reduces the annual rent escalator to 2.0% beginning January 1, 2019. In addition, the Welltower Master Lease Amendment extends the initial term of the master lease by five years to January 31, 2037 and extends the renewal term of the master lease by five years to December 31, 2048. The Welltower Master Lease Amendment also provides a potential upward rent reset, conditioned upon achievement of certain upside operating metrics, effective January 1, 2023. If triggered, the incremental rent from the rent reset is capped at $35 million.\nOmnibus Agreement\nOn February 21, 2018, we entered into an Omnibus Agreement with Welltower and Omega, pursuant to which Welltower and Omega committed to provide up to $40 million in new term loans and amend the current term loan to, among other things, accommodate a refinancing of our existing asset based credit facility, in each case subject to certain conditions, including the completion of a restructuring of certain of our other material debt and lease obligations. See Term Loan Amendment above.\nThe Omnibus Agreement also provides that upon satisfying certain conditions, including raising new capital that is used to pay down certain indebtedness owed to Welltower and Omega, (a) $50 million of outstanding indebtedness owed to Welltower will be written off and (b) we may request conversion of not more than $50 million of the outstanding balance of our Welltower real estate loans into equity. If the proposed equity conversion would result in any adverse REIT qualification, status or compliance consequences to Welltower, then the debt that would otherwise be converted to equity shall instead be converted into a loan incurring paid in kind\ninterest at 2% per annum compounded quarterly, with a term of ten years commencing on the date the applicable conditions precedent to the equity conversion have been satisfied. Moreover, we agreed to support Welltower in connection with the sale of certain of Welltower's interests in facilities covered by the Welltower Master Lease, including negotiating and entering into definitive new master lease agreements with third party buyers.\nIn connection with the Omnibus Agreement, we agreed to issue warrants to Welltower and Omega to purchase 900,000 shares and 600,000 shares, respectively, of our Class A Common Stock at an exercise price equal to $1.33 per share. Issuance of the warrant to Welltower is subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions. The warrants may be exercised at any time during the period commencing six months from the date of issuance and ending five years from the date of issuance.\nWelltower Real Estate Loans Amendment\nOn February 21, 2018, we entered into amendments (the Real Estate Loan Amendments) to the Welltower real estate loan (Welltower Real Estate Loans) agreements. The Real Estate Loan Amendments adjust the annual interest rate beginning February 15, 2018 to 12%, of which 7% will be paid in cash and 5% will be paid in kind. Previously, these loans carried a 10.25% cash pay interest rate that increased by 0.25% annually on January 1.\nWe agreed to make commercially reasonable efforts to secure commitments to repay no less than $105.0 million of the Welltower Real Estate Loan obligations. As of December 31, 2019, we have not yet secured the total required repayments or commitments. As a result, the annual cash component of the interest payments was increased by approximately $2.0 million with a corresponding decrease in the paid in kind component of interest.\nMidCap Real Estate Loans\nOn March 30, 2018, we entered into the MidCap Real Estate Loans which had combined available proceeds of $75.0 million, $73.0 million of which was drawn as of December 31, 2018. The MidCap Real Estate Loans are secured by 12 skilled nursing facilities and are subject to a five-year term maturing on March 30, 2023. The maturity of the MidCap Real Estate Loans will accelerate in the event the ABL Credit Facilities are repaid in full and terminated. The loans, which were interest only in the first year, are subject to an annual interest rate equal to LIBOR (subject to a floor of 1.5%) plus an applicable margin of 5.85%. Beginning April 1, 2019, mandatory principal payments commenced with the balance of the loans to be repaid at maturity. Proceeds from the MidCap Real Estate Loans were used to repay partially the Welltower Real Estate Loans.\nOn November 8, 2018, one of the MidCap Real Estate Loans was amended with an additional borrowing of $10.0 million. The proceeds were used to retire a maturing mortgage loan on a corporate office building. The office building has been added as collateral and the loan maturity remains March 30, 2023. The $10.0 million additional loan is subject to an annual interest rate equal to 30-day LIBOR (subject to a floor of 2.0%) plus an applicable margin of 6.25% with principal amortizing immediately and the balance due at maturity.\nOn May 1, 2019, we divested the real property and operations of five skilled nursing facilities in California, three of which were subject to the MidCap Real Estate Loans. We used the sale proceeds to repay $27.7 million on the MidCap Real Estate Loans. During the third quarter of 2019, we divested the real property of two skilled nursing facilities in New Jersey and one skilled nursing facility in Maryland that were subject to the MidCap Real Estate Loans and used the sale proceeds to repay $12.1 million on the loans. See Note 4 - Significant Transactions and Events - Strategic Partnerships - Vantage Point Partnership.\u201d The MidCap Real Estate Loans had an outstanding principal balance of $42.2 million and $83.0 million at December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively.\nSabra Master Leases\nIn 2017, we entered into a definitive agreement with Sabra resulting in permanent and unconditional annual cash rent savings of $19.0 million, which became effective January 1, 2018. For the year ended December 31, 2018, we terminated the Sabra lease agreement for 33 skilled nursing facilities and one assisted/senior living facility but continue to operate these facilities under new lease arrangements with different landlords and terminated the Sabra lease agreement associated with nine divested skilled nursing facilities.\nAs a result of the amendments and lease terminations noted above, we recorded a lease termination charge of $34.1 million in the year ended December 31, 2018. The charge represented the discounted residual rents due to Sabra on the skilled nursing facilities that\nhave been terminated due to either divestiture or sale to a new landlord. As of December 31, 2019, there remains an obligation of $26.7 million, $18.4 million recorded in other long-term liabilities and $8.3 million recorded in accrued expenses, to be repaid through 2023.\nOther Financing Activities\nMortgages and other secured debt (non-recourse) refinancings\nIn December 2019, a portion of the Next Partnership's term loan facility was refinanced via three new HUD insured loans. The new loans had an aggregate initial principal balance of $41.7 million, all of which remained outstanding as of December 31, 2019. The loans have an original amortization term of 35 years and a fixed interest rate of 3.15%. Proceeds were principally used to repay a portion of the term loan associated with the Next Partnership and fees.\nDivestiture of Non-Strategic Facilities\nConsistent with our strategy to divest assets in non-strategic markets, we have exited the inpatient operations of 111 skilled nursing facilities, five assisted/senior living facilities and seven behavioral outpatient clinics in 17 states since January 1, 2018, including:\n \u00b7 The closure of one skilled nursing facility located in Massachusetts on February 28, 2018 that was subject to a master lease agreement with Welltower.

At December 31, 2019, we were in compliance with all of the financial covenants contained in the Credit Facilities.\nWe have master lease agreements with Welltower, Sabra, Omega and Second Spring (collectively, the Master Lease Agreements). Our Master Lease Agreements each contain a number of financial, affirmative and negative covenants, including a maximum leverage\nratio, a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio, and minimum liquidity. At December 31, 2019, we were in compliance with the covenants contained in the Master Lease Agreements.\nWe have two master lease agreements with Cindat Best Years Welltower JV LLC involving 28 of our facilities. We did not meet certain financial covenants contained in one of the master lease agreements involving two of our facilities at December 31, 2019. On March 9, 2020, we received a waiver for these covenant breaches through April 1, 2021. At December 31, 2019, we are in compliance with the financial covenants contained in the other master lease agreement.\nAt December 31, 2019, we did not meet certain financial covenants contained in one lease related to two of our facilities. We are and expect to continue to be current in the timely payment of our obligations under the lease. This lease does not have cross default provisions, nor does it trigger cross default provisions in any of our other loan or lease agreements. We will continue to work with the related credit party to amend the lease and the related financial covenants. We do not believe the breach of such financial covenants has a material adverse impact on us at December 31, 2019.\nOur ability to maintain compliance with our covenants depends in part on management's ability to increase revenue and control costs. Due to continuing changes in the healthcare industry, as well as the uncertainty with respect to changing referral patterns, patient mix, and reimbursement rates, it is possible that future operating performance may not generate sufficient operating results to maintain compliance with our quarterly covenant compliance requirements. Should we fail to comply with our covenants at a future measurement date, we would, absent necessary and timely waivers and/or amendments, be in default under certain of our existing credit agreements. To the extent any cross-default provisions may apply, the default would have an even more significant impact on our financial position.\nConcentration of Credit Risk\nWe are exposed to the credit risk of our third-party customers, many of whom are in similar lines of business as us and are exposed to the same systemic industry risks of operations, as we, resulting in a concentration of risk. These include organizations that utilize our rehabilitation services, staffing services and physician service offerings, engaged in similar business activities or having economic features that would cause their ability to meet contractual obligations, including those to us, to be similarly affected by changes in regulatory and systemic industry conditions.\nManagement assesses its exposure to loss on accounts at the customer level. The greatest concentration of risk exists in our rehabilitation therapy services business where it has over 140 distinct customers, many being chain operators with more than one location. One of our customers, a related party, comprises $28.9 million, approximately 34%, of the gross outstanding contract receivables in the rehabilitation services business at December 31, 2019. See Note 16 - Related Party Transactions.\u201d Additionally, one former customer comprises $7.0 million, approximately 8%, of the gross outstanding contract receivables in the rehabilitation therapy services business at December 31, 2019. An adverse event impacting the solvency of these large customers resulting in their insolvency or other economic distress would have a material impact on us.\nFinancial Condition and Liquidity Considerations\nThe accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared on the basis that we will continue as a going concern, which contemplates the realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business.\nIn evaluating our ability to continue as a going concern, management considered the conditions and events that could raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern for 12 months following the date our financial statements were issued (March 16, 2020). Management considered the recent results of operations as well as our current financial condition and liquidity sources, including current funds available, forecasted future cash flows and our conditional and unconditional obligations due before March 16, 2021. Based upon such considerations, management determined that there are no known or knowable conditions or events that raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern for 12 months following the date of issuance of these financial statements (March 16, 2020).\nOur results of operations continue to be negatively impacted by the persistent pressure of healthcare reforms enacted in recent years. This challenging operating environment has been most acute in our inpatient segment, but also has had a detrimental effect on our rehabilitation therapy segment and its customers. In recent years, we have implemented a number of cost mitigation strategies to\noffset the negative financial implications of this challenging operating environment. These strategies have been successful in recent years, however, the negative impact of continued reductions in skilled patient admissions, shortening lengths of stay, escalating wage inflation and professional liability losses, combined with the increased cost of capital through escalating lease payments, persists.\nIn response to these issues, we entered into the Restructuring Transactions, exited the operations of 99 non-strategic facilities and restructured/terminated certain leases during the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018. See Note 4 - Significant Transactions and Events\u201d for further detail. We expect to continue to pursue cost mitigation and other strategies in 2020 in response to the operating environment and liquidity requirements. During 2018 and 2019, we also amended, or obtained waivers related to, the financial covenants of all of our material debt and lease agreements to account for these ongoing changes in our capital structure and business conditions.\nRisk and Uncertainties\nShould we fail to comply with our debt and lease covenants at a future measurement date, we could, absent necessary and timely waivers and/or amendments, be in default under certain of our existing debt and lease agreements. To the extent any cross-default provisions may apply, the default could have an even more significant impact on our financial position.\nAlthough we are in compliance and project to be in compliance with our material debt and lease covenants through March 31, 2021, the ongoing uncertainty related to the impact of healthcare reform initiatives may have an adverse impact on our ability to remain in compliance with our covenants. Such uncertainty includes, changes in reimbursement patterns, patient admission patterns, bundled payment arrangements, as well as potential changes to the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010 currently being considered in Congress, among others.\nThere can be no assurance that the confluence of these and other factors will not impede our ability to meet our debt and lease covenants in the future.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nAs of December 31, 2019 and 2018, we are not involved in any off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a material current or future impact on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenue or expense, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures, or capital resources.", "item_7_tables": "Table 38: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nYear ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nFinancial Results (in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nFinancial Performance Measures:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nNet revenues (GAAP)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n4,565,834\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n4,976,650\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nNet income (loss) attributable to Genesis Healthcare, Inc.
