As of January 30, 2016, we operated a total of 1,306 retail stores, as follows:\nTable 25: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>United States </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Canada </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Puerto Rico </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Total </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Gymboree\u00ae stores\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>546 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>48 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>595 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Gymboree Outlet stores\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>174 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>175 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Janie and Jack\u00ae shops (including Janie and Jack outlets)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>148 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>149 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Crazy 8\u00ae stores (including Crazy 8 outlets)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>387 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>387 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,255 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>48 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,306 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table> In addition, as of January 30, 2016, we operated online stores at www.gymboree.com, www.janieandjack.com, and www.crazy8.com. Overseas franchisees and Gymboree China operated 84 retail stores, as follows:\nTable 26: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Overseas\nFranchisees (1) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Gymboree\nChina </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Total </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Gymboree\u00ae stores\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>53 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>27 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>80 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Janie and Jack\u00ae shops\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Crazy 8\u00ae stores\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>57 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>27 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>84 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 27: <table> <tr> <td>(1) </td> <td> Overseas franchisees operated retail stores in the Middle East, South Korea and Latin America.\n</td> </tr>\n</table> Subsequent to fiscal 2015, Gymboree China's management made the decision to close 25 of its retail locations. Closures are targeted to be completed by the end of May 2016.\nWe also offer directed parent-child developmental play programs under the Gymboree Play & Music brand at 727 franchised and Company-operated centers in the United States and 43 other countries.\nOur year-end is the Saturday closest to January 31. Fiscal 2015 and 2014, which included 52 weeks each, ended on January 30, 2016 and January 31, 2015, respectively.\nFiscal 2015 Highlights\nTotal net sales increased to $1.25 billion for the fiscal year ended January 30, 2016 (\u201cfiscal 2015\u201d) from $1.23 billion in fiscal 2014, or 1.5%, driven primarily by increases in our Gymboree Play & Music sales of $10.3 million, retail sales of $6.1 million, and retail franchise sales of $2.1 million.\nComparable store sales (including online sales) increased 1% compared to fiscal 2014. Below is the comparable store sales (including online sales) by brand for each fiscal year:\nTable 28: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>January 30, 2016 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>January 31, 2015 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Gymboree\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- % </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(4)% </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Janie and Jack\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>8 % </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5 % </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Crazy 8\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2 % </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(3)% </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Combined comparable store sales\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1 % </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(3)% </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nOur Adjusted EBITDA increased to $102.5 million in fiscal 2015 from $93.7 million in fiscal 2014, an increase of $8.8 million or 9.4%, primarily due to a comparable store sales increase, gross profit expansion, and leveraging our selling, general and administrative expenses (\u201cSG&A\u201d), partially offset by the negative impact from the west coast port slowdown in our retail business during the first two quarters of fiscal 2015.\nThe following table summarizes store openings and closures by brand and country for fiscal 2015. Note that (i) all Crazy 8 stores are in the United States and (ii) retail stores operated by overseas franchisees and the VIE-operated Gymboree retail stores in China are excluded.\nTable 29: <table>

billion in fiscal 2014, or 1.5%, driven primarily by increases in our Gymboree Play & Music sales of $10.3 million, retail sales of $6.1 million, and retail franchise sales of $2.1 million.\nNet retail sales for fiscal 2015 increased to $1.185 billion from $1.178 billion compared to fiscal 2014, an increase of $6.1 million, or 0.5%, primarily due to an increase in comparable store sales (including online sales) of 1%. Comparable store sales (excluding online sales) increased by 1% in fiscal 2015 compared to the same period in the prior year. Total net stores decreased to 1,306 as of fiscal year-end 2015 from 1,326 as of fiscal year-end 2014. Total square footage decreased to approximately 2.7 million square feet as of fiscal year-end 2015 from approximately 2.8 million square feet as of fiscal year-end 2014.\nGymboree Play & Music net sales for fiscal 2015 increased to $41.2 million from $30.9 million in the same period last year, an increase of $10.3 million or 33.3%, primarily due to growth in the number of Gymboree Tianjin franchisee sites to 260 as of fiscal year-end 2015 from 227 at the same prior year period, combined with stronger performance of existing Gymboree Tianjin sites.\nRetail franchise net sales for fiscal 2015 increased to $21.5 million from $19.4 million in the same period last year, an increase of $2.1 million or 11.2%, primarily due to higher sales to our franchisee in the Middle East region. As of fiscal year-end 2015, our overseas franchisees and Gymboree China operated 84 stores compared to 89 stores as of the end of the same period last year.\nGross Profit\nGross profit for fiscal 2015 increased to $486.2 million from $468.5 million in fiscal 2014, primarily as a result of gross profit expansion. As a percentage of net sales, gross profit for fiscal 2015 increased by 90 basis points to 39.0% from 38.1% in the same period last year. The 90 basis points increase was driven primarily by lower cost of goods sold (\u201cCOGS\u201d) as a percentage of sales due to the mix of merchandise inventories sold, lower buying and occupancy costs as a percentage of sales, and an increased mix of Gymboree Tianjin and retail franchise sales, partially offset by the negative impact from the west coast port slowdown in our retail business during the first two quarters of fiscal 2015. As we record certain distribution costs as a component of selling, general and administrative expenses (\u201cSG&A\u201d) and do not include such costs in COGS, our COGS and gross profit may not be comparable to those of other companies. Our distribution costs recorded in SG&A expenses represent primarily outbound shipping and handling expenses to our stores, and amounted to $45.5 million and $43.1 million during fiscal 2015 and 2014, respectively.\nSelling, General and Administrative Expenses\nSG&A principally consists of non-occupancy store expenses, corporate overhead, and certain distribution expenses. SG&A decreased to $444.2 million for fiscal 2015 compared to $448.4 million in the same period last year. As a percentage of net sales, SG&A expenses decreased 90 basis points to 35.6% for fiscal 2015 from 36.5% in the same period last year.\nThe $4.1 million and 90 basis points decrease for fiscal 2015 compared to the same prior year period are primarily due to a decrease in expenses resulting from combined store closures and fewer store openings in the current year, and a $4.7 million reduction in store asset impairment charges for under-performing stores, partially offset by an increase in marketing expenses.\nGoodwill and Intangible Asset Impairment\nDuring fiscal 2015, we did not record any impairment for goodwill and intangible assets.\nIn connection with our long-range planning process in the third quarter of fiscal 2014, we revised our growth assumptions based on estimates of future operations. The updated assumptions resulted in a plan that reflected slower growth in revenues and margins in the reporting units of our retail stores segment. As a result, we recorded non-cash goodwill impairment charges of $252.3 million, $67.2 million and $59.3 million related to the Gymboree Retail, Gymboree Outlet and Crazy 8 reporting units, respectively, during the third quarter of fiscal 2014. In addition, we recorded a non-cash impairment charge of $212.6 million related to trade names in our retail stores segment during the third quarter of fiscal 2014.\nThese impairment charges did not have an effect on our business operations, liquidity or financial covenants.\nInterest Expense\nInterest expense increased to $86.0 million during fiscal 2015 compared to $82.4 million during fiscal 2014. The increase of $3.6 million was primarily related to amortization of our interest rate caps (which mature in December 2016), interest paid on the sale-leaseback financing liability for our Dixon distribution center, and an increase in ABL line of credit borrowings in fiscal 2015. Our average ABL line of credit borrowings increased to $51.9 million during fiscal 2015 compared to $32.0 million during fiscal 2014.\nGain on Extinguishment of Debt\nDuring fiscal 2015, we repurchased Notes (see Note 7 to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report) with an aggregate principal amount of $58.4 million for $15.3 million in cash through open market transactions. We recorded a $41.5 million gain on extinguishment of debt, net of a $1.6 million charge related to the write-off of deferred financing costs associated with the extinguished debt. We did not repurchase any Notes during fiscal 2014. The Notes payable balance as of January 30, 2016 was $287.6 million.\nIncome Taxes\nThe effective tax rate for fiscal 2015 and 2014 was -187.1% (expense) and 11.3% (benefit), respectively. The change in effective tax rate in fiscal 2015 as compared to fiscal 2014 was due to a non-recurring tax benefit in fiscal 2014 related to the impairment of indefinite lived intangible assets offset by the impact of tax liabilities and reserves in fiscal 2015 within certain foreign and state jurisdictions. These liabilities and reserves as a percentage of our fiscal 2015 pre-tax book loss of $3.1 million resulted in a large negative effective tax rate in fiscal 2015.\nWe consider all available positive and negative evidence in evaluating whether a valuation allowance is required, including prior earnings history, actual earnings over the previous 12 quarters on a cumulative basis, carryback and carryforward periods, and tax planning strategies that could potentially enhance the likelihood of realization of a deferred tax asset. As a result of weighing the available objective evidence as of January 30, 2016 and January 31, 2015, our valuation allowance against deferred tax assets was $63.2 million and $58.6 million, respectively. The valuation allowance as of January 30, 2016 represents a valuation allowance against all net deferred tax assets in U.S. federal, unitary U.S. state, and Australian jurisdictions, excluding indefinite-lived deferred tax assets and liabilities, and against the tax benefit on losses from our VIEs. We intend to maintain a valuation allowance until sufficient positive evidence exists to support its reversal.\nFiscal 2014 compared to Fiscal 2013\nNet Sales\nTotal net sales decreased $15.8 million or 1.3% during fiscal 2014 compared to fiscal 2013. This decline was primarily driven by a decrease in net retail sales.\nNet retail sales for fiscal 2014 decreased to $1.18 billion from $1.20 billion compared to fiscal 2013, a decrease of $18.7 million, or 1.6%, primarily due to a decrease in comparable store sales (including online sales) of 3%, partially offset by net new door growth of $23.1 million. Comparable store sales (excluding online sales) decreased by 4% in fiscal 2014 compared to the same period in the prior year. Total net stores increased to 1,326 as of fiscal year-end 2014 from 1,323 as of fiscal year-end 2013. Total square footage increased to approximately 2.8 million square feet as of fiscal year-end 2014 from approximately 2.7 million square feet as of fiscal year-end 2013.\nGymboree Play & Music net sales for fiscal 2014 increased to $30.9 million from $25.7 million during fiscal 2013, an increase of $5.2 million or 20.3%, primarily due to growth in Gymboree Tianjin.\nRetail franchise net sales for fiscal 2014 decreased to $19.4 million from $21.7 million during fiscal 2013, a decrease of $2.4 million or 10.8%, primarily due to lower sales to our franchisee in the Middle East region. As of fiscal year-end 2014, our overseas franchisees and Gymboree China operated 89 stores compared to 71 stores as of fiscal year-end 2013.\nGross Profit\nGross profit for fiscal 2014 decreased to $468.5 million from $476.0 million during fiscal 2013, primarily as a result of the net sales decrease described above. As a percentage of net sales, gross profit for fiscal 2014 decreased by 10 basis points to 38.1% from 38.2% during fiscal 2013 primarily due to deleveraging of buying and occupancy expenses and increased promotional activity. As we record certain distribution costs as a component of SG&A and do not include such costs in COGS, our COGS and gross profit may not be comparable to those of other companies. Our distribution costs recorded in SG&A expenses represent primarily outbound shipping and handling expenses to our stores, and amounted to $43.1 million and $37.9 million during fiscal 2014 and 2013, respectively.\nSelling, General and Administrative Expenses\nSG&A principally consists of non-occupancy store expenses, corporate overhead, and certain distribution expenses. SG&A increased to $448.4 million for fiscal 2014 compared to $443.9 million during fiscal 2013. As a percentage of net sales, SG&A expenses increased 80 basis points to 36.5% for fiscal 2014 from 35.7% during fiscal 2013 primarily due to a deleveraging of expenses on lower comparable store sales, increased expenses related to our third-party fulfillment center which commenced operations during the third quarter of fiscal 2013, and incremental marketing expenses.\nGoodwill and Intangible Asset Impairment\nIn connection with our long-range planning process in the third quarter of fiscal 2014, we revised our growth assumptions based on estimates of future operations. The updated assumptions resulted in a plan that reflected slower growth in revenues and margins in the reporting units of our retail stores segment. As a result, we recorded non-cash goodwill impairment charges of $252.3 million, $67.2 million and $59.3 million related to the Gymboree Retail, Gymboree Outlet and Crazy 8 reporting units, respectively, during the third quarter of fiscal 2014. In addition, we recorded a non-cash impairment charge of $212.6 million related to trade names in our retail stores segment during the third quarter of fiscal 2014.\nDuring fiscal 2013, we recorded non-cash goodwill impairment charges of $85.3 million, $38.8 million, and $16.1 million related to the Crazy 8, Gymboree Retail, and Gymboree Outlet reporting units, respectively. The impairment of goodwill was primarily driven by weak results in fiscal 2013, particularly in the fourth quarter. During fiscal 2013, we also recorded a non-cash impairment charge of $17.0 million related to trade names in our retail stores segment.\nThese impairment charges did not have an effect on our business operations, liquidity or financial covenants.\nInterest Expense\nInterest expense increased to $82.4 million during fiscal 2014 compared to $81.6 million during fiscal 2013. The increase of $0.8 million was primarily related to our interest rate caps.\nLoss on Extinguishment of Debt\nDuring fiscal 2013, we repurchased Notes with an aggregate principal amount of $25.0 million for $24.8 million in cash, which resulted in a $0.2 million gain on extinguishment of debt and a $1.0 million charge related to the write-off of deferred financing costs. We did not repurchase any Notes during fiscal 2014.\nIncome Taxes\nThe effective tax rate for fiscal 2014 and 2013 was 11.3% (benefit) and 0.7% (benefit), respectively. The change in effective tax rate as of fiscal year-end 2014 was related to goodwill and trade name impairment charges. The change in effective tax rate as of fiscal year-end 2013 was due to recording a valuation allowance against net deferred tax assets in jurisdictions where it is more likely than not that these assets will not be realized (see Note 13 to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report).\nWe consider all available positive and negative evidence in evaluating whether a valuation allowance is required, including prior earnings history, actual earnings over the previous 12 quarters on a cumulative basis, carryback and carryforward periods, and tax planning strategies that could potentially enhance the likelihood of realization of a deferred tax asset. As a result of weighing the available objective evidence as of January 31, 2015 and February 1, 2014, our valuation allowance against deferred tax assets was $58.6 million and $31.9 million, respectively. The valuation allowance as of January 31, 2015 represents a valuation allowance against all net deferred tax assets in U.S. federal, unitary U.S. state and Australian jurisdictions, excluding indefinite-lived deferred tax assets and liabilities, and against the tax benefit on losses from our VIEs. We intend to maintain a valuation allowance until sufficient positive evidence exists to support its reversal.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nOverview\nWe finance our business with existing cash, cash from operations and the funds available under our Senior Credit Facilities. We had cash and cash equivalents of $18.2 million and $18.5 million as of January 30, 2016 and January 31, 2015, respectively (including amounts held by the VIEs). Cash and cash equivalents held by the VIEs, of which we are the primary beneficiary, and the results of which we have consolidated into our financial statements, were $9.6 million and $10.0 million as of January 30, 2016 and January 31, 2015, respectively (see Note 19 to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report). The assets of the VIEs can only be used by the VIEs. Net working capital as of January 30, 2016 and January 31, 2015 totaled $29.4 million and $43.0 million, respectively (including $6.2 million and $5.1 million, respectively, from our VIEs).\nWe and our subsidiaries, the VIEs, and our affiliates may from time to time seek to retire or purchase our outstanding debt through cash purchases and/or exchanges, in open market purchases, privately negotiated transactions, by tender offer or otherwise. Such repurchases or exchanges, if any, will depend on prevailing market conditions, liquidity requirements, contractual restrictions and other factors. The amounts involved may be material.\nWe believe that cash generated by operations, the remaining funds available under our Senior Credit Facilities and existing cash and cash equivalents will be sufficient to meet working capital requirements, service our debt, and finance capital expenditures over the next twelve months. However, if we face unanticipated cash needs such as the funding of a capital investment, or if our suppliers request one or more letters of credit, our existing cash and cash equivalents and available borrowings may be insufficient. In addition, we cannot assure that our business will generate sufficient cash flow from operations or that future borrowings will be available to us under the Senior Credit Facilities in amounts sufficient to enable us to repay our indebtedness when due, including the Notes, or to fund other liquidity needs. See \u201cItem 1A. Risk Factors-Risks Related to Our Indebtedness and Certain Other Obligations.\u201d We also regularly evaluate market conditions, our liquidity profile, and various financing alternatives, for opportunities to enhance our capital structure. We are continuing to actively pursue various financing alternatives, including refinancing and/or repurchasing our outstanding Notes, divestitures of certain of our assets and operations, as well as other opportunities to improve our capital structure. If opportunities are favorable, we may consummate one or more of these initiatives and the amounts involved may be material.\nCash and Cash Equivalents\nChanges in our cash and cash equivalents for each fiscal year were as follows (in thousands):\nTable 31: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>January 30, 2016 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>January 31, 2015 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>February 1, 2014 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Cash provided by (used in) operating activities\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>29,140 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(21,758 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>74,871 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Cash used in investing activities\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(22,600 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(31,942 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(53,126 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Cash (used in) provided by financing activities\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(5,846 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>33,336 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(16,634 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Effect of exchange rate fluctuations on cash and cash equivalents\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(1,050 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(545 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>990 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net (decrease) increase in cash and cash equivalents\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(356 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(20,909 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>6,101 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table> Cash flows provided by (used in) operating activities\nNet cash provided by operating activities during fiscal 2015 was $29.1 million compared to net cash used in operating activities of $21.8 million in the same period last year. The change in cash flows from operating activities during fiscal 2015 was primarily due to gross profit expansion, the timing of purchases of merchandise inventories, and the timing of payment of accounts payable and accrued liabilities.\nNet cash used in operating activities for fiscal 2014 was $21.8 million compared to net cash provided by operating activities of $74.9 million in fiscal 2013. The decrease in cash attributable to changes in assets and liabilities was primarily due to an increase in merchandise inventory and a reduction in accounts payable. These increases were partially offset by reduced prepaid rent. The increase in merchandise inventory was primarily due to earlier receipt of Spring goods compared to fiscal 2013 and investments in Winter products in our Gymboree brand.\nCash flows used in investing activities\nNet cash used in investing activities during fiscal 2015 was $22.6 million compared to $31.9 million in the same period last year. The net change during fiscal 2015 was primarily due to lower capital expenditures, which decreased by $10.6 million to $21.4 million compared to $32.0 million in the same period last year. The decrease was due to fewer store openings and an increase in related party loan receivable of $1.7 million (see Note 17 to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report).\nNet cash used in investing activities during fiscal 2014 was $31.9 million compared to $53.1 million during fiscal 2013 and was primarily due to capital expenditures, which decreased to $32.0 million during fiscal 2014 compared to $52.6 million during fiscal 2013 due to fewer store openings.\nWe estimate capital expenditures for fiscal 2016 will be approximately $30 to $35 million. We expect capital expenditures to be used primarily for our systems infrastructure, lease required remodels of existing stores and, to a lesser extent, new store growth.\nCash flows (used in) provided by financing activities\nNet cash used in financing activities during fiscal 2015 was $5.8 million compared to net cash provided by financing activities of $33.3 million during fiscal 2014. In fiscal 2015, we repurchased Notes with an aggregate principal amount of $58.4 million for $15.3 million in cash through open market transactions (see Note 7 to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report). In addition, we made a $14.0 million of net payments on our ABL Revolving Facility and a $1.7 million payment for deferred financing costs related to the amendment of ABL Revolving Facility, partially offset by gross proceeds of $26.8 million related to the sale of the Company's distribution center in Dixon, California (reduced by $0.9 million payment for deferred financing costs (see Notes 7 and 8 to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report).\nNet cash provided by financing activities during fiscal 2014 was $33.3 million compared to net cash used in financing activities of $16.6 million during fiscal 2013. Net cash provided by financing activities for fiscal 2014 was primarily due to net proceeds of $33.0 million from our ABL Revolving Facility.\nCredit Facilities\nABL Facility\nIn September 2015, we amended the ABL Revolving Facility (the \u201cFirst Amendment\u201d) to extend the maturity date of the ABL revolving commitments from March 2017 to the earlier of (i) September 24, 2020 and (ii) the date that is 60 days before the scheduled final maturity date of any tranche of the Term Loan (which matures in February 2018) or the Notes (which mature in December 2018), unless such indebtedness is cumulatively equal to or less than $25.0 million in the aggregate and a reserve against the borrowing base is imposed equal to the amount of such indebtedness.\nThe ABL Revolving Facility, as amended by the First Amendment, provided financing of up to $225 million in a revolving line of credit. Line of credit availability under the ABL Revolving Facility is subject to a borrowing base consisting of certain assets of the Company, any subsidiary co-borrowers and any subsidiary guarantors that are available to collateralize the borrowings thereunder, and is reduced by the level of outstanding letters of credit. As of January 30, 2016, line of credit borrowings outstanding under the ABL Revolving Facility were $19.0 million and letter of credit utilization was $27.6 million. Undrawn line of credit availability under the ABL Revolving Facility, after being reduced by outstanding borrowings and letter of credit utilization, was $125.5 million as of January 30, 2016. Average line of credit borrowings during fiscal 2015 under the ABL Revolving Facility amounted to $51.9 million. We anticipate utilizing our line of credit under the ABL Revolving Facility throughout the course of fiscal 2016 to support seasonal working capital needs and expect to have borrowings outstanding at year-end.\nLine of credit borrowings under the ABL Revolving Facility bear interest at a rate per annum equal to, at our option, either (a) a base rate determined by reference to the highest of (1) the prime rate of Bank of America, N.A., (2) the federal funds effective rate plus 0.50%, and (3) a LIBOR rate determined by reference to the costs of funds for U.S. dollar deposits for an interest period of one month adjusted for certain additional costs, plus 1.00%, or (b) a LIBOR rate determined by reference to the costs of funds for U.S. dollar deposits for the interest period relevant to such borrowing adjusted for certain additional costs (\u201cAdjusted LIBOR\u201d), in each case plus an applicable margin. As of January 30, 2016, the weighted average interest rate on our line of credit borrowings outstanding under the ABL Revolving Facility was 3.5%. In addition to paying interest on outstanding line of credit borrowings under the ABL Revolving Facility, we are required to pay a commitment fee on unutilized commitments thereunder, which is between 0.250% and 0.375% per annum under the amended ABL Revolving Facility.\nIf at any time the aggregate amount of outstanding loans, unreimbursed letter of credit drawings and undrawn letters of credit under the ABL Revolving Facility exceeds the lesser of (a) the commitment amount and (b) the borrowing base, we will be required to repay outstanding loans and/or cash collateralized letters of credit in an aggregate amount equal to such excess, with no reduction of the commitment amount. The ABL Revolving Facility contains financial and other covenants that, among other things, restrict our ability to incur additional indebtedness and pay dividends. As of January 30, 2016, the ABL Revolving Facility also contained a financial covenant that required the Company to test its consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio when availability under the facility fell below a specified threshold. As of January 30, 2016, we were not required to test compliance with this financial covenant.\nOn April 22, 2016, we entered into a second amendment to the ABL Revolving Facility (the ABL Revolving Facility, as so amended, the \u201cABL Facility\u201d or the \u201cSecond Amendment\u201d). The Second Amendment provides for a senior secured term loan (the \u201cABL Term Loan\u201d) of $50.0 million, subject to a borrowing base, the proceeds of which may be used to finance the acquisition of working capital assets, including the purchase of inventory and equipment, in each case in the ordinary course of business, to finance capital expenditures, to finance permitted acquisitions and for general corporate purposes, including repurchases of the Notes.\nThe Second Amendment provides that the ABL Term Loan will bear interest (computed on the basis of the actual number of days elapsed over a year of 360 days) at a 90-day LIBOR contract rate as determined by the agent for the ABL Term Loan monthly on the first day of each calendar month, plus 10.25% per annum, or, in certain circumstances, at the prime rate, plus 9.25% per annum. The Second Amendment also provides for a new availability covenant, whereby so long as any amount of the ABL Term Loan remains outstanding, the Company and its restricted subsidiaries must maintain, at all times, (i) Combined Availability (or, an amount equal to (a) the ABL Term Loan borrowing base minus the sum of (b) the aggregate outstanding principal amount under the ABL Facility (including the ABL Term Loan, revolving line of credit borrowings and letter of credit utilization)) in excess of the greater of (x) $17.5 million and (y) 10% of the ABL Term Loan borrowing base; and (ii) Availability (or, an amount equal to the lesser of (A) (I) the revolving credit ceiling minus (II) the aggregate principal amount outstanding under the revolving line of credit and letter of credit utilization and (B) (I) the revolving line of credit borrowing base minus (II) the aggregate principal amount outstanding under the revolving line of credit and letter of credit utilization) in excess of the greater of (x) $17.5 million and (y) 10% of the lesser of (A) the applicable revolving line of credit borrowing base and (B) the revolving credit ceiling (which as of the date hereof is $225.0 million). The Second Amendment further provides that the Company's consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio will not be tested as long as the ABL Term Loan remains outstanding. The maturity date for the ABL Term Loan is the same as the maturity date of the ABL revolving commitments discussed above, and all other material affirmative and negative covenants and events of default under the ABL Facility remain substantially unchanged. In addition, the restrictions on amendments to the ABL Facility were amended to provide the agent for the ABL Term Loan and the ABL Term Loan lenders certain consent rights relating to, among other terms and provisions, the borrowing bases, the availability covenant and certain negative covenants.\nTerm Loan\nWe also have an agreement with several lenders for an $820 million senior secured Term Loan, with a maturity date of February 2018. As of January 30, 2016, $769.1 million was outstanding under the Term Loan. The Term Loan allows us to request additional tranches of term loans in an aggregate amount not to exceed $200 million, subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions, provided such amount will be subject to reduction by the amount of any additional commitments incurred under the ABL Revolving Facility. The interest rate for borrowings under the Term Loan is, at the Company's option, a base rate plus an additional marginal rate of 2.5% or the Adjusted LIBOR rate (with a 1.5% floor) plus an additional rate of 3.5%. As of January 30, 2016, the interest rate under our Term Loan was 5%.\nThe Term Loan requires us to make quarterly payments equal to 0.25% of the original $820 million principal amount of the Term Loan made on the closing date plus accrued and unpaid interest thereon, with the balance due in February 2018. The Term Loan also has mandatory and voluntary pre-payment provisions, including a requirement that we prepay the Term Loan with a certain percentage of our annual excess cash flow. We calculated our excess cash flow using fiscal 2015 operating results and concluded we\nare not required to make any excess cash flow payments on the Term Loan during fiscal 2016. Voluntary prepayments and the excess cash flow prepayments made in prior fiscal years were applied toward our remaining quarterly amortization payments payable under the Term Loan through fiscal 2016. Our next quarterly payment payable under the Term Loan is due in the first quarter of fiscal 2017.\nThe Term Loan contains covenants that, among other things, restrict our ability to incur additional indebtedness and pay dividends.\nNotes\nIn fiscal 2010, we issued $400 million aggregate principal amount of 9.125% Notes due in December 2018. Interest on the Notes is payable semi-annually. As of January 30, 2016, the Notes payable balance outstanding was $287.6 million.\nSummary Disclosures about Contractual Obligations and Commercial Commitments\nThe following table reflects a summary of our contractual obligations and commitments as of January 30, 2016:\nTable 32: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Payments due by period </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> ($ in thousands)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>Less than\n1 year </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1-3 years </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3-5 years </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>After 5 years </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Total </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Operating leases (1)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>102,638 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>155,978 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>92,524 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>86,185 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>437,325 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Inventory purchase obligations (2)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>182,439 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>182,439 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other purchase obligations (3)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>25,961 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>35,239 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>14,006 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>706 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>75,912 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Long-term debt (4)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>19,000 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,056,677 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,075,677 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Interest payments on long-term debt (5)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>65,994 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>98,054 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>164,048 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Sale-leaseback financing liability and interest payments (6)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,800 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3,667 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3,759 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>31,366 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>40,592 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total contractual cash obligations\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>397,832 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,349,615 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>110,289 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>118,257 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,975,993 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 33: <table> <tr> <td>(1) </td> <td> Other lease-required expenses such as utilities, real estate taxes and common area repairs and maintenance are excluded.

We present Adjusted EBITDA in this annual report because we consider it an important supplemental measure of performance used by management and we believe it is frequently used by securities analysts, investors and other interested parties in the evaluation of companies in the retail industry. Adjusted EBITDA is calculated in substantially the same manner as \u201cEBITDA\u201d under the indenture governing the Notes and \u201cConsolidated EBITDA\u201d under the agreement governing our Senior Credit Facilities. We believe the inclusion of supplementary adjustments applied to EBITDA in presenting Adjusted EBITDA is appropriate to provide additional information to investors about certain non-cash items and to provide additional information with respect to our ability to meet our future debt service and to comply with various covenants in documents governing our indebtedness. However, Adjusted EBITDA is not a presentation made in accordance with GAAP, and our computation of Adjusted EBITDA may vary from others in the retail industry. Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered an alternative to operating income or net income (loss), as a measure of operating performance or cash flow, or as a measure of liquidity. Adjusted EBITDA has important limitations as an analytical tool, and should not be considered in isolation, or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under GAAP. For example, Adjusted EBITDA:\nTable 39: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u2022 </td> <td> </td> <td> does not reflect our cash expenditures, or future requirements, for capital expenditures or

Management has discussed the development and selection of the critical accounting policies and estimates applicable to the Company as of the date of the completion of the audit for the fiscal year ended January 30, 2016 with the Company's Audit Committee.\nGoodwill\nOn November 23, 2010, we completed a merger (the \u201cMerger\u201d) with Giraffe Acquisition Corporation in accordance with an Agreement and Plan of Merger with Giraffe Holding, Inc. (\u201cParent\u201d) and Acquisition Sub, a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent. In connection with the Merger, we allocated goodwill to our reporting units, which we concluded were the same as our operating segments: Gymboree Retail (including an online store), Gymboree Outlet, Janie and Jack (including an online store), Crazy 8 (including an online store), Gymboree Play & Music and International Retail Franchise. We allocated goodwill to the reporting units by calculating the fair value of each reporting unit and deriving the implied fair value of each reporting unit's goodwill as of the Merger. As of January 30, 2016, we had goodwill of $372.7 million related to the Merger.\nGoodwill is tested for impairment on an annual basis at the end of our tenth fiscal period (fiscal November) and at an interim date if indicators of impairment exist. Events that could result in an interim period impairment review include significant changes in the business climate, declines in our operating results, or an expectation that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. We assess potential impairment by considering present economic conditions as well as future expectations.\nGoodwill is tested by performing a two-step goodwill impairment test. The first step of the two-step goodwill impairment test is to compare the fair value of the reporting unit to its carrying amount, including goodwill. If the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value, the second step of the two-step goodwill impairment test is required to measure the goodwill impairment loss. The second step includes valuing all the tangible and intangible assets and liabilities of the reporting unit as if the reporting unit had been acquired in a business combination. Then, the implied fair value of the reporting unit's goodwill is compared to the carrying amount of that goodwill. If the carrying amount of the reporting unit's goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of the goodwill, we recognize an impairment loss in an amount equal to the excess, not to exceed the carrying amount.\nCalculating the fair value of a reporting unit and the implied fair value of reporting unit goodwill requires significant judgment. The use of different assumptions, estimates or judgments in either step of the goodwill impairment testing process, such as the estimated future cash flows of reporting units, the discount rate used to discount such cash flows, or the estimated fair value of the reporting units' tangible and intangible assets and liabilities, could significantly increase or decrease the estimated fair value of a reporting unit or its net assets.\nWe performed our annual goodwill impairment test during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015 (fiscal November) and determined that there was no goodwill impairment for any of our reporting units. Based on the results of the first step of the Company's impairment test performed, we determined that the fair value of our reporting units each exceeded their carrying values by more than 30%.\nThe annual goodwill impairment analysis for the reporting units was based on our projection of revenues, gross margin, operating costs and cash flows considering historical and estimated future results, general economic and future market conditions, as well as the impact of planned business and operational strategies. We based our projections on assumptions we believed to be reasonable at the time, but such assumptions are subject to inherent uncertainty. Actual results may differ from those estimates. The valuations employed typical methodologies to measure fair value and considered market factors and reporting unit specific fact patterns. We primarily used an income approach and market approach to value these reporting units. Assumptions used in the market approach include valuation multiples based on an analysis of multiples for comparable public companies and similar transactions. Finally, specific weights were applied to the components of each approach to estimate the total fair value. These weights are based on estimates and are developed based on the specific characteristics, risks and uncertainties of each reporting unit.\nThe fair value of the Gymboree Retail, Gymboree Outlet, Janie and Jack, Crazy 8, Play & Music, and International Retail Franchise reporting units were $581.0 million, $140.0 million, $274.0 million, $143.0 million, $64.0 million, and $75.0 million, respectively, which exceeded the carrying values of $436.6 million, $106.6 million, $77.2 million, $69.9 million, $40.3 million, and $26.7 million, respectively.\nIndefinite-Lived Intangible Assets\nIndefinite-lived intangible assets primarily represent trade names for each of our brands. We do not amortize intangible assets with indefinite useful lives. We test indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment on annual basis at the end of our tenth\nfiscal period (fiscal November), and more frequently if indicators of potential impairment exist and indicate that it is more likely than not that the asset is impaired. Impairment of indefinite-lived intangible assets is measured by comparing the carrying amount of the asset to the discounted future cash flows that the asset is expected to generate using the relief from royalty method. If we determine that an individual asset is impaired, the amount of any impairment is measured as the difference between the carrying value and the fair value of the impaired asset. Calculating the fair value of indefinite-lived intangible assets requires significant judgment. The use of different assumptions, estimates or judgments, such as the estimated future cash flows, royalty rates or the discount rate used to discount such cash flows, could significantly increase or decrease the estimated fair value of our indefinite-lived intangible assets.\nWe performed our annual impairment test of indefinite-lived intangible assets (trade names) during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015 and concluded that these assets were not impaired. In connection with our annual impairment test, we determined that the estimated fair values of Gymboree Retail, Gymboree Outlet, Janie and Jack, Crazy 8 and Play & Music trade names were $229.5 million, $40.5 million, $61.6 million, $19.8 million and $46.8 million, respectively, which exceeded the carrying values of $202.2 million, $38.3 million, $42.2 million, $18.5 million and $36.2 million, respectively.\nStore Asset Impairment\nStore assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable. If the undiscounted future cash flows from the asset group are less than the carrying value, a loss is recognized equal to the difference between the carrying value of the asset group and its fair value. The fair value of the asset group is estimated based on discounted future cash flows using a discount rate commensurate with the risk. The asset group is determined at the store level, which is the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are available. Decisions to close a store or facility can also result in accelerated depreciation over the revised useful life. For locations to be closed that are under long-term leases, we record a charge for lease buyout expense or the difference between our rent and the rate at which we expect to be able to sublease the properties and related costs, as appropriate. Most closures occur upon the lease expiration. The estimate of future cash flows is based on historical experience and typically third-party advice or market data. These estimates can be affected by factors such as future store profitability, real estate demand and economic conditions that can be difficult to predict.\nDuring fiscal 2015, 2014, and 2013, we recorded impairment charges of $1.3 million, $6.0 million, and $7.6 million, respectively, related to assets of under-performing stores.\nIncome Taxes\nWe recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax basis of assets and liabilities. We establish valuation allowances when it is more likely than not that all or a portion of a deferred tax asset will not be realized. Changes in valuation allowances from period to period are included in the tax provision in the period of change. We consider all available positive and negative evidence in evaluating whether a valuation allowance is required, including prior earnings history, actual earnings over the previous 12 quarters on a cumulative basis, carryback and carryforward periods, and tax planning strategies that could potentially enhance the likelihood of realization of a deferred tax asset.\nAs of January 30, 2016 and January 31, 2015, the total valuation allowance against certain deferred tax assets was $63.2 million and $58.6 million, respectively. A valuation allowance has not been established for certain foreign and state jurisdictions. Changes in valuation allowances from period to period are included in the tax provision in the period of change.\nWe are subject to periodic audits by the Internal Revenue Service and other taxing authorities. These audits may challenge certain of our tax positions such as the timing and amount of deductions and allocation of taxable income to the various tax jurisdictions. As of January 30, 2016 and January 31, 2015, we had unrecognized tax benefits of $6.4 million and $5.6 million, respectively. Determining income tax expense for tax contingencies requires management to make assumptions that are subject to factors such as proposed assessments by tax authorities, changes in facts and circumstances, issuance of new regulations, and resolution of tax audits. Actual results could materially differ from these estimates and could significantly affect the effective tax rate and cash flows in future years.\nMerchandise Inventories\nMerchandise inventories are recorded at the lower of cost or market (\u201cLCM\u201d), with cost determined on a weighted-average basis. We review our inventory levels to identify slow-moving merchandise and broken assortments (items no longer in stock in a sufficient range of sizes) and record an adjustment when the future estimated selling price is less than cost. We take a physical count of inventories in all stores once a year and perform cycle counts throughout the year in our Dixon distribution center. We also perform an annual physical count of inventories at our third-party fulfillment center in Ohio. We record an inventory shrink adjustment based upon physical counts and also provide for estimated shrink adjustments for the period between the last physical inventory count and each balance sheet date. Our inventory shrink estimate can be affected by changes in merchandise mix and changes in actual shrink trends. Our LCM estimate can be affected by changes in consumer demand and the promotional environment.", "item_7_truncated": "Item 7.

Subsequent to fiscal 2015, Gymboree China's management made the decision to close 25 of its retail locations. Closures are targeted to be completed by the end of May 2016.\nWe also offer directed parent-child developmental play programs under the Gymboree Play & Music brand at 727 franchised and Company-operated centers in the United States and 43 other countries.\nOur year-end is the Saturday closest to January 31. Fiscal 2015 and 2014, which included 52 weeks each, ended on January 30, 2016 and January 31, 2015, respectively.\nFiscal 2015 Highlights\nTotal net sales increased to $1.25 billion for the fiscal year ended January 30, 2016 (\u201cfiscal 2015\u201d) from $1.23 billion in fiscal 2014, or 1.5%, driven primarily by increases in our Gymboree Play & Music sales of $10.3 million, retail sales of $6.1 million, and retail franchise sales of $2.1 million.\nComparable store sales (including online sales) increased 1% compared to fiscal 2014. Below is the comparable store sales (including online sales) by brand for each fiscal year:\nTable 28: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>January 30, 2016 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>January 31, 2015 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Gymboree\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- % </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(4)% </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Janie and Jack\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>8 % </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5 % </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Crazy 8\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2 % </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(3)% </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Combined comparable store sales\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1 % </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(3)% </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nOur Adjusted EBITDA increased to $102.5 million in fiscal 2015 from $93.7 million in fiscal 2014, an increase of $8.8 million or 9.4%, primarily due to a comparable store sales increase, gross profit expansion, and leveraging our selling, general and administrative expenses (\u201cSG&A\u201d), partially offset by the negative impact from the west coast port slowdown in our retail business during the first two quarters of fiscal 2015.\nThe following table summarizes store openings and closures by brand and country for fiscal 2015.

billion in fiscal 2014, or 1.5%, driven primarily by increases in our Gymboree Play & Music sales of $10.3 million, retail sales of $6.1 million, and retail franchise sales of $2.1 million.\nNet retail sales for fiscal 2015 increased to $1.185 billion from $1.178 billion compared to fiscal 2014, an increase of $6.1 million, or 0.5%, primarily due to an increase in comparable store sales (including online sales) of 1%. Comparable store sales (excluding online sales) increased by 1% in fiscal 2015 compared to the same period in the prior year. Total net stores decreased to 1,306 as of fiscal year-end 2015 from 1,326 as of fiscal year-end 2014. Total square footage decreased to approximately 2.7 million square feet as of fiscal year-end 2015 from approximately 2.8 million square feet as of fiscal year-end 2014.\nGymboree Play & Music net sales for fiscal 2015 increased to $41.2 million from $30.9 million in the same period last year, an increase of $10.3 million or 33.3%, primarily due to growth in the number of Gymboree Tianjin franchisee sites to 260 as of fiscal year-end 2015 from 227 at the same prior year period, combined with stronger performance of existing Gymboree Tianjin sites.\nRetail franchise net sales for fiscal 2015 increased to $21.5 million from $19.4 million in the same period last year, an increase of $2.1 million or 11.2%, primarily due to higher sales to our franchisee in the Middle East region. As of fiscal year-end 2015, our overseas franchisees and Gymboree China operated 84 stores compared to 89 stores as of the end of the same period last year.\nGross Profit\nGross profit for fiscal 2015 increased to $486.2 million from $468.5 million in fiscal 2014, primarily as a result of gross profit expansion. As a percentage of net sales, gross profit for fiscal 2015 increased by 90 basis points to 39.0% from 38.1% in the same period last year. The 90 basis points increase was driven primarily by lower cost of goods sold (\u201cCOGS\u201d) as a percentage of sales due to the mix of merchandise inventories sold, lower buying and occupancy costs as a percentage of sales, and an increased mix of Gymboree Tianjin and retail franchise sales, partially offset by the negative impact from the west coast port slowdown in our retail business during the first two quarters of fiscal 2015. As we record certain distribution costs as a component of selling, general and administrative expenses (\u201cSG&A\u201d) and do not include such costs in COGS, our COGS and gross profit may not be comparable to those of other companies. Our distribution costs recorded in SG&A expenses represent primarily outbound shipping and handling expenses to our stores, and amounted to $45.5 million and $43.1 million during fiscal 2015 and 2014, respectively.\nSelling, General and Administrative Expenses\nSG&A principally consists of non-occupancy store expenses, corporate overhead, and certain distribution expenses. SG&A decreased to $444.2 million for fiscal 2015 compared to $448.4 million in the same period last year. As a percentage of net sales, SG&A expenses decreased 90 basis points to 35.6% for fiscal 2015 from 36.5% in the same period last year.\nThe $4.1 million and 90 basis points decrease for fiscal 2015 compared to the same prior year period are primarily due to a decrease in expenses resulting from combined store closures and fewer store openings in the current year, and a $4.7 million reduction in store asset impairment charges for under-performing stores, partially offset by an increase in marketing expenses.\nGoodwill and Intangible Asset Impairment\nDuring fiscal 2015, we did not record any impairment for goodwill and intangible assets.\nIn connection with our long-range planning process in the third quarter of fiscal 2014, we revised our growth assumptions based on estimates of future operations. The updated assumptions resulted in a plan that reflected slower growth in revenues and margins in the reporting units of our retail stores segment. As a result, we recorded non-cash goodwill impairment charges of $252.3 million, $67.2 million and $59.3 million related to the Gymboree Retail, Gymboree Outlet and Crazy 8 reporting units, respectively, during the third quarter of fiscal 2014. In addition, we recorded a non-cash impairment charge of $212.6 million related to trade names in our retail stores segment during the third quarter of fiscal 2014.\nThese impairment charges did not have an effect on our business operations, liquidity or financial covenants.\nInterest Expense\nInterest expense increased to $86.0 million during fiscal 2015 compared to $82.4 million during fiscal 2014. The increase of $3.6 million was primarily related to amortization of our interest rate caps (which mature in December 2016), interest paid on the sale-leaseback financing liability for our Dixon distribution center, and an increase in ABL line of credit borrowings in fiscal 2015. Our average ABL line of credit borrowings increased to $51.9 million during fiscal 2015 compared to $32.0 million during fiscal 2014.\nGain on Extinguishment of Debt\nDuring fiscal 2015, we repurchased Notes (see Note 7 to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report) with an aggregate principal amount of $58.4 million for $15.3 million in cash through open market transactions. We recorded a $41.5 million gain on extinguishment of debt, net of a $1.6 million charge related to the write-off of deferred financing costs associated with the extinguished debt. We did not repurchase any Notes during fiscal 2014. The Notes payable balance as of January 30, 2016 was $287.6 million.\nIncome Taxes\nThe effective tax rate for fiscal 2015 and 2014 was -187.1% (expense) and 11.3% (benefit), respectively. The change in effective tax rate in fiscal 2015 as compared to fiscal 2014 was due to a non-recurring tax benefit in fiscal 2014 related to the impairment of indefinite lived intangible assets offset by the impact of tax liabilities and reserves in fiscal 2015 within certain foreign and state jurisdictions. These liabilities and reserves as a percentage of our fiscal 2015 pre-tax book loss of $3.1 million resulted in a large negative effective tax rate in fiscal 2015.\nWe consider all available positive and negative evidence in evaluating whether a valuation allowance is required, including prior earnings history, actual earnings over the previous 12 quarters on a cumulative basis, carryback and carryforward periods, and tax planning strategies that could potentially enhance the likelihood of realization of a deferred tax asset. As a result of weighing the available objective evidence as of January 30, 2016 and January 31, 2015, our valuation allowance against deferred tax assets was $63.2 million and $58.6 million, respectively. The valuation allowance as of January 30, 2016 represents a valuation allowance against all net deferred tax assets in U.S. federal, unitary U.S. state, and Australian jurisdictions, excluding indefinite-lived deferred tax assets and liabilities, and against the tax benefit on losses from our VIEs. We intend to maintain a valuation allowance until sufficient positive evidence exists to support its reversal.\nFiscal 2014 compared to Fiscal 2013\nNet Sales\nTotal net sales decreased $15.8 million or 1.3% during fiscal 2014 compared to fiscal 2013. This decline was primarily driven by a decrease in net retail sales.\nNet retail sales for fiscal 2014 decreased to $1.18 billion from $1.20 billion compared to fiscal 2013, a decrease of $18.7 million, or 1.6%, primarily due to a decrease in comparable store sales (including online sales) of 3%, partially offset by net new door growth of $23.1 million. Comparable store sales (excluding online sales) decreased by 4% in fiscal 2014 compared to the same period in the prior year. Total net stores increased to 1,326 as of fiscal year-end 2014 from 1,323 as of fiscal year-end 2013. Total square footage increased to approximately 2.8 million square feet as of fiscal year-end 2014 from approximately 2.7 million square feet as of fiscal year-end 2013.\nGymboree Play & Music net sales for fiscal 2014 increased to $30.9 million from $25.7 million during fiscal 2013, an increase of $5.2 million or 20.3%, primarily due to growth in Gymboree Tianjin.\nRetail franchise net sales for fiscal 2014 decreased to $19.4 million from $21.7 million during fiscal 2013, a decrease of $2.4 million or 10.8%, primarily due to lower sales to our franchisee in the Middle East region. As of fiscal year-end 2014, our overseas franchisees and Gymboree China operated 89 stores compared to 71 stores as of fiscal year-end 2013.\nGross Profit\nGross profit for fiscal 2014 decreased to $468.5 million from $476.0 million during fiscal 2013, primarily as a result of the net sales decrease described above. As a percentage of net sales, gross profit for fiscal 2014 decreased by 10 basis points to 38.1% from 38.2% during fiscal 2013 primarily due to deleveraging of buying and occupancy expenses and increased promotional activity. As we record certain distribution costs as a component of SG&A and do not include such costs in COGS, our COGS and gross profit may not be comparable to those of other companies. Our distribution costs recorded in SG&A expenses represent primarily outbound shipping and handling expenses to our stores, and amounted to $43.1 million and $37.9 million during fiscal 2014 and 2013, respectively.\nSelling, General and Administrative Expenses\nSG&A principally consists of non-occupancy store expenses, corporate overhead, and certain distribution expenses. SG&A increased to $448.4 million for fiscal 2014 compared to $443.9 million during fiscal 2013. As a percentage of net sales, SG&A expenses increased 80 basis points to 36.5% for fiscal 2014 from 35.7% during fiscal 2013 primarily due to a deleveraging of expenses on lower comparable store sales, increased expenses related to our third-party fulfillment center which commenced operations during the third quarter of fiscal 2013, and incremental marketing expenses.\nGoodwill and Intangible Asset Impairment\nIn connection with our long-range planning process in the third quarter of fiscal 2014, we revised our growth assumptions based on estimates of future operations. The updated assumptions resulted in a plan that reflected slower growth in revenues and margins in the reporting units of our retail stores segment. As a result, we recorded non-cash goodwill impairment charges of $252.3 million, $67.2 million and $59.3 million related to the Gymboree Retail, Gymboree Outlet and Crazy 8 reporting units, respectively, during the third quarter of fiscal 2014. In addition, we recorded a non-cash impairment charge of $212.6 million related to trade names in our retail stores segment during the third quarter of fiscal 2014.\nDuring fiscal 2013, we recorded non-cash goodwill impairment charges of $85.3 million, $38.8 million, and $16.1 million related to the Crazy 8, Gymboree Retail, and Gymboree Outlet reporting units, respectively. The impairment of goodwill was primarily driven by weak results in fiscal 2013, particularly in the fourth quarter. During fiscal 2013, we also recorded a non-cash impairment charge of $17.0 million related to trade names in our retail stores segment.\nThese impairment charges did not have an effect on our business operations, liquidity or financial covenants.\nInterest Expense\nInterest expense increased to $82.4 million during fiscal 2014 compared to $81.6 million during fiscal 2013. The increase of $0.8 million was primarily related to our interest rate caps.\nLoss on Extinguishment of Debt\nDuring fiscal 2013, we repurchased Notes with an aggregate principal amount of $25.0 million for $24.8 million in cash, which resulted in a $0.2 million gain on extinguishment of debt and a $1.0 million charge related to the write-off of deferred financing costs. We did not repurchase any Notes during fiscal 2014.\nIncome Taxes\nThe effective tax rate for fiscal 2014 and 2013 was 11.3% (benefit) and 0.7% (benefit), respectively. The change in effective tax rate as of fiscal year-end 2014 was related to goodwill and trade name impairment charges. The change in effective tax rate as of fiscal year-end 2013 was due to recording a valuation allowance against net deferred tax assets in jurisdictions where it is more likely than not that these assets will not be realized (see Note 13 to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report).\nWe consider all available positive and negative evidence in evaluating whether a valuation allowance is required, including prior earnings history, actual earnings over the previous 12 quarters on a cumulative basis, carryback and carryforward periods, and tax planning strategies that could potentially enhance the likelihood of realization of a deferred tax asset. As a result of weighing the available objective evidence as of January 31, 2015 and February 1, 2014, our valuation allowance against deferred tax assets was $58.6 million and $31.9 million, respectively. The valuation allowance as of January 31, 2015 represents a valuation allowance against all net deferred tax assets in U.S. federal, unitary U.S. state and Australian jurisdictions, excluding indefinite-lived deferred tax assets and liabilities, and against the tax benefit on losses from our VIEs. We intend to maintain a valuation allowance until sufficient positive evidence exists to support its reversal.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nOverview\nWe finance our business with existing cash, cash from operations and the funds available under our Senior Credit Facilities. We had cash and cash equivalents of $18.2 million and $18.5 million as of January 30, 2016 and January 31, 2015, respectively (including amounts held by the VIEs). Cash and cash equivalents held by the VIEs, of which we are the primary beneficiary, and the results of which we have consolidated into our financial statements, were $9.6 million and $10.0 million as of January 30, 2016 and January 31, 2015, respectively (see Note 19 to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report). The assets of the VIEs can only be used by the VIEs. Net working capital as of January 30, 2016 and January 31, 2015 totaled $29.4 million and $43.0 million, respectively (including $6.2 million and $5.1 million, respectively, from our VIEs).\nWe and our subsidiaries, the VIEs, and our affiliates may from time to time seek to retire or purchase our outstanding debt through cash purchases and/or exchanges, in open market purchases, privately negotiated transactions, by tender offer or otherwise. Such repurchases or exchanges, if any, will depend on prevailing market conditions, liquidity requirements, contractual restrictions and other factors. The amounts involved may be material.\nWe believe that cash generated by operations, the remaining funds available under our Senior Credit Facilities and existing cash and cash equivalents will be sufficient to meet working capital requirements, service our debt, and finance capital expenditures over the next twelve months. However, if we face unanticipated cash needs such as the funding of a capital investment, or if our suppliers request one or more letters of credit, our existing cash and cash equivalents and available borrowings may be insufficient. In addition, we cannot assure that our business will generate sufficient cash flow from operations or that future borrowings will be available to us under the Senior Credit Facilities in amounts sufficient to enable us to repay our indebtedness when due, including the Notes, or to fund other liquidity needs. See \u201cItem 1A. Risk Factors-Risks Related to Our Indebtedness and Certain Other Obligations.\u201d We also regularly evaluate market conditions, our liquidity profile, and various financing alternatives, for opportunities to enhance our capital structure. We are continuing to actively pursue various financing alternatives, including refinancing and/or repurchasing our outstanding Notes, divestitures of certain of our assets and operations, as well as other opportunities to improve our capital structure. If opportunities are favorable, we may consummate one or more of these initiatives and the amounts involved may be material.\nCash and Cash Equivalents\nChanges in our cash and cash equivalents for each fiscal year were as follows (in thousands):\nTable 31: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>January 30, 2016 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>January 31, 2015 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>February 1, 2014 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Cash provided by (used in) operating activities\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>29,140 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(21,758 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>74,871 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Cash used in investing activities\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(22,600 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(31,942 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(53,126 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Cash (used in) provided by financing activities\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(5,846 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>33,336 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(16,634 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Effect of exchange rate fluctuations on cash and cash equivalents\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(1,050 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(545 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>990 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net (decrease) increase in cash and cash equivalents\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(356 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(20,909 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>6,101 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table> Cash flows provided by (used in) operating activities\nNet cash provided by operating activities during fiscal 2015 was $29.1 million compared to net cash used in operating activities of $21.8 million in the same period last year. The change in cash flows from operating activities during fiscal 2015 was primarily due to gross profit expansion, the timing of purchases of merchandise inventories, and the timing of payment of accounts payable and accrued liabilities.\nNet cash used in operating activities for fiscal 2014 was $21.8 million compared to net cash provided by operating activities of $74.9 million in fiscal 2013. The decrease in cash attributable to changes in assets and liabilities was primarily due to an increase in merchandise inventory and a reduction in accounts payable. These increases were partially offset by reduced prepaid rent. The increase in merchandise inventory was primarily due to earlier receipt of Spring goods compared to fiscal 2013 and investments in Winter products in our Gymboree brand.\nCash flows used in investing activities\nNet cash used in investing activities during fiscal 2015 was $22.6 million compared to $31.9 million in the same period last year. The net change during fiscal 2015 was primarily due to lower capital expenditures, which decreased by $10.6 million to $21.4 million compared to $32.0 million in the same period last year. The decrease was due to fewer store openings and an increase in related party loan receivable of $1.7 million (see Note 17 to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report).\nNet cash used in investing activities during fiscal 2014 was $31.9 million compared to $53.1 million during fiscal 2013 and was primarily due to capital expenditures, which decreased to $32.0 million during fiscal 2014 compared to $52.6 million during fiscal 2013 due to fewer store openings.\nWe estimate capital expenditures for fiscal 2016 will be approximately $30 to $35 million. We expect capital expenditures to be used primarily for our systems infrastructure, lease required remodels of existing stores and, to a lesser extent, new store growth.\nCash flows (used in) provided by financing activities\nNet cash used in financing activities during fiscal 2015 was $5.8 million compared to net cash provided by financing activities of $33.3 million during fiscal 2014. In fiscal 2015, we repurchased Notes with an aggregate principal amount of $58.4 million for $15.3 million in cash through open market transactions (see Note 7 to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report). In addition, we made a $14.0 million of net payments on our ABL Revolving Facility and a $1.7 million payment for deferred financing costs related to the amendment of ABL Revolving Facility, partially offset by gross proceeds of $26.8 million related to the sale of the Company's distribution center in Dixon, California (reduced by $0.9 million payment for deferred financing costs (see Notes 7 and 8 to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report).\nNet cash provided by financing activities during fiscal 2014 was $33.3 million compared to net cash used in financing activities of $16.6 million during fiscal 2013. Net cash provided by financing activities for fiscal 2014 was primarily due to net proceeds of $33.0 million from our ABL Revolving Facility.\nCredit Facilities\nABL Facility\nIn September 2015, we amended the ABL Revolving Facility (the \u201cFirst Amendment\u201d) to extend the maturity date of the ABL revolving commitments from March 2017 to the earlier of (i) September 24, 2020 and (ii) the date that is 60 days before the scheduled final maturity date of any tranche of the Term Loan (which matures in February 2018) or the Notes (which mature in December 2018), unless such indebtedness is cumulatively equal to or less than $25.0 million in the aggregate and a reserve against the borrowing base is imposed equal to the amount of such indebtedness.\nThe ABL Revolving Facility, as amended by the First Amendment, provided financing of up to $225 million in a revolving line of credit. Line of credit availability under the ABL Revolving Facility is subject to a borrowing base consisting of certain assets of the Company, any subsidiary co-borrowers and any subsidiary guarantors that are available to collateralize the borrowings thereunder, and is reduced by the level of outstanding letters of credit. As of January 30, 2016, line of credit borrowings outstanding under the ABL Revolving Facility were $19.0 million and letter of credit utilization was $27.6 million. Undrawn line of credit availability under the ABL Revolving Facility, after being reduced by outstanding borrowings and letter of credit utilization, was $125.5 million as of January 30, 2016. Average line of credit borrowings during fiscal 2015 under the ABL Revolving Facility amounted to $51.9 million. We anticipate utilizing our line of credit under the ABL Revolving Facility throughout the course of fiscal 2016 to support seasonal working capital needs and expect to have borrowings outstanding at year-end.\nLine of credit borrowings under the ABL Revolving Facility bear interest at a rate per annum equal to, at our option, either (a) a base rate determined by reference to the highest of (1) the prime rate of Bank of America, N.A., (2) the federal funds effective rate plus 0.50%, and (3) a LIBOR rate determined by reference to the costs of funds for U.S. dollar deposits for an interest period of one month adjusted for certain additional costs, plus 1.00%, or (b) a LIBOR rate determined by reference to the costs of funds for U.S. dollar deposits for the interest period relevant to such borrowing adjusted for certain additional costs (\u201cAdjusted LIBOR\u201d), in each case plus an applicable margin. As of January 30, 2016, the weighted average interest rate on our line of credit borrowings outstanding under the ABL Revolving Facility was 3.5%. In addition to paying interest on outstanding line of credit borrowings under the ABL Revolving Facility, we are required to pay a commitment fee on unutilized commitments thereunder, which is between 0.250% and 0.375% per annum under the amended ABL Revolving Facility.\nIf at any time the aggregate amount of outstanding loans, unreimbursed letter of credit drawings and undrawn letters of credit under the ABL Revolving Facility exceeds the lesser of (a) the commitment amount and (b) the borrowing base, we will be required to repay outstanding loans and/or cash collateralized letters of credit in an aggregate amount equal to such excess, with no reduction of the commitment amount. The ABL Revolving Facility contains financial and other covenants that, among other things, restrict our ability to incur additional indebtedness and pay dividends. As of January 30, 2016, the ABL Revolving Facility also contained a financial covenant that required the Company to test its consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio when availability under the facility fell below a specified threshold. As of January 30, 2016, we were not required to test compliance with this financial covenant.\nOn April 22, 2016, we entered into a second amendment to the ABL Revolving Facility (the ABL Revolving Facility, as so amended, the \u201cABL Facility\u201d or the \u201cSecond Amendment\u201d). The Second Amendment provides for a senior secured term loan (the \u201cABL Term Loan\u201d) of $50.0 million, subject to a borrowing base, the proceeds of which may be used to finance the acquisition of working capital assets, including the purchase of inventory and equipment, in each case in the ordinary course of business, to finance capital expenditures, to finance permitted acquisitions and for general corporate purposes, including repurchases of the Notes.\nThe Second Amendment provides that the ABL Term Loan will bear interest (computed on the basis of the actual number of days elapsed over a year of 360 days) at a 90-day LIBOR contract rate as determined by the agent for the ABL Term Loan monthly on the first day of each calendar month, plus 10.25% per annum, or, in certain circumstances, at the prime rate, plus 9.25% per annum. The Second Amendment also provides for a new availability covenant, whereby so long as any amount of the ABL Term Loan remains outstanding, the Company and its restricted subsidiaries must maintain, at all times, (i) Combined Availability (or, an amount equal to (a) the ABL Term Loan borrowing base minus the sum of (b) the aggregate outstanding principal amount under the ABL Facility (including the ABL Term Loan, revolving line of credit borrowings and letter of credit utilization)) in excess of the greater of (x) $17.5 million and (y) 10% of the ABL Term Loan borrowing base; and (ii) Availability (or, an amount equal to the lesser of (A) (I) the revolving credit ceiling minus (II) the aggregate principal amount outstanding under the revolving line of credit and letter of credit utilization and (B) (I) the revolving line of credit borrowing base minus (II) the aggregate principal amount outstanding under the revolving line of credit and letter of credit utilization) in excess of the greater of (x) $17.5 million and (y) 10% of the lesser of (A) the applicable revolving line of credit borrowing base and (B) the revolving credit ceiling (which as of the date hereof is $225.0 million). The Second Amendment further provides that the Company's consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio will not be tested as long as the ABL Term Loan remains outstanding. The maturity date for the ABL Term Loan is the same as the maturity date of the ABL revolving commitments discussed above, and all other material affirmative and negative covenants and events of default under the ABL Facility remain substantially unchanged. In addition, the restrictions on amendments to the ABL Facility were amended to provide the agent for the ABL Term Loan and the ABL Term Loan lenders certain consent rights relating to, among other terms and provisions, the borrowing bases, the availability covenant and certain negative covenants.\nTerm Loan\nWe also have an agreement with several lenders for an $820 million senior secured Term Loan, with a maturity date of February 2018. As of January 30, 2016, $769.1 million was outstanding under the Term Loan. The Term Loan allows us to request additional tranches of term loans in an aggregate amount not to exceed $200 million, subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions, provided such amount will be subject to reduction by the amount of any additional commitments incurred under the ABL Revolving Facility. The interest rate for borrowings under the Term Loan is, at the Company's option, a base rate plus an additional marginal rate of 2.5% or the Adjusted LIBOR rate (with a 1.5% floor) plus an additional rate of 3.5%. As of January 30, 2016, the interest rate under our Term Loan was 5%.\nThe Term Loan requires us to make quarterly payments equal to 0.25% of the original $820 million principal amount of the Term Loan made on the closing date plus accrued and unpaid interest thereon, with the balance due in February 2018. The Term Loan also has mandatory and voluntary pre-payment provisions, including a requirement that we prepay the Term Loan with a certain percentage of our annual excess cash flow. We calculated our excess cash flow using fiscal 2015 operating results and concluded we\nare not required to make any excess cash flow payments on the Term Loan during fiscal 2016. Voluntary prepayments and the excess cash flow prepayments made in prior fiscal years were applied toward our remaining quarterly amortization payments payable under the Term Loan through fiscal 2016. Our next quarterly payment payable under the Term Loan is due in the first quarter of fiscal 2017.\nThe Term Loan contains covenants that, among other things, restrict our ability to incur additional indebtedness and pay dividends.\nNotes\nIn fiscal 2010, we issued $400 million aggregate principal amount of 9.125% Notes due in December 2018. Interest on the Notes is payable semi-annually. As of January 30, 2016, the Notes payable balance outstanding was $287.6 million.\nSummary Disclosures about Contractual Obligations and Commercial Commitments\nThe following table reflects a summary of our contractual obligations and commitments as of January 30, 2016:\nTable 32: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Payments due by period </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> ($ in thousands)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>Less than\n1 year </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1-3 years </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3-5 years </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>After 5 years </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Total </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Operating leases (1)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>102,638 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>155,978 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>92,524 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>86,185 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>437,325 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Inventory purchase obligations (2)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>182,439 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>182,439 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other purchase obligations (3)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>25,961 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>35,239 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>14,006 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>706 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>75,912 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Long-term debt (4)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>19,000 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,056,677 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,075,677 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Interest payments on long-term debt (5)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>65,994 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>98,054 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>164,048 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Sale-leaseback financing liability and interest payments (6)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,800 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3,667 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3,759 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>31,366 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>40,592 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total contractual cash obligations\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>397,832 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,349,615 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>110,289 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>118,257 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,975,993 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\n (1) Other lease-required expenses such as utilities, real estate taxes and common area repairs and maintenance are excluded. Additionally, sublease rental receipts totaling approximately $4.9 million through April 2018 are excluded. See Note 11 to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report for discussion of the Company's operating leases. \n (2) Inventory purchase obligations include outstanding purchase orders for merchandise inventories that are enforceable and legally binding on the Company and that specify all significant terms (including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased), fixed, minimum or variable price provisions, and the approximate timing of the transaction. \n (3) Other purchase obligations include annual commitments of approximately $8.8 million through the second quarter of 2019 under the operating services agreement related to a third party fulfillment center (see Notes 11 and 14 to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report). The table above does not reflect the impact of the subsequent termination of the operating service agreement. On February 25, 2016 (see Note 11 to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report), the Company entered into an agreement to terminate the operating services agreement effective upon exiting from the fulfillment center in Ohio, which is expected to be in May 2016. The Company will continue to pay a monthly minimum fee of approximately $0.7 million until fulfillment of orders ceases on April 30, 2016 and will pay an early termination fee of $8.3 million to the third-party fulfillment center. The Company could continue to pay the monthly minimum fee or a pro-rata amount if fulfillment of orders continues to be processed in the third-party fulfillment center after April 30, 2016 through no fault of the third party fulfillment center. \nAlso included in other purchase obligations are commitments for professional services, information technology and fixtures and equipment.\n (4) Long-term debt as of January 30, 3016 is consists of a $769.1 million Term Loan, an ABL Revolving Facility that provides a revolving line of credit of up to $225 million, and an aggregate principal amount of $287.6 million of our Notes. The table above includes $19.0 million of outstanding revolver borrowings from our ABL Facility. The amounts presented in the table above exclude an original issue discount of $0.7 million (see Note 7 to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report) and $27.6 million of commercial and standby letters of credit related to normal business transactions, which expires in fiscal 2016 (see Note 6 to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report). \nThe table above does not reflect the repurchase of any Notes subsequent to fiscal 2015. See Note 22 to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report.\n (5) Interest payments on long-term debt are estimated based on: (a) the outstanding principal balance of the Term Loan, which was $769.1 million as of January 30, 2016, and also take into consideration scheduled principal payments in fiscal 2017 through 2018, and (b) the outstanding principal balance of $287.6 million on the Notes as of January 30, 2016. The interest rate for borrowings under the Term Loan is, at the Company's option, a base rate plus an additional marginal rate of 2.5% or the Adjusted LIBOR rate (with a 1.5% floor) plus an additional rate of 3.5%. Interest payments for borrowings under the Term Loan, in the table above, are estimated using the Company's January 30, 2016 rate of 5%. Interest payments on the Company's Notes are made semi-annually at a rate of 9.125% of the principal amount outstanding.  The table above does not reflect the repurchase of any Notes subsequent to fiscal 2015. See Note 22 to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report.\n (6) Sale-leaseback financing liability and interest payments pertain to the sale of the distribution center in Dixon, California, which we leaseback from the purchaser for a period of 15 years (see Note 8 to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report). Under the terms of the lease agreement, the Company is required to maintain an unconditional irrevocable letter of credit for a period up to 10 years. Due to the Company's continuing involvement through the irrevocable letter of credit, the Company has accounted for the sale-leaseback as a financing liability.  As of January 30, 2016, we had unrecognized tax benefits of $3.7 million, accrued interest of $0.9 million, and accrued penalties of $0.5 million. These amounts have been excluded from the contractual obligations table because a reasonably reliable estimate of the timing of future tax settlements cannot be determined.\nThe expected timing of payment of the obligations discussed above is estimated based on current information. The timing of payments and actual amounts paid may differ depending on the timing of receipt of services, or, for some obligations, changes to agreed-upon amounts.\nEarnings before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization (\u201cEBITDA\u201d) (Non-GAAP Measure)\nIn the table below, we present Adjusted EBITDA (which is defined as net loss attributable to The Gymboree Corporation before interest expense, interest income, income taxes, and depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) adjusted for the other items described below), which is considered a non-GAAP financial measure. We present Adjusted EBITDA in this annual report because we consider it an important supplemental measure of performance used by management and we believe it is frequently used by securities analysts, investors and other interested parties in the evaluation of companies in the retail industry. Adjusted EBITDA is calculated in substantially the same manner as \u201cEBITDA\u201d under the indenture governing the Notes and \u201cConsolidated EBITDA\u201d under the agreement governing our Senior Credit Facilities. We believe the inclusion of supplementary adjustments applied to EBITDA in presenting Adjusted EBITDA is appropriate to provide additional information to investors about certain non-cash items and to provide additional information with respect to our ability to meet our future debt service and to comply with various covenants in documents governing our indebtedness. However, Adjusted EBITDA is not a presentation made in accordance with GAAP, and our computation of Adjusted EBITDA may vary from others in the retail industry. Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered an alternative to operating income or net income (loss), as a measure of operating performance or cash flow, or as a measure of liquidity. Adjusted EBITDA has important limitations as an analytical tool, and should not be considered in isolation, or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under GAAP. For example, Adjusted EBITDA:\n \u2022 does not reflect our cash expenditures, or future requirements, for capital expenditures or contractual commitments; \n \u2022 does not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, our working capital needs; \n \u2022 does not reflect the significant interest expense, or the cash requirements necessary to service interest or principal payments, on our debt; \n \u2022 excludes income tax payments that represent a reduction in cash available to us; and \n \u2022 does not reflect the impact of earnings or charges resulting from matters we consider not to be indicative of ongoing operations. \nThe following table provides a reconciliation of net loss attributable to The Gymboree Corporation to Adjusted EBITDA for the fiscal years indicated (in thousands):\nTable 44: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>

Management has discussed the development and selection of the critical accounting policies and estimates applicable to the Company as of the date of the completion of the audit for the fiscal year ended January 30, 2016 with the Company's Audit Committee.\nGoodwill\nOn November 23, 2010, we completed a merger (the \u201cMerger\u201d) with Giraffe Acquisition Corporation in accordance with an Agreement and Plan of Merger with Giraffe Holding, Inc. (\u201cParent\u201d) and Acquisition Sub, a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent. In connection with the Merger, we allocated goodwill to our reporting units, which we concluded were the same as our operating segments: Gymboree Retail (including an online store), Gymboree Outlet, Janie and Jack (including an online store), Crazy 8 (including an online store), Gymboree Play & Music and International Retail Franchise. We allocated goodwill to the reporting units by calculating the fair value of each reporting unit and deriving the implied fair value of each reporting unit's goodwill as of the Merger. As of January 30, 2016, we had goodwill of $372.7 million related to the Merger.\nGoodwill is tested for impairment on an annual basis at the end of our tenth fiscal period (fiscal November) and at an interim date if indicators of impairment exist. Events that could result in an interim period impairment review include significant changes in the business climate, declines in our operating results, or an expectation that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. We assess potential impairment by considering present economic conditions as well as future expectations.\nGoodwill is tested by performing a two-step goodwill impairment test. The first step of the two-step goodwill impairment test is to compare the fair value of the reporting unit to its carrying amount, including goodwill. If the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value, the second step of the two-step goodwill impairment test is required to measure the goodwill impairment loss. The second step includes valuing all the tangible and intangible assets and liabilities of the reporting unit as if the reporting unit had been acquired in a business combination. Then, the implied fair value of the reporting unit's goodwill is compared to the carrying amount of that goodwill. If the carrying amount of the reporting unit's goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of the goodwill, we recognize an impairment loss in an amount equal to the excess, not to exceed the carrying amount.\nCalculating the fair value of a reporting unit and the implied fair value of reporting unit goodwill requires significant judgment. The use of different assumptions, estimates or judgments in either step of the goodwill impairment testing process, such as the estimated future cash flows of reporting units, the discount rate used to discount such cash flows, or the estimated fair value of the reporting units' tangible and intangible assets and liabilities, could significantly increase or decrease the estimated fair value of a reporting unit or its net assets.\nWe performed our annual goodwill impairment test during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015 (fiscal November) and determined that there was no goodwill impairment for any of our reporting units. Based on the results of the first step of the Company's impairment test performed, we determined that the fair value of our reporting units each exceeded their carrying values by more than 30%.\nThe annual goodwill impairment analysis for the reporting units was based on our projection of revenues, gross margin, operating costs and cash flows considering historical and estimated future results, general economic and future market conditions, as well as the impact of planned business and operational strategies. We based our projections on assumptions we believed to be reasonable at the time, but such assumptions are subject to inherent uncertainty. Actual results may differ from those estimates. The valuations employed typical methodologies to measure fair value and considered market factors and reporting unit specific fact patterns. We primarily used an income approach and market approach to value these reporting units. Assumptions used in the market approach include valuation multiples based on an analysis of multiples for comparable public companies and similar transactions. Finally, specific weights were applied to the components of each approach to estimate the total fair value. These weights are based on estimates and are developed based on the specific characteristics, risks and uncertainties of each reporting unit.\nThe fair value of the Gymboree Retail, Gymboree Outlet, Janie and Jack, Crazy 8, Play & Music, and International Retail Franchise reporting units were $581.0 million, $140.0 million, $274.0 million, $143.0 million, $64.0 million, and $75.0 million, respectively, which exceeded the carrying values of $436.6 million, $106.6 million, $77.2 million, $69.9 million, $40.3 million, and $26.7 million, respectively.\nIndefinite-Lived Intangible Assets\nIndefinite-lived intangible assets primarily represent trade names for each of our brands. We do not amortize intangible assets with indefinite useful lives. We test indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment on annual basis at the end of our tenth\nfiscal period (fiscal November), and more frequently if indicators of potential impairment exist and indicate that it is more likely than not that the asset is impaired. Impairment of indefinite-lived intangible assets is measured by comparing the carrying amount of the asset to the discounted future cash flows that the asset is expected to generate using the relief from royalty method. If we determine that an individual asset is impaired, the amount of any impairment is measured as the difference between the carrying value and the fair value of the impaired asset. Calculating the fair value of indefinite-lived intangible assets requires significant judgment. The use of different assumptions, estimates or judgments, such as the estimated future cash flows, royalty rates or the discount rate used to discount such cash flows, could significantly increase or decrease the estimated fair value of our indefinite-lived intangible assets.\nWe performed our annual impairment test of indefinite-lived intangible assets (trade names) during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015 and concluded that these assets were not impaired. In connection with our annual impairment test, we determined that the estimated fair values of Gymboree Retail, Gymboree Outlet, Janie and Jack, Crazy 8 and Play & Music trade names were $229.5 million, $40.5 million, $61.6 million, $19.8 million and $46.8 million, respectively, which exceeded the carrying values of $202.2 million, $38.3 million, $42.2 million, $18.5 million and $36.2 million, respectively.\nStore Asset Impairment\nStore assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable. If the undiscounted future cash flows from the asset group are less than the carrying value, a loss is recognized equal to the difference between the carrying value of the asset group and its fair value. The fair value of the asset group is estimated based on discounted future cash flows using a discount rate commensurate with the risk. The asset group is determined at the store level, which is the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are available. Decisions to close a store or facility can also result in accelerated depreciation over the revised useful life. For locations to be closed that are under long-term leases, we record a charge for lease buyout expense or the difference between our rent and the rate at which we expect to be able to sublease the properties and related costs, as appropriate. Most closures occur upon the lease expiration. The estimate of future cash flows is based on historical experience and typically third-party advice or market data. These estimates can be affected by factors such as future store profitability, real estate demand and economic conditions that can be difficult to predict.\nDuring fiscal 2015, 2014, and 2013, we recorded impairment charges of $1.3 million, $6.0 million, and $7.6 million, respectively, related to assets of under-performing stores.\nIncome Taxes\nWe recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax basis of assets and liabilities. We establish valuation allowances when it is more likely than not that all or a portion of a deferred tax asset will not be realized. Changes in valuation allowances from period to period are included in the tax provision in the period of change. We consider all available positive and negative evidence in evaluating whether a valuation allowance is required, including prior earnings history, actual earnings over the previous 12 quarters on a cumulative basis, carryback and carryforward periods, and tax planning strategies that could potentially enhance the likelihood of realization of a deferred tax asset.\nAs of January 30, 2016 and January 31, 2015, the total valuation allowance against certain deferred tax assets was $63.2 million and $58.6 million, respectively. A valuation allowance has not been established for certain foreign and state jurisdictions. Changes in valuation allowances from period to period are included in the tax provision in the period of change.\nWe are subject to periodic audits by the Internal Revenue Service and other taxing authorities. These audits may challenge certain of our tax positions such as the timing and amount of deductions and allocation of taxable income to the various tax jurisdictions. As of January 30, 2016 and January 31, 2015, we had unrecognized tax benefits of $6.4 million and $5.6 million, respectively. Determining income tax expense for tax contingencies requires management to make assumptions that are subject to factors such as proposed assessments by tax authorities, changes in facts and circumstances, issuance of new regulations, and resolution of tax audits. Actual results could materially differ from these estimates and could significantly affect the effective tax rate and cash flows in future years.\nMerchandise Inventories\nMerchandise inventories are recorded at the lower of cost or market (\u201cLCM\u201d), with cost determined on a weighted-average basis. We review our inventory levels to identify slow-moving merchandise and broken assortments (items no longer in stock in a sufficient range of sizes) and record an adjustment when the future estimated selling price is less than cost. We take a physical count of inventories in all stores once a year and perform cycle counts throughout the year in our Dixon distribution center. We also perform an annual physical count of inventories at our third-party fulfillment center in Ohio. We record an inventory shrink adjustment based upon physical counts and also provide for estimated shrink adjustments for the period between the last physical inventory count and each balance sheet date. Our inventory shrink estimate can be affected by changes in merchandise mix and changes in actual shrink trends. Our LCM estimate can be affected by changes in consumer demand and the promotional environment.", "item_7_text": "Item 7.

As of January 30, 2016, we operated a total of 1,306 retail stores, as follows:\n In addition, as of January 30, 2016, we operated online stores at www.gymboree.com, www.janieandjack.com, and www.crazy8.com. Overseas franchisees and Gymboree China operated 84 retail stores, as follows:\n\n (1) Overseas franchisees operated retail stores in the Middle East, South Korea and Latin America.  Subsequent to fiscal 2015, Gymboree China's management made the decision to close 25 of its retail locations. Closures are targeted to be completed by the end of May 2016.\nWe also offer directed parent-child developmental play programs under the Gymboree Play & Music brand at 727 franchised and Company-operated centers in the United States and 43 other countries.\nOur year-end is the Saturday closest to January 31. Fiscal 2015 and 2014, which included 52 weeks each, ended on January 30, 2016 and January 31, 2015, respectively.\nFiscal 2015 Highlights\nTotal net sales increased to $1.25 billion for the fiscal year ended January 30, 2016 (\u201cfiscal 2015\u201d) from $1.23 billion in fiscal 2014, or 1.5%, driven primarily by increases in our Gymboree Play & Music sales of $10.3 million, retail sales of $6.1 million, and retail franchise sales of $2.1 million.\nComparable store sales (including online sales) increased 1% compared to fiscal 2014. Below is the comparable store sales (including online sales) by brand for each fiscal year:\n\nOur Adjusted EBITDA increased to $102.5 million in fiscal 2015 from $93.7 million in fiscal 2014, an increase of $8.8 million or 9.4%, primarily due to a comparable store sales increase, gross profit expansion, and leveraging our selling, general and administrative expenses (\u201cSG&A\u201d), partially offset by the negative impact from the west coast port slowdown in our retail business during the first two quarters of fiscal 2015.\nThe following table summarizes store openings and closures by brand and country for fiscal 2015. Note that (i) all Crazy 8 stores are in the United States and (ii) retail stores operated by overseas franchisees and the VIE-operated Gymboree retail stores in China are excluded.\n We plan to open approximately 6 new stores in fiscal 2016, primarily in our Janie and Jack and Gymboree Outlet brands, and close approximately 20 to 30 stores, primarily in our Crazy 8 and Gymboree brands. We expect our international franchise partners to open approximately 1 to 5 franchise stores in fiscal 2016.\nResults of Operations\nConsolidated statements of operations data as a percentage of total net sales for each fiscal year were as follows (amounts in thousands):\n Fiscal 2015 compared to Fiscal 2014\nNet Sales\nTotal net sales increased to $1.25 billion for fiscal 2015 from $1.23 billion in fiscal 2014, or 1.5%, driven primarily by increases in our Gymboree Play & Music sales of $10.3 million, retail sales of $6.1 million, and retail franchise sales of $2.1 million.\nNet retail sales for fiscal 2015 increased to $1.185 billion from $1.178 billion compared to fiscal 2014, an increase of $6.1 million, or 0.5%, primarily due to an increase in comparable store sales (including online sales) of 1%. Comparable store sales (excluding online sales) increased by 1% in fiscal 2015 compared to the same period in the prior year. Total net stores decreased to 1,306 as of fiscal year-end 2015 from 1,326 as of fiscal year-end 2014. Total square footage decreased to approximately 2.7 million square feet as of fiscal year-end 2015 from approximately 2.8 million square feet as of fiscal year-end 2014.\nGymboree Play & Music net sales for fiscal 2015 increased to $41.2 million from $30.9 million in the same period last year, an increase of $10.3 million or 33.3%, primarily due to growth in the number of Gymboree Tianjin franchisee sites to 260 as of fiscal year-end 2015 from 227 at the same prior year period, combined with stronger performance of existing Gymboree Tianjin sites.\nRetail franchise net sales for fiscal 2015 increased to $21.5 million from $19.4 million in the same period last year, an increase of $2.1 million or 11.2%, primarily due to higher sales to our franchisee in the Middle East region. As of fiscal year-end 2015, our overseas franchisees and Gymboree China operated 84 stores compared to 89 stores as of the end of the same period last year.\nGross Profit\nGross profit for fiscal 2015 increased to $486.2 million from $468.5 million in fiscal 2014, primarily as a result of gross profit expansion. As a percentage of net sales, gross profit for fiscal 2015 increased by 90 basis points to 39.0% from 38.1% in the same period last year. The 90 basis points increase was driven primarily by lower cost of goods sold (\u201cCOGS\u201d) as a percentage of sales due to the mix of merchandise inventories sold, lower buying and occupancy costs as a percentage of sales, and an increased mix of Gymboree Tianjin and retail franchise sales, partially offset by the negative impact from the west coast port slowdown in our retail business during the first two quarters of fiscal 2015. As we record certain distribution costs as a component of selling, general and administrative expenses (\u201cSG&A\u201d) and do not include such costs in COGS, our COGS and gross profit may not be comparable to those of other companies. Our distribution costs recorded in SG&A expenses represent primarily outbound shipping and handling expenses to our stores, and amounted to $45.5 million and $43.1 million during fiscal 2015 and 2014, respectively.\nSelling, General and Administrative Expenses\nSG&A principally consists of non-occupancy store expenses, corporate overhead, and certain distribution expenses. SG&A decreased to $444.2 million for fiscal 2015 compared to $448.4 million in the same period last year. As a percentage of net sales, SG&A expenses decreased 90 basis points to 35.6% for fiscal 2015 from 36.5% in the same period last year.\nThe $4.1 million and 90 basis points decrease for fiscal 2015 compared to the same prior year period are primarily due to a decrease in expenses resulting from combined store closures and fewer store openings in the current year, and a $4.7 million reduction in store asset impairment charges for under-performing stores, partially offset by an increase in marketing expenses.\nGoodwill and Intangible Asset Impairment\nDuring fiscal 2015, we did not record any impairment for goodwill and intangible assets.\nIn connection with our long-range planning process in the third quarter of fiscal 2014, we revised our growth assumptions based on estimates of future operations. The updated assumptions resulted in a plan that reflected slower growth in revenues and margins in the reporting units of our retail stores segment. As a result, we recorded non-cash goodwill impairment charges of $252.3 million, $67.2 million and $59.3 million related to the Gymboree Retail, Gymboree Outlet and Crazy 8 reporting units, respectively, during the third quarter of fiscal 2014. In addition, we recorded a non-cash impairment charge of $212.6 million related to trade names in our retail stores segment during the third quarter of fiscal 2014.\nThese impairment charges did not have an effect on our business operations, liquidity or financial covenants.\nInterest Expense\nInterest expense increased to $86.0 million during fiscal 2015 compared to $82.4 million during fiscal 2014. The increase of $3.6 million was primarily related to amortization of our interest rate caps (which mature in December 2016), interest paid on the sale-leaseback financing liability for our Dixon distribution center, and an increase in ABL line of credit borrowings in fiscal 2015. Our average ABL line of credit borrowings increased to $51.9 million during fiscal 2015 compared to $32.0 million during fiscal 2014.\nGain on Extinguishment of Debt\nDuring fiscal 2015, we repurchased Notes (see Note 7 to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report) with an aggregate principal amount of $58.4 million for $15.3 million in cash through open market transactions. We recorded a $41.5 million gain on extinguishment of debt, net of a $1.6 million charge related to the write-off of deferred financing costs associated with the extinguished debt. We did not repurchase any Notes during fiscal 2014. The Notes payable balance as of January 30, 2016 was $287.6 million.\nIncome Taxes\nThe effective tax rate for fiscal 2015 and 2014 was -187.1% (expense) and 11.3% (benefit), respectively. The change in effective tax rate in fiscal 2015 as compared to fiscal 2014 was due to a non-recurring tax benefit in fiscal 2014 related to the impairment of indefinite lived intangible assets offset by the impact of tax liabilities and reserves in fiscal 2015 within certain foreign and state jurisdictions. These liabilities and reserves as a percentage of our fiscal 2015 pre-tax book loss of $3.1 million resulted in a large negative effective tax rate in fiscal 2015.\nWe consider all available positive and negative evidence in evaluating whether a valuation allowance is required, including prior earnings history, actual earnings over the previous 12 quarters on a cumulative basis, carryback and carryforward periods, and tax planning strategies that could potentially enhance the likelihood of realization of a deferred tax asset. As a result of weighing the available objective evidence as of January 30, 2016 and January 31, 2015, our valuation allowance against deferred tax assets was $63.2 million and $58.6 million, respectively. The valuation allowance as of January 30, 2016 represents a valuation allowance against all net deferred tax assets in U.S. federal, unitary U.S. state, and Australian jurisdictions, excluding indefinite-lived deferred tax assets and liabilities, and against the tax benefit on losses from our VIEs. We intend to maintain a valuation allowance until sufficient positive evidence exists to support its reversal.\nFiscal 2014 compared to Fiscal 2013\nNet Sales\nTotal net sales decreased $15.8 million or 1.3% during fiscal 2014 compared to fiscal 2013. This decline was primarily driven by a decrease in net retail sales.\nNet retail sales for fiscal 2014 decreased to $1.18 billion from $1.20 billion compared to fiscal 2013, a decrease of $18.7 million, or 1.6%, primarily due to a decrease in comparable store sales (including online sales) of 3%, partially offset by net new door growth of $23.1 million. Comparable store sales (excluding online sales) decreased by 4% in fiscal 2014 compared to the same period in the prior year. Total net stores increased to 1,326 as of fiscal year-end 2014 from 1,323 as of fiscal year-end 2013. Total square footage increased to approximately 2.8 million square feet as of fiscal year-end 2014 from approximately 2.7 million square feet as of fiscal year-end 2013.\nGymboree Play & Music net sales for fiscal 2014 increased to $30.9 million from $25.7 million during fiscal 2013, an increase of $5.2 million or 20.3%, primarily due to growth in Gymboree Tianjin.\nRetail franchise net sales for fiscal 2014 decreased to $19.4 million from $21.7 million during fiscal 2013, a decrease of $2.4 million or 10.8%, primarily due to lower sales to our franchisee in the Middle East region. As of fiscal year-end 2014, our overseas franchisees and Gymboree China operated 89 stores compared to 71 stores as of fiscal year-end 2013.\nGross Profit\nGross profit for fiscal 2014 decreased to $468.5 million from $476.0 million during fiscal 2013, primarily as a result of the net sales decrease described above. As a percentage of net sales, gross profit for fiscal 2014 decreased by 10 basis points to 38.1% from 38.2% during fiscal 2013 primarily due to deleveraging of buying and occupancy expenses and increased promotional activity. As we record certain distribution costs as a component of SG&A and do not include such costs in COGS, our COGS and gross profit may not be comparable to those of other companies. Our distribution costs recorded in SG&A expenses represent primarily outbound shipping and handling expenses to our stores, and amounted to $43.1 million and $37.9 million during fiscal 2014 and 2013, respectively.\nSelling, General and Administrative Expenses\nSG&A principally consists of non-occupancy store expenses, corporate overhead, and certain distribution expenses. SG&A increased to $448.4 million for fiscal 2014 compared to $443.9 million during fiscal 2013. As a percentage of net sales, SG&A expenses increased 80 basis points to 36.5% for fiscal 2014 from 35.7% during fiscal 2013 primarily due to a deleveraging of expenses on lower comparable store sales, increased expenses related to our third-party fulfillment center which commenced operations during the third quarter of fiscal 2013, and incremental marketing expenses.\nGoodwill and Intangible Asset Impairment\nIn connection with our long-range planning process in the third quarter of fiscal 2014, we revised our growth assumptions based on estimates of future operations. The updated assumptions resulted in a plan that reflected slower growth in revenues and margins in the reporting units of our retail stores segment. As a result, we recorded non-cash goodwill impairment charges of $252.3 million, $67.2 million and $59.3 million related to the Gymboree Retail, Gymboree Outlet and Crazy 8 reporting units, respectively, during the third quarter of fiscal 2014. In addition, we recorded a non-cash impairment charge of $212.6 million related to trade names in our retail stores segment during the third quarter of fiscal 2014.\nDuring fiscal 2013, we recorded non-cash goodwill impairment charges of $85.3 million, $38.8 million, and $16.1 million related to the Crazy 8, Gymboree Retail, and Gymboree Outlet reporting units, respectively. The impairment of goodwill was primarily driven by weak results in fiscal 2013, particularly in the fourth quarter. During fiscal 2013, we also recorded a non-cash impairment charge of $17.0 million related to trade names in our retail stores segment.\nThese impairment charges did not have an effect on our business operations, liquidity or financial covenants.\nInterest Expense\nInterest expense increased to $82.4 million during fiscal 2014 compared to $81.6 million during fiscal 2013. The increase of $0.8 million was primarily related to our interest rate caps.\nLoss on Extinguishment of Debt\nDuring fiscal 2013, we repurchased Notes with an aggregate principal amount of $25.0 million for $24.8 million in cash, which resulted in a $0.2 million gain on extinguishment of debt and a $1.0 million charge related to the write-off of deferred financing costs. We did not repurchase any Notes during fiscal 2014.\nIncome Taxes\nThe effective tax rate for fiscal 2014 and 2013 was 11.3% (benefit) and 0.7% (benefit), respectively. The change in effective tax rate as of fiscal year-end 2014 was related to goodwill and trade name impairment charges. The change in effective tax rate as of fiscal year-end 2013 was due to recording a valuation allowance against net deferred tax assets in jurisdictions where it is more likely than not that these assets will not be realized (see Note 13 to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report).\nWe consider all available positive and negative evidence in evaluating whether a valuation allowance is required, including prior earnings history, actual earnings over the previous 12 quarters on a cumulative basis, carryback and carryforward periods, and tax planning strategies that could potentially enhance the likelihood of realization of a deferred tax asset. As a result of weighing the available objective evidence as of January 31, 2015 and February 1, 2014, our valuation allowance against deferred tax assets was $58.6 million and $31.9 million, respectively. The valuation allowance as of January 31, 2015 represents a valuation allowance against all net deferred tax assets in U.S. federal, unitary U.S. state and Australian jurisdictions, excluding indefinite-lived deferred tax assets and liabilities, and against the tax benefit on losses from our VIEs. We intend to maintain a valuation allowance until sufficient positive evidence exists to support its reversal.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nOverview\nWe finance our business with existing cash, cash from operations and the funds available under our Senior Credit Facilities. We had cash and cash equivalents of $18.2 million and $18.5 million as of January 30, 2016 and January 31, 2015, respectively (including amounts held by the VIEs). Cash and cash equivalents held by the VIEs, of which we are the primary beneficiary, and the results of which we have consolidated into our financial statements, were $9.6 million and $10.0 million as of January 30, 2016 and January 31, 2015, respectively (see Note 19 to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report). The assets of the VIEs can only be used by the VIEs. Net working capital as of January 30, 2016 and January 31, 2015 totaled $29.4 million and $43.0 million, respectively (including $6.2 million and $5.1 million, respectively, from our VIEs).\nWe and our subsidiaries, the VIEs, and our affiliates may from time to time seek to retire or purchase our outstanding debt through cash purchases and/or exchanges, in open market purchases, privately negotiated transactions, by tender offer or otherwise. Such repurchases or exchanges, if any, will depend on prevailing market conditions, liquidity requirements, contractual restrictions and other factors. The amounts involved may be material.\nWe believe that cash generated by operations, the remaining funds available under our Senior Credit Facilities and existing cash and cash equivalents will be sufficient to meet working capital requirements, service our debt, and finance capital expenditures over the next twelve months. However, if we face unanticipated cash needs such as the funding of a capital investment, or if our suppliers request one or more letters of credit, our existing cash and cash equivalents and available borrowings may be insufficient. In addition, we cannot assure that our business will generate sufficient cash flow from operations or that future borrowings will be available to us under the Senior Credit Facilities in amounts sufficient to enable us to repay our indebtedness when due, including the Notes, or to fund other liquidity needs. See \u201cItem 1A. Risk Factors-Risks Related to Our Indebtedness and Certain Other Obligations.\u201d We also regularly evaluate market conditions, our liquidity profile, and various financing alternatives, for opportunities to enhance our capital structure. We are continuing to actively pursue various financing alternatives, including refinancing and/or repurchasing our outstanding Notes, divestitures of certain of our assets and operations, as well as other opportunities to improve our capital structure. If opportunities are favorable, we may consummate one or more of these initiatives and the amounts involved may be material.\nCash and Cash Equivalents\nChanges in our cash and cash equivalents for each fiscal year were as follows (in thousands):\n Cash flows provided by (used in) operating activities\nNet cash provided by operating activities during fiscal 2015 was $29.1 million compared to net cash used in operating activities of $21.8 million in the same period last year. The change in cash flows from operating activities during fiscal 2015 was primarily due to gross profit expansion, the timing of purchases of merchandise inventories, and the timing of payment of accounts payable and accrued liabilities.\nNet cash used in operating activities for fiscal 2014 was $21.8 million compared to net cash provided by operating activities of $74.9 million in fiscal 2013. The decrease in cash attributable to changes in assets and liabilities was primarily due to an increase in merchandise inventory and a reduction in accounts payable. These increases were partially offset by reduced prepaid rent. The increase in merchandise inventory was primarily due to earlier receipt of Spring goods compared to fiscal 2013 and investments in Winter products in our Gymboree brand.\nCash flows used in investing activities\nNet cash used in investing activities during fiscal 2015 was $22.6 million compared to $31.9 million in the same period last year. The net change during fiscal 2015 was primarily due to lower capital expenditures, which decreased by $10.6 million to $21.4 million compared to $32.0 million in the same period last year. The decrease was due to fewer store openings and an increase in related party loan receivable of $1.7 million (see Note 17 to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report).\nNet cash used in investing activities during fiscal 2014 was $31.9 million compared to $53.1 million during fiscal 2013 and was primarily due to capital expenditures, which decreased to $32.0 million during fiscal 2014 compared to $52.6 million during fiscal 2013 due to fewer store openings.\nWe estimate capital expenditures for fiscal 2016 will be approximately $30 to $35 million. We expect capital expenditures to be used primarily for our systems infrastructure, lease required remodels of existing stores and, to a lesser extent, new store growth.\nCash flows (used in) provided by financing activities\nNet cash used in financing activities during fiscal 2015 was $5.8 million compared to net cash provided by financing activities of $33.3 million during fiscal 2014. In fiscal 2015, we repurchased Notes with an aggregate principal amount of $58.4 million for $15.3 million in cash through open market transactions (see Note 7 to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report). In addition, we made a $14.0 million of net payments on our ABL Revolving Facility and a $1.7 million payment for deferred financing costs related to the amendment of ABL Revolving Facility, partially offset by gross proceeds of $26.8 million related to the sale of the Company's distribution center in Dixon, California (reduced by $0.9 million payment for deferred financing costs (see Notes 7 and 8 to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report).\nNet cash provided by financing activities during fiscal 2014 was $33.3 million compared to net cash used in financing activities of $16.6 million during fiscal 2013. Net cash provided by financing activities for fiscal 2014 was primarily due to net proceeds of $33.0 million from our ABL Revolving Facility.\nCredit Facilities\nABL Facility\nIn September 2015, we amended the ABL Revolving Facility (the \u201cFirst Amendment\u201d) to extend the maturity date of the ABL revolving commitments from March 2017 to the earlier of (i) September 24, 2020 and (ii) the date that is 60 days before the scheduled final maturity date of any tranche of the Term Loan (which matures in February 2018) or the Notes (which mature in December 2018), unless such indebtedness is cumulatively equal to or less than $25.0 million in the aggregate and a reserve against the borrowing base is imposed equal to the amount of such indebtedness.\nThe ABL Revolving Facility, as amended by the First Amendment, provided financing of up to $225 million in a revolving line of credit. Line of credit availability under the ABL Revolving Facility is subject to a borrowing base consisting of certain assets of the Company, any subsidiary co-borrowers and any subsidiary guarantors that are available to collateralize the borrowings thereunder, and is reduced by the level of outstanding letters of credit. As of January 30, 2016, line of credit borrowings outstanding under the ABL Revolving Facility were $19.0 million and letter of credit utilization was $27.6 million. Undrawn line of credit availability under the ABL Revolving Facility, after being reduced by outstanding borrowings and letter of credit utilization, was $125.5 million as of January 30, 2016. Average line of credit borrowings during fiscal 2015 under the ABL Revolving Facility amounted to $51.9 million. We anticipate utilizing our line of credit under the ABL Revolving Facility throughout the course of fiscal 2016 to support seasonal working capital needs and expect to have borrowings outstanding at year-end.\nLine of credit borrowings under the ABL Revolving Facility bear interest at a rate per annum equal to, at our option, either (a) a base rate determined by reference to the highest of (1) the prime rate of Bank of America, N.A., (2) the federal funds effective rate plus 0.50%, and (3) a LIBOR rate determined by reference to the costs of funds for U.S. dollar deposits for an interest period of one month adjusted for certain additional costs, plus 1.00%, or (b) a LIBOR rate determined by reference to the costs of funds for U.S. dollar deposits for the interest period relevant to such borrowing adjusted for certain additional costs (\u201cAdjusted LIBOR\u201d), in each case plus an applicable margin. As of January 30, 2016, the weighted average interest rate on our line of credit borrowings outstanding under the ABL Revolving Facility was 3.5%. In addition to paying interest on outstanding line of credit borrowings under the ABL Revolving Facility, we are required to pay a commitment fee on unutilized commitments thereunder, which is between 0.250% and 0.375% per annum under the amended ABL Revolving Facility.\nIf at any time the aggregate amount of outstanding loans, unreimbursed letter of credit drawings and undrawn letters of credit under the ABL Revolving Facility exceeds the lesser of (a) the commitment amount and (b) the borrowing base, we will be required to repay outstanding loans and/or cash collateralized letters of credit in an aggregate amount equal to such excess, with no reduction of the commitment amount. The ABL Revolving Facility contains financial and other covenants that, among other things, restrict our ability to incur additional indebtedness and pay dividends. As of January 30, 2016, the ABL Revolving Facility also contained a financial covenant that required the Company to test its consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio when availability under the facility fell below a specified threshold. As of January 30, 2016, we were not required to test compliance with this financial covenant.\nOn April 22, 2016, we entered into a second amendment to the ABL Revolving Facility (the ABL Revolving Facility, as so amended, the \u201cABL Facility\u201d or the \u201cSecond Amendment\u201d). The Second Amendment provides for a senior secured term loan (the \u201cABL Term Loan\u201d) of $50.0 million, subject to a borrowing base, the proceeds of which may be used to finance the acquisition of working capital assets, including the purchase of inventory and equipment, in each case in the ordinary course of business, to finance capital expenditures, to finance permitted acquisitions and for general corporate purposes, including repurchases of the Notes.\nThe Second Amendment provides that the ABL Term Loan will bear interest (computed on the basis of the actual number of days elapsed over a year of 360 days) at a 90-day LIBOR contract rate as determined by the agent for the ABL Term Loan monthly on the first day of each calendar month, plus 10.25% per annum, or, in certain circumstances, at the prime rate, plus 9.25% per annum. The Second Amendment also provides for a new availability covenant, whereby so long as any amount of the ABL Term Loan remains outstanding, the Company and its restricted subsidiaries must maintain, at all times, (i) Combined Availability (or, an amount equal to (a) the ABL Term Loan borrowing base minus the sum of (b) the aggregate outstanding principal amount under the ABL Facility (including the ABL Term Loan, revolving line of credit borrowings and letter of credit utilization)) in excess of the greater of (x) $17.5 million and (y) 10% of the ABL Term Loan borrowing base; and (ii) Availability (or, an amount equal to the lesser of (A) (I) the revolving credit ceiling minus (II) the aggregate principal amount outstanding under the revolving line of credit and letter of credit utilization and (B) (I) the revolving line of credit borrowing base minus (II) the aggregate principal amount outstanding under the revolving line of credit and letter of credit utilization) in excess of the greater of (x) $17.5 million and (y) 10% of the lesser of (A) the applicable revolving line of credit borrowing base and (B) the revolving credit ceiling (which as of the date hereof is $225.0 million). The Second Amendment further provides that the Company's consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio will not be tested as long as the ABL Term Loan remains outstanding. The maturity date for the ABL Term Loan is the same as the maturity date of the ABL revolving commitments discussed above, and all other material affirmative and negative covenants and events of default under the ABL Facility remain substantially unchanged. In addition, the restrictions on amendments to the ABL Facility were amended to provide the agent for the ABL Term Loan and the ABL Term Loan lenders certain consent rights relating to, among other terms and provisions, the borrowing bases, the availability covenant and certain negative covenants.\nTerm Loan\nWe also have an agreement with several lenders for an $820 million senior secured Term Loan, with a maturity date of February 2018. As of January 30, 2016, $769.1 million was outstanding under the Term Loan. The Term Loan allows us to request additional tranches of term loans in an aggregate amount not to exceed $200 million, subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions, provided such amount will be subject to reduction by the amount of any additional commitments incurred under the ABL Revolving Facility. The interest rate for borrowings under the Term Loan is, at the Company's option, a base rate plus an additional marginal rate of 2.5% or the Adjusted LIBOR rate (with a 1.5% floor) plus an additional rate of 3.5%. As of January 30, 2016, the interest rate under our Term Loan was 5%.\nThe Term Loan requires us to make quarterly payments equal to 0.25% of the original $820 million principal amount of the Term Loan made on the closing date plus accrued and unpaid interest thereon, with the balance due in February 2018. The Term Loan also has mandatory and voluntary pre-payment provisions, including a requirement that we prepay the Term Loan with a certain percentage of our annual excess cash flow. We calculated our excess cash flow using fiscal 2015 operating results and concluded we\nare not required to make any excess cash flow payments on the Term Loan during fiscal 2016. Voluntary prepayments and the excess cash flow prepayments made in prior fiscal years were applied toward our remaining quarterly amortization payments payable under the Term Loan through fiscal 2016. Our next quarterly payment payable under the Term Loan is due in the first quarter of fiscal 2017.\nThe Term Loan contains covenants that, among other things, restrict our ability to incur additional indebtedness and pay dividends.\nNotes\nIn fiscal 2010, we issued $400 million aggregate principal amount of 9.125% Notes due in December 2018. Interest on the Notes is payable semi-annually. As of January 30, 2016, the Notes payable balance outstanding was $287.6 million.\nSummary Disclosures about Contractual Obligations and Commercial Commitments\nThe following table reflects a summary of our contractual obligations and commitments as of January 30, 2016:\n\n (1) Other lease-required expenses such as utilities, real estate taxes and common area repairs and maintenance are excluded. Additionally, sublease rental receipts totaling approximately $4.9 million through April 2018 are excluded. See Note 11 to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report for discussion of the Company's operating leases. \n (2) Inventory purchase obligations include outstanding purchase orders for merchandise inventories that are enforceable and legally binding on the Company and that specify all significant terms (including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased), fixed, minimum or variable price provisions, and the approximate timing of the transaction. \n (3) Other purchase obligations include annual commitments of approximately $8.8 million through the second quarter of 2019 under the operating services agreement related to a third party fulfillment center (see Notes 11 and 14 to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report). The table above does not reflect the impact of the subsequent termination of the operating service agreement. On February 25, 2016 (see Note 11 to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report), the Company entered into an agreement to terminate the operating services agreement effective upon exiting from the fulfillment center in Ohio, which is expected to be in May 2016. The Company will continue to pay a monthly minimum fee of approximately $0.7 million until fulfillment of orders ceases on April 30, 2016 and will pay an early termination fee of $8.3 million to the third-party fulfillment center. The Company could continue to pay the monthly minimum fee or a pro-rata amount if fulfillment of orders continues to be processed in the third-party fulfillment center after April 30, 2016 through no fault of the third party fulfillment center. \nAlso included in other purchase obligations are commitments for professional services, information technology and fixtures and equipment.\n (4) Long-term debt as of January 30, 3016 is consists of a $769.1 million Term Loan, an ABL Revolving Facility that provides a revolving line of credit of up to $225 million, and an aggregate principal amount of $287.6 million of our Notes. The table above includes $19.0 million of outstanding revolver borrowings from our ABL Facility. The amounts presented in the table above exclude an original issue discount of $0.7 million (see Note 7 to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report) and $27.6 million of commercial and standby letters of credit related to normal business transactions, which expires in fiscal 2016 (see Note 6 to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report). \nThe table above does not reflect the repurchase of any Notes subsequent to fiscal 2015. See Note 22 to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report.\n (5) Interest payments on long-term debt are estimated based on: (a) the outstanding principal balance of the Term Loan, which was $769.1 million as of January 30, 2016, and also take into consideration scheduled principal payments in fiscal 2017 through 2018, and (b) the outstanding principal balance of $287.6 million on the Notes as of January 30, 2016. The interest rate for borrowings under the Term Loan is, at the Company's option, a base rate plus an additional marginal rate of 2.5% or the Adjusted LIBOR rate (with a 1.5% floor) plus an additional rate of 3.5%. Interest payments for borrowings under the Term Loan, in the table above, are estimated using the Company's January 30, 2016 rate of 5%. Interest payments on the Company's Notes are made semi-annually at a rate of 9.125% of the principal amount outstanding.  The table above does not reflect the repurchase of any Notes subsequent to fiscal 2015. See Note 22 to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report.\n (6) Sale-leaseback financing liability and interest payments pertain to the sale of the distribution center in Dixon, California, which we leaseback from the purchaser for a period of 15 years (see Note 8 to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report). Under the terms of the lease agreement, the Company is required to maintain an unconditional irrevocable letter of credit for a period up to 10 years. Due to the Company's continuing involvement through the irrevocable letter of credit, the Company has accounted for the sale-leaseback as a financing liability.  As of January 30, 2016, we had unrecognized tax benefits of $3.7 million, accrued interest of $0.9 million, and accrued penalties of $0.5 million. These amounts have been excluded from the contractual obligations table because a reasonably reliable estimate of the timing of future tax settlements cannot be determined.\nThe expected timing of payment of the obligations discussed above is estimated based on current information. The timing of payments and actual amounts paid may differ depending on the timing of receipt of services, or, for some obligations, changes to agreed-upon amounts.\nEarnings before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization (\u201cEBITDA\u201d) (Non-GAAP Measure)\nIn the table below, we present Adjusted EBITDA (which is defined as net loss attributable to The Gymboree Corporation before interest expense, interest income, income taxes, and depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) adjusted for the other items described below), which is considered a non-GAAP financial measure. We present Adjusted EBITDA in this annual report because we consider it an important supplemental measure of performance used by management and we believe it is frequently used by securities analysts, investors and other interested parties in the evaluation of companies in the retail industry. Adjusted EBITDA is calculated in substantially the same manner as \u201cEBITDA\u201d under the indenture governing the Notes and \u201cConsolidated EBITDA\u201d under the agreement governing our Senior Credit Facilities. We believe the inclusion of supplementary adjustments applied to EBITDA in presenting Adjusted EBITDA is appropriate to provide additional information to investors about certain non-cash items and to provide additional information with respect to our ability to meet our future debt service and to comply with various covenants in documents governing our indebtedness. However, Adjusted EBITDA is not a presentation made in accordance with GAAP, and our computation of Adjusted EBITDA may vary from others in the retail industry. Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered an alternative to operating income or net income (loss), as a measure of operating performance or cash flow, or as a measure of liquidity. Adjusted EBITDA has important limitations as an analytical tool, and should not be considered in isolation, or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under GAAP. For example, Adjusted EBITDA:\n \u2022 does not reflect our cash expenditures, or future requirements, for capital expenditures or contractual commitments; \n \u2022 does not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, our working capital needs; \n \u2022 does not reflect the significant interest expense, or the cash requirements necessary to service interest or principal payments, on our debt; \n \u2022 excludes income tax payments that represent a reduction in cash available to us; and \n \u2022 does not reflect the impact of earnings or charges resulting from matters we consider not to be indicative of ongoing operations. \nThe following table provides a reconciliation of net loss attributable to The Gymboree Corporation to Adjusted EBITDA for the fiscal years indicated (in thousands):\n\nCritical Accounting Policies\nCritical accounting policies are those accounting policies and estimates that management believes are important to the portrayal of the Company's financial condition and results of operations and require management's most difficult, subjective or complex judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effects of matters that are inherently uncertain. Management has discussed the development and selection of the critical accounting policies and estimates applicable to the Company as of the date of the completion of the audit for the fiscal year ended January 30, 2016 with the Company's Audit Committee.\nGoodwill\nOn November 23, 2010, we completed a merger (the \u201cMerger\u201d) with Giraffe Acquisition Corporation in accordance with an Agreement and Plan of Merger with Giraffe Holding, Inc. (\u201cParent\u201d) and Acquisition Sub, a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent. In connection with the Merger, we allocated goodwill to our reporting units, which we concluded were the same as our operating segments: Gymboree Retail (including an online store), Gymboree Outlet, Janie and Jack (including an online store), Crazy 8 (including an online store), Gymboree Play & Music and International Retail Franchise. We allocated goodwill to the reporting units by calculating the fair value of each reporting unit and deriving the implied fair value of each reporting unit's goodwill as of the Merger. As of January 30, 2016, we had goodwill of $372.7 million related to the Merger.\nGoodwill is tested for impairment on an annual basis at the end of our tenth fiscal period (fiscal November) and at an interim date if indicators of impairment exist. Events that could result in an interim period impairment review include significant changes in the business climate, declines in our operating results, or an expectation that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. We assess potential impairment by considering present economic conditions as well as future expectations.\nGoodwill is tested by performing a two-step goodwill impairment test. The first step of the two-step goodwill impairment test is to compare the fair value of the reporting unit to its carrying amount, including goodwill. If the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value, the second step of the two-step goodwill impairment test is required to measure the goodwill impairment loss. The second step includes valuing all the tangible and intangible assets and liabilities of the reporting unit as if the reporting unit had been acquired in a business combination. Then, the implied fair value of the reporting unit's goodwill is compared to the carrying amount of that goodwill. If the carrying amount of the reporting unit's goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of the goodwill, we recognize an impairment loss in an amount equal to the excess, not to exceed the carrying amount.\nCalculating the fair value of a reporting unit and the implied fair value of reporting unit goodwill requires significant judgment. The use of different assumptions, estimates or judgments in either step of the goodwill impairment testing process, such as the estimated future cash flows of reporting units, the discount rate used to discount such cash flows, or the estimated fair value of the reporting units' tangible and intangible assets and liabilities, could significantly increase or decrease the estimated fair value of a reporting unit or its net assets.\nWe performed our annual goodwill impairment test during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015 (fiscal November) and determined that there was no goodwill impairment for any of our reporting units. Based on the results of the first step of the Company's impairment test performed, we determined that the fair value of our reporting units each exceeded their carrying values by more than 30%.\nThe annual goodwill impairment analysis for the reporting units was based on our projection of revenues, gross margin, operating costs and cash flows considering historical and estimated future results, general economic and future market conditions, as well as the impact of planned business and operational strategies. We based our projections on assumptions we believed to be reasonable at the time, but such assumptions are subject to inherent uncertainty. Actual results may differ from those estimates. The valuations employed typical methodologies to measure fair value and considered market factors and reporting unit specific fact patterns. We primarily used an income approach and market approach to value these reporting units. Assumptions used in the market approach include valuation multiples based on an analysis of multiples for comparable public companies and similar transactions. Finally, specific weights were applied to the components of each approach to estimate the total fair value. These weights are based on estimates and are developed based on the specific characteristics, risks and uncertainties of each reporting unit.\nThe fair value of the Gymboree Retail, Gymboree Outlet, Janie and Jack, Crazy 8, Play & Music, and International Retail Franchise reporting units were $581.0 million, $140.0 million, $274.0 million, $143.0 million, $64.0 million, and $75.0 million, respectively, which exceeded the carrying values of $436.6 million, $106.6 million, $77.2 million, $69.9 million, $40.3 million, and $26.7 million, respectively.\nIndefinite-Lived Intangible Assets\nIndefinite-lived intangible assets primarily represent trade names for each of our brands. We do not amortize intangible assets with indefinite useful lives. We test indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment on annual basis at the end of our tenth\nfiscal period (fiscal November), and more frequently if indicators of potential impairment exist and indicate that it is more likely than not that the asset is impaired. Impairment of indefinite-lived intangible assets is measured by comparing the carrying amount of the asset to the discounted future cash flows that the asset is expected to generate using the relief from royalty method. If we determine that an individual asset is impaired, the amount of any impairment is measured as the difference between the carrying value and the fair value of the impaired asset. Calculating the fair value of indefinite-lived intangible assets requires significant judgment. The use of different assumptions, estimates or judgments, such as the estimated future cash flows, royalty rates or the discount rate used to discount such cash flows, could significantly increase or decrease the estimated fair value of our indefinite-lived intangible assets.\nWe performed our annual impairment test of indefinite-lived intangible assets (trade names) during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015 and concluded that these assets were not impaired. In connection with our annual impairment test, we determined that the estimated fair values of Gymboree Retail, Gymboree Outlet, Janie and Jack, Crazy 8 and Play & Music trade names were $229.5 million, $40.5 million, $61.6 million, $19.8 million and $46.8 million, respectively, which exceeded the carrying values of $202.2 million, $38.3 million, $42.2 million, $18.5 million and $36.2 million, respectively.\nStore Asset Impairment\nStore assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable. If the undiscounted future cash flows from the asset group are less than the carrying value, a loss is recognized equal to the difference between the carrying value of the asset group and its fair value. The fair value of the asset group is estimated based on discounted future cash flows using a discount rate commensurate with the risk. The asset group is determined at the store level, which is the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are available. Decisions to close a store or facility can also result in accelerated depreciation over the revised useful life. For locations to be closed that are under long-term leases, we record a charge for lease buyout expense or the difference between our rent and the rate at which we expect to be able to sublease the properties and related costs, as appropriate. Most closures occur upon the lease expiration. The estimate of future cash flows is based on historical experience and typically third-party advice or market data. These estimates can be affected by factors such as future store profitability, real estate demand and economic conditions that can be difficult to predict.\nDuring fiscal 2015, 2014, and 2013, we recorded impairment charges of $1.3 million, $6.0 million, and $7.6 million, respectively, related to assets of under-performing stores.\nIncome Taxes\nWe recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax basis of assets and liabilities. We establish valuation allowances when it is more likely than not that all or a portion of a deferred tax asset will not be realized. Changes in valuation allowances from period to period are included in the tax provision in the period of change. We consider all available positive and negative evidence in evaluating whether a valuation allowance is required, including prior earnings history, actual earnings over the previous 12 quarters on a cumulative basis, carryback and carryforward periods, and tax planning strategies that could potentially enhance the likelihood of realization of a deferred tax asset.\nAs of January 30, 2016 and January 31, 2015, the total valuation allowance against certain deferred tax assets was $63.2 million and $58.6 million, respectively. A valuation allowance has not been established for certain foreign and state jurisdictions. Changes in valuation allowances from period to period are included in the tax provision in the period of change.\nWe are subject to periodic audits by the Internal Revenue Service and other taxing authorities. These audits may challenge certain of our tax positions such as the timing and amount of deductions and allocation of taxable income to the various tax jurisdictions. As of January 30, 2016 and January 31, 2015, we had unrecognized tax benefits of $6.4 million and $5.6 million, respectively. Determining income tax expense for tax contingencies requires management to make assumptions that are subject to factors such as proposed assessments by tax authorities, changes in facts and circumstances, issuance of new regulations, and resolution of tax audits. Actual results could materially differ from these estimates and could significantly affect the effective tax rate and cash flows in future years.\nMerchandise Inventories\nMerchandise inventories are recorded at the lower of cost or market (\u201cLCM\u201d), with cost determined on a weighted-average basis. We review our inventory levels to identify slow-moving merchandise and broken assortments (items no longer in stock in a sufficient range of sizes) and record an adjustment when the future estimated selling price is less than cost. We take a physical count of inventories in all stores once a year and perform cycle counts throughout the year in our Dixon distribution center. We also perform an annual physical count of inventories at our third-party fulfillment center in Ohio. We record an inventory shrink adjustment based upon physical counts and also provide for estimated shrink adjustments for the period between the last physical inventory count and each balance sheet date. Our inventory shrink estimate can be affected by changes in merchandise mix and changes in actual shrink trends. Our LCM estimate can be affected by changes in consumer demand and the promotional environment.", "item_7_tables": "Table 25: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>
