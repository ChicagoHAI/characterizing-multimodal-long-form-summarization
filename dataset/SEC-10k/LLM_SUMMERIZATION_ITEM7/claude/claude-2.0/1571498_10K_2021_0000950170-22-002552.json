Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nOur management's discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, which have been prepared by us in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, or GAAP, and with Regulation S-X promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. This discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with these consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Some of the information contained in this discussion and analysis or set forth elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including information with respect to our plans and strategy for our business, includes forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. As a result of many factors, including those factors set forth in Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, our actual results could differ materially from the results described in or implied by the forward-looking statements contained in the following discussion and analysis.\nNote on the COVID-19 Pandemic\nThe ongoing COVID-19 pandemic continues to have widespread, evolving, and unpredictable impacts on global economies, supply chains, financial markets, business practices and societies. The complex challenges created by the COVID-19 pandemic have had an adverse impact on our business, operations, and financial performance, and as such we continue to take steps to respond to these challenges and adjust our commercial strategy and operating plans accordingly.\nWe believe that the COVID-19 pandemic has had an adverse impact on sales of TAZVERIK since the June 2020 FDA approval of TAZVERIK for follicular lymphoma, or FL. Our commercial and medical affairs field teams continue to use virtual formats as well as in-person interactions, where possible, to allow us to serve the needs of healthcare providers, patients and other stakeholders, However, access to prescribers remains restrictive, and we expect these challenges to continue through the first half of 2022.\nIn response, we have taken steps to adjust our commercial strategy and continue to further refine our commercial strategy, recognizing that some of the changes brought about by the COVID-19 pandemic, such as ongoing restrictions to access prescribers by traditional sales personnel, will likely persist after the resolution of the pandemic. We are evolving our commercial strategies and deployment of resources to address these changes in market dynamics as we seek to increase awareness of TAZVERIK in ES and FL.\nAlthough the initiation, enrollment and completion of our ongoing and planned clinical trials have not been meaningfully disrupted, we have experienced some delays in clinical trial startup activities due to what we believe to be mostly related to COVID-19 related capacity constraints and resulting delays in the packaging and labeling of clinical drug supply at a third-party manufacturer. We are aware of the impact that COVID-19 continues to have on other clinical trials in our industry and there is a risk of material impact on the conduct of our clinical trials as well. We are continuing to work with our clinical trial sites as we seek to ensure study continuity, enable medical monitoring, facilitate study procedures and maintain clinical data and records, including the use of local laboratories for testing, home delivery of study drug and remote data and records monitoring.\nTo date, the COVID-19 pandemic has not had a material impact on our commercial supply chain, and we currently have a consistent supply of tazemetostat and TAZVERIK that we believe will cover our ongoing clinical development as well as the ongoing commercialization for ES and FL. From time to time, however, we have experienced some occasional delays in connection with our clinical supply, including delays related to packaging and labeling. As a proactive measure, we have taken certain steps to try to reduce the risk to our supply chain, such as advancing orders for long-lead items in anticipation of potential future delays or shortages. Because the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic could materially adversely impact our suppliers and result in delays or disruptions in our current or future supply chain, we are continuing to monitor and manage our supply chain accordingly.\nWe are implementing a multi-stage return to office plan, and in October 2021 we opened our facilities to all employees who expressed interest in participating in a return-to-office pilot program. In the meantime, many of our employees continue to work in a remote operating model. Our laboratory scientists who engage in bench research activities now have full access to our laboratories. We are using our pilot program to further evaluate this hybrid model and will use that evaluation to formulate how we will move forward. Ultimately, our return to office plan will be based primarily on guidance from federal, state and local government authorities, and we expect that some form of a hybrid model will continue to exist for us in the future.\nWe are closely monitoring the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and related developments on our business, operations and financial performance. We plan to continue to assess the potential duration, scope and severity of the COVID-19 pandemic and its impacts on our business, operations and financial performance, and to continue to work closely with our third-party vendors, collaborators and other parties in order to seek to continue to advance our efforts with respect to the commercialization of TAZVERIK and to continue to advance the development of EZM0414 and our pipeline, while making the health and safety of our employees and their families, healthcare providers, patients and communities a top priority. Due to the evolving and uncertain global impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, however, we cannot precisely determine or quantify the impact that this pandemic has had on our business, operations and financial performance to date or the impact that this pandemic will have in 2022 and beyond.\nPlease refer to our risk factors set forth in Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2021 for further discussion of risks related to the COVID-19 pandemic.\nOperating Expense Reductions\nIn response to the challenges we have continued to face since we commenced the launch of TAZVERIK in FL in June 2020, in August 2021, we determined to implement changes to our commercial strategy and organization in an effort to accelerate commercial adoption of TAZVERIK in appropriate patients while also pursuing our research and broader corporate objectives.\nOn August 9, 2021, we announced a cross-functional reduction of our 2021 budgeted headcount by approximately 20%, which included approximately 11% of our then-current workforce under the cost reduction plan. Affected employees were provided separation benefits, including severance payments along with temporary healthcare coverage assistance. The severance and termination-related costs were approximately $2.0 million. We recorded these costs in the third quarter of 2021 and expect that payments of these costs will be made through August 2022.\nIn addition to the organizational changes and cross-functional headcount reduction announced in August 2021, on March 1, 2022, we announced a further reduction of our operating expenses, including a cross-functional workforce reduction of approximately 12% of our current employees. Additionally, we announced a pipeline reprioritization. Given the breadth of our current tazemetostat clinical development program, we have discontinued enrollment in our Phase 2 study of tazemetostat in combination with rituximab with FL in the third line or later treatment settings (SYMPHONY-2, EZH-1401), as well as in our Phase 1/1b basket study evaluating tazemetostat combinations in patients with solid tumors (EZH-1301) due to evolving market dynamics and a continued focus on optimizing our investments and eliminating potentially overlapping studies.\nAs part of these March 2022 headcount reductions and our pipeline reprioritization, we are implementing further changes to our commercial strategy, to our medical affairs and clinical development teams and to our broader organization. We are focused on accelerating commercial adoption of TAZVERIK in appropriate patients and on implementing a broader operational cost reduction plan that will reduce our headcount across different areas of the organization and re-prioritize our investment of company resources in important clinical trials and programs, including our SYMPHONY-1 (EZH-302), CELLO-1 (EZH-1101), EZH-1501 and SET-101 trials.\nWe expect that these actions will allow us to keep the company in a financial position that will enable us to continue to achieve important near-term milestones and execute on our long-term strategy. As part of the March 2022 workforce reduction, affected employees will be offered separation benefits, including severance payments along with temporary healthcare coverage assistance. We estimate that the severance and termination-related costs will be approximately $2.8 - 3.2 million and expect to record these charges in the first quarter of 2022. We expect that payments of these costs will be made through the end of the fourth quarter of 2022.\nWe plan to continue to implement our broader operational expense reduction effort, and to monitor and seek opportunities to further reduce our operating expenses.\nOverview\nWe are a commercial-stage biopharmaceutical company that is committed to rewriting treatment for people with cancer through the discovery, development, and commercialization of novel epigenetic medicines. We aspire to change the standard of care for patients and physicians by developing targeted medicines with fundamentally new mechanisms of action directed at specific causes of hematological malignancies and solid tumors.\nWe have one approved product, TAZVERIK (tazemetostat), which was granted accelerated approval by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, in 2020 for epithelioid sarcoma, or ES, and FL. Our focus is on maximizing our effectiveness as a commercial organization to achieve adoption of TAZVERIK among as many appropriate patients as possible, including in earlier treatment lines and in combination regimens with the data to support this expanded use; building on TAZVERIK's pipeline-in-a-drug potential; and expanding our pipeline and evolving oncology portfolio, including with SET-101, our first-in-human Phase 1/1b trial of EZM0414, our novel, first-in-class, oral SETD2 inhibitor. We are leveraging our drug discovery platform and expertise as a leader in epigenetics, as well as our team's deep experience across clinical development and commercialization to execute on our strategy.\nIn January 2020, the FDA granted accelerated approval of TAZVERIK (tazemetostat), an oral, first in class, selective small molecule inhibitor of the EZH2 histone methyltransferase, or HMT, for the treatment of adult and pediatric patients aged 16 years and older with metastatic or locally advanced ES not eligible for complete resection. This approval was based on overall response rate and duration of response data shown in the ES cohort of our Phase 2 trial in patients with INI1-negative tumors. We continue to make TAZVERIK available to eligible patients and their physicians in the United States.\nAs part of the accelerated approval for ES, continued approval for this indication is contingent upon verification and description of clinical benefit in a confirmatory trial. To provide this confirmatory evidence to support a full approval of TAZVERIK for this indication, we are conducting a single, randomized, controlled Phase 1b/3 confirmatory trial in the United States (EZH-301) assessing tazemetostat in combination with doxorubicin compared with doxorubicin plus placebo as a front-line treatment for ES. The trial is expected to enroll approximately 152 patients. We have completed the planned enrollment in the Phase 1b safety run-in portion of the trial and the Phase 3 efficacy portion of the trial is open for accrual. We reported safety and preliminary activity data from the patients in the safety run-in portion of the EZH-301 trial at the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) Annual Meeting in June 2021.\nIn June 2020, the FDA approved a supplemental New Drug Application, or sNDA, for TAZVERIK for adult patients with relapsed or refractory (R/R) FL whose tumors are positive for an EZH2 mutation as detected by an FDA-approved test and who have received at least two prior systemic therapies, and adult patients with relapsed or refractory FL who have no satisfactory alternative treatment options. These indications were approved under accelerated approval with a priority review, based on overall response rate and duration of response data shown in the FL cohorts of our Phase 2 clinical trial in patients with EZH2 mutations and wild-type EZH2. We continue to make TAZVERIK available to eligible patients and their physicians in the United States.\nAs part of the accelerated approval for FL, continued approval for these R/R FL indications is contingent upon verification and description of clinical benefit in a confirmatory trial. To provide this confirmatory evidence to support a full approval of TAZVERIK for these indications, we are conducting a single global, randomized, adaptive Phase 1b/3 confirmatory trial (EZH-302, SYMPHONY-1) assessing the combination of tazemetostat with R2\u201d (lenalidomide and rituximab), an approved chemotherapy-free treatment regimen, compared with R2 plus placebo for R/R FL patients in the second-line or later treatment setting. We plan to leverage the confirmatory trial and also conduct post-marketing commitments to expand the TAZVERIK label into the second-line treatment setting.\nIn December 2021 we presented updated safety and activity data from the Phase 1b safety run-in portion of this confirmatory trial at the 2021 American Society of Hematology (ASH) Annual Meeting. We continue to follow the 40 patients in the Phase 1b safety run-in portion of the trial, and we expect to present follow-up data from the safety run-in portion of the trial at a medical conference later in 2022.\nWe expect that the Phase 3 portion of the SYMPHONY-1 trial will be a global, randomized and adaptive confirmatory trial in 500 patients. Based on the Phase 1b safety run-in results, in December 2021 we submitted a protocol amendment to the FDA with 800 mg twice-daily as the recommended tazemetostat dose (RP3D) for the Phase 3 portion of the trial. After completing the 30-day voluntary waiting period following submission of the protocol amendment for 800 mg RP3D without any objection from the FDA, and as we continue to conduct the Phase 1b safety run-in portion of the trial, we have accelerated global start-up activities and are activating as many study sites as possible, globally, for the Phase 3 portion of the trial. The primary endpoint for the Phase 3 portion of the trial will be based on progression free survival as determined by investigator. Based on discussions with the FDA, this portion of the trial will include two interim analyses, the first of which is for futility only and the second of which will be conducted for futility, and if 65% of progression free survival events have occurred, the trial will also include an efficacy evaluation. In July 2021 China's Center for Drug Evaluation, or CDE, approved the Investigational New Drug Application, or IND, we filed in China for SYMPHONY-1. We are currently screening\npatients in the Phase 3 portion of this trial and we expect to enroll the first patient in the Phase 3 portion of this trial in the first quarter of 2022.\nThrough our planned development efforts, our intention is to eventually make TAZVERIK available in all lines of treatment for patients with FL. In collaboration with The Lymphoma Study Association, or LYSA, and based on clinical activity observed with tazemetostat in combination with R-CHOP (rituximab, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine and prednisolone) as a front-line treatment for patients with high risk diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, or DLBCL, LYSA is conducting a Phase 1b/2 clinical trial to evaluate this combination as a front-line treatment for high-risk patients with FL and DLBCL. Patient enrollment in the Phase 2 portion of this trial is now nearly complete with 111 patients out of a target of approximately 122 patients in DLBCL and 61 patients out of a target of approximately 62 patients in FL enrolled as of February 23, 2022. We expect that interim results from the Phase 2 portion of this trial will be presented at a medical conference in the second half of 2022. We are also finalizing plans for investigator-sponsored studies to evaluate tazemetostat in combination with venetoclax or BTK inhibitors for the treatment of patients with FL in the third-line or later treatment settings.\nWe are also developing tazemetostat for the treatment of a broad range of other cancer types in multiple treatment settings. Tazemetostat has shown meaningful clinical activity as an investigational monotherapy in multiple cancer indications and has been generally well-tolerated across clinical trials to date. We believe tazemetostat is a pipeline in a product\u201d opportunity and plan to explore its potential utility in additional indications and combinations.\nThere are four areas where we see the greatest potential for tazemetostat, all of which are based on a strong scientific hypothesis and are for patients suffering from diseases that would benefit from a new effective and safe treatment option, including:\n\u2022Lymphomas and B-cell malignancies, such as DLBCL, mantle cell lymphoma, or MCL, multiple myeloma and others;\n\u2022Molecularly defined solid tumors, such as chordoma, melanoma, mesothelioma, and tumors harboring an EZH2 or SWI/SNF alteration;\n\u2022PARPi-resistant tumors, such as castration-resistant prostate cancer, small cell lung cancer, and others; and\n\u2022Immuno-oncology sensitive tumors, such as small cell lung cancer, prostate cancer and others.\nAs part of these broader tazemetostat development efforts, we are conducting a global, multi-center, open-label randomized Phase 1b/2 trial (EZH-1101, CELLO-1). The Phase 2 efficacy portion of the CELLO-1 trial, which is evaluating tazemetostat plus enzalutamide compared to enzalutamide monotherapy in patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer, or mCRPC, is approximately 75% enrolled toward a target of 80 patients and we expect to complete enrollment in the Phase 2 portion of the trial in 2022. We plan to provide updated data from the safety run-in portion of the trial as well as interim data from the Phase 2 portion of the trial in the second half of 2022.\nWe own the global development and commercialization rights to tazemetostat outside of Japan and greater China. Eisai Co. Ltd, or Eisai, holds the rights to develop and commercialize tazemetostat in Japan, and Hutchison China MediTech Investment Limited, or HutchMed, holds certain rights to develop and commercialize tazemetostat in greater China.\nTAZVERIK is available to eligible patients in the United States via a specialty distribution network. Through this specialty distribution network, we sell TAZVERIK principally to a limited number of specialty pharmacies, which dispense the product directly to patients, and specialty distributors, which in turn sell the product to hospital pharmacies and community practice pharmacies for the treatment of patients. To commercialize TAZVERIK for the approved ES and FL indications in the United States, we have built a focused field presence and marketing capabilities.\nOn August 7, 2021, we entered into a strategic collaboration pursuant to a license agreement with HutchMed through which we granted a license to HutchMed for the co-exclusive (with us) development and exclusive commercialization of tazemetostat, either as monotherapy or as a part of combinations with other therapies, including HutchMed proprietary compounds, agreed by us and HutchMed for the treatment of ES, FL and DLBCL in humans, and any additional indications agreed to by us and HutchMed in mainland China, Taiwan, Hong Kong and Macau, or the HutchMed Territory.\nFor other geographies outside the United States, we are evaluating the most efficient path to obtain marketing approval, commercialize and distribute TAZVERIK to reach patients, including pursuing potential strategic collaborations. Based on comparators and the regulatory landscape, we have decided not to pursue marketing approval of tazemetostat as monotherapy from the European Medicines Agency, or EMA at this time.\nBeyond tazemetostat, we are utilizing our drug discovery platform to progress preclinical efforts and discover and identify additional product candidates to expand our pipeline of inhibitors against several classes of chromatin modifying proteins, or CMPs, including HMTs, histone acetyltransferases, or HATs, and helicases.\nOur most advanced product candidate, EZM0414, is a novel first-in-class oral inhibitor of the SETD2 HMT.\nSETD2 is an HMT that plays multiple important roles in oncogenesis. Based on the potential of SETD2 inhibition demonstrated in multiple preclinical settings, including multiple myeloma, and in particular high risk t(4;14) multiple myeloma and in other B-cell malignancies such as DLBCL, as well as in combination with existing and emerging therapies including tazemetostat, we submitted an IND for EZM0414 to the FDA in July 2021. We received study may proceed\u201d from the FDA with respect to our IND for EZM0414 in July 2021. In October 2021, EZM0414 was granted Fast Track designation by the FDA in adult patients with relapsed or refractory DLBCL and in January 2022 we received orphan drug designation from the FDA for EZM0414 for the treatment of multiple myeloma. In the fourth quarter of 2021, we initiated a Phase 1/1b trial (SET-101) intended to evaluate the safety and optimize the dose and schedule of EZM0414 in R/R multiple myeloma and DLBCL patients. The Phase 1 portion of our SET-101 trial is a 3 + 3 dose escalation design and includes six planned dose levels ranging from 100 mg to 900 mg once daily. Once we have optimized the dose, we then expect to expand the trial to two patient cohorts in multiple myeloma: t(4;14) multiple myeloma and non t(4;14) multiple myeloma. Based on dose optimization data from the trial, we may add a third patient cohort in DLBCL. We are screening patients with one site open for the Phase 1 dose escalation portion of the SET-101 trial, which we expect will enroll between 30-36 patients. We plan to provide updates as the trial reaches key enrollment milestones along with preliminary data from the trial in 2022.\nTo date we have entered into various strategic collaborations, including with Eisai, HutchMed, Roche and other third parties. As one of several key aspects of our strategy, we plan to continue to leverage our existing collaborations and to seek to identify new potential strategic collaborations to further support and grow our business in and outside of the United States.\nThrough December 31, 2021, in addition to revenues from product sales, we have raised an aggregate of $1,568.3 million to fund our operations. This includes $268.8 of non-equity funding through our collaboration agreements, $368.1 million of funding, consisting of $150.0 million in equity funding received through agreements with RPI Finance Trust, or RPI, and $218.1 million in debt financing received through a loan agreement with BioPharma Credit Investments V (Master) LP and BPCR Limited Partnership (as transferee of BioPharma Credit Investments V (Master) LP's interest as a lender), or the Lenders, $855.4 million from the sale of common stock and series A convertible preferred stock in our public and at-the-market offerings and $76.0 million from the sale of redeemable convertible preferred stock in private financings prior to our initial public offering in May 2013.\nAs of December 31, 2021, we had $176.8 million in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities. In January 2022, the Company raised approximately $79.5 million in net proceeds (after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering costs) from the sale of 56,666,667 shares of its common stock in a public offering at a price of $1.50 per share.\nWe commenced active operations in early 2008, and since inception, have incurred significant operating losses. Our net loss was $251.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. As of December 31, 2021, our accumulated deficit totaled $1,239.8 million. Notwithstanding our sales of TAZVERIK, we expect to continue to incur significant expenses and operating losses over the next several years. Our net losses may fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter and year to year. We expect our expenses to increase in connection with our ongoing activities, particularly as we expect to incur significant commercialization expenses related to product manufacturing, marketing, sales and distribution. In addition, we expect our expenses to increase as we fund our tazemetostat development program; make any milestone and royalty payments provided for and achieved under the amended and restated collaboration and license agreement with Eisai; pay interest and principal associated with our amended and restated loan agreement with BioPharma Credit Investments V (Master) LP, BPCR Limited Partnership and BioPharma Credit PLC, or the Amended and Restated Loan Agreement; and continue research and development and initiate clinical trials of, and seek regulatory approval for, any future product candidates.\nFunding Agreements with BioPharma Credit Investments V (Master) LP, BPCR Limited Partnership, BioPharma Credit PLC and RPI Finance Trust\nWe executed a purchase agreement with RPI on November 4, 2019, or the RPI Purchase Agreement. Pursuant to the RPI Purchase Agreement, we sold to RPI 6,666,667 shares of our common stock and a warrant to purchase up to 2,500,000 shares of our common stock at an exercise price of $20.00 per share, or the Common Stock Warrant. We also sold our rights to receive royalties from Eisai with respect to net sales by Eisai of tazemetostat products in Japan, or the Japan Royalty, pursuant to the amended and restated collaboration and license agreement between us and Eisai, dated as of March 12, 2015, or the Eisai License Agreement. In consideration for the sale of shares of our common stock, the Common Stock Warrant and the Japan Royalty, RPI paid us $100.0 million upon the closing of the RPI Purchase Agreement in November 2019. In addition, RPI agreed, in connection with RPI's acquisition from Eisai of the right to receive royalties from us under the Eisai License Agreement, to reduce our royalty obligation by low single digits upon the achievement of specified annual net sales levels. We also had the option to sell to RPI $50.0 million of shares of common stock for an 18-month period beginning November 4, 2019, or the Put Option. On February 11, 2020, we sold 2,500,000 shares of common stock to RPI for an aggregate of $50.0 million in proceeds at a sale price of $20.00 per share of common stock pursuant to the Put Option.\nOn November 4, 2019, we also entered into a Loan Agreement with BioPharma Credit PLC, or the Collateral Agent, and the Lenders, providing for up to $70.0 million in secured term loans to be advanced in up to three tranches, or the Loan Agreement. We borrowed $70.0 million in the aggregate under the three tranches pursuant to the Loan Agreement.\nOn November 3, 2020, we, the Collateral Agent and the Lenders amended and restated the Loan Agreement, or, as amended and restated, the Amended and Restated Loan Agreement. The Amended and Restated Loan Agreement provides for, among other things, an additional secured term loan facility of $150.0 million, or the Tranche D Loan. On November 18, 2020, we borrowed the Tranche D Loan.\nThe obligations under the Amended and Restated Loan Agreement remain secured by a first priority security interest that was granted at the time of the Loan Agreement in and a lien on substantially all of our assets, subject to certain exceptions.\nThe Amended and Restated Loan Agreement contains certain customary representations and warranties, affirmative and negative covenants and events of default applicable to us and our subsidiaries. If an event of default occurs and is continuing, the Collateral Agent under the Amended and Restated Loan Agreement may, among other things, accelerate the loans and foreclose on the collateral. See Note 13, Long-Term Debt, of the notes to our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a description of the key terms of the Amended and Restated Loan Agreement.\nCollaborations\nRefer to Item 1, Business--Our Collaborations and Note 11, Collaborations, of the notes to our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a description of the key terms of our arrangements with Eisai Co. Ltd, or Eisai, Hutchison China MediTech Investment Limited, or HutchMed, and Roche Sequencing Solutions, Inc., or Roche Sequencing. On December 16, 2021, we received a notice of termination of our collaboration and license agreement with Glaxo Group Limited, effective March 16, 2022.\nResults of Operations\nFor a discussion related to the results of operations for 2020 compared to 2019, refer to Part II, Item 7, \"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Results of Operations\" in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2020 filed with the SEC on February 23, 2021.\nRevenues\nThe following is a comparison of total revenues for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020:\nTable 8: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2021\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2020\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(In millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Product revenues, net\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>30.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>11.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>19.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Collaboration and other revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Total revenues\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>37.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>15.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>21.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nProduct Revenues, net\nNet product revenues represent U.S. sales from our sole commercial product, TAZVERIK, which was first approved by the FDA on January 23, 2020, less allowances and accruals. During the years ended December 31, 2021, and 2020 net product revenues were $30.9 million and $11.5 million, respectively. The $19.4 million increase reflects the timing of approval of TAZVERIK for ES in January 2020 and the approval of TAZVERIK for FL in June 2020. The increase also reflects the inclusion of $7.4 million in product revenue during the year ended December 31, 2021 related to the sale of commercial product by one of our customers to a third-party pharmaceutical company for use in its clinical trials. Sales allowances and accruals consisted of patient financial assistance, distribution fees, discounts, and chargebacks.\nCollaboration and Other Revenue\nOur collaboration and other revenue during the periods included amounts recognized from deferred revenue related to upfront payments for licenses or options to obtain licenses in the future, research and development services revenue earned, milestone payments earned under collaboration and license agreements with our collaboration partners and revenue from the sale of tazemetostat active pharmaceutical ingredient (API) and drug product to our licensees and collaborators.\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, we recognized $6.5 million and $4.3 million, respectively, in collaboration and other revenue. In 2021 we recognized $6.5 million in collaboration and other revenue in connection with our waiver of our exclusive right to the supply of tazemetostat drug substance from Eisai's manufacturer, the manufacture and supply of tazemetostat, and technical support services under our supply agreement with Eisai. In 2020 we recognized $3.8 million of collaboration and other revenue under our collaboration agreement with Celgene related to the recognition of the remaining deferred revenue related to the agreement, which was recognized as revenue as a result of the termination of the collaboration agreement with Celgene. We recognized $0.5 million in collaboration and other revenue under our collaboration agreement with Boehringer Ingelheim during the year ended December 31, 2020 related to amendments to extend the research period under the collaboration agreement under which Boehringer Ingelheim funded $0.5 million of additional\nresearch activities. In December 2020, we received written notice from Boehringer Ingelheim to terminate the collaboration agreement, effective January 31, 2021.\nCost of Revenue\nThe following is a comparison of cost of revenue for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020:\nTable 9: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2021\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2020\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(In millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Cost of product revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>9.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>5.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>4.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Cost of other revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Total cost of revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>10.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>5.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>5.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe cost of revenue consists of costs related to our product revenue and other revenue for the sales of TAZVERIK as well as tazemetostat drug product and drug substance. These costs include materials, labor, manufacturing overhead, amortization of milestone payments, and royalties payable on net sales of TAZVERIK and sales of tazemetostat drug product. Costs related to the sale of TAZVERIK are included in cost of product revenue while cost related to the sale of tazemetostat drug product and drug substance are included in cost of other revenue.\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, the cost of product revenue was $9.7 million and $5.1 million, respectively, and consisted of $0.9 million and $0.4 million, respectively, in costs associated with manufacturing TAZVERIK, $4.2 million and $3.0 million, respectively, in amortization expense related to the two $25.0 million milestone payments under our agreement with Eisai upon regulatory approval of TAZVERIK for ES and upon regulatory approval of TAZVERIK for FL, and $4.6 million and $1.7 million, respectively, in worldwide royalties due under the Eisai License Agreement on net sales of TAZVERIK in the year ended December 31, 2021. Cost of other revenue during the year ended December 31, 2021 consisted of $0.8 million of costs related to sales of tazemetostat drug product to Eisai. All product costs incurred prior to FDA approval of TAZVERIK in January 2020 were expensed as research and development expenses. We expect our cost of product revenues (excluding amortization of intangible assets) to continue to be positively impacted during 2022, as we sell through certain inventory that was expensed prior to FDA approval of TAZVERIK in January 2020.\nResearch and Development\nResearch and development expenses consist of expenses incurred in performing research and development activities, including clinical trials and related clinical manufacturing expenses, fees paid to external providers of research and development services, third-party clinical research organizations, or CROs, compensation and benefits for full-time research and development employees, facilities expenses, overhead expenses, and other outside expenses. Most of our research and development costs are external costs, which we track on a program-by-program basis. Our internal research and development costs are primarily compensation expenses for our full-time research and development employees, including stock-based compensation expense.\nIn our early-stage research, we identify and prioritize novel CMPs that are implicated in cancer, and seek to develop potent and selective small molecule inhibitors of these targets. During this phase of research, our external costs primarily relate to lead discovery, biology, drug metabolism and pharmacokinetics and chemistry services from a multinational network of third-party providers of research and development services. As our product candidates\nprogress into preclinical and clinical development, external costs are driven by clinical trial costs, manufacturing expenses, and third-party research and development expenses.\nIn circumstances where our collaboration and license agreements provide for equally co-funded global development under joint risk sharing collaborations, and where we are the study sponsor, amounts received for co-funding are recorded as a reduction to research and development expense.\nThe following is a comparison of research and development expenses for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 :\nTable 10: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2021\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2020\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(In millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Research and development\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>131.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>110.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>20.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>18.1\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2021, total research and development expenses increased by $20.1 million compared to the year ended December 31, 2020, primarily due to increases in clinical trial expenses and discovery research activities related to tazemetostat in indications other than the approved indications as well as our SETD2 inhibitor EZM0414 program. Additionally, severance and termination-related costs totaling $0.4 million were recorded as research and development expenses in 2021 related to the August 2021 cost reduction plan. Increases in research and development expenses were partially offset by decreases in costs associated with the build-out of our regulatory and late-stage development groups.\nThe following table illustrates the components of our research and development expenses:\nTable 11: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Product Program\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2021\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2020\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(In millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>External research and development expenses:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Tazemetostat and related EZH2 programs\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>54.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>42.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>12.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>28.8\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> SETD2 inhibitor EZM0414 program\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>100.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Discovery and preclinical stage product programs, collectively\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>19.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>17.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Unallocated personnel and other expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>55.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>51.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Total research and development expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>131.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>110.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>20.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>18.1\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nExternal research and development expenses include external manufacturing costs related to the acquisition of active pharmaceutical ingredient and manufacturing of clinical drug supply, ongoing clinical trial costs, discovery and preclinical research in support of the tazemetostat program and expenses associated with our SETD2 inhibitor EZM0414 program.\nExternal research and development expenses for tazemetostat and related EZH2 programs increased by $12.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to the year ended December 31, 2020. The increase in external tazemetostat and related EZH2 programs research and development expenses in the year ended December 31, 2021 relates to increases in clinical trial expenses and discovery research activities related to tazemetostat in other indications associated with increased clinical trial activity, which were offset by decreases in costs associated with the build-out of our regulatory and late-stage development groups that we conducted in 2020.\nExternal research and development expenses for our EZM0414 SETD2 inhibitor program increased $2.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to the 2020. We designated the program as a clinical development program in the third quarter of 2021. Prior to the designation of the program as a clinical development program, we allocated costs related to the EZM0414 program to external research and development expenses for discovery and preclinical stage product programs.\nExternal research and development expenses for discovery and preclinical stage product programs increased by $1.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to the year ended December 31, 2020, was primarily\nrelated to increased spending for discovery research activities and development activities related to our preclinical programs, partially offset by reduced preclinical costs in connection with our EZM0414 SETD2 inhibitor program as a result of the designation of the EZM0414 SETD2 inhibitor program as a clinical development program in the third quarter of 2021.\nUnallocated personnel and other expenses are comprised of compensation expenses for our full-time research and development employees and other general research and development expenses. Unallocated personnel and other expenses for the year ended December 31, 2021 increased $4.4 million compared to the year ended December 31, 2020. The increase is a result of increases in facilities and equipment related expenses and in unallocated personnel costs, offset by an increase in the allocation of expenses to projects.\nWe expect that research and development expenses will decrease in 2022, as we continue to implement our operating expense reductions and prioritize our investment of company resources in important clinical trials and programs, including our SYMPHONY-1 (EZH-302) and CELLO-1 (EZH-1101), EZH-1501 and SET-101 trials.\nSelling, General and Administrative\nSelling, general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and related benefits, including stock-based compensation, related to our executive, finance, intellectual property, business development and support functions. Other selling, general and administrative expenses include allocated facility-related costs not otherwise included in research and development expenses, travel expenses and professional fees for auditing, tax and legal services, including intellectual property and general legal services.\nThe following is a comparison of selling, general and administrative expenses for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 :\nTable 12: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2021\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2020\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(In millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Selling, general and administrative\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>134.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>125.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>8.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nFor the year ended December 31, 2021, our selling, general and administrative expenses increased $8.8 million compared to the year ended December 31, 2020, primarily due to increased commercialization activities, including the build-out of our sales force and commercial infrastructure to support the commercial launch of TAZVERIK in the approved ES and FL indications, and increased personnel related expenses. Additionally, severance and termination-related costs totaling $1.6 million were recorded as selling, general and administrative expenses in 2021 related to the August 2021 cost reduction plan.\nWe expect that selling, general and administrative expenses will decrease in 2022 as we implement changes to our commercial strategy and organization in an effort to accelerate commercial adoption of TAZVERIK in appropriate patients as well as an operational cost reduction across general and administrative functions as part of our prioritization of our investment of company resources in important clinical trials and programs.\nOther (Expense) Income, Net\nThe following is a comparison of other (expense) income, net for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020:\nTable 13: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2021\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2020\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(In millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Other income, net\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Interest income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>0.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(2.7\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(93.1\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Interest expense\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(22.5\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(7.6\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(14.9\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>196.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Other expense, net\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(0.1\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(0.1\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Change in fair value of warrants to purchase common stock\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>100.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Non-cash interest expense related to sale of future royalties\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1.8\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1.4\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(0.4\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>28.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Other (expense) income, net\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(13.1\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(6.2\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(6.9\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>111.3\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOther (expense) income, net consists of interest income earned on our cash equivalents and marketable securities, net of imputed interest expense paid under our capital lease obligation. The increase in other expense for the year ended December 31, 2021 is principally due to an increase in interest expense of $15.0 million incurred in connection with our long-term debt obligations under our Amended and Restated Loan Agreement which increased to a principal balance of $220.0 million in the fourth quarter of 2020, a decrease in net interest income of $2.6 million due to a combination of lower cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities combined with lower rates of return, and an increase in non-cash interest expense related to the sale of future royalties of $0.4 million. These increases in other expense were offset by income related to the changes in fair value of warrant liability of $11.1 million due to a decrease in our stock price.\nIncome Tax Benefit\nWe evaluated the expected recoverability of our net deferred tax assets as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, and determined that there was insufficient positive evidence to support the recoverability of these net deferred tax assets, concluding it is more likely than not that our net deferred tax assets would not be realized in the future; therefore, the Company provided a full valuation allowance against its net deferred tax asset balance as of December 31, 2021 and 2020.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nFor a discussion related to our cash flows for 2020 compared to 2019, refer to Part II, Item 7, \"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Liquidity and Capital Resources\" in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2020 filed with the SEC on February 23, 2021\nThrough December 31, 2021, in addition to revenues from product sales, we have raised an aggregate of $1,568.3 million to fund our operations. This includes $268.8 million in non-equity funding through our collaboration agreements, $368.1 million of funding, consisting of $150.0 million in equity funding received through agreements with RPI Finance Trust, or RPI, and $218.1 million in debt financing received through a loan agreement with BioPharma Credit Investments V (Master) LP and BPCR Limited Partnership (as transferee of BioPharma Credit Investments V (Master) LP's interest as a lender), or the Lenders, $855.4 million from the sale of common stock and series A convertible preferred stock in our public offerings and at-the-market offerings and $76.0 million was from the sale of redeemable convertible preferred stock in private financings prior to our initial public offering in May 2013. As of December 31, 2021, we had $176.8 million in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities.\nOn May 6, 2021, we entered into an Open Market Sale AgreementSM, or ATM Sale Agreement, with Jefferies LLC, or Jefferies, to sell, from time to time, shares of our common stock having an aggregate offering price of up to $200,000,000 through an at the market offering\u201d as defined in Rule 415 under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, under which Jefferies would act as sales agent, which we refer to as the ATM Offering. The shares that may be sold under the ATM Sale Agreement, if any, are issued and sold pursuant to our shelf registration statement on Form S-3 that was declared effective by the Securities and Exchange Commission on May 13, 2021. Through December 31, 2021, we have sold a total of 3,840,977 shares under the ATM Offering, resulting in aggregate net proceeds to us of approximately $16.0 million after deducting issuance costs of $0.5 million.\nIn addition to our existing cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, we are eligible to earn milestone payments under our collaboration agreement with HutchMed. Our ability to earn these payments and the timing of earning these payments is dependent upon the outcome of research and development activities and is uncertain at this time.\nIn January 2022, we raised approximately $79.5 million in net proceeds (after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering costs, but excluding any expenses and other costs reimbursed by the underwriters) from the sale of 56,666,667 shares of our common stock in a public offering at a price of $1.50 per share.\nFunding Requirements\nOur primary uses of capital are clinical trial costs, third-party research and development services, expenses related to commercialization, debt service obligations, compensation and related expenses, laboratory and related supplies, legal and other regulatory expenses and general overhead costs.\nBecause the continued approval of TAZVERIK in the approved indications is contingent upon verification and description of clinical benefit in confirmatory trials, and because we are developing tazemetostat for other indications, we cannot estimate the actual amounts necessary to successfully complete the development and commercialization of TAZVERIK for the approved indications or the indications that we are exploring or that we may plan to explore. Because EZM0414 is an early clinical product candidate and any future product candidates are in various stages of preclinical development with uncertain outcomes, we also cannot estimate the actual amounts necessary to successfully complete the development and commercialization of EZM0414 or future product candidates. Because of these uncertainties, we also cannot estimate whether, or when, we may achieve profitability. Until such time, if ever, as we can generate substantial product revenues, we expect to finance our cash needs through a combination of equity or debt financings and collaboration arrangements. Except for any obligations of our collaborators to make license, milestone or royalty payments under our agreements with them, we do not have any committed external sources of liquidity. To the extent that we raise additional capital through the future sale of equity or debt, the ownership interest of our stockholders may be diluted, and the terms of these securities may include liquidation or other preferences that adversely affect the rights of our existing common stockholders. Debt\nfinancing and preferred equity financing, if available, may involve agreements that include covenants limiting or restricting our ability to take specific actions, such as incurring additional debt, making capital expenditures or declaring dividends. If we raise additional funds through collaboration arrangements in the future, we may have to relinquish valuable rights to our technologies, future revenue streams or product candidates or grant licenses on terms that may not be favorable to us. If we are unable to raise any additional funds that may be needed through equity or debt financings when needed, we may be required to delay, limit, reduce or terminate our product development or future commercialization efforts or grant rights to develop and market product candidates that we would otherwise prefer to develop and market ourselves.\nOutlook\nBased on our current operating plan, we expect that our existing cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities as of December 31, 2021, together with the $79.5 million in net proceeds raised from the common stock offering in January 2022 and cash we expect to generate from product sales, will be sufficient to fund our planned operating expenses and capital expenditure requirements and pay our debt service obligations as they become due into the third quarter of 2023, without giving effect to any potential milestone payments we may receive under our collaboration agreements. We have based this estimate on assumptions that may prove to be wrong, such as the revenue that we expect to generate from the sale of our products, or as to our clinical development costs, particularly as the process of testing drug candidates in clinical trials is costly and the timing of progress in these trials is uncertain. As a result, we could use our capital resources sooner than we expect.\nCash Flows\nThe following is a summary of cash flows for the years ended for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020:\nTable 14: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2021\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2020\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(In millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Net cash (used in) operating activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(226.9\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(206.3\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(20.6\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Net cash provided by (used in) investing activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>125.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(14.6\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>140.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(959.6\n</td> <td>%)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Net cash provided by financing activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>31.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>249.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(218.2\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(87.4\n</td> <td>%)\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nNet Cash Used in Operating Activities\nNet cash used in operating activities was $226.9 million during the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to $206.3 million during the year ended December 31, 2020. The increase in net cash used in operating activities of $20.6 million primarily relates to our net loss of $251.1 million and the $11.1 million change in fair value of warrants, partially offset by changes in working capital of $0.2 million, net depreciation and amortization of $5.2 million, non-cash stock-based compensation of $26.8 million, and non-cash interest expense associated with the sale of future royalties of $1.8 million.\nNet Cash Provided by (Used in) Investing Activities\nNet cash provided by investing activities during the year ended December 31, 2021 reflects maturities of available-for-sale securities of $388.6 million, offset by $262.6 million of purchases of available-for-sale securities, and $0.5 million of purchases of property and equipment.\nNet cash used in investing activities during the year ended December 31, 2020 reflects $276.4 million of purchases of available for sale securities, a $25.0 million milestone payment under the Eisai collaboration agreement upon regulatory approval of tazemetostat for ES, a $25.0 million milestone payment under the Eisai collaboration agreement upon regulatory approval of tazemetostat for FL, and $0.9 million of purchases of property and equipment, offset by maturities and sales of available for sale securities of $312.7 million.\nNet Cash Provided by Financing Activities\nNet cash provided by financing activities of $31.5 million during the year ended December 31, 2021 primarily reflects net proceeds from the sale of common stock under the ATM Sale Agreement of $16.0 million, the purchases of shares under our employee stock purchase plan of $1.9 million, stock option exercises of $0.9 million, and $13.1 million from the issuance of the HutchMed Warrant, partially offset by the payment of offering costs of $0.3 million related to the ATM program.\nNet cash provided by financing activities of $249.7 million during the year ended December 31, 2020 primarily reflects cash received from the sale of common stock of $50.0 million in connection with our exercise of our Put Option to sell shares of our common stock to Royalty Pharma, net cash received during the period from Tranche B Tranche C and Tranche D Loan borrowings totaling $195.0 million under the Amended and Restated Loan Agreement, stock option exercises of $6.7 million, and the purchases of shares under our employee stock purchase plan of $1.3 million, partially offset by payments of debt issuance costs of $3.1 million and offering costs of $0.1 million.\nContractual Obligations and Contingent Liabilities\nOn August 11, 2021, we entered into a fifth amendment to the Technology Square Lease, the Fifth Amendment, with ARE-TECH Square, LLC. Under the Fifth Amendment, we extended the term of the Technology Square Lease through November 30, 2024. Under the Fifth Amendment, we will continue to pay the current monthly base rent amount contemplated by the Technology Square Lease through November 30, 2022, with an increase commencing on December 1, 2022 and adjusting the monthly base rent amount to approximately $377,000 and an increase commencing on December 1, 2023 and adjusting the monthly base rent amount to approximately $388,000 through November 30, 2024. Under the current terms of the Technology Square Lease, we do not have any further right to extend the term beyond November 30, 2024.\nWe remain committed to fund $1.0 million of development costs payable to Roche Molecular, or Roche, upon certain development and regulatory milestones, under our amended companion diagnostic agreement with Roche.\nWe have incurred secured indebtedness of $220.0 million under our amended and restated loan agreement with BioPharma Credit Investments V (Master) LP, BPCR Limited Partnership and BioPharma Credit PLC. The interest rate for the loans under the agreement are determined by reference to a Eurodollar rate plus 7.75% above such Eurodollar rate subject to a 2.00% floor. Interest is paid quarterly with principal repayments beginning in the first quarter of 2024. Our long-term debt obligation is more fully described in Note 13, Long-Term Debt to the financial statements in Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nThis description of our contractual obligations does not include potential future milestones or royalties that we may be required to make under license and collaboration agreements due to the uncertainty of events requiring payment under these agreements.\nWe enter into contracts in the normal course of business with clinical research organizations for clinical and preclinical research studies, external manufacturers for product for use in our clinical trials, and other research supplies and other services as part of our operations. These contracts generally provide for termination on notice, and therefore are cancelable contracts and not included in contractual commitments.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Use of Estimates\nOur management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the balance sheets and the reported amounts of collaboration revenue, inventory and expenses during the reporting periods. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances at the time such estimates are made. Actual results and outcomes may differ materially from our estimates, judgments and assumptions. We\nperiodically review our estimates in light of changes in circumstances, facts and experience. The effects of material revisions in estimates are reflected in the consolidated financial statements prospectively from the date of the change in estimate.\nWe define our critical accounting policies as those accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America that require us to make subjective estimates and judgments about matters that are uncertain and are likely to have a material impact on our financial condition and results of operations as well as the specific manner in which we apply those principles. Management has determined that our most critical accounting policies are those relating to revenue recognition, research and development expenses, including our accounting for clinical trial expense and accruals, inventory and going concern. As our clinical development plan for tazemetostat and EZM0414 progresses, we expect research and development expenses and, in particular, our accounting for clinical trial accruals to be an increasingly important critical accounting policy.\nRevenue Recognition - Product Revenue\nWe recognize revenue when our customer obtains control of promised goods or services, in an amount that reflects the consideration which we expect to receive in exchange for those goods or services. To determine revenue recognition, we perform the following five steps: (i) identify the contract(s) with a customer; (ii) identify the performance obligations in the contract; (iii) determine the transaction price; (iv) allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract; and (v) recognize revenue when (or as) we satisfy a performance obligation. We only apply the five-step model to contracts when it is probable that we will collect the consideration we are entitled to in exchange for the goods or services we transfer to the customer.\nWe sell TAZVERIK in the United States principally to a limited number of specialty pharmacies, which dispense the product directly to patients, and specialty distributors, which in turn sell the product to hospital pharmacies and community practice pharmacies (collectively, healthcare providers) for the treatment of patients. The specialty pharmacies and specialty distributors are referred to as our customers.\nRevenue is recognized by us when the customer obtains control of the product, which occurs at a point in time, typically when the product is received by our customers. We provide a right of return to our customers for unopened product for a limited time before and after its expiration date, which lapses upon shipment to a patient. Healthcare providers to whom specialty distributors sell TAZVERIK hold limited inventory that is designated for patients, and we are able to monitor inventory levels in the distribution channel, thereby limiting the risk of return.\nReserves for Variable Consideration\nRevenues from product sales are recorded at the net sales price (transaction price), which includes estimates of variable consideration for which reserves are established and which result from discounts, returns, chargebacks, rebates, co-pay assistance and other allowances that are offered within contracts between us and our customers, health care providers, payors and other indirect customers relating to our product sales. These reserves are based on the amounts earned or to be claimed on the related sales and are classified as reductions of accounts receivable (if the amount is payable to the customer) or a current liability (if the amount is payable to a party other than a customer). Where appropriate, these estimates take into consideration a range of possible outcomes that are probability-weighted for relevant factors such as our historical experience, current contractual and statutory requirements, specific known market events and trends, industry data and forecasted customer buying and payment patterns. Overall, these reserves reflect our best estimates of the amount of consideration to which we are entitled based on the terms of the contract. The amount of variable consideration that is included in the transaction price may be constrained, and is included in the net sales price only to the extent that it is probable that a significant reversal in the amount of the cumulative revenue recognized will not occur in a future period. Actual amounts of consideration ultimately received may differ from our estimates. If actual results in the future vary from our estimates, we will adjust these estimates, which would affect net product revenue and earnings in the period such variances become known.\nTrade Discounts and Allowances: We generally provide customers with discounts that include incentive fees that are explicitly stated in our contracts and are recorded as a reduction of revenue in the period the related product revenue is recognized. In addition, we receive sales order management, data and distribution services from certain customers. To the extent the services received are distinct from our sale of products to the customer, these payments are\nclassified in selling, general and administrative expenses in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss.\nProduct Returns: Consistent with industry practice, we generally offer customers a limited right of return based on the product's expiration date for product that has been purchased from us, which lapses upon shipment to a patient. We estimate the amount of our product sales that may be returned by our customers and record this estimate as a reduction of revenue in the period the related product revenue is recognized. We currently estimate product return liabilities using available industry data and our own historical sales information, including our visibility into the inventory remaining in the distribution channel.\nProvider Chargebacks and Discounts: Chargebacks for fees and discounts to providers represent the estimated obligations resulting from contractual commitments to sell products to qualified healthcare providers at prices lower than the list prices charged to customers who directly purchase the product from us. Customers charge us for the difference between what they pay for the product and the ultimate selling price to the qualified healthcare providers. These reserves are established in the same period that the related revenue is recognized, resulting in a reduction of product revenue and accounts receivable. Chargeback amounts are generally determined at the time of resale to the qualified healthcare provider by customers, and we generally issue credits for such amounts within a few weeks of the customer's notification to us of the resale. Reserves for chargebacks consist of credits that we expect to issue for units that remain in the distribution channel inventories at each reporting period end that we expect will be sold to qualified healthcare providers, and chargebacks that customers have claimed but for which we have not yet issued a credit.\nGovernment Rebates: We are subject to discount obligations under state Medicaid programs and Medicare. We estimate our Medicaid and Medicare rebates based upon a range of possible outcomes that are probability-weighted for the estimated payor mix. These reserves are recorded in the same period the related revenue is recognized, resulting in a reduction of product revenue and the establishment of a current liability that is included in accrued expenses on the consolidated balance sheet. For Medicare, we also estimate the number of patients in the prescription drug coverage gap for whom we will owe an additional liability under the Medicare Part D program. Our liability for these rebates consists of invoices received for claims from prior quarters that have not been paid or for which an invoice has not yet been received, estimates of claims for the current quarter, and estimated future claims that will be made for product that has been recognized as revenue, but remains in the distribution channel inventories at period end.\nPayor Rebates: We may contract with various private payor organizations, primarily insurance companies and pharmacy benefit managers, for the payment of rebates with respect to utilization of our products. We estimate these rebates and record such estimates in the same period the related revenue is recognized, resulting in a reduction of product revenue and the establishment of a current liability.\nOther Incentives/Patient Assistance Programs: We also offer voluntary patient assistance programs such as co-pay assistance. Co-pay assistance programs are intended to provide financial assistance to qualified commercially insured patients with prescription drug co-payments required by payors. The calculation of the accrual for co-pay assistance is based on an estimate of claims and the cost per claim that we expect to receive associated with product that has been recognized as revenue, but remains in in the distribution channel inventories at period end.\nRevenue Recognition - Collaboration Revenue\nEffective January 1, 2018, we adopted ASC, Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, or ASC 606, using the modified retrospective transition method. Under this method, results for reporting periods beginning after January 1, 2018 are presented pursuant to ASC 606, while prior period amounts are not adjusted and continue to be reported in accordance with ASC 605. This standard applies to all contracts with customers, except for contracts that are within the scope of other standards, such as leases, insurance, collaboration arrangements and financial instruments. Under ASC 606, an entity recognizes revenue when its customer obtains control of promised goods or services, in an amount that reflects the consideration which the entity expects to receive in exchange for those goods or services. To determine revenue recognition for arrangements that an entity determines are within the scope of ASC 606, the entity performs the following five steps: (i) identify the contract(s) with a customer; (ii) identify the\nperformance obligations in the contract; (iii) determine the transaction price; (iv) allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract; and (v) recognize revenue when (or as) the entity satisfies a performance obligation. We only apply the five-step model to contracts when it is probable that the entity will collect the consideration it is entitled to in exchange for the goods or services it transfers to the customer. At contract inception, once the contract is determined to be within the scope of ASC 606, we assess the goods or services promised within each contract and determines those that are performance obligations, and assesses whether each promised good or service is distinct. We then recognize as revenue the amount of the transaction price that is allocated to the respective performance obligation when (or as) the performance obligation is satisfied.\nWe have entered into collaboration and license agreements, which are within the scope of ASC 606, to discover, develop, manufacture and commercialize product candidates. The terms of these agreements typically contain multiple promises or obligations, which may include: (i) licenses, or options to obtain licenses, to compounds directed to specific targets (referred to as exclusive licenses\u201d) and (ii) research and development activities to be performed on behalf of the collaboration partner related to the licensed targets. Payments to us under these agreements may include non-refundable license fees, customer option exercise fees, payments for research activities, reimbursement of certain costs, payments based upon the achievement of certain milestones and royalties on any resulting net product sales.\nWe first evaluate license and/or collaboration arrangements to determine whether the arrangement (or part of the arrangement) represents a collaborative arrangement pursuant to ASC Topic 808, Collaborative Arrangements, based on the risks and rewards and activities of the parties pursuant to the contractual arrangement. We account for collaborative arrangements (or elements within the contract that are deemed part of a collaborative arrangement), which represent a collaborative relationship and not a customer relationship, outside the scope of ASC 606. Our collaborations primarily represent revenue arrangements. For the arrangements or arrangement components that are subject to revenue accounting guidance, in determining the appropriate amount of revenue to be recognized as it fulfills its obligations under each of its agreements, we perform the following steps: (i) identification of the promised goods or services in the contract; (ii) determination of whether the promised goods or services are performance obligations including whether they are distinct in the context of the contract; (iii) measurement of the transaction price, including the constraint on variable consideration; (iv) allocation of the transaction price to the performance obligations; and (v) recognition of revenue when (or as) we satisfy each performance obligation. As part of the accounting for these arrangements, we must use significant judgment to determine: a) the number of performance obligations based on the determination under step (ii) above and whether those performance obligations are distinct from other performance obligations in the contract; b) the transaction price under step (iii) above; and c) the stand-alone selling price for each performance obligation identified in the contract for the allocation of transaction price in step (iv) above. We use judgment to determine whether milestones or other variable consideration, except for sales-based royalties, should be included in the transaction price as described further below. The transaction price is allocated to each performance obligation on a relative stand-alone selling price basis, for which we recognize revenue as or when the performance obligations under the contract are satisfied. In determining the stand-alone selling price of a license to our proprietary technology or a material right provided by a customer option, we consider market conditions as well as entity-specific factors, including those factors contemplated in negotiating the agreements as well as internally developed estimates that include assumptions related to the market opportunity, estimated development costs, probability of success and the time needed to commercialize a product candidate pursuant to the license. In validating its estimated stand-alone selling price, we evaluate whether changes in the key assumptions used to determine its estimated stand-alone selling price will have a significant effect on the allocation of arrangement consideration between performance obligations.\nAmounts received prior to revenue recognition are recorded as deferred revenue. Amounts expected to be recognized as revenue within the 12 months following the balance sheet date are classified as current portion of deferred revenue in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. Amounts not expected to be recognized as revenue within the 12 months following the balance sheet date are classified as deferred revenue, net of current portion. Amounts recognized as revenue, but not yet received or invoiced are generally recognized as contract assets.\nExclusive Licenses - If the license to our intellectual property is determined to be distinct from the other promises or performance obligations identified in the arrangement, which generally include research and development services, we recognize revenue from non-refundable, upfront fees allocated to the license when the license is transferred to\nthe customer and the customer is able to use and benefit from the license. In assessing whether a license is distinct from the other promises, we consider relevant facts and circumstances of each arrangement, including the research and development capabilities of the collaboration partner and the availability of the associated expertise in the general marketplace. In addition, we consider whether the collaboration partner can benefit from the license for its intended purpose without the receipt of the remaining promises, whether the value of the license is dependent on the unsatisfied promises, whether there are other vendors that could provide the remaining promises, and whether it is separately identifiable from the remaining promises. For licenses that are combined with other promises, we utilize judgment to assess the nature of the combined performance obligation to determine whether the combined performance obligation is satisfied over time or at a point in time and, if over time, the appropriate method of measuring progress for purposes of recognizing revenue. We evaluate the measure of progress each reporting period and, if necessary, adjusts the measure of performance and related revenue recognition. The measure of progress, and thereby periods over which revenue should be recognized, are subject to estimates by management and may change over the course of the research and development and licensing agreement.\nResearch and Development Services - The promises under our collaboration and license agreements generally include research and development services to be performed by us on behalf of the collaboration partner. For performance obligations that include research and development services, we generally recognize revenue allocated to such performance obligations based on an appropriate measure of progress. We utilize judgment to determine the appropriate method of measuring progress for purposes of recognizing revenue, which is generally an input measure such as costs incurred. We evaluate the measure of progress each reporting period as described under Exclusive Licenses above. Reimbursements from the partner that are the result of a collaborative relationship with the partner, instead of a customer relationship, such as co-development activities, are recorded as a reduction to research and development expense.\nCustomer Options - Our arrangements may provide a collaborator with the right to select a target for licensing either at the inception of the arrangement or within an initial pre-defined selection period, which may, in certain cases, include the right of the collaborator to extend the selection period. Under these agreements, fees may be due to us (i) at the inception of the arrangement as an upfront fee or payment, (ii) upon the exercise of an option to acquire a license or (iii) upon extending the selection period as an extension fee or payment. If an arrangement is determined to contain customer options that allow the customer to acquire additional goods or services, the goods and services underlying the customer options are not considered to be performance obligations at the outset of the arrangement, as they are contingent upon option exercise. We evaluate the customer options for material rights, or options to acquire additional goods or services for free or at a discount. If the customer options are determined to represent a material right, the material right is recognized as a separate performance obligation at the inception of the arrangement. We allocate the transaction price to material rights based on the relative stand-alone selling price, which is determined based on the identified discount and the probability that the customer will exercise the option. Amounts allocated to a material right are not recognized as revenue until, at the earliest, the option is exercised or expires.\nMilestone Payments - At the inception of each arrangement that includes development milestone payments, we evaluate whether the milestones are considered probable of being achieved and estimates the amount to be included in the transaction price using the most likely amount method. If it is probable that a significant revenue reversal would not occur, the associated milestone value is included in the transaction price. Milestone payments that are not within our control or the licensee's control, such as regulatory approvals, are not considered probable of being achieved until those approvals are received. We evaluate factors such as the scientific, clinical, regulatory, commercial, and other risks that must be overcome to achieve the particular milestone in making this assessment. There is considerable judgment involved in determining whether it is probable that a significant revenue reversal would not occur. At the end of each subsequent reporting period, we reevaluate the probability of achievement of all milestones subject to constraint and, if necessary, adjusts its estimate of the overall transaction price. Any such adjustments are recorded on a cumulative catch-up basis, which would affect revenues and earnings in the period of adjustment. If a milestone or other variable consideration relates specifically to our efforts to satisfy a single performance obligation or to a specific outcome from satisfying the performance obligation, we generally allocate the milestone amount entirely to that performance obligation once it is probable that a significant revenue reversal would not occur.\nRoyalties - For arrangements that include sales-based royalties, including milestone payments based on a level of sales, and the license is deemed to be the predominant item to which the royalties relate, we recognize revenue at the\nlater of (i) when the related sales occur or (ii) when the performance obligation to which some or all of the royalty has been allocated has been satisfied (or partially satisfied). To date, we have not recognized any royalty revenue resulting from any of our licensing arrangements.\nFor a complete discussion of accounting for collaboration revenues, see Note 11, Collaborations, in the accompanying Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 15. of Part IV of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nAccrued Research and Development Expenses\nAs part of the process of preparing our financial statements, we are required to estimate our accrued expenses as of each balance sheet date. This process involves reviewing open contracts and purchase orders, communicating with our personnel to identify services that have been performed on our behalf and estimating the level of service performed and the associated cost incurred for the service when we have not yet been invoiced or otherwise notified of the actual cost. The majority of our service providers invoice us monthly in arrears for services performed or when contractual milestones are met. We make estimates of our accrued expenses as of each balance sheet date in our financial statements based on facts and circumstances known to us at that time. We periodically confirm the accuracy of our estimates with the service providers and make adjustments if necessary. Examples of estimated accrued research and development expenses include fees paid to:\n\u2022contract research organizations in connection with clinical trials;\n\u2022investigative sites in connection with clinical trials;\n\u2022vendors in connection with non-clinical development activities; and\n\u2022vendors related to product manufacturing, development and distribution of clinical supplies.\nWe generally accrue expenses related to research and development activities based on the services received and efforts expended pursuant to contracts with multiple contract research organizations that conduct and manage clinical trials on our behalf as well as other vendors that provide research and development services. The financial terms of these agreements are subject to negotiation, vary from contract to contract and may result in uneven payment flows. There may be instances in which payments made to our vendors will exceed the level of services provided and result in a prepayment of the expense. Payments under some of these contracts depend on factors such as the successful enrollment of subjects and the completion of clinical trial milestones. In accruing service fees, we estimate the time period over which services will be performed and the level of effort to be expended in each period. If the actual timing of the performance of services or the level of effort varies from our estimate, we would adjust the accrual or prepaid accordingly.\nAlthough we do not expect our estimates to be materially different from amounts actually incurred, if our estimates of the status and timing of services performed differ from the actual status and timing of services performed we may report amounts that are too high or too low in any particular period. To date, there have been no material differences from our estimates to the amount actually incurred.\nInventory\nWe outsource the manufacturing of TAZVERIK and use contract manufacturers to produce the raw and intermediate materials used in the production of TAZVERIK as well as the finished product. We currently have one supplier qualified for each step in the manufacturing process and are in the process of qualifying additional suppliers.\nInventory is composed of raw materials, intermediate materials, which are classified as work-in-process, and finished goods, which are goods that are available for sale. We state inventory at the lower of cost or net realizable value with the cost based on the first-in, first-out method. If we identify excess, obsolete or unsalable items, we write down our inventory to its net realizable value in the period in which the impairment is identified. These adjustments are recorded based upon various factors related to the product, including the level of product manufactured by us, the level of product in the distribution channel, current and projected demand, the expected\nshelf-life of the product and firm inventory purchase commitments. Shipping and handling costs incurred for inventory purchases are included in inventory costs and costs incurred for product shipments are recorded as incurred in cost of product revenue.\nPrior to receiving our first approval from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, on January 23, 2020, we expensed all costs incurred related to the manufacture of TAZVERIK as research and development expense because of the inherent risks associated with the development of a product candidate, the uncertainty about the regulatory approval process and the lack of history for us of regulatory approval of drug candidates.\nGoing Concern\nAt each reporting period, we evaluate whether there are conditions or events that raise substantial doubt about the Company's ability to continue as a going concern within one year after the date that the financial statements are issued. The Company is required to make certain additional disclosures if it concludes substantial doubt exists about the Company's ability to continue as a going concern within one year after the date that the financial statements are issued and such doubt is not alleviated by the Company's plans or when its plans alleviate substantial doubt about the Company's ability to continue as a going concern. The Company's evaluation entails analyzing prospective operating budgets and forecasts for expectations of the Company's cash needs, and comparing those needs to its available cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities.\nThe analysis of the Company's ability to continue as a going concern includes consideration of the Company's current cash needs, including its research and development plans, commercialization activities associated with the continued commercialization of TAZVERIK in the ES and FL indications, its existing debt service obligations, and anticipated cost savings from its operational cost reduction plans, including ongoing efforts to eliminate costs not related to the Company's strategic focus. The analysis includes forecasted product revenues from sales of TAZVERIK. Such estimates of future sales contain significant judgment as TAZVERIK was first launched in the first half of 2020 and there is little history with which to base such estimates. In addition, the Company's ongoing efforts to eliminate costs not related to the Company's strategic focus contains uncertainties as to whether the Company can attain such benefits.\nBased on its analysis, the Company concluded that its available cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities as of December 31, 2021 combined with the $79.5 million raised in January 2022 will be sufficient to fund current planned operations and capital expenditure requirements and pay its debt service obligations as they become due into the third quarter of 2023, which is at least 12 months from the filing date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K with the SEC. As a result, the Company concluded that it did not identify conditions or events that raise substantial doubt about the Company's ability to continue as a going concern within one year from the date these financial statements were issued. The Company's current operating plan is based on assumptions that may prove to be wrong, and the Company could use its capital resources sooner than it expects, in which case the Company would evaluate further reductions in its expenses or obtaining additional financing sooner than it otherwise would, which additional financing may not be available or may only be available on terms that are not acceptable to the Company.\nRecently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements\nFor detailed information regarding recently issued accounting pronouncements and the expected impact on our consolidated financial statements, see Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies-Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements, in the accompanying Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 15. of Part IV of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.", "item_7_truncated": "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nOur management's discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, which have been prepared by us in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, or GAAP, and with Regulation S-X promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. This discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with these consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Some of the information contained in this discussion and analysis or set forth elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including information with respect to our plans and strategy for our business, includes forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. As a result of many factors, including those factors set forth in Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, our actual results could differ materially from the results described in or implied by the forward-looking statements contained in the following discussion and analysis.\nNote on the COVID-19 Pandemic\nThe ongoing COVID-19 pandemic continues to have widespread, evolving, and unpredictable impacts on global economies, supply chains, financial markets, business practices and societies. The complex challenges created by the COVID-19 pandemic have had an adverse impact on our business, operations, and financial performance, and as such we continue to take steps to respond to these challenges and adjust our commercial strategy and operating plans accordingly.\nWe believe that the COVID-19 pandemic has had an adverse impact on sales of TAZVERIK since the June 2020 FDA approval of TAZVERIK for follicular lymphoma, or FL. Our commercial and medical affairs field teams continue to use virtual formats as well as in-person interactions, where possible, to allow us to serve the needs of healthcare providers, patients and other stakeholders, However, access to prescribers remains restrictive, and we expect these challenges to continue through the first half of 2022.\nIn response, we have taken steps to adjust our commercial strategy and continue to further refine our commercial strategy, recognizing that some of the changes brought about by the COVID-19 pandemic, such as ongoing restrictions to access prescribers by traditional sales personnel, will likely persist after the resolution of the pandemic. We are evolving our commercial strategies and deployment of resources to address these changes in market dynamics as we seek to increase awareness of TAZVERIK in ES and FL.\nAlthough the initiation, enrollment and completion of our ongoing and planned clinical trials have not been meaningfully disrupted, we have experienced some delays in clinical trial startup activities due to what we believe to be mostly related to COVID-19 related capacity constraints and resulting delays in the packaging and labeling of clinical drug supply at a third-party manufacturer. We are aware of the impact that COVID-19 continues to have on other clinical trials in our industry and there is a risk of material impact on the conduct of our clinical trials as well. We are continuing to work with our clinical trial sites as we seek to ensure study continuity, enable medical monitoring, facilitate study procedures and maintain clinical data and records, including the use of local laboratories for testing, home delivery of study drug and remote data and records monitoring.\nTo date, the COVID-19 pandemic has not had a material impact on our commercial supply chain, and we currently have a consistent supply of tazemetostat and TAZVERIK that we believe will cover our ongoing clinical development as well as the ongoing commercialization for ES and FL. From time to time, however, we have experienced some occasional delays in connection with our clinical supply, including delays related to packaging and labeling. As a proactive measure, we have taken certain steps to try to reduce the risk to our supply chain, such as advancing orders for long-lead items in anticipation of potential future delays or shortages. Because the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic could materially adversely impact our suppliers and result in delays or disruptions in our current or future supply chain, we are continuing to monitor and manage our supply chain accordingly.\nWe are implementing a multi-stage return to office plan, and in October 2021 we opened our facilities to all employees who expressed interest in participating in a return-to-office pilot program. In the meantime, many of our employees continue to work in a remote operating model. Our laboratory scientists who engage in bench research activities now have full access to our laboratories. We are using our pilot program to further evaluate this hybrid model and will use that evaluation to formulate how we will move forward. Ultimately, our return to office plan will be based primarily on guidance from federal, state and local government authorities, and we expect that some form of a hybrid model will continue to exist for us in the future.\nWe are closely monitoring the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and related developments on our business, operations and financial performance. We plan to continue to assess the potential duration, scope and severity of the COVID-19 pandemic and its impacts on our business, operations and financial performance, and to continue to work closely with our third-party vendors, collaborators and other parties in order to seek to continue to advance our efforts with respect to the commercialization of TAZVERIK and to continue to advance the development of EZM0414 and our pipeline, while making the health and safety of our employees and their families, healthcare providers, patients and communities a top priority. Due to the evolving and uncertain global impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, however, we cannot precisely determine or quantify the impact that this pandemic has had on our business, operations and financial performance to date or the impact that this pandemic will have in 2022 and beyond.\nPlease refer to our risk factors set forth in Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2021 for further discussion of risks related to the COVID-19 pandemic.\nOperating Expense Reductions\nIn response to the challenges we have continued to face since we commenced the launch of TAZVERIK in FL in June 2020, in August 2021, we determined to implement changes to our commercial strategy and organization in an effort to accelerate commercial adoption of TAZVERIK in appropriate patients while also pursuing our research and broader corporate objectives.\nOn August 9, 2021, we announced a cross-functional reduction of our 2021 budgeted headcount by approximately 20%, which included approximately 11% of our then-current workforce under the cost reduction plan. Affected employees were provided separation benefits, including severance payments along with temporary healthcare coverage assistance. The severance and termination-related costs were approximately $2.0 million. We recorded these costs in the third quarter of 2021 and expect that payments of these costs will be made through August 2022.\nIn addition to the organizational changes and cross-functional headcount reduction announced in August 2021, on March 1, 2022, we announced a further reduction of our operating expenses, including a cross-functional workforce reduction of approximately 12% of our current employees. Additionally, we announced a pipeline reprioritization. Given the breadth of our current tazemetostat clinical development program, we have discontinued enrollment in our Phase 2 study of tazemetostat in combination with rituximab with FL in the third line or later treatment settings (SYMPHONY-2, EZH-1401), as well as in our Phase 1/1b basket study evaluating tazemetostat combinations in patients with solid tumors (EZH-1301) due to evolving market dynamics and a continued focus on optimizing our investments and eliminating potentially overlapping studies.\nAs part of these March 2022 headcount reductions and our pipeline reprioritization, we are implementing further changes to our commercial strategy, to our medical affairs and clinical development teams and to our broader organization. We are focused on accelerating commercial adoption of TAZVERIK in appropriate patients and on implementing a broader operational cost reduction plan that will reduce our headcount across different areas of the organization and re-prioritize our investment of company resources in important clinical trials and programs, including our SYMPHONY-1 (EZH-302), CELLO-1 (EZH-1101), EZH-1501 and SET-101 trials.\nWe expect that these actions will allow us to keep the company in a financial position that will enable us to continue to achieve important near-term milestones and execute on our long-term strategy. As part of the March 2022 workforce reduction, affected employees will be offered separation benefits, including severance payments along with temporary healthcare coverage assistance. We estimate that the severance and termination-related costs will be approximately $2.8 - 3.2 million and expect to record these charges in the first quarter of 2022. We expect that payments of these costs will be made through the end of the fourth quarter of 2022.\nWe plan to continue to implement our broader operational expense reduction effort, and to monitor and seek opportunities to further reduce our operating expenses.\nOverview\nWe are a commercial-stage biopharmaceutical company that is committed to rewriting treatment for people with cancer through the discovery, development, and commercialization of novel epigenetic medicines. We aspire to change the standard of care for patients and physicians by developing targeted medicines with fundamentally new mechanisms of action directed at specific causes of hematological malignancies and solid tumors.\nWe have one approved product, TAZVERIK (tazemetostat), which was granted accelerated approval by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, in 2020 for epithelioid sarcoma, or ES, and FL. Our focus is on maximizing our effectiveness as a commercial organization to achieve adoption of TAZVERIK among as many appropriate patients as possible, including in earlier treatment lines and in combination regimens with the data to support this expanded use; building on TAZVERIK's pipeline-in-a-drug potential; and expanding our pipeline and evolving oncology portfolio, including with SET-101, our first-in-human Phase 1/1b trial of EZM0414, our novel, first-in-class, oral SETD2 inhibitor. We are leveraging our drug discovery platform and expertise as a leader in epigenetics, as well as our team's deep experience across clinical development and commercialization to execute on our strategy.\nIn January 2020, the FDA granted accelerated approval of TAZVERIK (tazemetostat), an oral, first in class, selective small molecule inhibitor of the EZH2 histone methyltransferase, or HMT, for the treatment of adult and pediatric patients aged 16 years and older with metastatic or locally advanced ES not eligible for complete resection. This approval was based on overall response rate and duration of response data shown in the ES cohort of our Phase 2 trial in patients with INI1-negative tumors. We continue to make TAZVERIK available to eligible patients and their physicians in the United States.\nAs part of the accelerated approval for ES, continued approval for this indication is contingent upon verification and description of clinical benefit in a confirmatory trial. To provide this confirmatory evidence to support a full approval of TAZVERIK for this indication, we are conducting a single, randomized, controlled Phase 1b/3 confirmatory trial in the United States (EZH-301) assessing tazemetostat in combination with doxorubicin compared with doxorubicin plus placebo as a front-line treatment for ES. The trial is expected to enroll approximately 152 patients. We have completed the planned enrollment in the Phase 1b safety run-in portion of the trial and the Phase 3 efficacy portion of the trial is open for accrual. We reported safety and preliminary activity data from the patients in the safety run-in portion of the EZH-301 trial at the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) Annual Meeting in June 2021.\nIn June 2020, the FDA approved a supplemental New Drug Application, or sNDA, for TAZVERIK for adult patients with relapsed or refractory (R/R) FL whose tumors are positive for an EZH2 mutation as detected by an FDA-approved test and who have received at least two prior systemic therapies, and adult patients with relapsed or refractory FL who have no satisfactory alternative treatment options. These indications were approved under accelerated approval with a priority review, based on overall response rate and duration of response data shown in the FL cohorts of our Phase 2 clinical trial in patients with EZH2 mutations and wild-type EZH2. We continue to make TAZVERIK available to eligible patients and their physicians in the United States.\nAs part of the accelerated approval for FL, continued approval for these R/R FL indications is contingent upon verification and description of clinical benefit in a confirmatory trial. To provide this confirmatory evidence to support a full approval of TAZVERIK for these indications, we are conducting a single global, randomized, adaptive Phase 1b/3 confirmatory trial (EZH-302, SYMPHONY-1) assessing the combination of tazemetostat with R2\u201d (lenalidomide and rituximab), an approved chemotherapy-free treatment regimen, compared with R2 plus placebo for R/R FL patients in the second-line or later treatment setting. We plan to leverage the confirmatory trial and also conduct post-marketing commitments to expand the TAZVERIK label into the second-line treatment setting.\nIn December 2021 we presented updated safety and activity data from the Phase 1b safety run-in portion of this confirmatory trial at the 2021 American Society of Hematology (ASH) Annual Meeting. We continue to follow the 40 patients in the Phase 1b safety run-in portion of the trial, and we expect to present follow-up data from the safety run-in portion of the trial at a medical conference later in 2022.\nWe expect that the Phase 3 portion of the SYMPHONY-1 trial will be a global, randomized and adaptive confirmatory trial in 500 patients. Based on the Phase 1b safety run-in results, in December 2021 we submitted a protocol amendment to the FDA with 800 mg twice-daily as the recommended tazemetostat dose (RP3D) for the Phase 3 portion of the trial. After completing the 30-day voluntary waiting period following submission of the protocol amendment for 800 mg RP3D without any objection from the FDA, and as we continue to conduct the Phase 1b safety run-in portion of the trial, we have accelerated global start-up activities and are activating as many study sites as possible, globally, for the Phase 3 portion of the trial. The primary endpoint for the Phase 3 portion of the trial will be based on progression free survival as determined by investigator. Based on discussions with the FDA, this portion of the trial will include two interim analyses, the first of which is for futility only and the second of which will be conducted for futility, and if 65% of progression free survival events have occurred, the trial will also include an efficacy evaluation. In July 2021 China's Center for Drug Evaluation, or CDE, approved the Investigational New Drug Application, or IND, we filed in China for SYMPHONY-1. We are currently screening\npatients in the Phase 3 portion of this trial and we expect to enroll the first patient in the Phase 3 portion of this trial in the first quarter of 2022.\nThrough our planned development efforts, our intention is to eventually make TAZVERIK available in all lines of treatment for patients with FL. In collaboration with The Lymphoma Study Association, or LYSA, and based on clinical activity observed with tazemetostat in combination with R-CHOP (rituximab, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine and prednisolone) as a front-line treatment for patients with high risk diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, or DLBCL, LYSA is conducting a Phase 1b/2 clinical trial to evaluate this combination as a front-line treatment for high-risk patients with FL and DLBCL. Patient enrollment in the Phase 2 portion of this trial is now nearly complete with 111 patients out of a target of approximately 122 patients in DLBCL and 61 patients out of a target of approximately 62 patients in FL enrolled as of February 23, 2022. We expect that interim results from the Phase 2 portion of this trial will be presented at a medical conference in the second half of 2022. We are also finalizing plans for investigator-sponsored studies to evaluate tazemetostat in combination with venetoclax or BTK inhibitors for the treatment of patients with FL in the third-line or later treatment settings.\nWe are also developing tazemetostat for the treatment of a broad range of other cancer types in multiple treatment settings. Tazemetostat has shown meaningful clinical activity as an investigational monotherapy in multiple cancer indications and has been generally well-tolerated across clinical trials to date. We believe tazemetostat is a pipeline in a product\u201d opportunity and plan to explore its potential utility in additional indications and combinations.\nThere are four areas where we see the greatest potential for tazemetostat, all of which are based on a strong scientific hypothesis and are for patients suffering from diseases that would benefit from a new effective and safe treatment option, including:\n\u2022Lymphomas and B-cell malignancies, such as DLBCL, mantle cell lymphoma, or MCL, multiple myeloma and others;\n\u2022Molecularly defined solid tumors, such as chordoma, melanoma, mesothelioma, and tumors harboring an EZH2 or SWI/SNF alteration;\n\u2022PARPi-resistant tumors, such as castration-resistant prostate cancer, small cell lung cancer, and others; and\n\u2022Immuno-oncology sensitive tumors, such as small cell lung cancer, prostate cancer and others.\nAs part of these broader tazemetostat development efforts, we are conducting a global, multi-center, open-label randomized Phase 1b/2 trial (EZH-1101, CELLO-1). The Phase 2 efficacy portion of the CELLO-1 trial, which is evaluating tazemetostat plus enzalutamide compared to enzalutamide monotherapy in patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer, or mCRPC, is approximately 75% enrolled toward a target of 80 patients and we expect to complete enrollment in the Phase 2 portion of the trial in 2022. We plan to provide updated data from the safety run-in portion of the trial as well as interim data from the Phase 2 portion of the trial in the second half of 2022.\nWe own the global development and commercialization rights to tazemetostat outside of Japan and greater China. Eisai Co. Ltd, or Eisai, holds the rights to develop and commercialize tazemetostat in Japan, and Hutchison China MediTech Investment Limited, or HutchMed, holds certain rights to develop and commercialize tazemetostat in greater China.\nTAZVERIK is available to eligible patients in the United States via a specialty distribution network. Through this specialty distribution network, we sell TAZVERIK principally to a limited number of specialty pharmacies, which dispense the product directly to patients, and specialty distributors, which in turn sell the product to hospital pharmacies and community practice pharmacies for the treatment of patients. To commercialize TAZVERIK for the approved ES and FL indications in the United States, we have built a focused field presence and marketing capabilities.\nOn August 7, 2021, we entered into a strategic collaboration pursuant to a license agreement with HutchMed through which we granted a license to HutchMed for the co-exclusive (with us) development and exclusive commercialization of tazemetostat, either as monotherapy or as a part of combinations with other therapies, including HutchMed proprietary compounds, agreed by us and HutchMed for the treatment of ES, FL and DLBCL in humans, and any additional indications agreed to by us and HutchMed in mainland China, Taiwan, Hong Kong and Macau, or the HutchMed Territory.\nFor other geographies outside the United States, we are evaluating the most efficient path to obtain marketing approval, commercialize and distribute TAZVERIK to reach patients, including pursuing potential strategic collaborations. Based on comparators and the regulatory landscape, we have decided not to pursue marketing approval of tazemetostat as monotherapy from the European Medicines Agency, or EMA at this time.\nBeyond tazemetostat, we are utilizing our drug discovery platform to progress preclinical efforts and discover and identify additional product candidates to expand our pipeline of inhibitors against several classes of chromatin modifying proteins, or CMPs, including HMTs, histone acetyltransferases, or HATs, and helicases.\nOur most advanced product candidate, EZM0414, is a novel first-in-class oral inhibitor of the SETD2 HMT.\nSETD2 is an HMT that plays multiple important roles in oncogenesis. Based on the potential of SETD2 inhibition demonstrated in multiple preclinical settings, including multiple myeloma, and in particular high risk t(4;14) multiple myeloma and in other B-cell malignancies such as DLBCL, as well as in combination with existing and emerging therapies including tazemetostat, we submitted an IND for EZM0414 to the FDA in July 2021. We received study may proceed\u201d from the FDA with respect to our IND for EZM0414 in July 2021. In October 2021, EZM0414 was granted Fast Track designation by the FDA in adult patients with relapsed or refractory DLBCL and in January 2022 we received orphan drug designation from the FDA for EZM0414 for the treatment of multiple myeloma. In the fourth quarter of 2021, we initiated a Phase 1/1b trial (SET-101) intended to evaluate the safety and optimize the dose and schedule of EZM0414 in R/R multiple myeloma and DLBCL patients. The Phase 1 portion of our SET-101 trial is a 3 + 3 dose escalation design and includes six planned dose levels ranging from 100 mg to 900 mg once daily. Once we have optimized the dose, we then expect to expand the trial to two patient cohorts in multiple myeloma: t(4;14) multiple myeloma and non t(4;14) multiple myeloma. Based on dose optimization data from the trial, we may add a third patient cohort in DLBCL. We are screening patients with one site open for the Phase 1 dose escalation portion of the SET-101 trial, which we expect will enroll between 30-36 patients. We plan to provide updates as the trial reaches key enrollment milestones along with preliminary data from the trial in 2022.\nTo date we have entered into various strategic collaborations, including with Eisai, HutchMed, Roche and other third parties. As one of several key aspects of our strategy, we plan to continue to leverage our existing collaborations and to seek to identify new potential strategic collaborations to further support and grow our business in and outside of the United States.\nThrough December 31, 2021, in addition to revenues from product sales, we have raised an aggregate of $1,568.3 million to fund our operations. This includes $268.8 of non-equity funding through our collaboration agreements, $368.1 million of funding, consisting of $150.0 million in equity funding received through agreements with RPI Finance Trust, or RPI, and $218.1 million in debt financing received through a loan agreement with BioPharma Credit Investments V (Master) LP and BPCR Limited Partnership (as transferee of BioPharma Credit Investments V (Master) LP's interest as a lender), or the Lenders, $855.4 million from the sale of common stock and series A convertible preferred stock in our public and at-the-market offerings and $76.0 million from the sale of redeemable convertible preferred stock in private financings prior to our initial public offering in May 2013.\nAs of December 31, 2021, we had $176.8 million in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities. In January 2022, the Company raised approximately $79.5 million in net proceeds (after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering costs) from the sale of 56,666,667 shares of its common stock in a public offering at a price of $1.50 per share.\nWe commenced active operations in early 2008, and since inception, have incurred significant operating losses. Our net loss was $251.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. As of December 31, 2021, our accumulated deficit totaled $1,239.8 million. Notwithstanding our sales of TAZVERIK, we expect to continue to incur significant expenses and operating losses over the next several years. Our net losses may fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter and year to year. We expect our expenses to increase in connection with our ongoing activities, particularly as we expect to incur significant commercialization expenses related to product manufacturing, marketing, sales and distribution. In addition, we expect our expenses to increase as we fund our tazemetostat development program; make any milestone and royalty payments provided for and achieved under the amended and restated collaboration and license agreement with Eisai; pay interest and principal associated with our amended and restated loan agreement with BioPharma Credit Investments V (Master) LP, BPCR Limited Partnership and BioPharma Credit PLC, or the Amended and Restated Loan Agreement; and continue research and development and initiate clinical trials of, and seek regulatory approval for, any future product candidates.\nFunding Agreements with BioPharma Credit Investments V (Master) LP, BPCR Limited Partnership, BioPharma Credit PLC and RPI Finance Trust\nWe executed a purchase agreement with RPI on November 4, 2019, or the RPI Purchase Agreement. Pursuant to the RPI Purchase Agreement, we sold to RPI 6,666,667 shares of our common stock and a warrant to purchase up to 2,500,000 shares of our common stock at an exercise price of $20.00 per share, or the Common Stock Warrant. We also sold our rights to receive royalties from Eisai with respect to net sales by Eisai of tazemetostat products in Japan, or the Japan Royalty, pursuant to the amended and restated collaboration and license agreement between us and Eisai, dated as of March 12, 2015, or the Eisai License Agreement. In consideration for the sale of shares of our common stock, the Common Stock Warrant and the Japan Royalty, RPI paid us $100.0 million upon the closing of the RPI Purchase Agreement in November 2019. In addition, RPI agreed, in connection with RPI's acquisition from Eisai of the right to receive royalties from us under the Eisai License Agreement, to reduce our royalty obligation by low single digits upon the achievement of specified annual net sales levels. We also had the option to sell to RPI $50.0 million of shares of common stock for an 18-month period beginning November 4, 2019, or the Put Option. On February 11, 2020, we sold 2,500,000 shares of common stock to RPI for an aggregate of $50.0 million in proceeds at a sale price of $20.00 per share of common stock pursuant to the Put Option.\nOn November 4, 2019, we also entered into a Loan Agreement with BioPharma Credit PLC, or the Collateral Agent, and the Lenders, providing for up to $70.0 million in secured term loans to be advanced in up to three tranches, or the Loan Agreement. We borrowed $70.0 million in the aggregate under the three tranches pursuant to the Loan Agreement.\nOn November 3, 2020, we, the Collateral Agent and the Lenders amended and restated the Loan Agreement, or, as amended and restated, the Amended and Restated Loan Agreement. The Amended and Restated Loan Agreement provides for, among other things, an additional secured term loan facility of $150.0 million, or the Tranche D Loan. On November 18, 2020, we borrowed the Tranche D Loan.\nThe obligations under the Amended and Restated Loan Agreement remain secured by a first priority security interest that was granted at the time of the Loan Agreement in and a lien on substantially all of our assets, subject to certain exceptions.\nThe Amended and Restated Loan Agreement contains certain customary representations and warranties, affirmative and negative covenants and events of default applicable to us and our subsidiaries. If an event of default occurs and is continuing, the Collateral Agent under the Amended and Restated Loan Agreement may, among other things, accelerate the loans and foreclose on the collateral. See Note 13, Long-Term Debt, of the notes to our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a description of the key terms of the Amended and Restated Loan Agreement.\nCollaborations\nRefer to Item 1, Business--Our Collaborations and Note 11, Collaborations, of the notes to our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a description of the key terms of our arrangements with Eisai Co. Ltd, or Eisai, Hutchison China MediTech Investment Limited, or HutchMed, and Roche Sequencing Solutions, Inc., or Roche Sequencing. On December 16, 2021, we received a notice of termination of our collaboration and license agreement with Glaxo Group Limited, effective March 16, 2022.\nResults of Operations\nFor a discussion related to the results of operations for 2020 compared to 2019, refer to Part II, Item 7, \"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Results of Operations\" in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2020 filed with the SEC on February 23, 2021.\nRevenues\nThe following is a comparison of total revenues for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020:\nTable 8: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2021\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2020\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(In millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Product revenues, net\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>30.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>11.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>19.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Collaboration and other revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Total revenues\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>37.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>15.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>21.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nProduct Revenues, net\nNet product revenues represent U.S. sales from our sole commercial product, TAZVERIK, which was first approved by the FDA on January 23, 2020, less allowances and accruals. During the years ended December 31, 2021, and 2020 net product revenues were $30.9 million and $11.5 million, respectively. The $19.4 million increase reflects the timing of approval of TAZVERIK for ES in January 2020 and the approval of TAZVERIK for FL in June 2020. The increase also reflects the inclusion of $7.4 million in product revenue during the year ended December 31, 2021 related to the sale of commercial product by one of our customers to a third-party pharmaceutical company for use in its clinical trials. Sales allowances and accruals consisted of patient financial assistance, distribution fees, discounts, and chargebacks.\nCollaboration and Other Revenue\nOur collaboration and other revenue during the periods included amounts recognized from deferred revenue related to upfront payments for licenses or options to obtain licenses in the future, research and development services revenue earned, milestone payments earned under collaboration and license agreements with our collaboration partners and revenue from the sale of tazemetostat active pharmaceutical ingredient (API) and drug product to our licensees and collaborators.\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, we recognized $6.5 million and $4.3 million, respectively, in collaboration and other revenue. In 2021 we recognized $6.5 million in collaboration and other revenue in connection with our waiver of our exclusive right to the supply of tazemetostat drug substance from Eisai's manufacturer, the manufacture and supply of tazemetostat, and technical support services under our supply agreement with Eisai. In 2020 we recognized $3.8 million of collaboration and other revenue under our collaboration agreement with Celgene related to the recognition of the remaining deferred revenue related to the agreement, which was recognized as revenue as a result of the termination of the collaboration agreement with Celgene. We recognized $0.5 million in collaboration and other revenue under our collaboration agreement with Boehringer Ingelheim during the year ended December 31, 2020 related to amendments to extend the research period under the collaboration agreement under which Boehringer Ingelheim funded $0.5 million of additional\nresearch activities. In December 2020, we received written notice from Boehringer Ingelheim to terminate the collaboration agreement, effective January 31, 2021.\nCost of Revenue\nThe following is a comparison of cost of revenue for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020:\nTable 9: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2021\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2020\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(In millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Cost of product revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>9.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>5.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>4.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Cost of other revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Total cost of revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>10.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>5.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>5.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe cost of revenue consists of costs related to our product revenue and other revenue for the sales of TAZVERIK as well as tazemetostat drug product and drug substance. These costs include materials, labor, manufacturing overhead, amortization of milestone payments, and royalties payable on net sales of TAZVERIK and sales of tazemetostat drug product. Costs related to the sale of TAZVERIK are included in cost of product revenue while cost related to the sale of tazemetostat drug product and drug substance are included in cost of other revenue.\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, the cost of product revenue was $9.7 million and $5.1 million, respectively, and consisted of $0.9 million and $0.4 million, respectively, in costs associated with manufacturing TAZVERIK, $4.2 million and $3.0 million, respectively, in amortization expense related to the two $25.0 million milestone payments under our agreement with Eisai upon regulatory approval of TAZVERIK for ES and upon regulatory approval of TAZVERIK for FL, and $4.6 million and $1.7 million, respectively, in worldwide royalties due under the Eisai License Agreement on net sales of TAZVERIK in the year ended December 31, 2021. Cost of other revenue during the year ended December 31, 2021 consisted of $0.8 million of costs related to sales of tazemetostat drug product to Eisai. All product costs incurred prior to FDA approval of TAZVERIK in January 2020 were expensed as research and development expenses. We expect our cost of product revenues (excluding amortization of intangible assets) to continue to be positively impacted during 2022, as we sell through certain inventory that was expensed prior to FDA approval of TAZVERIK in January 2020.\nResearch and Development\nResearch and development expenses consist of expenses incurred in performing research and development activities, including clinical trials and related clinical manufacturing expenses, fees paid to external providers of research and development services, third-party clinical research organizations, or CROs, compensation and benefits for full-time research and development employees, facilities expenses, overhead expenses, and other outside expenses. Most of our research and development costs are external costs, which we track on a program-by-program basis. Our internal research and development costs are primarily compensation expenses for our full-time research and development employees, including stock-based compensation expense.\nIn our early-stage research, we identify and prioritize novel CMPs that are implicated in cancer, and seek to develop potent and selective small molecule inhibitors of these targets. During this phase of research, our external costs primarily relate to lead discovery, biology, drug metabolism and pharmacokinetics and chemistry services from a multinational network of third-party providers of research and development services. As our product candidates\nprogress into preclinical and clinical development, external costs are driven by clinical trial costs, manufacturing expenses, and third-party research and development expenses.\nIn circumstances where our collaboration and license agreements provide for equally co-funded global development under joint risk sharing collaborations, and where we are the study sponsor, amounts received for co-funding are recorded as a reduction to research and development expense.\nThe following is a comparison of research and development expenses for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 :\nTable 10: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2021\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2020\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(In millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Research and development\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>131.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>110.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>20.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>18.1\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2021, total research and development expenses increased by $20.1 million compared to the year ended December 31, 2020, primarily due to increases in clinical trial expenses and discovery research activities related to tazemetostat in indications other than the approved indications as well as our SETD2 inhibitor EZM0414 program. Additionally, severance and termination-related costs totaling $0.4 million were recorded as research and development expenses in 2021 related to the August 2021 cost reduction plan. Increases in research and development expenses were partially offset by decreases in costs associated with the build-out of our regulatory and late-stage development groups.\nThe following table illustrates the components of our research and development expenses:\nTable 11: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Product Program\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2021\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2020\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(In millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>External research and development expenses:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Tazemetostat and related EZH2 programs\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>54.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>42.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>12.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>28.8\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> SETD2 inhibitor EZM0414 program\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>100.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Discovery and preclinical stage product programs, collectively\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>19.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>17.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Unallocated personnel and other expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>55.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>51.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Total research and development expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>131.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>110.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>20.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>18.1\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nExternal research and development expenses include external manufacturing costs related to the acquisition of active pharmaceutical ingredient and manufacturing of clinical drug supply, ongoing clinical trial costs, discovery and preclinical research in support of the tazemetostat program and expenses associated with our SETD2 inhibitor EZM0414 program.\nExternal research and development expenses for tazemetostat and related EZH2 programs increased by $12.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to the year ended December 31, 2020. The increase in external tazemetostat and related EZH2 programs research and development expenses in the year ended December 31, 2021 relates to increases in clinical trial expenses and discovery research activities related to tazemetostat in other indications associated with increased clinical trial activity, which were offset by decreases in costs associated with the build-out of our regulatory and late-stage development groups that we conducted in 2020.\nExternal research and development expenses for our EZM0414 SETD2 inhibitor program increased $2.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to the 2020. We designated the program as a clinical development program in the third quarter of 2021. Prior to the designation of the program as a clinical development program, we allocated costs related to the EZM0414 program to external research and development expenses for discovery and preclinical stage product programs.\nExternal research and development expenses for discovery and preclinical stage product programs increased by $1.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to the year ended December 31, 2020, was primarily\nrelated to increased spending for discovery research activities and development activities related to our preclinical programs, partially offset by reduced preclinical costs in connection with our EZM0414 SETD2 inhibitor program as a result of the designation of the EZM0414 SETD2 inhibitor program as a clinical development program in the third quarter of 2021.\nUnallocated personnel and other expenses are comprised of compensation expenses for our full-time research and development employees and other general research and development expenses. Unallocated personnel and other expenses for the year ended December 31, 2021 increased $4.4 million compared to the year ended December 31, 2020. The increase is a result of increases in facilities and equipment related expenses and in unallocated personnel costs, offset by an increase in the allocation of expenses to projects.\nWe expect that research and development expenses will decrease in 2022, as we continue to implement our operating expense reductions and prioritize our investment of company resources in important clinical trials and programs, including our SYMPHONY-1 (EZH-302) and CELLO-1 (EZH-1101), EZH-1501 and SET-101 trials.\nSelling, General and Administrative\nSelling, general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and related benefits, including stock-based compensation, related to our executive, finance, intellectual property, business development and support functions. Other selling, general and administrative expenses include allocated facility-related costs not otherwise included in research and development expenses, travel expenses and professional fees for auditing, tax and legal services, including intellectual property and general legal services.\nThe following is a comparison of selling, general and administrative expenses for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 :\nTable 12: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2021\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2020\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(In millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Selling, general and administrative\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>134.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>125.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>8.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nFor the year ended December 31, 2021, our selling, general and administrative expenses increased $8.8 million compared to the year ended December 31, 2020, primarily due to increased commercialization activities, including the build-out of our sales force and commercial infrastructure to support the commercial launch of TAZVERIK in the approved ES and FL indications, and increased personnel related expenses. Additionally, severance and termination-related costs totaling $1.6 million were recorded as selling, general and administrative expenses in 2021 related to the August 2021 cost reduction plan.\nWe expect that selling, general and administrative expenses will decrease in 2022 as we implement changes to our commercial strategy and organization in an effort to accelerate commercial adoption of TAZVERIK in appropriate patients as well as an operational cost reduction across general and administrative functions as part of our prioritization of our investment of company resources in important clinical trials and programs.\nOther (Expense) Income, Net\nThe following is a comparison of other (expense) income, net for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020:\nTable 13: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2021\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2020\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(In millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Other income, net\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Interest income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>0.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(2.7\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(93.1\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Interest expense\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(22.5\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(7.6\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(14.9\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>196.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Other expense, net\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(0.1\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(0.1\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Change in fair value of warrants to purchase common stock\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>100.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Non-cash interest expense related to sale of future royalties\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1.8\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1.4\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(0.4\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>28.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Other (expense) income, net\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(13.1\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(6.2\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(6.9\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>111.3\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOther (expense) income, net consists of interest income earned on our cash equivalents and marketable securities, net of imputed interest expense paid under our capital lease obligation. The increase in other expense for the year ended December 31, 2021 is principally due to an increase in interest expense of $15.0 million incurred in connection with our long-term debt obligations under our Amended and Restated Loan Agreement which increased to a principal balance of $220.0 million in the fourth quarter of 2020, a decrease in net interest income of $2.6 million due to a combination of lower cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities combined with lower rates of return, and an increase in non-cash interest expense related to the sale of future royalties of $0.4 million. These increases in other expense were offset by income related to the changes in fair value of warrant liability of $11.1 million due to a decrease in our stock price.\nIncome Tax Benefit\nWe evaluated the expected recoverability of our net deferred tax assets as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, and determined that there was insufficient positive evidence to support the recoverability of these net deferred tax assets, concluding it is more likely than not that our net deferred tax assets would not be realized in the future; therefore, the Company provided a full valuation allowance against its net deferred tax asset balance as of December 31, 2021 and 2020.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nFor a discussion related to our cash flows for 2020 compared to 2019, refer to Part II, Item 7, \"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Liquidity and Capital Resources\" in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2020 filed with the SEC on February 23, 2021\nThrough December 31, 2021, in addition to revenues from product sales, we have raised an aggregate of $1,568.3 million to fund our operations. This includes $268.8 million in non-equity funding through our collaboration agreements, $368.1 million of funding, consisting of $150.0 million in equity funding received through agreements with RPI Finance Trust, or RPI, and $218.1 million in debt financing received through a loan agreement with BioPharma Credit Investments V (Master) LP and BPCR Limited Partnership (as transferee of BioPharma Credit Investments V (Master) LP's interest as a lender), or the Lenders, $855.4 million from the sale of common stock and series A convertible preferred stock in our public offerings and at-the-market offerings and $76.0 million was from the sale of redeemable convertible preferred stock in private financings prior to our initial public offering in May 2013. As of December 31, 2021, we had $176.8 million in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities.\nOn May 6, 2021, we entered into an Open Market Sale AgreementSM, or ATM Sale Agreement, with Jefferies LLC, or Jefferies, to sell, from time to time, shares of our common stock having an aggregate offering price of up to $200,000,000 through an at the market offering\u201d as defined in Rule 415 under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, under which Jefferies would act as sales agent, which we refer to as the ATM Offering. The shares that may be sold under the ATM Sale Agreement, if any, are issued and sold pursuant to our shelf registration statement on Form S-3 that was declared effective by the Securities and Exchange Commission on May 13, 2021. Through December 31, 2021, we have sold a total of 3,840,977 shares under the ATM Offering, resulting in aggregate net proceeds to us of approximately $16.0 million after deducting issuance costs of $0.5 million.\nIn addition to our existing cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, we are eligible to earn milestone payments under our collaboration agreement with HutchMed. Our ability to earn these payments and the timing of earning these payments is dependent upon the outcome of research and development activities and is uncertain at this time.\nIn January 2022, we raised approximately $79.5 million in net proceeds (after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering costs, but excluding any expenses and other costs reimbursed by the underwriters) from the sale of 56,666,667 shares of our common stock in a public offering at a price of $1.50 per share.\nFunding Requirements\nOur primary uses of capital are clinical trial costs, third-party research and development services, expenses related to commercialization, debt service obligations, compensation and related expenses, laboratory and related supplies, legal and other regulatory expenses and general overhead costs.\nBecause the continued approval of TAZVERIK in the approved indications is contingent upon verification and description of clinical benefit in confirmatory trials, and because we are developing tazemetostat for other indications, we cannot estimate the actual amounts necessary to successfully complete the development and commercialization of TAZVERIK for the approved indications or the indications that we are exploring or that we may plan to explore. Because EZM0414 is an early clinical product candidate and any future product candidates are in various stages of preclinical development with uncertain outcomes, we also cannot estimate the actual amounts necessary to successfully complete the development and commercialization of EZM0414 or future product candidates. Because of these uncertainties, we also cannot estimate whether, or when, we may achieve profitability. Until such time, if ever, as we can generate substantial product revenues, we expect to finance our cash needs through a combination of equity or debt financings and collaboration arrangements. Except for any obligations of our collaborators to make license, milestone or royalty payments under our agreements with them, we do not have any committed external sources of liquidity. To the extent that we raise additional capital through the future sale of equity or debt, the ownership interest of our stockholders may be diluted, and the terms of these securities may include liquidation or other preferences that adversely affect the rights of our existing common stockholders. Debt\nfinancing and preferred equity financing, if available, may involve agreements that include covenants limiting or restricting our ability to take specific actions, such as incurring additional debt, making capital expenditures or declaring dividends. If we raise additional funds through collaboration arrangements in the future, we may have to relinquish valuable rights to our technologies, future revenue streams or product candidates or grant licenses on terms that may not be favorable to us. If we are unable to raise any additional funds that may be needed through equity or debt financings when needed, we may be required to delay, limit, reduce or terminate our product development or future commercialization efforts or grant rights to develop and market product candidates that we would otherwise prefer to develop and market ourselves.\nOutlook\nBased on our current operating plan, we expect that our existing cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities as of December 31, 2021, together with the $79.5 million in net proceeds raised from the common stock offering in January 2022 and cash we expect to generate from product sales, will be sufficient to fund our planned operating expenses and capital expenditure requirements and pay our debt service obligations as they become due into the third quarter of 2023, without giving effect to any potential milestone payments we may receive under our collaboration agreements. We have based this estimate on assumptions that may prove to be wrong, such as the revenue that we expect to generate from the sale of our products, or as to our clinical development costs, particularly as the process of testing drug candidates in clinical trials is costly and the timing of progress in these trials is uncertain. As a result, we could use our capital resources sooner than we expect.\nCash Flows\nThe following is a summary of cash flows for the years ended for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020:\nTable 14: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2021\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2020\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(In millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Net cash (used in) operating activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(226.9\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(206.3\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(20.6\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Net cash provided by (used in) investing activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>125.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(14.6\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>140.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(959.6\n</td> <td>%)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Net cash provided by financing activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>31.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>249.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(218.2\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(87.4\n</td> <td>%)\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nNet Cash Used in Operating Activities\nNet cash used in operating activities was $226.9 million during the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to $206.3 million during the year ended December 31, 2020. The increase in net cash used in operating activities of $20.6 million primarily relates to our net loss of $251.1 million and the $11.1 million change in fair value of warrants, partially offset by changes in working capital of $0.2 million, net depreciation and amortization of $5.2 million, non-cash stock-based compensation of $26.8 million, and non-cash interest expense associated with the sale of future royalties of $1.8 million.\nNet Cash Provided by (Used in) Investing Activities\nNet cash provided by investing activities during the year ended December 31, 2021 reflects maturities of available-for-sale securities of $388.6 million, offset by $262.6 million of purchases of available-for-sale securities, and $0.5 million of purchases of property and equipment.\nNet cash used in investing activities during the year ended December 31, 2020 reflects $276.4 million of purchases of available for sale securities, a $25.0 million milestone payment under the Eisai collaboration agreement upon regulatory approval of tazemetostat for ES, a $25.0 million milestone payment under the Eisai collaboration agreement upon regulatory approval of tazemetostat for FL, and $0.9 million of purchases of property and equipment, offset by maturities and sales of available for sale securities of $312.7 million.\nNet Cash Provided by Financing Activities\nNet cash provided by financing activities of $31.5 million during the year ended December 31, 2021 primarily reflects net proceeds from the sale of common stock under the ATM Sale Agreement of $16.0 million, the purchases of shares under our employee stock purchase plan of $1.9 million, stock option exercises of $0.9 million, and $13.1 million from the issuance of the HutchMed Warrant, partially offset by the payment of offering costs of $0.3 million related to the ATM program.\nNet cash provided by financing activities of $249.7 million during the year ended December 31, 2020 primarily reflects cash received from the sale of common stock of $50.0 million in connection with our exercise of our Put Option to sell shares of our common stock to Royalty Pharma, net cash received during the period from Tranche B Tranche C and Tranche D Loan borrowings totaling $195.0 million under the Amended and Restated Loan Agreement, stock option exercises of $6.7 million, and the purchases of shares under our employee stock purchase plan of $1.3 million, partially offset by payments of debt issuance costs of $3.1 million and offering costs of $0.1 million.\nContractual Obligations and Contingent Liabilities\nOn August 11, 2021, we entered into a fifth amendment to the Technology Square Lease, the Fifth Amendment, with ARE-TECH Square, LLC. Under the Fifth Amendment, we extended the term of the Technology Square Lease through November 30, 2024. Under the Fifth Amendment, we will continue to pay the current monthly base rent amount contemplated by the Technology Square Lease through November 30, 2022, with an increase commencing on December 1, 2022 and adjusting the monthly base rent amount to approximately $377,000 and an increase commencing on December 1, 2023 and adjusting the monthly base rent amount to approximately $388,000 through November 30, 2024. Under the current terms of the Technology Square Lease, we do not have any further right to extend the term beyond November 30, 2024.\nWe remain committed to fund $1.0 million of development costs payable to Roche Molecular, or Roche, upon certain development and regulatory milestones, under our amended companion diagnostic agreement with Roche.\nWe have incurred secured indebtedness of $220.0 million under our amended and restated loan agreement with BioPharma Credit Investments V (Master) LP, BPCR Limited Partnership and BioPharma Credit PLC. The interest rate for the loans under the agreement are determined by reference to a Eurodollar rate plus 7.75% above such Eurodollar rate subject to a 2.00% floor. Interest is paid quarterly with principal repayments beginning in the first quarter of 2024. Our long-term debt obligation is more fully described in Note 13, Long-Term Debt to the financial statements in Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nThis description of our contractual obligations does not include potential future milestones or royalties that we may be required to make under license and collaboration agreements due to the uncertainty of events requiring payment under these agreements.\nWe enter into contracts in the normal course of business with clinical research organizations for clinical and preclinical research studies, external manufacturers for product for use in our clinical trials, and other research supplies and other services as part of our operations. These contracts generally provide for termination on notice, and therefore are cancelable contracts and not included in contractual commitments.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Use of Estimates\nOur management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the balance sheets and the reported amounts of collaboration revenue, inventory and expenses during the reporting periods. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances at the time such estimates are made. Actual results and outcomes may differ materially from our estimates, judgments and assumptions. We\nperiodically review our estimates in light of changes in circumstances, facts and experience. The effects of material revisions in estimates are reflected in the consolidated financial statements prospectively from the date of the change in estimate.\nWe define our critical accounting policies as those accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America that require us to make subjective estimates and judgments about matters that are uncertain and are likely to have a material impact on our financial condition and results of operations as well as the specific manner in which we apply those principles. Management has determined that our most critical accounting policies are those relating to revenue recognition, research and development expenses, including our accounting for clinical trial expense and accruals, inventory and going concern. As our clinical development plan for tazemetostat and EZM0414 progresses, we expect research and development expenses and, in particular, our accounting for clinical trial accruals to be an increasingly important critical accounting policy.\nRevenue Recognition - Product Revenue\nWe recognize revenue when our customer obtains control of promised goods or services, in an amount that reflects the consideration which we expect to receive in exchange for those goods or services. To determine revenue recognition, we perform the following five steps: (i) identify the contract(s) with a customer; (ii) identify the performance obligations in the contract; (iii) determine the transaction price; (iv) allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract; and (v) recognize revenue when (or as) we satisfy a performance obligation. We only apply the five-step model to contracts when it is probable that we will collect the consideration we are entitled to in exchange for the goods or services we transfer to the customer.\nWe sell TAZVERIK in the United States principally to a limited number of specialty pharmacies, which dispense the product directly to patients, and specialty distributors, which in turn sell the product to hospital pharmacies and community practice pharmacies (collectively, healthcare providers) for the treatment of patients. The specialty pharmacies and specialty distributors are referred to as our customers.\nRevenue is recognized by us when the customer obtains control of the product, which occurs at a point in time, typically when the product is received by our customers. We provide a right of return to our customers for unopened product for a limited time before and after its expiration date, which lapses upon shipment to a patient. Healthcare providers to whom specialty distributors sell TAZVERIK hold limited inventory that is designated for patients, and we are able to monitor inventory levels in the distribution channel, thereby limiting the risk of return.\nReserves for Variable Consideration\nRevenues from product sales are recorded at the net sales price (transaction price), which includes estimates of variable consideration for which reserves are established and which result from discounts, returns, chargebacks, rebates, co-pay assistance and other allowances that are offered within contracts between us and our customers, health care providers, payors and other indirect customers relating to our product sales. These reserves are based on the amounts earned or to be claimed on the related sales and are classified as reductions of accounts receivable (if the amount is payable to the customer) or a current liability (if the amount is payable to a party other than a customer). Where appropriate, these estimates take into consideration a range of possible outcomes that are probability-weighted for relevant factors such as our historical experience, current contractual and statutory requirements, specific known market events and trends, industry data and forecasted customer buying and payment patterns. Overall, these reserves reflect our best estimates of the amount of consideration to which we are entitled based on the terms of the contract. The amount of variable consideration that is included in the transaction price may be constrained, and is included in the net sales price only to the extent that it is probable that a significant reversal in the amount of the cumulative revenue recognized will not occur in a future period. Actual amounts of consideration ultimately received may differ from our estimates. If actual results in the future vary from our estimates, we will adjust these estimates, which would affect net product revenue and earnings in the period such variances become known.\nTrade Discounts and Allowances: We generally provide customers with discounts that include incentive fees that are explicitly stated in our contracts and are recorded as a reduction of revenue in the period the related product revenue is recognized. In addition, we receive sales order management, data and distribution services from certain customers. To the extent the services received are distinct from our sale of products to the customer, these payments are\nclassified in selling, general and administrative expenses in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss.\nProduct Returns: Consistent with industry practice, we generally offer customers a limited right of return based on the product's expiration date for product that has been purchased from us, which lapses upon shipment to a patient. We estimate the amount of our product sales that may be returned by our customers and record this estimate as a reduction of revenue in the period the related product revenue is recognized. We currently estimate product return liabilities using available industry data and our own historical sales information, including our visibility into the inventory remaining in the distribution channel.\nProvider Chargebacks and Discounts: Chargebacks for fees and discounts to providers represent the estimated obligations resulting from contractual commitments to sell products to qualified healthcare providers at prices lower than the list prices charged to customers who directly purchase the product from us. Customers charge us for the difference between what they pay for the product and the ultimate selling price to the qualified healthcare providers. These reserves are established in the same period that the related revenue is recognized, resulting in a reduction of product revenue and accounts receivable. Chargeback amounts are generally determined at the time of resale to the qualified healthcare provider by customers, and we generally issue credits for such amounts within a few weeks of the customer's notification to us of the resale. Reserves for chargebacks consist of credits that we expect to issue for units that remain in the distribution channel inventories at each reporting period end that we expect will be sold to qualified healthcare providers, and chargebacks that customers have claimed but for which we have not yet issued a credit.\nGovernment Rebates: We are subject to discount obligations under state Medicaid programs and Medicare. We estimate our Medicaid and Medicare rebates based upon a range of possible outcomes that are probability-weighted for the estimated payor mix. These reserves are recorded in the same period the related revenue is recognized, resulting in a reduction of product revenue and the establishment of a current liability that is included in accrued expenses on the consolidated balance sheet. For Medicare, we also estimate the number of patients in the prescription drug coverage gap for whom we will owe an additional liability under the Medicare Part D program. Our liability for these rebates consists of invoices received for claims from prior quarters that have not been paid or for which an invoice has not yet been received, estimates of claims for the current quarter, and estimated future claims that will be made for product that has been recognized as revenue, but remains in the distribution channel inventories at period end.\nPayor Rebates: We may contract with various private payor organizations, primarily insurance companies and pharmacy benefit managers, for the payment of rebates with respect to utilization of our products. We estimate these rebates and record such estimates in the same period the related revenue is recognized, resulting in a reduction of product revenue and the establishment of a current liability.\nOther Incentives/Patient Assistance Programs: We also offer voluntary patient assistance programs such as co-pay assistance. Co-pay assistance programs are intended to provide financial assistance to qualified commercially insured patients with prescription drug co-payments required by payors. The calculation of the accrual for co-pay assistance is based on an estimate of claims and the cost per claim that we expect to receive associated with product that has been recognized as revenue, but remains in in the distribution channel inventories at period end.\nRevenue Recognition - Collaboration Revenue\nEffective January 1, 2018, we adopted ASC, Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, or ASC 606, using the modified retrospective transition method. Under this method, results for reporting periods beginning after January 1, 2018 are presented pursuant to ASC 606, while prior period amounts are not adjusted and continue to be reported in accordance with ASC 605. This standard applies to all contracts with customers, except for contracts that are within the scope of other standards, such as leases, insurance, collaboration arrangements and financial instruments. Under ASC 606, an entity recognizes revenue when its customer obtains control of promised goods or services, in an amount that reflects the consideration which the entity expects to receive in exchange for those goods or services. To determine revenue recognition for arrangements that an entity determines are within the scope of ASC 606, the entity performs the following five steps: (i) identify the contract(s) with a customer; (ii) identify the\nperformance obligations in the contract; (iii) determine the transaction price; (iv) allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract; and (v) recognize revenue when (or as) the entity satisfies a performance obligation. We only apply the five-step model to contracts when it is probable that the entity will collect the consideration it is entitled to in exchange for the goods or services it transfers to the customer. At contract inception, once the contract is determined to be within the scope of ASC 606, we assess the goods or services promised within each contract and determines those that are performance obligations, and assesses whether each promised good or service is distinct. We then recognize as revenue the amount of the transaction price that is allocated to the respective performance obligation when (or as) the performance obligation is satisfied.\nWe have entered into collaboration and license agreements, which are within the scope of ASC 606, to discover, develop, manufacture and commercialize product candidates. The terms of these agreements typically contain multiple promises or obligations, which may include: (i) licenses, or options to obtain licenses, to compounds directed to specific targets (referred to as exclusive licenses\u201d) and (ii) research and development activities to be performed on behalf of the collaboration partner related to the licensed targets. Payments to us under these agreements may include non-refundable license fees, customer option exercise fees, payments for research activities, reimbursement of certain costs, payments based upon the achievement of certain milestones and royalties on any resulting net product sales.\nWe first evaluate license and/or collaboration arrangements to determine whether the arrangement (or part of the arrangement) represents a collaborative arrangement pursuant to ASC Topic 808, Collaborative Arrangements, based on the risks and rewards and activities of the parties pursuant to the contractual arrangement. We account for collaborative arrangements (or elements within the contract that are deemed part of a collaborative arrangement), which represent a collaborative relationship and not a customer relationship, outside the scope of ASC 606. Our collaborations primarily represent revenue arrangements. For the arrangements or arrangement components that are subject to revenue accounting guidance, in determining the appropriate amount of revenue to be recognized as it fulfills its obligations under each of its agreements, we perform the following steps: (i) identification of the promised goods or services in the contract; (ii) determination of whether the promised goods or services are performance obligations including whether they are distinct in the context of the contract; (iii) measurement of the transaction price, including the constraint on variable consideration; (iv) allocation of the transaction price to the performance obligations; and (v) recognition of revenue when (or as) we satisfy each performance obligation. As part of the accounting for these arrangements, we must use significant judgment to determine: a) the number of performance obligations based on the determination under step (ii) above and whether those performance obligations are distinct from other performance obligations in the contract; b) the transaction price under step (iii) above; and c) the stand-alone selling price for each performance obligation identified in the contract for the allocation of transaction price in step (iv) above. We use judgment to determine whether milestones or other variable consideration, except for sales-based royalties, should be included in the transaction price as described further below. The transaction price is allocated to each performance obligation on a relative stand-alone selling price basis, for which we recognize revenue as or when the performance obligations under the contract are satisfied. In determining the stand-alone selling price of a license to our proprietary technology or a material right provided by a customer option, we consider market conditions as well as entity-specific factors, including those factors contemplated in negotiating the agreements as well as internally developed estimates that include assumptions related to the market opportunity, estimated development costs, probability of success and the time needed to commercialize a product candidate pursuant to the license. In validating its estimated stand-alone selling price, we evaluate whether changes in the key assumptions used to determine its estimated stand-alone selling price will have a significant effect on the allocation of arrangement consideration between performance obligations.\nAmounts received prior to revenue recognition are recorded as deferred revenue. Amounts expected to be recognized as revenue within the 12 months following the balance sheet date are classified as current portion of deferred revenue in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. Amounts not expected to be recognized as revenue within the 12 months following the balance sheet date are classified as deferred revenue, net of current portion. Amounts recognized as revenue, but not yet received or invoiced are generally recognized as contract assets.\nExclusive Licenses - If the license to our intellectual property is determined to be distinct from the other promises or performance obligations identified in the arrangement, which generally include research and development services, we recognize revenue from non-refundable, upfront fees allocated to the license when the license is transferred to\nthe customer and the customer is able to use and benefit from the license. In assessing whether a license is distinct from the other promises, we consider relevant facts and circumstances of each arrangement, including the research and development capabilities of the collaboration partner and the availability of the associated expertise in the general marketplace. In addition, we consider whether the collaboration partner can benefit from the license for its intended purpose without the receipt of the remaining promises, whether the value of the license is dependent on the unsatisfied promises, whether there are other vendors that could provide the remaining promises, and whether it is separately identifiable from the remaining promises. For licenses that are combined with other promises, we utilize judgment to assess the nature of the combined performance obligation to determine whether the combined performance obligation is satisfied over time or at a point in time and, if over time, the appropriate method of measuring progress for purposes of recognizing revenue. We evaluate the measure of progress each reporting period and, if necessary, adjusts the measure of performance and related revenue recognition. The measure of progress, and thereby periods over which revenue should be recognized, are subject to estimates by management and may change over the course of the research and development and licensing agreement.\nResearch and Development Services - The promises under our collaboration and license agreements generally include research and development services to be performed by us on behalf of the collaboration partner. For performance obligations that include research and development services, we generally recognize revenue allocated to such performance obligations based on an appropriate measure of progress. We utilize judgment to determine the appropriate method of measuring progress for purposes of recognizing revenue, which is generally an input measure such as costs incurred. We evaluate the measure of progress each reporting period as described under Exclusive Licenses above. Reimbursements from the partner that are the result of a collaborative relationship with the partner, instead of a customer relationship, such as co-development activities, are recorded as a reduction to research and development expense.\nCustomer Options - Our arrangements may provide a collaborator with the right to select a target for licensing either at the inception of the arrangement or within an initial pre-defined selection period, which may, in certain cases, include the right of the collaborator to extend the selection period. Under these agreements, fees may be due to us (i) at the inception of the arrangement as an upfront fee or payment, (ii) upon the exercise of an option to acquire a license or (iii) upon extending the selection period as an extension fee or payment. If an arrangement is determined to contain customer options that allow the customer to acquire additional goods or services, the goods and services underlying the customer options are not considered to be performance obligations at the outset of the arrangement, as they are contingent upon option exercise. We evaluate the customer options for material rights, or options to acquire additional goods or services for free or at a discount. If the customer options are determined to represent a material right, the material right is recognized as a separate performance obligation at the inception of the arrangement. We allocate the transaction price to material rights based on the relative stand-alone selling price, which is determined based on the identified discount and the probability that the customer will exercise the option. Amounts allocated to a material right are not recognized as revenue until, at the earliest, the option is exercised or expires.\nMilestone Payments - At the inception of each arrangement that includes development milestone payments, we evaluate whether the milestones are considered probable of being achieved and estimates the amount to be included in the transaction price using the most likely amount method. If it is probable that a significant revenue reversal would not occur, the associated milestone value is included in the transaction price. Milestone payments that are not within our control or the licensee's control, such as regulatory approvals, are not considered probable of being achieved until those approvals are received. We evaluate factors such as the scientific, clinical, regulatory, commercial, and other risks that must be overcome to achieve the particular milestone in making this assessment. There is considerable judgment involved in determining whether it is probable that a significant revenue reversal would not occur. At the end of each subsequent reporting period, we reevaluate the probability of achievement of all milestones subject to constraint and, if necessary, adjusts its estimate of the overall transaction price. Any such adjustments are recorded on a cumulative catch-up basis, which would affect revenues and earnings in the period of adjustment. If a milestone or other variable consideration relates specifically to our efforts to satisfy a single performance obligation or to a specific outcome from satisfying the performance obligation, we generally allocate the milestone amount entirely to that performance obligation once it is probable that a significant revenue reversal would not occur.\nRoyalties - For arrangements that include sales-based royalties, including milestone payments based on a level of sales, and the license is deemed to be the predominant item to which the royalties relate, we recognize revenue at the\nlater of (i) when the related sales occur or (ii) when the performance obligation to which some or all of the royalty has been allocated has been satisfied (or partially satisfied). To date, we have not recognized any royalty revenue resulting from any of our licensing arrangements.\nFor a complete discussion of accounting for collaboration revenues, see Note 11, Collaborations, in the accompanying Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 15. of Part IV of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nAccrued Research and Development Expenses\nAs part of the process of preparing our financial statements, we are required to estimate our accrued expenses as of each balance sheet date. This process involves reviewing open contracts and purchase orders, communicating with our personnel to identify services that have been performed on our behalf and estimating the level of service performed and the associated cost incurred for the service when we have not yet been invoiced or otherwise notified of the actual cost. The majority of our service providers invoice us monthly in arrears for services performed or when contractual milestones are met. We make estimates of our accrued expenses as of each balance sheet date in our financial statements based on facts and circumstances known to us at that time. We periodically confirm the accuracy of our estimates with the service providers and make adjustments if necessary. Examples of estimated accrued research and development expenses include fees paid to:\n\u2022contract research organizations in connection with clinical trials;\n\u2022investigative sites in connection with clinical trials;\n\u2022vendors in connection with non-clinical development activities; and\n\u2022vendors related to product manufacturing, development and distribution of clinical supplies.\nWe generally accrue expenses related to research and development activities based on the services received and efforts expended pursuant to contracts with multiple contract research organizations that conduct and manage clinical trials on our behalf as well as other vendors that provide research and development services. The financial terms of these agreements are subject to negotiation, vary from contract to contract and may result in uneven payment flows. There may be instances in which payments made to our vendors will exceed the level of services provided and result in a prepayment of the expense. Payments under some of these contracts depend on factors such as the successful enrollment of subjects and the completion of clinical trial milestones. In accruing service fees, we estimate the time period over which services will be performed and the level of effort to be expended in each period. If the actual timing of the performance of services or the level of effort varies from our estimate, we would adjust the accrual or prepaid accordingly.\nAlthough we do not expect our estimates to be materially different from amounts actually incurred, if our estimates of the status and timing of services performed differ from the actual status and timing of services performed we may report amounts that are too high or too low in any particular period. To date, there have been no material differences from our estimates to the amount actually incurred.\nInventory\nWe outsource the manufacturing of TAZVERIK and use contract manufacturers to produce the raw and intermediate materials used in the production of TAZVERIK as well as the finished product. We currently have one supplier qualified for each step in the manufacturing process and are in the process of qualifying additional suppliers.\nInventory is composed of raw materials, intermediate materials, which are classified as work-in-process, and finished goods, which are goods that are available for sale. We state inventory at the lower of cost or net realizable value with the cost based on the first-in, first-out method. If we identify excess, obsolete or unsalable items, we write down our inventory to its net realizable value in the period in which the impairment is identified. These adjustments are recorded based upon various factors related to the product, including the level of product manufactured by us, the level of product in the distribution channel, current and projected demand, the expected\nshelf-life of the product and firm inventory purchase commitments. Shipping and handling costs incurred for inventory purchases are included in inventory costs and costs incurred for product shipments are recorded as incurred in cost of product revenue.\nPrior to receiving our first approval from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, on January 23, 2020, we expensed all costs incurred related to the manufacture of TAZVERIK as research and development expense because of the inherent risks associated with the development of a product candidate, the uncertainty about the regulatory approval process and the lack of history for us of regulatory approval of drug candidates.\nGoing Concern\nAt each reporting period, we evaluate whether there are conditions or events that raise substantial doubt about the Company's ability to continue as a going concern within one year after the date that the financial statements are issued. The Company is required to make certain additional disclosures if it concludes substantial doubt exists about the Company's ability to continue as a going concern within one year after the date that the financial statements are issued and such doubt is not alleviated by the Company's plans or when its plans alleviate substantial doubt about the Company's ability to continue as a going concern. The Company's evaluation entails analyzing prospective operating budgets and forecasts for expectations of the Company's cash needs, and comparing those needs to its available cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities.\nThe analysis of the Company's ability to continue as a going concern includes consideration of the Company's current cash needs, including its research and development plans, commercialization activities associated with the continued commercialization of TAZVERIK in the ES and FL indications, its existing debt service obligations, and anticipated cost savings from its operational cost reduction plans, including ongoing efforts to eliminate costs not related to the Company's strategic focus. The analysis includes forecasted product revenues from sales of TAZVERIK. Such estimates of future sales contain significant judgment as TAZVERIK was first launched in the first half of 2020 and there is little history with which to base such estimates. In addition, the Company's ongoing efforts to eliminate costs not related to the Company's strategic focus contains uncertainties as to whether the Company can attain such benefits.\nBased on its analysis, the Company concluded that its available cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities as of December 31, 2021 combined with the $79.5 million raised in January 2022 will be sufficient to fund current planned operations and capital expenditure requirements and pay its debt service obligations as they become due into the third quarter of 2023, which is at least 12 months from the filing date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K with the SEC. As a result, the Company concluded that it did not identify conditions or events that raise substantial doubt about the Company's ability to continue as a going concern within one year from the date these financial statements were issued. The Company's current operating plan is based on assumptions that may prove to be wrong, and the Company could use its capital resources sooner than it expects, in which case the Company would evaluate further reductions in its expenses or obtaining additional financing sooner than it otherwise would, which additional financing may not be available or may only be available on terms that are not acceptable to the Company.\nRecently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements\nFor detailed information regarding recently issued accounting pronouncements and the expected impact on our consolidated financial statements, see Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies-Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements, in the accompanying Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 15. of Part IV of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.", "item_7_text": "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nOur management's discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, which have been prepared by us in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, or GAAP, and with Regulation S-X promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. This discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with these consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Some of the information contained in this discussion and analysis or set forth elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including information with respect to our plans and strategy for our business, includes forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. As a result of many factors, including those factors set forth in Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, our actual results could differ materially from the results described in or implied by the forward-looking statements contained in the following discussion and analysis.\nNote on the COVID-19 Pandemic\nThe ongoing COVID-19 pandemic continues to have widespread, evolving, and unpredictable impacts on global economies, supply chains, financial markets, business practices and societies. The complex challenges created by the COVID-19 pandemic have had an adverse impact on our business, operations, and financial performance, and as such we continue to take steps to respond to these challenges and adjust our commercial strategy and operating plans accordingly.\nWe believe that the COVID-19 pandemic has had an adverse impact on sales of TAZVERIK since the June 2020 FDA approval of TAZVERIK for follicular lymphoma, or FL. Our commercial and medical affairs field teams continue to use virtual formats as well as in-person interactions, where possible, to allow us to serve the needs of healthcare providers, patients and other stakeholders, However, access to prescribers remains restrictive, and we expect these challenges to continue through the first half of 2022.\nIn response, we have taken steps to adjust our commercial strategy and continue to further refine our commercial strategy, recognizing that some of the changes brought about by the COVID-19 pandemic, such as ongoing restrictions to access prescribers by traditional sales personnel, will likely persist after the resolution of the pandemic. We are evolving our commercial strategies and deployment of resources to address these changes in market dynamics as we seek to increase awareness of TAZVERIK in ES and FL.\nAlthough the initiation, enrollment and completion of our ongoing and planned clinical trials have not been meaningfully disrupted, we have experienced some delays in clinical trial startup activities due to what we believe to be mostly related to COVID-19 related capacity constraints and resulting delays in the packaging and labeling of clinical drug supply at a third-party manufacturer. We are aware of the impact that COVID-19 continues to have on other clinical trials in our industry and there is a risk of material impact on the conduct of our clinical trials as well. We are continuing to work with our clinical trial sites as we seek to ensure study continuity, enable medical monitoring, facilitate study procedures and maintain clinical data and records, including the use of local laboratories for testing, home delivery of study drug and remote data and records monitoring.\nTo date, the COVID-19 pandemic has not had a material impact on our commercial supply chain, and we currently have a consistent supply of tazemetostat and TAZVERIK that we believe will cover our ongoing clinical development as well as the ongoing commercialization for ES and FL. From time to time, however, we have experienced some occasional delays in connection with our clinical supply, including delays related to packaging and labeling. As a proactive measure, we have taken certain steps to try to reduce the risk to our supply chain, such as advancing orders for long-lead items in anticipation of potential future delays or shortages. Because the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic could materially adversely impact our suppliers and result in delays or disruptions in our current or future supply chain, we are continuing to monitor and manage our supply chain accordingly.\nWe are implementing a multi-stage return to office plan, and in October 2021 we opened our facilities to all employees who expressed interest in participating in a return-to-office pilot program. In the meantime, many of our employees continue to work in a remote operating model. Our laboratory scientists who engage in bench research activities now have full access to our laboratories. We are using our pilot program to further evaluate this hybrid model and will use that evaluation to formulate how we will move forward. Ultimately, our return to office plan will be based primarily on guidance from federal, state and local government authorities, and we expect that some form of a hybrid model will continue to exist for us in the future.\nWe are closely monitoring the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and related developments on our business, operations and financial performance. We plan to continue to assess the potential duration, scope and severity of the COVID-19 pandemic and its impacts on our business, operations and financial performance, and to continue to work closely with our third-party vendors, collaborators and other parties in order to seek to continue to advance our efforts with respect to the commercialization of TAZVERIK and to continue to advance the development of EZM0414 and our pipeline, while making the health and safety of our employees and their families, healthcare providers, patients and communities a top priority. Due to the evolving and uncertain global impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, however, we cannot precisely determine or quantify the impact that this pandemic has had on our business, operations and financial performance to date or the impact that this pandemic will have in 2022 and beyond.\nPlease refer to our risk factors set forth in Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2021 for further discussion of risks related to the COVID-19 pandemic.\nOperating Expense Reductions\nIn response to the challenges we have continued to face since we commenced the launch of TAZVERIK in FL in June 2020, in August 2021, we determined to implement changes to our commercial strategy and organization in an effort to accelerate commercial adoption of TAZVERIK in appropriate patients while also pursuing our research and broader corporate objectives.\nOn August 9, 2021, we announced a cross-functional reduction of our 2021 budgeted headcount by approximately 20%, which included approximately 11% of our then-current workforce under the cost reduction plan. Affected employees were provided separation benefits, including severance payments along with temporary healthcare coverage assistance. The severance and termination-related costs were approximately $2.0 million. We recorded these costs in the third quarter of 2021 and expect that payments of these costs will be made through August 2022.\nIn addition to the organizational changes and cross-functional headcount reduction announced in August 2021, on March 1, 2022, we announced a further reduction of our operating expenses, including a cross-functional workforce reduction of approximately 12% of our current employees. Additionally, we announced a pipeline reprioritization. Given the breadth of our current tazemetostat clinical development program, we have discontinued enrollment in our Phase 2 study of tazemetostat in combination with rituximab with FL in the third line or later treatment settings (SYMPHONY-2, EZH-1401), as well as in our Phase 1/1b basket study evaluating tazemetostat combinations in patients with solid tumors (EZH-1301) due to evolving market dynamics and a continued focus on optimizing our investments and eliminating potentially overlapping studies.\nAs part of these March 2022 headcount reductions and our pipeline reprioritization, we are implementing further changes to our commercial strategy, to our medical affairs and clinical development teams and to our broader organization. We are focused on accelerating commercial adoption of TAZVERIK in appropriate patients and on implementing a broader operational cost reduction plan that will reduce our headcount across different areas of the organization and re-prioritize our investment of company resources in important clinical trials and programs, including our SYMPHONY-1 (EZH-302), CELLO-1 (EZH-1101), EZH-1501 and SET-101 trials.\nWe expect that these actions will allow us to keep the company in a financial position that will enable us to continue to achieve important near-term milestones and execute on our long-term strategy. As part of the March 2022 workforce reduction, affected employees will be offered separation benefits, including severance payments along with temporary healthcare coverage assistance. We estimate that the severance and termination-related costs will be approximately $2.8 - 3.2 million and expect to record these charges in the first quarter of 2022. We expect that payments of these costs will be made through the end of the fourth quarter of 2022.\nWe plan to continue to implement our broader operational expense reduction effort, and to monitor and seek opportunities to further reduce our operating expenses.\nOverview\nWe are a commercial-stage biopharmaceutical company that is committed to rewriting treatment for people with cancer through the discovery, development, and commercialization of novel epigenetic medicines. We aspire to change the standard of care for patients and physicians by developing targeted medicines with fundamentally new mechanisms of action directed at specific causes of hematological malignancies and solid tumors.\nWe have one approved product, TAZVERIK (tazemetostat), which was granted accelerated approval by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, in 2020 for epithelioid sarcoma, or ES, and FL. Our focus is on maximizing our effectiveness as a commercial organization to achieve adoption of TAZVERIK among as many appropriate patients as possible, including in earlier treatment lines and in combination regimens with the data to support this expanded use; building on TAZVERIK's pipeline-in-a-drug potential; and expanding our pipeline and evolving oncology portfolio, including with SET-101, our first-in-human Phase 1/1b trial of EZM0414, our novel, first-in-class, oral SETD2 inhibitor. We are leveraging our drug discovery platform and expertise as a leader in epigenetics, as well as our team's deep experience across clinical development and commercialization to execute on our strategy.\nIn January 2020, the FDA granted accelerated approval of TAZVERIK (tazemetostat), an oral, first in class, selective small molecule inhibitor of the EZH2 histone methyltransferase, or HMT, for the treatment of adult and pediatric patients aged 16 years and older with metastatic or locally advanced ES not eligible for complete resection. This approval was based on overall response rate and duration of response data shown in the ES cohort of our Phase 2 trial in patients with INI1-negative tumors. We continue to make TAZVERIK available to eligible patients and their physicians in the United States.\nAs part of the accelerated approval for ES, continued approval for this indication is contingent upon verification and description of clinical benefit in a confirmatory trial. To provide this confirmatory evidence to support a full approval of TAZVERIK for this indication, we are conducting a single, randomized, controlled Phase 1b/3 confirmatory trial in the United States (EZH-301) assessing tazemetostat in combination with doxorubicin compared with doxorubicin plus placebo as a front-line treatment for ES. The trial is expected to enroll approximately 152 patients. We have completed the planned enrollment in the Phase 1b safety run-in portion of the trial and the Phase 3 efficacy portion of the trial is open for accrual. We reported safety and preliminary activity data from the patients in the safety run-in portion of the EZH-301 trial at the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) Annual Meeting in June 2021.\nIn June 2020, the FDA approved a supplemental New Drug Application, or sNDA, for TAZVERIK for adult patients with relapsed or refractory (R/R) FL whose tumors are positive for an EZH2 mutation as detected by an FDA-approved test and who have received at least two prior systemic therapies, and adult patients with relapsed or refractory FL who have no satisfactory alternative treatment options. These indications were approved under accelerated approval with a priority review, based on overall response rate and duration of response data shown in the FL cohorts of our Phase 2 clinical trial in patients with EZH2 mutations and wild-type EZH2. We continue to make TAZVERIK available to eligible patients and their physicians in the United States.\nAs part of the accelerated approval for FL, continued approval for these R/R FL indications is contingent upon verification and description of clinical benefit in a confirmatory trial. To provide this confirmatory evidence to support a full approval of TAZVERIK for these indications, we are conducting a single global, randomized, adaptive Phase 1b/3 confirmatory trial (EZH-302, SYMPHONY-1) assessing the combination of tazemetostat with R2\u201d (lenalidomide and rituximab), an approved chemotherapy-free treatment regimen, compared with R2 plus placebo for R/R FL patients in the second-line or later treatment setting. We plan to leverage the confirmatory trial and also conduct post-marketing commitments to expand the TAZVERIK label into the second-line treatment setting.\nIn December 2021 we presented updated safety and activity data from the Phase 1b safety run-in portion of this confirmatory trial at the 2021 American Society of Hematology (ASH) Annual Meeting. We continue to follow the 40 patients in the Phase 1b safety run-in portion of the trial, and we expect to present follow-up data from the safety run-in portion of the trial at a medical conference later in 2022.\nWe expect that the Phase 3 portion of the SYMPHONY-1 trial will be a global, randomized and adaptive confirmatory trial in 500 patients. Based on the Phase 1b safety run-in results, in December 2021 we submitted a protocol amendment to the FDA with 800 mg twice-daily as the recommended tazemetostat dose (RP3D) for the Phase 3 portion of the trial. After completing the 30-day voluntary waiting period following submission of the protocol amendment for 800 mg RP3D without any objection from the FDA, and as we continue to conduct the Phase 1b safety run-in portion of the trial, we have accelerated global start-up activities and are activating as many study sites as possible, globally, for the Phase 3 portion of the trial. The primary endpoint for the Phase 3 portion of the trial will be based on progression free survival as determined by investigator. Based on discussions with the FDA, this portion of the trial will include two interim analyses, the first of which is for futility only and the second of which will be conducted for futility, and if 65% of progression free survival events have occurred, the trial will also include an efficacy evaluation. In July 2021 China's Center for Drug Evaluation, or CDE, approved the Investigational New Drug Application, or IND, we filed in China for SYMPHONY-1. We are currently screening\npatients in the Phase 3 portion of this trial and we expect to enroll the first patient in the Phase 3 portion of this trial in the first quarter of 2022.\nThrough our planned development efforts, our intention is to eventually make TAZVERIK available in all lines of treatment for patients with FL. In collaboration with The Lymphoma Study Association, or LYSA, and based on clinical activity observed with tazemetostat in combination with R-CHOP (rituximab, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine and prednisolone) as a front-line treatment for patients with high risk diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, or DLBCL, LYSA is conducting a Phase 1b/2 clinical trial to evaluate this combination as a front-line treatment for high-risk patients with FL and DLBCL. Patient enrollment in the Phase 2 portion of this trial is now nearly complete with 111 patients out of a target of approximately 122 patients in DLBCL and 61 patients out of a target of approximately 62 patients in FL enrolled as of February 23, 2022. We expect that interim results from the Phase 2 portion of this trial will be presented at a medical conference in the second half of 2022. We are also finalizing plans for investigator-sponsored studies to evaluate tazemetostat in combination with venetoclax or BTK inhibitors for the treatment of patients with FL in the third-line or later treatment settings.\nWe are also developing tazemetostat for the treatment of a broad range of other cancer types in multiple treatment settings. Tazemetostat has shown meaningful clinical activity as an investigational monotherapy in multiple cancer indications and has been generally well-tolerated across clinical trials to date. We believe tazemetostat is a pipeline in a product\u201d opportunity and plan to explore its potential utility in additional indications and combinations.\nThere are four areas where we see the greatest potential for tazemetostat, all of which are based on a strong scientific hypothesis and are for patients suffering from diseases that would benefit from a new effective and safe treatment option, including:\n\u2022Lymphomas and B-cell malignancies, such as DLBCL, mantle cell lymphoma, or MCL, multiple myeloma and others;\n\u2022Molecularly defined solid tumors, such as chordoma, melanoma, mesothelioma, and tumors harboring an EZH2 or SWI/SNF alteration;\n\u2022PARPi-resistant tumors, such as castration-resistant prostate cancer, small cell lung cancer, and others; and\n\u2022Immuno-oncology sensitive tumors, such as small cell lung cancer, prostate cancer and others.\nAs part of these broader tazemetostat development efforts, we are conducting a global, multi-center, open-label randomized Phase 1b/2 trial (EZH-1101, CELLO-1). The Phase 2 efficacy portion of the CELLO-1 trial, which is evaluating tazemetostat plus enzalutamide compared to enzalutamide monotherapy in patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer, or mCRPC, is approximately 75% enrolled toward a target of 80 patients and we expect to complete enrollment in the Phase 2 portion of the trial in 2022. We plan to provide updated data from the safety run-in portion of the trial as well as interim data from the Phase 2 portion of the trial in the second half of 2022.\nWe own the global development and commercialization rights to tazemetostat outside of Japan and greater China. Eisai Co. Ltd, or Eisai, holds the rights to develop and commercialize tazemetostat in Japan, and Hutchison China MediTech Investment Limited, or HutchMed, holds certain rights to develop and commercialize tazemetostat in greater China.\nTAZVERIK is available to eligible patients in the United States via a specialty distribution network. Through this specialty distribution network, we sell TAZVERIK principally to a limited number of specialty pharmacies, which dispense the product directly to patients, and specialty distributors, which in turn sell the product to hospital pharmacies and community practice pharmacies for the treatment of patients. To commercialize TAZVERIK for the approved ES and FL indications in the United States, we have built a focused field presence and marketing capabilities.\nOn August 7, 2021, we entered into a strategic collaboration pursuant to a license agreement with HutchMed through which we granted a license to HutchMed for the co-exclusive (with us) development and exclusive commercialization of tazemetostat, either as monotherapy or as a part of combinations with other therapies, including HutchMed proprietary compounds, agreed by us and HutchMed for the treatment of ES, FL and DLBCL in humans, and any additional indications agreed to by us and HutchMed in mainland China, Taiwan, Hong Kong and Macau, or the HutchMed Territory.\nFor other geographies outside the United States, we are evaluating the most efficient path to obtain marketing approval, commercialize and distribute TAZVERIK to reach patients, including pursuing potential strategic collaborations. Based on comparators and the regulatory landscape, we have decided not to pursue marketing approval of tazemetostat as monotherapy from the European Medicines Agency, or EMA at this time.\nBeyond tazemetostat, we are utilizing our drug discovery platform to progress preclinical efforts and discover and identify additional product candidates to expand our pipeline of inhibitors against several classes of chromatin modifying proteins, or CMPs, including HMTs, histone acetyltransferases, or HATs, and helicases.\nOur most advanced product candidate, EZM0414, is a novel first-in-class oral inhibitor of the SETD2 HMT.\nSETD2 is an HMT that plays multiple important roles in oncogenesis. Based on the potential of SETD2 inhibition demonstrated in multiple preclinical settings, including multiple myeloma, and in particular high risk t(4;14) multiple myeloma and in other B-cell malignancies such as DLBCL, as well as in combination with existing and emerging therapies including tazemetostat, we submitted an IND for EZM0414 to the FDA in July 2021. We received study may proceed\u201d from the FDA with respect to our IND for EZM0414 in July 2021. In October 2021, EZM0414 was granted Fast Track designation by the FDA in adult patients with relapsed or refractory DLBCL and in January 2022 we received orphan drug designation from the FDA for EZM0414 for the treatment of multiple myeloma. In the fourth quarter of 2021, we initiated a Phase 1/1b trial (SET-101) intended to evaluate the safety and optimize the dose and schedule of EZM0414 in R/R multiple myeloma and DLBCL patients. The Phase 1 portion of our SET-101 trial is a 3 + 3 dose escalation design and includes six planned dose levels ranging from 100 mg to 900 mg once daily. Once we have optimized the dose, we then expect to expand the trial to two patient cohorts in multiple myeloma: t(4;14) multiple myeloma and non t(4;14) multiple myeloma. Based on dose optimization data from the trial, we may add a third patient cohort in DLBCL. We are screening patients with one site open for the Phase 1 dose escalation portion of the SET-101 trial, which we expect will enroll between 30-36 patients. We plan to provide updates as the trial reaches key enrollment milestones along with preliminary data from the trial in 2022.\nTo date we have entered into various strategic collaborations, including with Eisai, HutchMed, Roche and other third parties. As one of several key aspects of our strategy, we plan to continue to leverage our existing collaborations and to seek to identify new potential strategic collaborations to further support and grow our business in and outside of the United States.\nThrough December 31, 2021, in addition to revenues from product sales, we have raised an aggregate of $1,568.3 million to fund our operations. This includes $268.8 of non-equity funding through our collaboration agreements, $368.1 million of funding, consisting of $150.0 million in equity funding received through agreements with RPI Finance Trust, or RPI, and $218.1 million in debt financing received through a loan agreement with BioPharma Credit Investments V (Master) LP and BPCR Limited Partnership (as transferee of BioPharma Credit Investments V (Master) LP's interest as a lender), or the Lenders, $855.4 million from the sale of common stock and series A convertible preferred stock in our public and at-the-market offerings and $76.0 million from the sale of redeemable convertible preferred stock in private financings prior to our initial public offering in May 2013.\nAs of December 31, 2021, we had $176.8 million in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities. In January 2022, the Company raised approximately $79.5 million in net proceeds (after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering costs) from the sale of 56,666,667 shares of its common stock in a public offering at a price of $1.50 per share.\nWe commenced active operations in early 2008, and since inception, have incurred significant operating losses. Our net loss was $251.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. As of December 31, 2021, our accumulated deficit totaled $1,239.8 million. Notwithstanding our sales of TAZVERIK, we expect to continue to incur significant expenses and operating losses over the next several years. Our net losses may fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter and year to year. We expect our expenses to increase in connection with our ongoing activities, particularly as we expect to incur significant commercialization expenses related to product manufacturing, marketing, sales and distribution. In addition, we expect our expenses to increase as we fund our tazemetostat development program; make any milestone and royalty payments provided for and achieved under the amended and restated collaboration and license agreement with Eisai; pay interest and principal associated with our amended and restated loan agreement with BioPharma Credit Investments V (Master) LP, BPCR Limited Partnership and BioPharma Credit PLC, or the Amended and Restated Loan Agreement; and continue research and development and initiate clinical trials of, and seek regulatory approval for, any future product candidates.\nFunding Agreements with BioPharma Credit Investments V (Master) LP, BPCR Limited Partnership, BioPharma Credit PLC and RPI Finance Trust\nWe executed a purchase agreement with RPI on November 4, 2019, or the RPI Purchase Agreement. Pursuant to the RPI Purchase Agreement, we sold to RPI 6,666,667 shares of our common stock and a warrant to purchase up to 2,500,000 shares of our common stock at an exercise price of $20.00 per share, or the Common Stock Warrant. We also sold our rights to receive royalties from Eisai with respect to net sales by Eisai of tazemetostat products in Japan, or the Japan Royalty, pursuant to the amended and restated collaboration and license agreement between us and Eisai, dated as of March 12, 2015, or the Eisai License Agreement. In consideration for the sale of shares of our common stock, the Common Stock Warrant and the Japan Royalty, RPI paid us $100.0 million upon the closing of the RPI Purchase Agreement in November 2019. In addition, RPI agreed, in connection with RPI's acquisition from Eisai of the right to receive royalties from us under the Eisai License Agreement, to reduce our royalty obligation by low single digits upon the achievement of specified annual net sales levels. We also had the option to sell to RPI $50.0 million of shares of common stock for an 18-month period beginning November 4, 2019, or the Put Option. On February 11, 2020, we sold 2,500,000 shares of common stock to RPI for an aggregate of $50.0 million in proceeds at a sale price of $20.00 per share of common stock pursuant to the Put Option.\nOn November 4, 2019, we also entered into a Loan Agreement with BioPharma Credit PLC, or the Collateral Agent, and the Lenders, providing for up to $70.0 million in secured term loans to be advanced in up to three tranches, or the Loan Agreement. We borrowed $70.0 million in the aggregate under the three tranches pursuant to the Loan Agreement.\nOn November 3, 2020, we, the Collateral Agent and the Lenders amended and restated the Loan Agreement, or, as amended and restated, the Amended and Restated Loan Agreement. The Amended and Restated Loan Agreement provides for, among other things, an additional secured term loan facility of $150.0 million, or the Tranche D Loan. On November 18, 2020, we borrowed the Tranche D Loan.\nThe obligations under the Amended and Restated Loan Agreement remain secured by a first priority security interest that was granted at the time of the Loan Agreement in and a lien on substantially all of our assets, subject to certain exceptions.\nThe Amended and Restated Loan Agreement contains certain customary representations and warranties, affirmative and negative covenants and events of default applicable to us and our subsidiaries. If an event of default occurs and is continuing, the Collateral Agent under the Amended and Restated Loan Agreement may, among other things, accelerate the loans and foreclose on the collateral. See Note 13, Long-Term Debt, of the notes to our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a description of the key terms of the Amended and Restated Loan Agreement.\nCollaborations\nRefer to Item 1, Business--Our Collaborations and Note 11, Collaborations, of the notes to our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a description of the key terms of our arrangements with Eisai Co. Ltd, or Eisai, Hutchison China MediTech Investment Limited, or HutchMed, and Roche Sequencing Solutions, Inc., or Roche Sequencing. On December 16, 2021, we received a notice of termination of our collaboration and license agreement with Glaxo Group Limited, effective March 16, 2022.\nResults of Operations\nFor a discussion related to the results of operations for 2020 compared to 2019, refer to Part II, Item 7, \"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Results of Operations\" in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2020 filed with the SEC on February 23, 2021.\nRevenues\nThe following is a comparison of total revenues for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020:\n\nProduct Revenues, net\nNet product revenues represent U.S. sales from our sole commercial product, TAZVERIK, which was first approved by the FDA on January 23, 2020, less allowances and accruals. During the years ended December 31, 2021, and 2020 net product revenues were $30.9 million and $11.5 million, respectively. The $19.4 million increase reflects the timing of approval of TAZVERIK for ES in January 2020 and the approval of TAZVERIK for FL in June 2020. The increase also reflects the inclusion of $7.4 million in product revenue during the year ended December 31, 2021 related to the sale of commercial product by one of our customers to a third-party pharmaceutical company for use in its clinical trials. Sales allowances and accruals consisted of patient financial assistance, distribution fees, discounts, and chargebacks.\nCollaboration and Other Revenue\nOur collaboration and other revenue during the periods included amounts recognized from deferred revenue related to upfront payments for licenses or options to obtain licenses in the future, research and development services revenue earned, milestone payments earned under collaboration and license agreements with our collaboration partners and revenue from the sale of tazemetostat active pharmaceutical ingredient (API) and drug product to our licensees and collaborators.\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, we recognized $6.5 million and $4.3 million, respectively, in collaboration and other revenue. In 2021 we recognized $6.5 million in collaboration and other revenue in connection with our waiver of our exclusive right to the supply of tazemetostat drug substance from Eisai's manufacturer, the manufacture and supply of tazemetostat, and technical support services under our supply agreement with Eisai. In 2020 we recognized $3.8 million of collaboration and other revenue under our collaboration agreement with Celgene related to the recognition of the remaining deferred revenue related to the agreement, which was recognized as revenue as a result of the termination of the collaboration agreement with Celgene. We recognized $0.5 million in collaboration and other revenue under our collaboration agreement with Boehringer Ingelheim during the year ended December 31, 2020 related to amendments to extend the research period under the collaboration agreement under which Boehringer Ingelheim funded $0.5 million of additional\nresearch activities. In December 2020, we received written notice from Boehringer Ingelheim to terminate the collaboration agreement, effective January 31, 2021.\nCost of Revenue\nThe following is a comparison of cost of revenue for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020:\n\nThe cost of revenue consists of costs related to our product revenue and other revenue for the sales of TAZVERIK as well as tazemetostat drug product and drug substance. These costs include materials, labor, manufacturing overhead, amortization of milestone payments, and royalties payable on net sales of TAZVERIK and sales of tazemetostat drug product. Costs related to the sale of TAZVERIK are included in cost of product revenue while cost related to the sale of tazemetostat drug product and drug substance are included in cost of other revenue.\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, the cost of product revenue was $9.7 million and $5.1 million, respectively, and consisted of $0.9 million and $0.4 million, respectively, in costs associated with manufacturing TAZVERIK, $4.2 million and $3.0 million, respectively, in amortization expense related to the two $25.0 million milestone payments under our agreement with Eisai upon regulatory approval of TAZVERIK for ES and upon regulatory approval of TAZVERIK for FL, and $4.6 million and $1.7 million, respectively, in worldwide royalties due under the Eisai License Agreement on net sales of TAZVERIK in the year ended December 31, 2021. Cost of other revenue during the year ended December 31, 2021 consisted of $0.8 million of costs related to sales of tazemetostat drug product to Eisai. All product costs incurred prior to FDA approval of TAZVERIK in January 2020 were expensed as research and development expenses. We expect our cost of product revenues (excluding amortization of intangible assets) to continue to be positively impacted during 2022, as we sell through certain inventory that was expensed prior to FDA approval of TAZVERIK in January 2020.\nResearch and Development\nResearch and development expenses consist of expenses incurred in performing research and development activities, including clinical trials and related clinical manufacturing expenses, fees paid to external providers of research and development services, third-party clinical research organizations, or CROs, compensation and benefits for full-time research and development employees, facilities expenses, overhead expenses, and other outside expenses. Most of our research and development costs are external costs, which we track on a program-by-program basis. Our internal research and development costs are primarily compensation expenses for our full-time research and development employees, including stock-based compensation expense.\nIn our early-stage research, we identify and prioritize novel CMPs that are implicated in cancer, and seek to develop potent and selective small molecule inhibitors of these targets. During this phase of research, our external costs primarily relate to lead discovery, biology, drug metabolism and pharmacokinetics and chemistry services from a multinational network of third-party providers of research and development services. As our product candidates\nprogress into preclinical and clinical development, external costs are driven by clinical trial costs, manufacturing expenses, and third-party research and development expenses.\nIn circumstances where our collaboration and license agreements provide for equally co-funded global development under joint risk sharing collaborations, and where we are the study sponsor, amounts received for co-funding are recorded as a reduction to research and development expense.\nThe following is a comparison of research and development expenses for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 :\n\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2021, total research and development expenses increased by $20.1 million compared to the year ended December 31, 2020, primarily due to increases in clinical trial expenses and discovery research activities related to tazemetostat in indications other than the approved indications as well as our SETD2 inhibitor EZM0414 program. Additionally, severance and termination-related costs totaling $0.4 million were recorded as research and development expenses in 2021 related to the August 2021 cost reduction plan. Increases in research and development expenses were partially offset by decreases in costs associated with the build-out of our regulatory and late-stage development groups.\nThe following table illustrates the components of our research and development expenses:\n\nExternal research and development expenses include external manufacturing costs related to the acquisition of active pharmaceutical ingredient and manufacturing of clinical drug supply, ongoing clinical trial costs, discovery and preclinical research in support of the tazemetostat program and expenses associated with our SETD2 inhibitor EZM0414 program.\nExternal research and development expenses for tazemetostat and related EZH2 programs increased by $12.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to the year ended December 31, 2020. The increase in external tazemetostat and related EZH2 programs research and development expenses in the year ended December 31, 2021 relates to increases in clinical trial expenses and discovery research activities related to tazemetostat in other indications associated with increased clinical trial activity, which were offset by decreases in costs associated with the build-out of our regulatory and late-stage development groups that we conducted in 2020.\nExternal research and development expenses for our EZM0414 SETD2 inhibitor program increased $2.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to the 2020. We designated the program as a clinical development program in the third quarter of 2021. Prior to the designation of the program as a clinical development program, we allocated costs related to the EZM0414 program to external research and development expenses for discovery and preclinical stage product programs.\nExternal research and development expenses for discovery and preclinical stage product programs increased by $1.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to the year ended December 31, 2020, was primarily\nrelated to increased spending for discovery research activities and development activities related to our preclinical programs, partially offset by reduced preclinical costs in connection with our EZM0414 SETD2 inhibitor program as a result of the designation of the EZM0414 SETD2 inhibitor program as a clinical development program in the third quarter of 2021.\nUnallocated personnel and other expenses are comprised of compensation expenses for our full-time research and development employees and other general research and development expenses. Unallocated personnel and other expenses for the year ended December 31, 2021 increased $4.4 million compared to the year ended December 31, 2020. The increase is a result of increases in facilities and equipment related expenses and in unallocated personnel costs, offset by an increase in the allocation of expenses to projects.\nWe expect that research and development expenses will decrease in 2022, as we continue to implement our operating expense reductions and prioritize our investment of company resources in important clinical trials and programs, including our SYMPHONY-1 (EZH-302) and CELLO-1 (EZH-1101), EZH-1501 and SET-101 trials.\nSelling, General and Administrative\nSelling, general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and related benefits, including stock-based compensation, related to our executive, finance, intellectual property, business development and support functions. Other selling, general and administrative expenses include allocated facility-related costs not otherwise included in research and development expenses, travel expenses and professional fees for auditing, tax and legal services, including intellectual property and general legal services.\nThe following is a comparison of selling, general and administrative expenses for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 :\n\nFor the year ended December 31, 2021, our selling, general and administrative expenses increased $8.8 million compared to the year ended December 31, 2020, primarily due to increased commercialization activities, including the build-out of our sales force and commercial infrastructure to support the commercial launch of TAZVERIK in the approved ES and FL indications, and increased personnel related expenses. Additionally, severance and termination-related costs totaling $1.6 million were recorded as selling, general and administrative expenses in 2021 related to the August 2021 cost reduction plan.\nWe expect that selling, general and administrative expenses will decrease in 2022 as we implement changes to our commercial strategy and organization in an effort to accelerate commercial adoption of TAZVERIK in appropriate patients as well as an operational cost reduction across general and administrative functions as part of our prioritization of our investment of company resources in important clinical trials and programs.\nOther (Expense) Income, Net\nThe following is a comparison of other (expense) income, net for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020:\n\nOther (expense) income, net consists of interest income earned on our cash equivalents and marketable securities, net of imputed interest expense paid under our capital lease obligation. The increase in other expense for the year ended December 31, 2021 is principally due to an increase in interest expense of $15.0 million incurred in connection with our long-term debt obligations under our Amended and Restated Loan Agreement which increased to a principal balance of $220.0 million in the fourth quarter of 2020, a decrease in net interest income of $2.6 million due to a combination of lower cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities combined with lower rates of return, and an increase in non-cash interest expense related to the sale of future royalties of $0.4 million. These increases in other expense were offset by income related to the changes in fair value of warrant liability of $11.1 million due to a decrease in our stock price.\nIncome Tax Benefit\nWe evaluated the expected recoverability of our net deferred tax assets as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, and determined that there was insufficient positive evidence to support the recoverability of these net deferred tax assets, concluding it is more likely than not that our net deferred tax assets would not be realized in the future; therefore, the Company provided a full valuation allowance against its net deferred tax asset balance as of December 31, 2021 and 2020.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nFor a discussion related to our cash flows for 2020 compared to 2019, refer to Part II, Item 7, \"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Liquidity and Capital Resources\" in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2020 filed with the SEC on February 23, 2021\nThrough December 31, 2021, in addition to revenues from product sales, we have raised an aggregate of $1,568.3 million to fund our operations. This includes $268.8 million in non-equity funding through our collaboration agreements, $368.1 million of funding, consisting of $150.0 million in equity funding received through agreements with RPI Finance Trust, or RPI, and $218.1 million in debt financing received through a loan agreement with BioPharma Credit Investments V (Master) LP and BPCR Limited Partnership (as transferee of BioPharma Credit Investments V (Master) LP's interest as a lender), or the Lenders, $855.4 million from the sale of common stock and series A convertible preferred stock in our public offerings and at-the-market offerings and $76.0 million was from the sale of redeemable convertible preferred stock in private financings prior to our initial public offering in May 2013. As of December 31, 2021, we had $176.8 million in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities.\nOn May 6, 2021, we entered into an Open Market Sale AgreementSM, or ATM Sale Agreement, with Jefferies LLC, or Jefferies, to sell, from time to time, shares of our common stock having an aggregate offering price of up to $200,000,000 through an at the market offering\u201d as defined in Rule 415 under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, under which Jefferies would act as sales agent, which we refer to as the ATM Offering. The shares that may be sold under the ATM Sale Agreement, if any, are issued and sold pursuant to our shelf registration statement on Form S-3 that was declared effective by the Securities and Exchange Commission on May 13, 2021. Through December 31, 2021, we have sold a total of 3,840,977 shares under the ATM Offering, resulting in aggregate net proceeds to us of approximately $16.0 million after deducting issuance costs of $0.5 million.\nIn addition to our existing cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, we are eligible to earn milestone payments under our collaboration agreement with HutchMed. Our ability to earn these payments and the timing of earning these payments is dependent upon the outcome of research and development activities and is uncertain at this time.\nIn January 2022, we raised approximately $79.5 million in net proceeds (after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering costs, but excluding any expenses and other costs reimbursed by the underwriters) from the sale of 56,666,667 shares of our common stock in a public offering at a price of $1.50 per share.\nFunding Requirements\nOur primary uses of capital are clinical trial costs, third-party research and development services, expenses related to commercialization, debt service obligations, compensation and related expenses, laboratory and related supplies, legal and other regulatory expenses and general overhead costs.\nBecause the continued approval of TAZVERIK in the approved indications is contingent upon verification and description of clinical benefit in confirmatory trials, and because we are developing tazemetostat for other indications, we cannot estimate the actual amounts necessary to successfully complete the development and commercialization of TAZVERIK for the approved indications or the indications that we are exploring or that we may plan to explore. Because EZM0414 is an early clinical product candidate and any future product candidates are in various stages of preclinical development with uncertain outcomes, we also cannot estimate the actual amounts necessary to successfully complete the development and commercialization of EZM0414 or future product candidates. Because of these uncertainties, we also cannot estimate whether, or when, we may achieve profitability. Until such time, if ever, as we can generate substantial product revenues, we expect to finance our cash needs through a combination of equity or debt financings and collaboration arrangements. Except for any obligations of our collaborators to make license, milestone or royalty payments under our agreements with them, we do not have any committed external sources of liquidity. To the extent that we raise additional capital through the future sale of equity or debt, the ownership interest of our stockholders may be diluted, and the terms of these securities may include liquidation or other preferences that adversely affect the rights of our existing common stockholders. Debt\nfinancing and preferred equity financing, if available, may involve agreements that include covenants limiting or restricting our ability to take specific actions, such as incurring additional debt, making capital expenditures or declaring dividends. If we raise additional funds through collaboration arrangements in the future, we may have to relinquish valuable rights to our technologies, future revenue streams or product candidates or grant licenses on terms that may not be favorable to us. If we are unable to raise any additional funds that may be needed through equity or debt financings when needed, we may be required to delay, limit, reduce or terminate our product development or future commercialization efforts or grant rights to develop and market product candidates that we would otherwise prefer to develop and market ourselves.\nOutlook\nBased on our current operating plan, we expect that our existing cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities as of December 31, 2021, together with the $79.5 million in net proceeds raised from the common stock offering in January 2022 and cash we expect to generate from product sales, will be sufficient to fund our planned operating expenses and capital expenditure requirements and pay our debt service obligations as they become due into the third quarter of 2023, without giving effect to any potential milestone payments we may receive under our collaboration agreements. We have based this estimate on assumptions that may prove to be wrong, such as the revenue that we expect to generate from the sale of our products, or as to our clinical development costs, particularly as the process of testing drug candidates in clinical trials is costly and the timing of progress in these trials is uncertain. As a result, we could use our capital resources sooner than we expect.\nCash Flows\nThe following is a summary of cash flows for the years ended for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020:\n\nNet Cash Used in Operating Activities\nNet cash used in operating activities was $226.9 million during the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to $206.3 million during the year ended December 31, 2020. The increase in net cash used in operating activities of $20.6 million primarily relates to our net loss of $251.1 million and the $11.1 million change in fair value of warrants, partially offset by changes in working capital of $0.2 million, net depreciation and amortization of $5.2 million, non-cash stock-based compensation of $26.8 million, and non-cash interest expense associated with the sale of future royalties of $1.8 million.\nNet Cash Provided by (Used in) Investing Activities\nNet cash provided by investing activities during the year ended December 31, 2021 reflects maturities of available-for-sale securities of $388.6 million, offset by $262.6 million of purchases of available-for-sale securities, and $0.5 million of purchases of property and equipment.\nNet cash used in investing activities during the year ended December 31, 2020 reflects $276.4 million of purchases of available for sale securities, a $25.0 million milestone payment under the Eisai collaboration agreement upon regulatory approval of tazemetostat for ES, a $25.0 million milestone payment under the Eisai collaboration agreement upon regulatory approval of tazemetostat for FL, and $0.9 million of purchases of property and equipment, offset by maturities and sales of available for sale securities of $312.7 million.\nNet Cash Provided by Financing Activities\nNet cash provided by financing activities of $31.5 million during the year ended December 31, 2021 primarily reflects net proceeds from the sale of common stock under the ATM Sale Agreement of $16.0 million, the purchases of shares under our employee stock purchase plan of $1.9 million, stock option exercises of $0.9 million, and $13.1 million from the issuance of the HutchMed Warrant, partially offset by the payment of offering costs of $0.3 million related to the ATM program.\nNet cash provided by financing activities of $249.7 million during the year ended December 31, 2020 primarily reflects cash received from the sale of common stock of $50.0 million in connection with our exercise of our Put Option to sell shares of our common stock to Royalty Pharma, net cash received during the period from Tranche B Tranche C and Tranche D Loan borrowings totaling $195.0 million under the Amended and Restated Loan Agreement, stock option exercises of $6.7 million, and the purchases of shares under our employee stock purchase plan of $1.3 million, partially offset by payments of debt issuance costs of $3.1 million and offering costs of $0.1 million.\nContractual Obligations and Contingent Liabilities\nOn August 11, 2021, we entered into a fifth amendment to the Technology Square Lease, the Fifth Amendment, with ARE-TECH Square, LLC. Under the Fifth Amendment, we extended the term of the Technology Square Lease through November 30, 2024. Under the Fifth Amendment, we will continue to pay the current monthly base rent amount contemplated by the Technology Square Lease through November 30, 2022, with an increase commencing on December 1, 2022 and adjusting the monthly base rent amount to approximately $377,000 and an increase commencing on December 1, 2023 and adjusting the monthly base rent amount to approximately $388,000 through November 30, 2024. Under the current terms of the Technology Square Lease, we do not have any further right to extend the term beyond November 30, 2024.\nWe remain committed to fund $1.0 million of development costs payable to Roche Molecular, or Roche, upon certain development and regulatory milestones, under our amended companion diagnostic agreement with Roche.\nWe have incurred secured indebtedness of $220.0 million under our amended and restated loan agreement with BioPharma Credit Investments V (Master) LP, BPCR Limited Partnership and BioPharma Credit PLC. The interest rate for the loans under the agreement are determined by reference to a Eurodollar rate plus 7.75% above such Eurodollar rate subject to a 2.00% floor. Interest is paid quarterly with principal repayments beginning in the first quarter of 2024. Our long-term debt obligation is more fully described in Note 13, Long-Term Debt to the financial statements in Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nThis description of our contractual obligations does not include potential future milestones or royalties that we may be required to make under license and collaboration agreements due to the uncertainty of events requiring payment under these agreements.\nWe enter into contracts in the normal course of business with clinical research organizations for clinical and preclinical research studies, external manufacturers for product for use in our clinical trials, and other research supplies and other services as part of our operations. These contracts generally provide for termination on notice, and therefore are cancelable contracts and not included in contractual commitments.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Use of Estimates\nOur management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the balance sheets and the reported amounts of collaboration revenue, inventory and expenses during the reporting periods. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances at the time such estimates are made. Actual results and outcomes may differ materially from our estimates, judgments and assumptions. We\nperiodically review our estimates in light of changes in circumstances, facts and experience. The effects of material revisions in estimates are reflected in the consolidated financial statements prospectively from the date of the change in estimate.\nWe define our critical accounting policies as those accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America that require us to make subjective estimates and judgments about matters that are uncertain and are likely to have a material impact on our financial condition and results of operations as well as the specific manner in which we apply those principles. Management has determined that our most critical accounting policies are those relating to revenue recognition, research and development expenses, including our accounting for clinical trial expense and accruals, inventory and going concern. As our clinical development plan for tazemetostat and EZM0414 progresses, we expect research and development expenses and, in particular, our accounting for clinical trial accruals to be an increasingly important critical accounting policy.\nRevenue Recognition - Product Revenue\nWe recognize revenue when our customer obtains control of promised goods or services, in an amount that reflects the consideration which we expect to receive in exchange for those goods or services. To determine revenue recognition, we perform the following five steps: (i) identify the contract(s) with a customer; (ii) identify the performance obligations in the contract; (iii) determine the transaction price; (iv) allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract; and (v) recognize revenue when (or as) we satisfy a performance obligation. We only apply the five-step model to contracts when it is probable that we will collect the consideration we are entitled to in exchange for the goods or services we transfer to the customer.\nWe sell TAZVERIK in the United States principally to a limited number of specialty pharmacies, which dispense the product directly to patients, and specialty distributors, which in turn sell the product to hospital pharmacies and community practice pharmacies (collectively, healthcare providers) for the treatment of patients. The specialty pharmacies and specialty distributors are referred to as our customers.\nRevenue is recognized by us when the customer obtains control of the product, which occurs at a point in time, typically when the product is received by our customers. We provide a right of return to our customers for unopened product for a limited time before and after its expiration date, which lapses upon shipment to a patient. Healthcare providers to whom specialty distributors sell TAZVERIK hold limited inventory that is designated for patients, and we are able to monitor inventory levels in the distribution channel, thereby limiting the risk of return.\nReserves for Variable Consideration\nRevenues from product sales are recorded at the net sales price (transaction price), which includes estimates of variable consideration for which reserves are established and which result from discounts, returns, chargebacks, rebates, co-pay assistance and other allowances that are offered within contracts between us and our customers, health care providers, payors and other indirect customers relating to our product sales. These reserves are based on the amounts earned or to be claimed on the related sales and are classified as reductions of accounts receivable (if the amount is payable to the customer) or a current liability (if the amount is payable to a party other than a customer). Where appropriate, these estimates take into consideration a range of possible outcomes that are probability-weighted for relevant factors such as our historical experience, current contractual and statutory requirements, specific known market events and trends, industry data and forecasted customer buying and payment patterns. Overall, these reserves reflect our best estimates of the amount of consideration to which we are entitled based on the terms of the contract. The amount of variable consideration that is included in the transaction price may be constrained, and is included in the net sales price only to the extent that it is probable that a significant reversal in the amount of the cumulative revenue recognized will not occur in a future period. Actual amounts of consideration ultimately received may differ from our estimates. If actual results in the future vary from our estimates, we will adjust these estimates, which would affect net product revenue and earnings in the period such variances become known.\nTrade Discounts and Allowances: We generally provide customers with discounts that include incentive fees that are explicitly stated in our contracts and are recorded as a reduction of revenue in the period the related product revenue is recognized. In addition, we receive sales order management, data and distribution services from certain customers. To the extent the services received are distinct from our sale of products to the customer, these payments are\nclassified in selling, general and administrative expenses in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss.\nProduct Returns: Consistent with industry practice, we generally offer customers a limited right of return based on the product's expiration date for product that has been purchased from us, which lapses upon shipment to a patient. We estimate the amount of our product sales that may be returned by our customers and record this estimate as a reduction of revenue in the period the related product revenue is recognized. We currently estimate product return liabilities using available industry data and our own historical sales information, including our visibility into the inventory remaining in the distribution channel.\nProvider Chargebacks and Discounts: Chargebacks for fees and discounts to providers represent the estimated obligations resulting from contractual commitments to sell products to qualified healthcare providers at prices lower than the list prices charged to customers who directly purchase the product from us. Customers charge us for the difference between what they pay for the product and the ultimate selling price to the qualified healthcare providers. These reserves are established in the same period that the related revenue is recognized, resulting in a reduction of product revenue and accounts receivable. Chargeback amounts are generally determined at the time of resale to the qualified healthcare provider by customers, and we generally issue credits for such amounts within a few weeks of the customer's notification to us of the resale. Reserves for chargebacks consist of credits that we expect to issue for units that remain in the distribution channel inventories at each reporting period end that we expect will be sold to qualified healthcare providers, and chargebacks that customers have claimed but for which we have not yet issued a credit.\nGovernment Rebates: We are subject to discount obligations under state Medicaid programs and Medicare. We estimate our Medicaid and Medicare rebates based upon a range of possible outcomes that are probability-weighted for the estimated payor mix. These reserves are recorded in the same period the related revenue is recognized, resulting in a reduction of product revenue and the establishment of a current liability that is included in accrued expenses on the consolidated balance sheet. For Medicare, we also estimate the number of patients in the prescription drug coverage gap for whom we will owe an additional liability under the Medicare Part D program. Our liability for these rebates consists of invoices received for claims from prior quarters that have not been paid or for which an invoice has not yet been received, estimates of claims for the current quarter, and estimated future claims that will be made for product that has been recognized as revenue, but remains in the distribution channel inventories at period end.\nPayor Rebates: We may contract with various private payor organizations, primarily insurance companies and pharmacy benefit managers, for the payment of rebates with respect to utilization of our products. We estimate these rebates and record such estimates in the same period the related revenue is recognized, resulting in a reduction of product revenue and the establishment of a current liability.\nOther Incentives/Patient Assistance Programs: We also offer voluntary patient assistance programs such as co-pay assistance. Co-pay assistance programs are intended to provide financial assistance to qualified commercially insured patients with prescription drug co-payments required by payors. The calculation of the accrual for co-pay assistance is based on an estimate of claims and the cost per claim that we expect to receive associated with product that has been recognized as revenue, but remains in in the distribution channel inventories at period end.\nRevenue Recognition - Collaboration Revenue\nEffective January 1, 2018, we adopted ASC, Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, or ASC 606, using the modified retrospective transition method. Under this method, results for reporting periods beginning after January 1, 2018 are presented pursuant to ASC 606, while prior period amounts are not adjusted and continue to be reported in accordance with ASC 605. This standard applies to all contracts with customers, except for contracts that are within the scope of other standards, such as leases, insurance, collaboration arrangements and financial instruments. Under ASC 606, an entity recognizes revenue when its customer obtains control of promised goods or services, in an amount that reflects the consideration which the entity expects to receive in exchange for those goods or services. To determine revenue recognition for arrangements that an entity determines are within the scope of ASC 606, the entity performs the following five steps: (i) identify the contract(s) with a customer; (ii) identify the\nperformance obligations in the contract; (iii) determine the transaction price; (iv) allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract; and (v) recognize revenue when (or as) the entity satisfies a performance obligation. We only apply the five-step model to contracts when it is probable that the entity will collect the consideration it is entitled to in exchange for the goods or services it transfers to the customer. At contract inception, once the contract is determined to be within the scope of ASC 606, we assess the goods or services promised within each contract and determines those that are performance obligations, and assesses whether each promised good or service is distinct. We then recognize as revenue the amount of the transaction price that is allocated to the respective performance obligation when (or as) the performance obligation is satisfied.\nWe have entered into collaboration and license agreements, which are within the scope of ASC 606, to discover, develop, manufacture and commercialize product candidates. The terms of these agreements typically contain multiple promises or obligations, which may include: (i) licenses, or options to obtain licenses, to compounds directed to specific targets (referred to as exclusive licenses\u201d) and (ii) research and development activities to be performed on behalf of the collaboration partner related to the licensed targets. Payments to us under these agreements may include non-refundable license fees, customer option exercise fees, payments for research activities, reimbursement of certain costs, payments based upon the achievement of certain milestones and royalties on any resulting net product sales.\nWe first evaluate license and/or collaboration arrangements to determine whether the arrangement (or part of the arrangement) represents a collaborative arrangement pursuant to ASC Topic 808, Collaborative Arrangements, based on the risks and rewards and activities of the parties pursuant to the contractual arrangement. We account for collaborative arrangements (or elements within the contract that are deemed part of a collaborative arrangement), which represent a collaborative relationship and not a customer relationship, outside the scope of ASC 606. Our collaborations primarily represent revenue arrangements. For the arrangements or arrangement components that are subject to revenue accounting guidance, in determining the appropriate amount of revenue to be recognized as it fulfills its obligations under each of its agreements, we perform the following steps: (i) identification of the promised goods or services in the contract; (ii) determination of whether the promised goods or services are performance obligations including whether they are distinct in the context of the contract; (iii) measurement of the transaction price, including the constraint on variable consideration; (iv) allocation of the transaction price to the performance obligations; and (v) recognition of revenue when (or as) we satisfy each performance obligation. As part of the accounting for these arrangements, we must use significant judgment to determine: a) the number of performance obligations based on the determination under step (ii) above and whether those performance obligations are distinct from other performance obligations in the contract; b) the transaction price under step (iii) above; and c) the stand-alone selling price for each performance obligation identified in the contract for the allocation of transaction price in step (iv) above. We use judgment to determine whether milestones or other variable consideration, except for sales-based royalties, should be included in the transaction price as described further below. The transaction price is allocated to each performance obligation on a relative stand-alone selling price basis, for which we recognize revenue as or when the performance obligations under the contract are satisfied. In determining the stand-alone selling price of a license to our proprietary technology or a material right provided by a customer option, we consider market conditions as well as entity-specific factors, including those factors contemplated in negotiating the agreements as well as internally developed estimates that include assumptions related to the market opportunity, estimated development costs, probability of success and the time needed to commercialize a product candidate pursuant to the license. In validating its estimated stand-alone selling price, we evaluate whether changes in the key assumptions used to determine its estimated stand-alone selling price will have a significant effect on the allocation of arrangement consideration between performance obligations.\nAmounts received prior to revenue recognition are recorded as deferred revenue. Amounts expected to be recognized as revenue within the 12 months following the balance sheet date are classified as current portion of deferred revenue in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. Amounts not expected to be recognized as revenue within the 12 months following the balance sheet date are classified as deferred revenue, net of current portion. Amounts recognized as revenue, but not yet received or invoiced are generally recognized as contract assets.\nExclusive Licenses - If the license to our intellectual property is determined to be distinct from the other promises or performance obligations identified in the arrangement, which generally include research and development services, we recognize revenue from non-refundable, upfront fees allocated to the license when the license is transferred to\nthe customer and the customer is able to use and benefit from the license. In assessing whether a license is distinct from the other promises, we consider relevant facts and circumstances of each arrangement, including the research and development capabilities of the collaboration partner and the availability of the associated expertise in the general marketplace. In addition, we consider whether the collaboration partner can benefit from the license for its intended purpose without the receipt of the remaining promises, whether the value of the license is dependent on the unsatisfied promises, whether there are other vendors that could provide the remaining promises, and whether it is separately identifiable from the remaining promises. For licenses that are combined with other promises, we utilize judgment to assess the nature of the combined performance obligation to determine whether the combined performance obligation is satisfied over time or at a point in time and, if over time, the appropriate method of measuring progress for purposes of recognizing revenue. We evaluate the measure of progress each reporting period and, if necessary, adjusts the measure of performance and related revenue recognition. The measure of progress, and thereby periods over which revenue should be recognized, are subject to estimates by management and may change over the course of the research and development and licensing agreement.\nResearch and Development Services - The promises under our collaboration and license agreements generally include research and development services to be performed by us on behalf of the collaboration partner. For performance obligations that include research and development services, we generally recognize revenue allocated to such performance obligations based on an appropriate measure of progress. We utilize judgment to determine the appropriate method of measuring progress for purposes of recognizing revenue, which is generally an input measure such as costs incurred. We evaluate the measure of progress each reporting period as described under Exclusive Licenses above. Reimbursements from the partner that are the result of a collaborative relationship with the partner, instead of a customer relationship, such as co-development activities, are recorded as a reduction to research and development expense.\nCustomer Options - Our arrangements may provide a collaborator with the right to select a target for licensing either at the inception of the arrangement or within an initial pre-defined selection period, which may, in certain cases, include the right of the collaborator to extend the selection period. Under these agreements, fees may be due to us (i) at the inception of the arrangement as an upfront fee or payment, (ii) upon the exercise of an option to acquire a license or (iii) upon extending the selection period as an extension fee or payment. If an arrangement is determined to contain customer options that allow the customer to acquire additional goods or services, the goods and services underlying the customer options are not considered to be performance obligations at the outset of the arrangement, as they are contingent upon option exercise. We evaluate the customer options for material rights, or options to acquire additional goods or services for free or at a discount. If the customer options are determined to represent a material right, the material right is recognized as a separate performance obligation at the inception of the arrangement. We allocate the transaction price to material rights based on the relative stand-alone selling price, which is determined based on the identified discount and the probability that the customer will exercise the option. Amounts allocated to a material right are not recognized as revenue until, at the earliest, the option is exercised or expires.\nMilestone Payments - At the inception of each arrangement that includes development milestone payments, we evaluate whether the milestones are considered probable of being achieved and estimates the amount to be included in the transaction price using the most likely amount method. If it is probable that a significant revenue reversal would not occur, the associated milestone value is included in the transaction price. Milestone payments that are not within our control or the licensee's control, such as regulatory approvals, are not considered probable of being achieved until those approvals are received. We evaluate factors such as the scientific, clinical, regulatory, commercial, and other risks that must be overcome to achieve the particular milestone in making this assessment. There is considerable judgment involved in determining whether it is probable that a significant revenue reversal would not occur. At the end of each subsequent reporting period, we reevaluate the probability of achievement of all milestones subject to constraint and, if necessary, adjusts its estimate of the overall transaction price. Any such adjustments are recorded on a cumulative catch-up basis, which would affect revenues and earnings in the period of adjustment. If a milestone or other variable consideration relates specifically to our efforts to satisfy a single performance obligation or to a specific outcome from satisfying the performance obligation, we generally allocate the milestone amount entirely to that performance obligation once it is probable that a significant revenue reversal would not occur.\nRoyalties - For arrangements that include sales-based royalties, including milestone payments based on a level of sales, and the license is deemed to be the predominant item to which the royalties relate, we recognize revenue at the\nlater of (i) when the related sales occur or (ii) when the performance obligation to which some or all of the royalty has been allocated has been satisfied (or partially satisfied). To date, we have not recognized any royalty revenue resulting from any of our licensing arrangements.\nFor a complete discussion of accounting for collaboration revenues, see Note 11, Collaborations, in the accompanying Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 15. of Part IV of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nAccrued Research and Development Expenses\nAs part of the process of preparing our financial statements, we are required to estimate our accrued expenses as of each balance sheet date. This process involves reviewing open contracts and purchase orders, communicating with our personnel to identify services that have been performed on our behalf and estimating the level of service performed and the associated cost incurred for the service when we have not yet been invoiced or otherwise notified of the actual cost. The majority of our service providers invoice us monthly in arrears for services performed or when contractual milestones are met. We make estimates of our accrued expenses as of each balance sheet date in our financial statements based on facts and circumstances known to us at that time. We periodically confirm the accuracy of our estimates with the service providers and make adjustments if necessary. Examples of estimated accrued research and development expenses include fees paid to:\n\u2022contract research organizations in connection with clinical trials;\n\u2022investigative sites in connection with clinical trials;\n\u2022vendors in connection with non-clinical development activities; and\n\u2022vendors related to product manufacturing, development and distribution of clinical supplies.\nWe generally accrue expenses related to research and development activities based on the services received and efforts expended pursuant to contracts with multiple contract research organizations that conduct and manage clinical trials on our behalf as well as other vendors that provide research and development services. The financial terms of these agreements are subject to negotiation, vary from contract to contract and may result in uneven payment flows. There may be instances in which payments made to our vendors will exceed the level of services provided and result in a prepayment of the expense. Payments under some of these contracts depend on factors such as the successful enrollment of subjects and the completion of clinical trial milestones. In accruing service fees, we estimate the time period over which services will be performed and the level of effort to be expended in each period. If the actual timing of the performance of services or the level of effort varies from our estimate, we would adjust the accrual or prepaid accordingly.\nAlthough we do not expect our estimates to be materially different from amounts actually incurred, if our estimates of the status and timing of services performed differ from the actual status and timing of services performed we may report amounts that are too high or too low in any particular period. To date, there have been no material differences from our estimates to the amount actually incurred.\nInventory\nWe outsource the manufacturing of TAZVERIK and use contract manufacturers to produce the raw and intermediate materials used in the production of TAZVERIK as well as the finished product. We currently have one supplier qualified for each step in the manufacturing process and are in the process of qualifying additional suppliers.\nInventory is composed of raw materials, intermediate materials, which are classified as work-in-process, and finished goods, which are goods that are available for sale. We state inventory at the lower of cost or net realizable value with the cost based on the first-in, first-out method. If we identify excess, obsolete or unsalable items, we write down our inventory to its net realizable value in the period in which the impairment is identified. These adjustments are recorded based upon various factors related to the product, including the level of product manufactured by us, the level of product in the distribution channel, current and projected demand, the expected\nshelf-life of the product and firm inventory purchase commitments. Shipping and handling costs incurred for inventory purchases are included in inventory costs and costs incurred for product shipments are recorded as incurred in cost of product revenue.\nPrior to receiving our first approval from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, on January 23, 2020, we expensed all costs incurred related to the manufacture of TAZVERIK as research and development expense because of the inherent risks associated with the development of a product candidate, the uncertainty about the regulatory approval process and the lack of history for us of regulatory approval of drug candidates.\nGoing Concern\nAt each reporting period, we evaluate whether there are conditions or events that raise substantial doubt about the Company's ability to continue as a going concern within one year after the date that the financial statements are issued. The Company is required to make certain additional disclosures if it concludes substantial doubt exists about the Company's ability to continue as a going concern within one year after the date that the financial statements are issued and such doubt is not alleviated by the Company's plans or when its plans alleviate substantial doubt about the Company's ability to continue as a going concern. The Company's evaluation entails analyzing prospective operating budgets and forecasts for expectations of the Company's cash needs, and comparing those needs to its available cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities.\nThe analysis of the Company's ability to continue as a going concern includes consideration of the Company's current cash needs, including its research and development plans, commercialization activities associated with the continued commercialization of TAZVERIK in the ES and FL indications, its existing debt service obligations, and anticipated cost savings from its operational cost reduction plans, including ongoing efforts to eliminate costs not related to the Company's strategic focus. The analysis includes forecasted product revenues from sales of TAZVERIK. Such estimates of future sales contain significant judgment as TAZVERIK was first launched in the first half of 2020 and there is little history with which to base such estimates. In addition, the Company's ongoing efforts to eliminate costs not related to the Company's strategic focus contains uncertainties as to whether the Company can attain such benefits.\nBased on its analysis, the Company concluded that its available cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities as of December 31, 2021 combined with the $79.5 million raised in January 2022 will be sufficient to fund current planned operations and capital expenditure requirements and pay its debt service obligations as they become due into the third quarter of 2023, which is at least 12 months from the filing date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K with the SEC. As a result, the Company concluded that it did not identify conditions or events that raise substantial doubt about the Company's ability to continue as a going concern within one year from the date these financial statements were issued. The Company's current operating plan is based on assumptions that may prove to be wrong, and the Company could use its capital resources sooner than it expects, in which case the Company would evaluate further reductions in its expenses or obtaining additional financing sooner than it otherwise would, which additional financing may not be available or may only be available on terms that are not acceptable to the Company.\nRecently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements\nFor detailed information regarding recently issued accounting pronouncements and the expected impact on our consolidated
