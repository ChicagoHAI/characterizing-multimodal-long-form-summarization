Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nForward-Looking Statements\nThis report contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements can be identified by the fact that they do not relate strictly to historical or current facts and may include statements concerning, among other things, the anticipated economic and business environment in our service area and elsewhere, credit quality and other financial and business matters in future periods, our future results of operations and financial position, our business strategy and plans and our objectives and future operations. We also may make forward-looking statements in our other documents filed with or furnished to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC\u201d). In addition, our senior management may make forward-looking statements orally to analysts, investors, representatives of the media and others. Our forward-looking statements are based on numerous assumptions, any of which could prove to be inaccurate, and actual results may differ materially from those projected because of a variety of risks and uncertainties, including, but not limited to: 1) general economic conditions either nationally, internationally, or locally may be different than expected, and particularly, any event that negatively impacts the tourism industry in Hawaii; 2) unanticipated changes in the securities markets, public debt markets, and other capital markets in the U.S. and internationally; 3) competitive pressures in the markets for financial services and products; 4) the impact of legislative and regulatory initiatives, particularly the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 (the Dodd-Frank Act\u201d) and Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief, and Consumer Protection Act of 2018; 5) changes in fiscal and monetary policies of the markets in which we operate; 6) the increased cost of maintaining or the Company's ability to maintain adequate liquidity and capital, based on the requirements adopted by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision and U.S. regulators; 7) actual or alleged conduct which could harm our reputation; 8) changes in accounting standards; 9) changes in tax laws or regulations, including Public Law 115-97, commonly known as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, or the interpretation of such laws and regulations; 10) changes in our credit quality or risk profile that may increase or decrease the required level of our reserve for credit losses; 11) changes in market interest rates that may affect credit markets and our ability to maintain our net interest margin; 12) the impact of litigation and regulatory investigations of the Company, including costs, expenses, settlements, and judgments; 13) any failure in or breach of our operational systems, information systems or infrastructure, or those of our merchants, third party vendors and other service providers; 14) any interruption or breach of security of our information systems resulting in failures or disruptions in customer account management, general ledger processing, and loan or deposit systems; 15) changes to the amount and timing of proposed common stock repurchases; and 16) natural disasters, public unrest or adverse weather, public health, and other conditions impacting us and our customers' operations or negatively impacting the tourism industry in Hawaii. Given these risks and uncertainties, investors should not place undue reliance on any forward-looking statement as a prediction of our actual results. A detailed discussion of these and other risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results and events to differ materially from such forward-looking statements is included under the section entitled Risk Factors\u201d in Part I of this report. Words such as believes,\u201d anticipates,\u201d expects,\u201d intends,\u201d targeted,\u201d and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements but are not the exclusive means of identifying such statements. We undertake no obligation to update forward-looking statements to reflect later events or circumstances, except as may be required by law.\nCritical Accounting Policies\nOur Consolidated Financial Statements were prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ( GAAP\u201d) and follow general practices within the industries in which we operate. The most significant accounting policies we follow are presented in Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Application of these principles requires us to make estimates, assumptions, and judgments that affect the amounts reported in the Consolidated Financial Statements and accompanying notes. Most accounting policies are not considered by management to be critical accounting policies. Several factors are considered in determining whether or not a policy is critical in the preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements. These factors include among other things, whether the policy requires management to make difficult, subjective, and complex judgments about matters that are inherently uncertain and because it is likely that materially different amounts would be reported under different conditions or using different assumptions. The accounting policies which we believe to be most critical in preparing our Consolidated Financial Statements are those that are related to the determination of the reserve for credit losses, fair value estimates, leased asset residual values, and income taxes.\nReserve for Credit Losses\nA consequence of lending activities is that we may incur credit losses. The amount of such losses will vary depending upon the risk characteristics of the loan and lease portfolio as affected by economic conditions such as rising interest rates and the financial performance of borrowers. The reserve for credit losses consists of the allowance for loan and lease losses (the Allowance\u201d) and the reserve for unfunded commitments (the Unfunded Reserve\u201d). The Allowance provides for probable and estimable losses inherent in our loan and lease portfolio. The Allowance is increased or decreased through the provisioning process. There is no exact method of predicting specific losses or amounts that ultimately may be charged-off on particular segments of the loan and lease portfolio. The Unfunded Reserve is a component of other liabilities and represents the estimate for probable credit losses inherent in unfunded commitments to extend credit. The level of the Unfunded Reserve is adjusted by recording an expense or recovery in other noninterest expense.\nManagement's evaluation of the adequacy of the reserve for credit losses is often the most critical of accounting estimates for a financial institution. Our determination of the amount of the reserve for credit losses is a critical accounting estimate as it requires significant reliance on the accuracy of credit risk ratings on individual borrowers, the use of estimates and significant judgment as to the amount and timing of expected future cash flows on impaired loans, significant reliance on estimated loss rates on homogenous portfolios, and consideration of our quantitative and qualitative evaluation of economic factors and trends. While our methodology in establishing the reserve for credit losses attributes portions of the Allowance and Unfunded Reserve to the commercial and consumer portfolio segments, the entire Allowance and Unfunded Reserve is available to absorb credit losses inherent in the total loan and lease portfolio and total amount of unfunded credit commitments, respectively.\nThe reserve for credit losses related to our commercial portfolio segment is generally most sensitive to the accuracy of credit risk ratings assigned to each borrower. Commercial loan risk ratings are evaluated based on each situation by experienced senior credit officers and are subject to periodic review by an independent internal team of credit specialists. The reserve for credit losses related to our consumer portfolio segment is generally most sensitive to economic assumptions and delinquency trends. The reserve for credit losses attributable to each portfolio segment also includes an amount for inherent risks not reflected in the historical analyses. Relevant factors include, but are not limited to, concentrations of credit risk (geographic, large borrower, and industry), economic trends and conditions, changes in underwriting standards, experience and depth of lending staff, trends in delinquencies, and the level of criticized and classified loans.\nSee Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements and the Corporate Risk Profile - Credit Risk\u201d section in Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations ( MD&A\u201d) for more information on the Allowance and the Unfunded Reserve.\nFair Value Measurements\nFair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in the principal or most advantageous market for an asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. The degree of management judgment involved in determining the fair value of a financial instrument is dependent upon the availability of quoted market prices or observable market inputs. For financial instruments that are traded actively and have quoted market prices or observable market inputs, there is minimal subjectivity involved in measuring fair value. However, when quoted market prices or observable market inputs are not fully available, significant management judgment may be necessary to estimate fair value. In developing our fair value measurements, we maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs.\nThe fair value hierarchy defines Level 1 valuations as those based on quoted prices, unadjusted, for identical instruments traded in active markets. Level 2 valuations are those based on quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active, or model-based valuation techniques for which all significant assumptions are observable in the market. Level 3 valuations are based on model-based techniques that use at least one significant assumption not observable in the market, or significant management judgment or estimation, some of which may be internally developed.\nFinancial assets that are recorded at fair value on a recurring basis include available-for-sale investment securities, loans held for sale, mortgage servicing rights, investments related to deferred compensation arrangements, and derivative financial instruments. As of December 31, 2018 and 2017, $2.1 billion or 12% and $2.3 billion or 13%, respectively, of our total assets consisted of financial assets recorded at fair value on a recurring basis and most of these financial assets consisted of available-for-sale investment securities measured using information from a third-party pricing service. These investments in debt securities and mortgage-backed securities were all classified in either Levels 1 or 2 of the fair value hierarchy. Financial liabilities that are recorded at fair value on a recurring basis are comprised of derivative financial instruments. As of December 31, 2018 and 2017, $9.7 million or less than 1% of our total liabilities consisted of financial liabilities recorded at fair value on a recurring basis. As of December 31, 2018 and 2017, Level 3 financial assets recorded at fair value on a recurring basis were $15.1 million and $11.8 million, respectively, or less than 1% of our total assets, and were comprised of mortgage servicing rights and derivative financial instruments. As of December 31, 2018 and 2017, Level 3 financial liabilities recorded at fair value on a recurring basis were $9.4 million and $9.5 million, respectively, or less than 1% of our total liabilities, and were comprised of derivative financial instruments.\nOur third-party pricing service makes no representations or warranties that the pricing data provided to us is complete or free from errors, omissions, or defects. As a result, we have processes in place to monitor and periodically review the information provided to us by our third-party pricing service such as: 1) Our third-party pricing service provides us with documentation by asset class of inputs and methodologies used to value securities. We review this documentation to evaluate the inputs and valuation methodologies used to place securities into the appropriate level of the fair value hierarchy. This documentation is periodically updated by our third-party pricing service. Accordingly, transfers of securities within the fair value hierarchy are made if deemed necessary. 2) On a quarterly basis, management also selects a sample of securities priced by the Company's third-party pricing service and reviews the significant assumptions and valuation methodologies used by the pricing service with respect to those securities. The information provided is comprised of market reference data, which may include reported trades; bids, offers, or broker-dealer dealer quotes; benchmark yields and spreads; as well as other reference data as appropriate. Periodically, based on these reviews, management determines whether the current placement of the security in the fair value hierarchy is appropriate or whether transfers may be warranted. 3) On a quarterly basis, management reviews the pricing information received from our third-party pricing service. This review process includes a comparison to a second source. 4) Our third-party pricing service has also established processes for us to submit inquiries regarding quoted prices. Periodically, we will challenge the quoted prices provided by our third-party pricing service. Our third-party pricing service will review the inputs to the evaluation in light of the new market data presented by us. Our third-party pricing service may then affirm the original quoted price or may update the evaluation on a going forward basis. Generally, we do not adjust the price from the third-party service provider. 5) On an annual basis, we obtain and review the third-party's most recently issued Service Organization Controls report. related to controls placed in operation and tests of operating effectiveness, to update our understanding of the third-party pricing service's control environment.\nBased on the composition of our investment securities portfolio, we believe that we have developed appropriate internal controls and performed appropriate due diligence procedures to prevent or detect material misstatements. See Note 21 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information on our fair value measurements.\nIncome Taxes\nWe determine our liabilities for income taxes based on current tax regulations and interpretations in tax jurisdictions where our income is subject to taxation. Currently, we file tax returns in seven federal, state and local domestic jurisdictions, and four foreign jurisdictions. In estimating income taxes payable or receivable, we assess the relative merits and risks of the appropriate tax treatment considering statutory, judicial, and regulatory guidance in the context of each tax position. Accordingly, previously estimated liabilities are regularly reevaluated and adjusted through the provision for income taxes. Changes in the estimate of income taxes payable or receivable occur periodically due to changes in tax rates, interpretations of tax law, the status of examinations being conducted by various taxing authorities, and newly enacted statutory, judicial and regulatory guidance that impact the relative merits and risks of each tax position. These changes, when they occur, may affect the provision for income taxes as well as current and deferred income taxes, and may be significant to our statements of income and condition.\nManagement's determination of the realization of net deferred tax assets is based upon management's judgment of various future events and uncertainties, including the timing and amount of future income, as well as the implementation of various tax planning strategies to maximize realization of the deferred tax assets. A valuation allowance is provided when it is more likely than not that some portion of the deferred tax asset will not be realized. As of December 31, 2018 and 2017, we carried a valuation allowance of $1.1 million and $1.0 million, respectively, related to our deferred tax assets established in connection with our low-income housing investments.\nWe are also required to record a liability, referred to as an unrecognized tax benefit (\"UTB\"), for the entire amount of benefit taken in a prior or future income tax return when we determine that a tax position has a less than 50% likelihood of being accepted by the taxing authority. As of December 31, 2018 and 2017, our liabilities for UTBs were $5.5 million and $5.3 million, respectively.\nIn 2018, the Company recognized federal and State of Hawaii investment tax credits from energy investments. The Company uses the deferral method of accounting for its investment tax credit with the benefit recognized in the provision for income taxes. These credits reduced the Company's provision for income taxes by $5.0 million, 5.4 million, and 4.7 million in 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively.\nPublic law No. 115-97, known as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the \"Tax Act\"), which was enacted on December 22, 2017, reduced the U.S. federal corporate tax rate from 35% to 21% effective January 1, 2018. Also on December 22, 2017, the Securities and Exchange Commission issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118 ( SAB 118\u201d), which provides guidance on accounting for tax effects of the Tax Act. SAB 118 provides a measurement period of up to one year from the enactment date to complete the accounting. Any adjustments during this measurement period were included in net earnings from continuing operations as\nan adjustment to income tax expense in the reporting period when such adjustments were determined. Based on the information available and current interpretation of the rules, the Company calculated the impact of the reduction in the corporate tax rate and remeasurement of certain deferred tax assets and liabilities. The provisional amount recorded in the fourth quarter of 2017 related to the remeasurement of the Company's deferred tax balance resulted in additional income tax expense of $3.6 million. An additional $0.1 million was expensed in the first quarter of 2018 due to the remeasurement of the Company's deferred tax balance. In addition, during the first quarter of 2018, the Company recorded a $2.0 million basis adjustment on its low income\nhousing partnership investments, which consequently reduced income tax expense by the same amount. The remeasurement of the Company's deferred tax balance in the third quarter of 2018 resulted in an income tax expense reduction of $0.3 million. The Company finalized the impact of the Tax Act in the third quarter of 2018.\nOverview\nWe are a regional financial services company serving businesses, consumers, and governments in Hawaii, Guam, and other Pacific Islands. Our principal operating subsidiary, the Bank, was founded in 1897 and is the largest independent financial institution in Hawaii.\nOur business strategy is to use our unique market knowledge, prudent management discipline and brand strength to deliver exceptional value to our stakeholders. Our business plan is balanced between growth and risk management while maintaining flexibility to adjust to economic changes. We will continue to focus on providing customers with best-in-class service and an innovative mix of products and services. We will also remain focused on continuing to deliver strong financial results while maintaining prudent risk and capital management strategies as well as our commitment to support our local communities.\nHawaii Economy\nGeneral economic conditions in Hawaii remained healthy during 2018, led by a strong tourism industry, relatively low unemployment, rising real estate prices, and an active construction industry. Total visitor arrivals increased 5.9% and visitor spending increased 6.8% during 2018 compared to 2017. The statewide seasonally-adjusted unemployment rate was 2.5% in December 2018 compared to 3.9% nationally. The volume of single-family home sales on Oahu decreased 7.7% in 2018 compared to 2017, while the volume of condominium sales on Oahu decreased 2.5% in 2018 compared to 2017. The median price of single-family home sales and condominium sales on Oahu increased 4.6% and 3.7%, respectively, in 2018 compared to 2017. As of December 31, 2018, months of inventory of single-family homes and condominiums on Oahu remained low at approximately 2.8 months and 2.9 months, respectively.\nEarnings Summary\nNet income for 2018 was $219.6 million, an increase of $34.9 million or 19% compared to 2017. Diluted earnings per share were $5.23 in 2018, an increase of $0.90 or 21% compared to 2017. Our return on average assets was 1.29% in 2018, an increase of 19 basis points from 2017, and our return on average shareholders' equity was 17.63% in 2018, an increase of 236 basis points from 2017.\nOur higher net income in 2018 was primarily due to the following:\nTable 18: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>The provision for income taxes was $50.6 million in 2018, a decrease of $32.8 million or 39% compared to 2017 primarily due to the federal corporate tax rate changing from 35% to 21% as a result of the passage of the Tax Act.

On a taxable-equivalent basis, net interest income was $491.5 million in 2018, an increase of $22.4 million or 5% compared to 2017. This increase was primarily due to a higher level of earning assets, including growth in both our commercial and consumer lending portfolios, and higher net interest margin. The higher level of earning assets was primarily funded by higher deposit balances. Net interest margin was 3.05% in 2018, a 12 basis point increase from 2017, primarily due to our loans, which generally have higher yields than our investment securities, comprising a larger percentage of our earning assets compared to 2017. In addition, yields increased for our commercial loans and investment portfolio. Yields on our loan portfolios increased primarily due to higher yields on floating rate loans. This was partially offset by an increase in rates offered on our deposit products.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 20: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>We recorded a $13.4 million provision for credit losses in 2018 compared to a $16.9 million provision recorded in 2017.

These increases were partially offset by a $2.1 million decrease in incentive compensation. During the fourth quarter of 2017, the Company paid a $2.2 million bonus, inclusive of payroll taxes, partly due to anticipated future tax expense reductions resulting from the Tax Act. In addition, share-based compensation decreased by $2.1 million as a result of the Company's lower share price. Commission expense also decreased by $2.1 million primarily due to a decrease in loan origination and refinancing activity.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 23: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Mortgage banking income was $8.4 million in 2018, a decrease of $4.5 million or 35% compared to 2017.

in interest income and expense not solely due to changes in volume or rate has been allocated on a pro-rata basis to the volume and rate columns.\n2 Comprised of other consumer revolving credit, installment, and consumer lease financing.\nNet Interest Income\nNet interest income is affected by the size and mix of our balance sheet components as well as the spread between interest earned on assets and interest paid on liabilities. Net interest margin is defined as net interest income, on a taxable-equivalent basis, as a percentage of average earning assets.\nNet interest income was $486.4 million in 2018, an increase of $29.1 million or 6% compared to 2017. On a taxable-equivalent basis, net interest income was $491.5 million in 2018, an increase of $22.4 million or 5% compared to 2017. This increase was primarily due to a higher level of earning assets, including growth in both our commercial and consumer lending portfolios, and higher net interest margin. The higher level of earning assets was primarily funded by higher deposit balances. Net interest margin was 3.05% in 2018, a 12 basis point increase from 2017, primarily due to our loans, which generally have higher yields than our investment securities, comprising a larger percentage of our earning assets compared to 2017. In addition, yields increased for our commercial loans and investment portfolio. Yields on our loan portfolios increased primarily due to higher yields on floating rate loans.\nYields on our earning assets increased by 22 basis points in 2018 compared to 2017 primarily due to the shift in the mix of our earning assets from investment securities to loans, which generally have higher yields. Yields on our commercial and industrial and commercial mortgage portfolios increased by 46 basis points and 31 basis points, respectively, primarily due to higher yields on floating rate loans. In addition, yields on our investment securities portfolio increased by 14 basis points primarily due to the higher interest rate environment and lower premium amortization. These yield increases were partially offset by an 86 basis point decrease in yield for our automobile loans portfolio.\nInterest rates paid on our interest-bearing liabilities increased 15 basis points in 2018 compared to 2017. Increases to our funding costs were primarily due to higher rates paid on our interest-bearing deposits, a reflection of the higher rate environment. The increase in our funding costs was partially offset by a lower average balance of our public time deposits which decreased by $209.2 million. Interest rates paid on our securities sold under agreements to repurchase decreased by 19 basis points from 2017 primarily due to the restructuring of three repurchase agreements with private institutions with an aggregate total of $200.0 million. These repurchase agreements had a weighted-average interest rate of 3.94%. The restructuring of the agreements extended the maturity dates to June 2022 and lowered the weighted-average interest rate to 2.70% effective June 2017.\nAverage balances of our earning assets increased by $92.1 million or 1% in 2018 compared to 2017 primarily due to loan growth as the average balances of our loans and leases portfolio increased by $696.9 million. Offsetting this increase in the average balance of our loans and leases portfolio were a $371.5 million decrease in the average balance of investment securities and a $223.0 million decrease in the average balance of funds sold. The average balance of our residential mortgage portfolio increased by $238.9 million primarily due to a relatively constant level of loan originations combined with a slowdown in payoff activity. The average balance of our commercial mortgage portfolio increased by $187.5 million primarily due to continued demand from new and existing customers as a result of healthy Hawaii economy. The average balance of our home equity portfolio increased by $153.2 million as a result of continued loan demand in light of a healthy Hawaii economy and stable real estate market conditions. Additionally, utilization on new and existing home equity lines was strong during 2018.\nAverage balances of our interest-bearing liabilities increased by $228.3 million or 2% in 2018 compared to 2017 primarily due to growth in our consumer and commercial time deposits, along with continued growth in our relationship checking and savings products, offset by the aforementioned lower average balance in our public time deposits. Average balances in our time deposits and core deposits increased by $136.5 million and $132.9 million, respectively.\nNet interest income was $457.2 million in 2017, an increase of $39.7 million or 9% compared to 2016. On a taxable-equivalent basis, net interest income was $469.1 million in 2017, an increase of $39.5 million or 9% compared to 2016. This increase was primarily due to a higher level of earning assets, including growth in both our commercial and consumer lending portfolios, and higher net interest margin. The higher level of earning assets was primarily funded by higher deposit balances. Net interest margin was 2.93% in 2017, a 10 basis point increase from 2016, primarily due to our loans, which generally have higher yields than our investment securities, comprising a larger percentage of our earning assets compared to 2016. In addition, yields increased for our commercial loans and investment portfolio. Yields on our loan portfolios increased primarily due to higher yields on floating rate loans. This was partially offset by an increase in rates offered on our deposit products.\nYields on our earning assets increased by 12 basis points in 2017 compared to 2016 primarily due to the shift in the mix of our earning assets from funds sold to loans which generally have higher yields. Yields on our commercial and industrial and commercial mortgage portfolios increased by 10 basis points and 11 basis points, respectively, primarily due to higher yields on floating rate loans. In addition, yields on our investment securities portfolio increased by 10 basis points primarily due to the higher interest rate environment and lower premium amortization. These yield increases were partially offset by a 15 basis point yield decrease in our residential mortgage loan portfolio, primarily due to continued payoff activity of higher-rate mortgage loans and the addition of lower-rate mortgage loans to our portfolio.\nInterest rates paid on our interest-bearing liabilities increased four basis points in 2017 compared to 2016. Interest rates paid on our time deposits increased by 31 basis points due to new public time deposits at higher rates. Interest rates paid on our securities sold under agreements to repurchase decreased by 25 basis points from 2016 due to the restructuring of three repurchase agreements with private institutions with an aggregate total of $200.0 million during the second quarter of 2017. These repurchase agreements were to mature in 2018 and had a weighted-average interest rate of 3.94%. The restructuring of the agreements extended the maturity dates to June 2022 and lowered the weighted-average interest rate to 2.70% effective June 2017. The remaining balance in our repurchase agreements consists mainly of those with private entities which have relatively longer terms at higher interest rates. The increases to our funding costs were largely offset by growth in our demand and savings deposits, which generally have lower rates than other funding sources. The average balance of these core deposits increased by $284.7 million or 4% in 2017 compared to 2016.\nAverage balances of our earning assets increased by $865.6 million or 6% in 2017 compared to 2016 primarily due to loan growth as the average balances of our loans and leases portfolio increased by $984.6 million. The average balance of our commercial and industrial portfolio increased by $82.9 million due to increase in corporate demand for funding. The average balance of our commercial mortgage portfolio increased by $241.9 million as a result of continued demand from new and existing customers as the Hawaii economy continued to be strong coupled with the transfer of construction loans into this loan portfolio upon project completion. The average balance of our residential mortgage portfolio increased by $270.6 million primarily due to a relatively constant level of loan originations combined with a slowdown in payoff activity. The average balance of our home equity portfolio increased by $255.8 million as a result of healthy loan demand in light of a strong Hawaii economy and improved real estate market conditions. Additionally, utilization on new and existing home equity lines remained steady during 2017. In addition to the increase in the average balances of our loan and lease portfolio, there was a $63.0 million increase in the average balance of our investment securities portfolio in 2017.\nAverage balances of our interest-bearing liabilities increased by $584.8 million or 6% in 2017 compared to 2016 primarily due to growth in our time deposits, along with continued growth in our relationship checking and savings products.\nProvision for Credit Losses\nThe provision for credit losses (the Provision\u201d) reflects our judgment of the expense or benefit necessary to achieve the appropriate amount of the Allowance. We maintain the Allowance at levels adequate to cover our estimate of probable credit losses as of the end of the reporting period. The Allowance is determined through detailed quarterly analyses of our loan and lease portfolio. The Allowance is based on our loss experience and changes in the economic environment, as well as an ongoing assessment of our credit quality. We recorded a Provision of $13.4 million in 2018, $16.9 million in 2017, and $4.8 million in 2016. For further discussion on the Allowance, see the Corporate Risk Profile - Credit Risk\u201d section in MD&A.\nNoninterest Income\nTable 3 presents the major components of noninterest income for 2018, 2017, and 2016.\nTable 34: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Noninterest Income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Table 3\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Dollar Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Percent Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(dollars in thousands)\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\nto 2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\nto 2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\nto 2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\nto 2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Trust and Asset Management\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>43,877\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>45,430\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>46,203\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(1,553\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(773\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(3\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(2\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Mortgage Banking\n</td> <td>8,437\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12,949\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>19,895\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(4,512\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(6,946\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(35\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(35\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Service Charges on Deposit Accounts\n</td> <td>28,811\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>32,575\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>33,654\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(3,764\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1,079\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(12\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(3\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Fees, Exchange, and Other Service Charges\n</td> <td>57,482\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>54,845\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>55,176\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,637\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(331\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Investment Securities Gains (Losses), Net\n</td> <td>(3,938\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10,430\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10,203\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(14,368\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>227\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(138\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Annuity and Insurance\n</td> <td>5,822\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6,858\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7,017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1,036\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(159\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(15\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(2\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Bank-Owned Life Insurance\n</td> <td>7,199\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6,517\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6,561\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>682\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(44\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other\n</td> <td>21,233\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>15,813\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>18,634\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5,420\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(2,821\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>34\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(15\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total Noninterest Income\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>168,923\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>185,417\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>197,343\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(16,494\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(11,926\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(9\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(6\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTrust and asset management income is comprised of fees earned from the management and administration of trusts and other customer assets. These fees are largely based upon the market value of the assets that we manage and the fee rate charged to customers. Total trust assets under administration were $9.4 billion, $9.3 billion, and $8.8 billion as of December 31, 2018, 2017, and 2016, respectively. Trust and asset management income decreased by $1.6 million or 3% in 2018 compared to 2017 due to a decrease in special service fees ($0.6 million), employee benefit trust fees ($0.5 million), and other trust fees ($0.3 million) primarily due to a decline in the number of customer accounts under administration. Trust and asset management income decreased by $0.8 million or 2% in 2017 compared to 2016 primarily due to a $1.2 million decrease in special service fees mainly the result of a service fee received from the sale of real estate in second quarter of 2016. This increase was partially offset by a $0.7 million increase in agency fees primarily due to an increase in market value of accounts.\nMortgage banking income is highly influenced by mortgage interest rates, the housing market, the amount of our loan sales, and our valuation of mortgage servicing rights. Mortgage banking income decreased by $4.5 million or 35% in 2018 compared to 2017. This decrease was primarily due to reduced sales of conforming saleable loans from current production. There were no sales from our mortgage loan portfolio in 2018. Mortgage banking income decreased by $6.9 million or 35% in 2017 compared to 2016. This decrease was primarily due to reduced sales and margins on sales of conforming saleable loans from current production and from our mortgage loan portfolio.\nService charges on deposit accounts decreased by $3.8 million or 12% in 2018 compared to 2017. This decrease was primarily due to a $2.3 million decrease in account analysis fees and a $1.7 million decrease in overdraft fees, partially offset by an increase in other service and monthly fees. Service charges on deposit accounts decreased by $1.1 million or 3% in 2017 compared to 2016. This decrease was primarily due to a $0.8 million decrease in overdraft fees due in part to higher customer deposit balances and a $0.7 decrease in account analysis fees.\nFees, exchange, and other service charges are primarily comprised of debit and credit card income, fees from ATMs, merchant service activity, and other loan fees and special charges. Fees, exchange, and other service charges increased by $2.6 million or 5% primarily due to $2.3 million increase in merchant income, which was recorded as a reduction of other noninterest expense in 2017. This accounting change was related to the 2018 adoption of the new revenue recognition accounting guidance. Fees, exchange, and other service charges decreased $0.3 million or 1% in 2017 compared to 2016 primarily due to decreases in other loan fees ($0.8 million) and ATM fees ($0.5 million), largely offset by a $0.9 million increase in debit card fees primarily due to increased transaction volume.\nNet gains (losses) on sales of investment securities totaled $(3.9) million, $10.4 million, and $10.2 million, in 2018, 2017, and 2016, respectively. The net loss in 2018 was primarily due to fees paid to the counterparties of our prior Visa Class B share sale transactions. In addition, in June 2018, Visa announced a reduction of the conversion ratio of its Class B shares from 1.6483 to 1.6298 effective June 28, 2018. As a result, the Company recorded a $1.0 million liability in June 2018, which was paid to previous buyers of our Visa Class B shares in July 2018. The net gains in 2017 and 2016 were due to gains on the sale of 90,000 and 100,000 Visa Class B restricted shares in 2017 and 2016, respectively. We received these Class B shares in 2008 as part of Visa's initial public offering. These shares are transferable only under limited circumstances until they can be converted into the publicly traded Class A shares. This conversion will not occur until the settlement of certain litigation which is indemnified by Visa members such as the Company. Visa funded an escrow account from its initial public offering to settle these litigation claims. Should this escrow account not be sufficient to cover these litigation claims, Visa is entitled to fund additional amounts to the escrow account by reducing each member bank's Class B conversion ratio to unrestricted Class A shares. Concurrent with the sale of these Visa Class B shares, we entered into an agreement with the buyer that requires payment to the buyer in the event Visa further reduces the conversion ratio. Based on the existing transfer restriction and the uncertainty of the covered litigation, the remaining 83,014 Visa Class B shares (135,296 Class A equivalent shares) that we own are carried at a zero cost basis as of December 31, 2018. We also contributed to the Bank of Hawaii Foundation 3,600, 4,300, and 7,800, Visa Class B shares during 2018, 2017, and 2016, respectively.\nAnnuity and insurance income decreased by $1.0 million or 15% in 2018 compared to 2017 primarily due to a $0.7 million decrease in income related to our annuity products. Annuity and insurance income decreased by $0.2 million or 2% in 2017 compared to 2016 primarily due to a decrease in income related to our annuity products.\nBank-owned life insurance increased by $0.7 million or 10% in 2018 compared to 2017 primarily due to death benefits received. Bank-owned life insurance remained relatively unchanged in 2017 compared to 2016.\nOther noninterest income increased by $5.4 million or 34% in 2018 compared to 2017 primarily due to a distribution received in the first quarter of 2018 from a low-income housing investment sale totaling $2.8 million combined with a $1.1 million increase in fees from our customer interest rate swap derivatives and a $0.8 million increase in net gain on sale of leased assets. Other noninterest income decreased by $2.8 million or 15% in 2017 compared to 2016. This decrease was primarily due to a $2.3 million decrease in fees from our customer interest rate swap derivatives, and a $0.9 million decrease in net gain on sale of leased assets.\nNoninterest

As such $1.8 million previously reported in retirement and other benefits were reclassified to other noninterest expense for the year ended December 31, 2017 and 2016.\nTotal salaries and benefits increased by $9.5 million or 5% in 2018 compared to 2017 primarily due to $9.8 million in merit and minimum wage increases. Medical, dental, and life insurance increased by $3.8 million primarily due to higher expenses related to our self-insured medical plans coupled with increased group medical insurance costs. These increases were partially offset by a $2.1 million decrease in incentive compensation. During the fourth quarter of 2017, the Company paid a $2.2 million bonus, inclusive of payroll taxes, partly due to anticipated future tax expense reductions resulting from the Tax Act. In addition, share-based compensation decreased by $2.1 million as a result of the Company's lower share price. Commission expense also decreased by $2.1 million primarily due to a decrease in loan origination and refinancing activity. Total salaries and benefits increased by $4.4 million or 2% in 2017 compared to 2016 due in part to the aforementioned $2.2 million bonus, paid in the fourth quarter 2017. In addition, separation expense increased by $1.2 million. These increases were partially offset by a $2.0 million decrease in share-based compensation. Commission expense also decreased by $1.0 million primarily due to a decrease in loan origination and refinancing activity.\nNet occupancy expense increased by $2.2 million or 7% in 2018 compared to 2017 due to a $1.0 million increase in ATM lease space rental costs in 2018. These ATM lease space rental costs were recorded as a reduction of ATM fee income in 2017. This accounting change was related to the 2018 adoption of the new revenue recognition accounting guidance. In addition, this increase was due to the increases in utilities and depreciation expenses by $0.6 million and $0.3 million, respectively. Net occupancy expense increased by $2.3 million or 8% in compared to 2016 primarily due to a $3.4 million decrease in net gain on sale of real estate from $3.7 million in 2016 to $0.3 million in 2017. This increase was offset by a $0.9 million decrease in net rental expense.\nNet equipment expense increased by $1.8 million or 8% 2018 compared to 2017 primarily due to a $1.1 million increase in depreciation expense. In addition, branches and information technology rent expense increased by $0.6 million. Net equipment expense increased by $1.5 million or 7% in 2017 compared to 2016 primarily due to a $0.8 million increase in software license fees and maintenance and a $0.5 million increase in depreciation expense.\nData processing expense increased by $2.4 million or 15% in 2018 compared to 2017 due to ongoing information technology projects. Data processing expense remained relatively unchanged in 2017 compared to 2016.\nProfessional fees decreased by $1.7 million or 14% in 2018 compared to 2017 primarily due to a decrease in professional services in our mortgage division. Professional fees increased by $1.6 million or 16% in 2017 compared to 2016 primarily due to a $0.9 million increase in legal fees and a $0.8 million increase in professional services primarily in our mortgage division.\nOther noninterest expense increased by $0.7 million or 1% in 2018 compared to 2017 due to $2.7 million in legal reserves recorded during 2018. Operating losses, which include losses as a result of bank error, fraud, items processing, or theft, increased by $1.2 million, partially offset by a decrease in business travel of $0.9 million, a $0.9 million decrease in credit card expense due to the completed sale of our MyBankoh Rewards Credit Card portfolio on November 1, 2018, and a decrease in temporary services of $0.7 million. Other noninterest expense decreased by $3.0 million or 5% in 2017 compared to 2016 due to a $0.9 million decrease in delivery and postage services and a $0.8 million decrease in solar energy tax credit partnership amortization expense.\nIncome Taxes\nTable 5 presents our provision for income taxes and effective tax rates for 2018, 2017, and 2016:\nTable 36: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Provision for Income Taxes and Effective Tax Rates\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Table 5\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(dollars in thousands)\n</td> <td>Provision for Income Taxes\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Effective Tax Rates\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>50,624\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>18.73\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>83,392\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>31.11\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>78,133\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>30.10\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe provision for income taxes was $50.6 million in 2018, a decrease of $32.8 million or 39% compared to 2017. The effective tax rate was 18.73% in 2018 compared to 31.11% in 2017. The lower effective tax rate in 2018 compared to 2017 was due primarily to the Tax Act enacted into law on December 22, 2017. The Tax Act made changes to the U.S. tax code, including reducing the U.S. federal tax rate from 35% to 21% effective January 1, 2018.\nA reduction in the corporate tax rate set forth in the Tax Act discussed above also affected the Company's primary benefits received from low income housing investments. The impact of the change in tax rate on the Company's accounting for such investments was reevaluated, resulting in a $2 million reduction in the amortization of the net investment, which also favorably impacted the effective tax rate in 2018. These items were partially offset by a $3.3 million decrease in the release of valuation allowances for low income housing investments in 2018 compared to 2017.\nThe provision for income taxes was $83.4 million in 2017, an increase of $5.3 million or 7% compared to 2016. The effective tax rate was 31.11% in 2017 compared to 30.10% in 2016. The higher effective tax rate in 2017 compared to 2016 was primarily due to a $3.6 million charge for the write down of net deferred tax assets as a result of the Tax Act discussed above. A $3.0 million state tax reserve release in 2016 due to the lapse in the statute of limitations related to prior tax years also favorably impacted the effective tax rate in 2016. These items were partially offset by a $2.5 million tax benefit from the exercise of stock options and the vesting of restricted stock in 2017 and a $2.1 million increase in the release of valuation allowances for low income housing investments in 2017 compared to 2016.\nAnalysis of Business Segments\nOur business segments are Retail Banking, Commercial Banking, Investment Services and Private Banking, and Treasury and Other.

This was partially offset by a decrease in noninterest income, an increase in noninterest expense, and an increase in the Provision. The decrease in noninterest income was primarily due to reduced sales of conforming saleable loans from our mortgage portfolio and lower margins on those sales. In addition, overdraft fees decreased. Noninterest expense increased primarily due to a $2.0 million increase in legal reserves recorded in the first quarter of 2018 and higher allocated technology, operations, and finance expense. This was partially offset by the reclassification of certain ATM and debit transaction processing fees, in 2018, as contra revenue, and decreases in professional fees and salaries and benefits. The increase in the Provision was primarily due to higher net charge-offs in our credit card portfolio, which was sold on November 1, 2018, our home equity portfolio due to lower recoveries, as well as overdrafts; this was partially offset by lower net charge-offs in our residential mortgage portfolio.\nNet income increased by $6.1 million or 8% in 2017 compared to 2016 primarily due to an increase in net interest income, partially offset by a decrease in noninterest income and an increase in the Provision. The increase in net interest income was primarily due to higher volume in both the lending and deposit portfolios as well as higher earnings credits on the segment's deposit portfolio. The decrease in noninterest income is primarily due to lower mortgage loan sales and reduced margins on those sales. The increase in the Provision was primarily due to higher net charge-offs in our installment loan, credit card, auto loan, and mortgage loan portfolios, partially offset by lower net charge-offs in our home equity loan and personal credit line portfolios.\nCommercial Banking\nNet income increased by $17.4 million or 23% in 2018 compared to 2017 primarily due to increases in net interest income and noninterest income, and a decrease in the provision for income taxes. These were partially offset by an increase in noninterest expense. The increase in net interest income was primarily due to higher earnings credits on the segment's deposit portfolio. The increase in noninterest income was primarily due to higher merchant income stemming from the adoption of ASU No. 2014-09 Revenue from Contracts with Customers: (Topic 606), higher fees related to our customer interest rate swap derivative program, and to higher net gains on sale of leased equipment. This increase was partially offset by lower account analysis fees as a result of higher earnings credit rates on customer accounts. The decrease in the Provision was due to higher net recovery of loans and leases in 2018. The increase in noninterest expense was primarily due to higher salaries, operating and allocated expenses. The increase in operating expenses was due to the aforementioned adoption of ASU No. 2014-09s. The decrease in the provision for income taxes was due to the lower effective tax rate allocated to the segment.\nNet income decreased by $0.4 million or 1% in 2017 compared to 2016 primarily due to a decrease in noninterest income, and increases to the Provision and noninterest expense. This was partially offset by an increase in net interest income. The decrease in noninterest income was primarily due to lower net gains on sale of leased equipment, lower fees related to our customer interest rate swap derivatives and lower non-recurring loan fees. The increase in the Provision was due to lower net recoveries of loans and leases in 2017. The increase in noninterest expense was primarily due to higher salaries and benefits expense and to higher allocated expenses. The increase in net interest income was primarily due to higher volume in both the lending and deposit portfolios, and partially due to higher earnings credits on the segment's deposit portfolio.\nInvestment Services and Private Banking\nNet income increased by $6.8 million or 43% in 2018 compared to 2017 primarily due to an increase in net interest income, partially offset by an increase in noninterest expense and a decrease in noninterest revenue. The increase in net interest income was primarily driven by the transfer of deposits and loans from the Retail Banking segment and growth of the segment's deposit portfolio. The increase in noninterest expense was primarily due to higher salaries and benefits expense, a one-time charge-off, and higher allocated expenses. The decrease in noninterest revenue was driven by lower annuity sales and lower trust service fees.\nNet income increased by $1.8 million or 13% in 2017 compared to 2016 primarily due to an increase in net interest income, partially offset by increases in noninterest expense. The increase in net interest income was primarily driven by the transfer of deposits from the Retail Banking segment and growth of the segment's deposit portfolio. The increase in noninterest expense was primarily due to higher salaries and benefits expense and an operational recovery in the second quarter of 2016.\nTreasury and Other\nNet income increased by $3.8 million or 34% in 2018 compared to 2017 primarily due to an increase in net interest income, a decrease in the provision for loan losses and an decrease in the provision for taxes. The increase in net interest income was primarily due to an increase in funding income related to lending activities and an increase interest income from investment securities and funds sold resulting from an increase in associated yields partially offset by higher deposit funding costs. The Provision in this business segment represents the residual provision for credit losses to arrive at the total Provision for the Company. The decrease in noninterest income was primarily due to the sale of 90,000 Visa Class B shares amounting to $12.5 million in the first quarter of 2017. Partially offsetting this was a $2.8 million distribution from a low-income housing partnership in the first quarter of 2018. The provision for income taxes in this business segment represents the residual amount to arrive at the total tax expense for the Company. The overall effective tax rate decreased to 18.73% in 2018 compared to 31.11% in 2017.\nNet income decreased by $4.2 million or 27% in 2017 compared to 2016 primarily due to a decrease in net interest income, an increase in the provision for loan losses, and an increase in the provision for taxes. The decrease in net interest income was primarily due to higher deposit funding costs, partially offset by an increase in interest income from investment securities and funds sold under agreements to repurchase resulting from an increase in associated yields and an increase in funding income related to lending activities. The Provision in this business segment represents the residual provision for credit losses to arrive at the total Provision for the Company. The provision for income taxes in this business segment represents the residual amount to arrive at the total tax expense for the Company. The overall effective tax rate increased to 31.11% in 2017 compared to 30.10% in 2016.\nOther organizational units (Technology, Operations, Marketing, Human Resources, Finance, Credit and Risk Management, and Corporate and Regulatory Administration) included in Treasury and Other provide a wide range of support to the Company's other income earning segments. Expenses incurred by these support units are charged to the business segments through an internal cost allocation process.\nAnalysis of Statements of Condition\nInvestment Securities\nTable 7 presents the maturity distribution at amortized cost, weighted-average yield to maturity, and fair value of our investment securities.\nTable 38: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Maturities and Average Yield on Securities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Table 7\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(dollars in millions)\n</td> <td>1 Year\nor Less\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Weighted\nAverage\nYield\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>After 1\nYear-5\nYears\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Weighted\nAverage\nYield\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>After 5\nYears-10\nYears\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Weighted\nAverage\nYield\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Over 10\nYears\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Weighted\nAverage\nYield\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Weighted\nAverage\nYield\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Fair\nValue\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>As of December 31, 2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Available-for-Sale\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Debt Securities Issued by the U.S. Treasury and Government Agencies 2\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>0.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.6\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>114.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.9\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>279.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.7\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>394.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.1\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>392.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Debt Securities Issued by States and Political Subdivisions 1\n</td> <td>56.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>387.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>92.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>22.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>559.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>564.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Debt Securities Issued by U.S. Government-Sponsored Enterprises\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Debt Securities Issued by Corporations\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>225.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>225.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>223.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Mortgage-Backed Securities 2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Residential -

As of December 31, 2018, our investment securities portfolio was comprised of securities with an average base duration of approximately 3.4 years.\nWe continually evaluate our investment securities portfolio in response to established asset/liability management objectives, changing market conditions that could affect profitability, and the level of interest rate risk to which we are exposed. These evaluations may cause us to change the level of funds we deploy into investment securities, change the composition of our investment securities portfolio, and change the proportion of investments made into the available-for-sale and held-to-maturity investment categories.\nIn 2018, we reduced our positions primarily in mortgage-backed securities, municipal debt securities, and corporate debt securities. We re-invested these proceeds primarily into higher yielding loan products. Ginnie Mae mortgage-backed securities continue to be the largest concentration in our portfolio. As of December 31, 2018, our portfolio of Ginnie Mae mortgage-backed securities was primarily comprised of securities issued in 2008 or later. As of December 31, 2018, these mortgage-backed securities were all AAA-rated, with a low probability of a change in their credit ratings in the near future. As of December 31, 2018, our available-for-sale investment securities portfolio was comprised of securities with an average base duration of approximately 2.3 years.\nGross unrealized gains in our investment securities portfolio were $21.2 million as of December 31, 2018 and $36.6 million as of December 31, 2017. Gross unrealized losses on our temporarily impaired investment securities were $103.5 million as of December 31, 2018 and $73.9 million as of December 31, 2017. The gross unrealized loss positions were primarily related to mortgage-backed securities issued by Ginnie Mae, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, and corporate debt securities. See Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information.\nAs of December 31, 2018, included in our investment securities portfolio were debt securities issued by political subdivisions within the State of Hawaii of $451.1 million, representing 56% of the total fair value of the Company's municipal debt securities. Of the entire Hawaii municipal bond portfolio, 96% were credit-rated Aa2 or better by Moody's while the remaining Hawaii municipal bonds were credit-rated A1 or better by at least one nationally recognized statistical rating organization. Also, approximately 79% of the Company's Hawaii municipal bond holdings were general obligation issuances. As of December 31, 2018, there were no other holdings of municipal debt securities that were issued by a single state or political subdivision which comprised more than 10% of the total fair value of the Company's municipal debt securities.\nThe Company's corporate bond holdings as of December 31, 2018 had a fair value of $318.7 million. Of this total, $95.5 million or 30% was fully guaranteed by the Export-Import Bank of the United States, an agency of the U.S. government.

This represents a $0.7 billion or 7% increase from December 31, 2017 primarily due to growth in our consumer lending portfolio.\nThe commercial loan and lease portfolio is comprised of commercial and industrial loans, commercial mortgages, construction loans, and lease financing. Commercial and industrial loans are made primarily to corporations, middle market, and small businesses for the purpose of financing equipment acquisition, expansion, working capital, and other general business purposes. Commercial mortgages and construction loans are offered to real estate investors, developers, and builders primarily domiciled in Hawaii. Commercial mortgages are secured by first mortgages on commercial real estate at loan-to-value ratios generally not exceeding 75%. The commercial properties are predominantly developments such as retail centers, apartments, industrial properties, and to a lesser extent, specialized properties such as hotels. The primary source of repayment for investor property is cash flow from the property and for owner-occupied property is the operating cash flow from the business. Construction loans are for the purchase or construction of a property for which repayment will be generated by the property. We classify loans as construction until the completion of the construction phase. Following construction, if a loan is retained, the loan is reclassified to the commercial mortgage category. Lease financing consists of direct financing leases and leveraged leases and are used by commercial customers to finance capital purchases. Although our primary market is Hawaii, the commercial portfolio contains loans to some borrowers based on the U.S. Mainland, including some Shared National Credits.\nCommercial loans and leases were $4.0 billion as of December 31, 2018, an increase of $213.3 million or 6% from December 31, 2017. Commercial and industrial loans increased by $51.8 million or 4% from December 31, 2017. Commercial mortgage loans increased by $198.4 million or 9% from December 31, 2017 primarily due to continued demand from new and existing customers as the Hawaii economy continues to be strong. Construction loans decreased by $32.2 million or 16% from December 31, 2017 primarily due to paydowns and successful completion of construction projects such as condominiums and low-income housing, partially offset by increased activity in our portfolio.\nThe consumer loan and lease portfolio is comprised of residential mortgage loans, home equity lines and loans, indirect auto loans and leases, and other consumer loans including personal credit lines, direct installment loans, and rewards-based consumer credit cards. These products are generally offered in the geographic markets we serve. Although we offer a variety of products, our residential mortgage loan portfolio is primarily comprised of fixed-rate loans concentrated in Hawaii. We also offer a variety of home equity lines and loans, usually secured by second mortgages on residential property of the borrower. Automobile lending activities include loans and leases secured by new or used automobiles. We originate automobile loans and leases on an indirect basis through selected dealerships. Direct installment loans are generally unsecured and are often used for personal expenses or for debt consolidation.\nConsumer loans and leases were $6.5 billion as of December 31, 2018, an increase of $438.5 million or 7% from December 31, 2017. Residential mortgage loans increased by $207.0 million or 6% from December 31, 2017 primarily due to a relatively constant level of loan originations combined with a slowdown in payoff activity. Automobile loans increased by $129.7 million or 25% from December 31, 2017 primarily driven by steady automobile loan demand and competitive loan programs. Home equity lines and loans increased by $96.0 million or 6% from December 31, 2017 as a result of continued loan demand in light of a healthy Hawaii economy and stable real estate market conditions. Additionally, utilization on new and existing home equity lines was strong during 2018.\nSee Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements and the Corporate Risk Profile - Credit Risk\u201d section

As of December 31, 2018, based on our qualitative assessment, there were no reporting units where we believed it was more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit was less than its carrying amount, including goodwill. As a result, we had no reporting units where there was a reasonable possibility of failing Step 1 of the goodwill impairment test.

This decrease was primarily due to a $30.3 million decrease in accounts receivable, which was primarily due to a $20.0 million decrease related to the settlement of a matured security coupled with a $16.4 million early buy-out on an equipment lease in the first quarter of 2018. These decreases were partially offset by a $7.8 million increase in other assets.

In addition, commercial deposits increased by $124.4 million primarily due to a $95.1 million increase in core deposits and a $29.3 million increase in time deposits.

Some of our repurchase agreements with private institutions may be terminated at earlier specified dates by the private institution or in some cases by either the private institution or the Company. If all such agreements were to terminate at the earliest possible date, the weighted-average maturity for our repurchase agreements with private institutions would decrease to 2.0 years. As of December 31, 2018 and 2017, the weighted-average interest rate for repurchase agreements with government entities was 1.19% and 0.61%, respectively, while the weighted-average interest rate for repurchase agreements with private institutions as of December 31, 2018 and 2017 was 3.64%, with all rates being fixed. Each of our repurchase agreements is accounted for as collateralized financing arrangements (i.e., a secured borrowing) and not as a sale and subsequent repurchase of securities. See Note 9 and 19 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information.\nOther Debt\nOther debt was $135.6 million as of December 31, 2018, a decrease of $125.1 million or 48% from December 31, 2017. This decrease was primarily due to seven FHLB advances totaling $175.0 million which matured during 2018. As of December 31, 2018, this balance was mainly comprised of $125.0 million in FHLB advances with a weighted-average interest rate of 1.93% and maturity dates ranging from 2019 to 2020. These advances were primarily for asset/liability management purposes. As of December 31, 2018, our remaining line of credit with the FHLB was $2.2 billion.\nPension and Postretirement Plan Obligations\nRetirement benefits payable were $40.5 million as of December 31, 2018, an $3.2 million or 9% increase from December 31, 2017. Our pension and postretirement benefit obligations and net periodic benefit cost are actuarially determined based on a number of key assumptions, including the discount rate, the expected return on plan assets, and the health-care cost trend rate. The accounting for pension and postretirement benefit plans reflect the long-term nature of the obligations and the investment horizon of the plan assets. The increase in retirement benefits payable was primarily due to a net investment loss on assets during the year.\nThe discount rate is used to determine the present value of future benefit obligations and the net periodic benefit cost. The discount rate used to value the present value of future benefit obligations as of each year-end is the rate used to estimate the net periodic benefit cost for the following year. Table 14 presents a sensitivity analysis of a 25 basis point change in discount rates to the pension and postretirement benefit plan's net periodic benefit cost and benefit obligations:\nTable 50: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Discount Rate Sensitivity Analysis\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Table 14\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Impact of\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Base Discount Rate\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Discount Rate\n25 Basis Point Increase\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Discount Rate\n25 Basis Point Decrease\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(dollars in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Pension Benefit\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Postretirement Benefits\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Pension Benefits\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Postretirement Benefits\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Pension Benefits\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Postretirement Benefits\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2018 Net Periodic Benefit Cost\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.90\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.96\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>38\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(72\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(46\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>72\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Benefit Plan Obligations as of December 31, 2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.41\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.48\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(2,501\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(714\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,563\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>736\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Estimated 2019 Net Periodic Benefit Cost\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.41\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.48\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>31\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(66\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(38\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>66\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nSee Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information on our pension and postretirement benefit plans.\nForeign Activities\nCross-border outstandings are defined as loans (including accrued interest), acceptances, interest-bearing deposits with other banks, other interest-bearing investments, and any other monetary assets which are denominated in dollars or other non-local currency. As of December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, we did not have cross-border outstandings to any foreign country which exceeded 0.75% of our total assets.\nCorporate Risk Profile\nManaging risk is an essential part of successfully operating our business. Management believes that the most prominent risk exposures for the Company are credit risk, market risk, liquidity risk management, capital management, and operational risk.\nCredit Risk\nCredit risk is the risk that borrowers or counterparties will be unable or unwilling to repay their obligations in accordance with the underlying contractual terms. We manage and control credit risk in the loan and lease portfolio by adhering to well-defined underwriting criteria and account administration standards established by management. Written credit policies document underwriting standards, approval levels, exposure limits, and other limits or standards deemed necessary and prudent. Portfolio diversification at the obligor, industry, product, and/or geographic location levels is actively managed to mitigate concentration risk. In addition, credit risk management also includes an independent credit review process that assesses compliance with commercial and consumer credit policies, risk ratings, and other critical credit information. In addition to implementing risk management practices that are based upon established and sound lending practices, we adhere to sound credit principles. We understand and evaluate our customers' borrowing needs and capacity to repay, in conjunction with their character and history.\nCommercial and industrial loans are made primarily for the purpose of financing equipment acquisition, expansion, working capital, and other general business purposes. Lease financing consists of direct financing leases and leveraged leases that are used by commercial customers to finance capital purchases ranging from computer equipment to transportation equipment. The credit decisions for these transactions are based upon an assessment of the overall financial capacity of the applicant. A determination is made as to the applicant's ability to repay in accordance with the proposed terms as well as an overall assessment of the risks involved. In addition to an evaluation of the applicant's financial condition, a determination is made of the probable adequacy of the primary and secondary sources of repayment, such as additional collateral or personal guarantees, to be relied upon in the transaction. Credit agency reports of the applicant's credit history supplement the analysis of the applicant's creditworthiness.\nCommercial mortgages and construction loans are offered to real estate investors, developers, builders, and owner-occupants primarily domiciled in Hawaii. These loans are secured by first mortgages on real estate at loan-to-value ( LTV\u201d) ratios deemed appropriate based on the property type, location, overall quality, and sponsorship. Generally, these LTV ratios do not exceed 75%. The commercial properties are predominantly developments such as retail centers, apartments, industrial properties and, to a lesser extent, more specialized properties such as hotels. Substantially our entire commercial mortgage loans are secured by properties located in our primary market area.\nIn the underwriting of our commercial mortgage loans, we obtain appraisals for the underlying properties. Decisions to lend are based on the economic fundamentals of the property and the creditworthiness of the borrower. In evaluating a proposed commercial mortgage loan, we primarily emphasize the ratio of the property's projected net cash flows to the loan's debt service requirement. The debt service coverage ratio normally is not less than 120% and it is computed after deducting for a vacancy factor and property expenses as appropriate. In addition, a personal guarantee of the loan or a portion thereof is sometimes required from the principal(s) of the borrower. We typically require title insurance insuring the priority of our lien, fire, and extended coverage casualty insurance, and flood insurance, if appropriate, in order to protect our security interest in the underlying property. In addition, business interruption insurance or other insurance may be required. Owner-occupant commercial mortgage loans are underwritten based upon the cash flow of the business provided that the real estate asset is utilized in the operation of the business. Real estate is evaluated independently as a secondary source of repayment. As noted above, LTV ratios generally do not exceed 75%.\nConstruction loans are underwritten against projected cash flows derived from rental income, business income from an owner-occupant, or the sale of the property to an end-user. We may mitigate the risks associated with these types of loans by requiring fixed-price construction contracts, performance and payment bonding, controlled disbursements, and pre-sale contracts or pre-lease agreements.\nWe offer a variety of first mortgage and junior lien loans to consumers within our markets with residential home mortgages comprising our largest loan category. These loans are generally secured by a primary residence and are underwritten using traditional underwriting systems to assess the credit risks and financial capacity and repayment ability of the consumer. Decisions are primarily based on LTV ratios, debt-to-income ( DTI\u201d) ratios, liquidity, and credit scores. LTV ratios generally do not exceed 80%, although higher levels are permitted with mortgage insurance. We offer variable rate mortgage loans with interest rates that are subject to change every year after the first, third, fifth, or seventh year, depending on the product and are based on the London Interbank Offered Rate ( LIBOR\u201d). Variable rate mortgage loans are underwritten at fully-indexed interest rates. We do not offer payment-option facilities, sub-prime or Alt-A loans, or any product with negative amortization. We selectively offer interest-only mortgage loans to Private Banking clients.\u201d\nHome equity loans are secured by both first and second liens on residential property of the borrower. The underwriting terms for the home equity product generally permits borrowing availability, in the aggregate, up to 85% of the value of the collateral property at the time of origination. We offer fixed and variable rate home equity loans, with variable rate loans underwritten at fully-indexed interest rates. Our procedures for underwriting home equity loans include an assessment of an applicant's overall financial capacity and repayment ability. Decisions are primarily based on LTV ratios, DTI ratios, and credit scores. Maximum amount and LTVs are determined by collateral value and channel.\nAutomobile lending activities include loans and leases secured by new or used automobiles. We originate automobile loans and leases on an indirect basis through selected dealerships in Hawaii, Guam and Saipan. Our procedures for underwriting automobile loans include an assessment of an applicant's overall financial capacity and repayment ability, credit history, and the ability to meet existing obligations and payments on the proposed loan. Although an applicant's creditworthiness is the primary consideration, the underwriting process also includes a comparison of the value of the collateral security to the proposed loan amount. We require borrowers to maintain full coverage automobile insurance on automobile loans and leases, with the Bank listed as either the loss payee or additional insured.\nGeneral economic conditions in Hawaii remained healthy during 2018, led by a strong tourism industry, relatively low unemployment, rising real estate prices, and an active construction industry. Our overall credit risk position reflects these positive economic trends and our loan portfolio growth and composition.\nNon-Performing Assets and Accruing Loans and Leases Past Due 90 Days or

Changes in the level of non-accrual loans and leases typically represent increases for loans and leases that reach a specified past due status, offset by reductions for loans and leases that are charged-off, paid down, sold, transferred to foreclosed real estate, or are no longer classified as non-accrual because they have returned to accrual status.\nTotal NPAs were $12.9 million as of December 31, 2018, a decrease of $3.2 million or 20% from December 31, 2017. The decrease was experienced primarily in the consumer lending portfolio. The ratio of our NPAs to total loans and leases, and foreclosed real estate was 0.12% as of December 31, 2018 and 0.16% as of December 31, 2017.\nCommercial mortgage non-accrual loans increased by $0.6 million or 46% from December 31, 2017 primarily due to the addition of one loan. Although three loans were removed, the one loan addition has an amount greater than the three loans combined. We have individually evaluated the two commercial mortgage non-accrual loans for impairment and have no cumulative net charge-offs.\nCommercial and industrial non-accrual loans increased by $0.1 million or 21% from December 31, 2017 due to the addition of two loans. We have evaluated the two borrowers for impairment and have recorded a $0.2 million partial charge-off in 2018. As of December 31, 2018, the non-accrual balance in this category was comprised of six commercial borrowers.\nThe largest component of our NPAs continues to be residential mortgage loans. Residential mortgage non-accrual loans decreased by $3.9 million or 42% from December 31, 2017 primarily due to paydowns and payoffs. In addition, three loans modified in a troubled debt restructuring ( TDR\u201d) were returned to accrual status. As of December 31, 2018, our residential mortgage non-accrual loans were comprised of 21 loans with a weighted average current LTV ratio of 57%.\nForeclosed real estate represents property acquired as the result of borrower defaults on loans. Foreclosed real estate is recorded at fair value, less estimated selling costs, at the time of foreclosure. On an ongoing basis, properties are appraised as required by market conditions and applicable regulations. Foreclosed real estate increased by $0.3 million or 30% from December 31, 2017 primarily due to the addition of two residential properties as of December 31, 2018.\nLoans and Leases Past Due 90 Days or More and Still Accruing Interest\nLoans and leases in this category are 90 days or more past due, as to principal or interest, and are still accruing interest because they are well secured and in the process of collection. Loans and leases past due 90 days or more and still accruing interest were $6.6 million as of December 31, 2018, a $0.6 million or 8% decrease from December 31, 2017. This decrease was primarily in our other and automobile portfolios, which was offset by an increase in the home equity portfolio.\nImpaired Loans\nImpaired loans are defined as loans for which we believe it is probable we will not collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement. Included in impaired loans are all classes of commercial non-accruing loans (except lease financing and small business loans), all loans modified in a TDR (including accruing TDRs), and other loans where we believe that we will be unable to collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement. Impaired loans exclude lease financing and smaller balance homogeneous loans (consumer and small business non-accruing loans) that are collectively evaluated for impairment. Impaired loans were $54.6 million as of December 31, 2018 and $61.2 million as of December 31, 2017, and had a related Allowance of $4.0 million as of December 31, 2018 and $3.9 million as of December 31, 2017. The change in impaired loans was primarily due to the decrease in impaired Commercial Mortgage, Commercial and Industrial, and Residential Mortgage loans, which was partially offset by the increase in impaired Automobile, and Home Equity loans. As of December 31, 2018, we recorded cumulative net charge-offs of $7.6 million related to our total impaired loans. Our impaired loans are considered in management's assessment of the overall adequacy of the Allowance.\nIf interest due on the balances of all non-accrual loans as of December 31, 2018 had been accrued under the original terms, approximately $0.8 million in total interest income would have been recorded in 2018, compared to less than $0.1 million actually recorded as interest income on those loans.\nLoans Modified in a Troubled Debt Restructuring\nTable 17 presents information on loans whose terms have been modified in a TDR:\nTable 53: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Loans Modified in a Troubled Debt Restructuring\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Table 17\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(dollars in thousands)\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Commercial\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Commercial and Industrial\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>6,198\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>8,486\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Commercial Mortgage\n</td> <td>4,144\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9,205\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Construction\n</td> <td>1,321\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,416\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total Commercial\n</td> <td>11,663\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>19,107\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Consumer\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Residential Mortgage\n</td> <td>19,753\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>21,581\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Home Equity\n</td> <td>3,359\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,965\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Automobile\n</td> <td>17,117\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>14,811\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other 1\n</td> <td>2,098\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,645\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total Consumer\n</td> <td>42,327\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>41,002\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>53,990\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>60,109\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n1 Comprised of other revolving credit and installment financing.\nLoans modified in a TDR decreased by $6.1 million from December 31, 2017. The decrease was primarily due to the full repayments of commercial mortgage loans during the second quarter of 2018. Residential mortgage loans remain our largest TDR loan class. As of December 31, 2018, $48.7 million or 90% of loans modified in a TDR were performing in accordance with their modified contractual terms and were on accrual status.\nGenerally, loans modified in a TDR are returned to accrual status after the borrower has demonstrated performance under the modified terms by making at least six consecutive payments. See Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a description of the modification programs that we currently offer to our customers.\nReserve for Credit Losses\nThe Company's reserve for credit losses is comprised of two components, the Allowance and the reserve for unfunded commitments (the Unfunded Reserve\u201d).

other revolving credit, installment, and lease financing.\nAs of December 31, 2018, the Allowance was $106.7 million or 1.02% of total loans and leases outstanding, compared with an Allowance of $107.3 million or 1.10% of total loans and leases outstanding as of December 31, 2017. The level of the Allowance was commensurate with the Company's stable credit risk profile, loan portfolio growth and composition, and a healthy Hawaii economy.\nNet charge-offs of loans and leases were $14.1 million or 0.14% of total average loans and leases in 2018 compared to $13.8 million or 0.15% of total average loans and leases in 2017. Net charge-offs in our consumer portfolios were $14.6 million in 2018 compared to $13.9 million in 2017. This increase was primarily reflected in our credit card portfolio, which was sold on November 1, 2018, our home equity portfolio due to lower recoveries, as well as overdrafts. Net recoveries in our commercial portfolios were $0.5 million in 2018 compared to net recoveries of $0.1 million in 2017.\nAlthough we determine the amount of each component of the Allowance separately, the Allowance as a whole was considered appropriate by management as of December 31, 2018 based on our ongoing analysis of estimated probable credit losses, credit risk profiles, economic conditions, coverage ratios, and other relevant factors.\nThe allocation of the Allowance to our commercial portfolio segment increased by $1.1 million or 2% from December 31, 2017. This increase was primarily due to a $1.7 million increase in the Allowance allocated to the commercial and industrial portfolio due to loan growth. The increase was offset by a $0.7 million decrease in the Allowance allocated to the construction portfolio due to the completion of major construction projects and the resultant decline in construction outstandings.\nThe allocation of the Allowance to our consumer portfolio segment decreased by $1.7 million or 4% from December 31, 2017 and is consistent with current asset quality metrics and economic conditions.\nSee Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information on the Allowance and credit quality indicators.\nReserve for Unfunded Commitments\nThe Unfunded Reserve was $6.8 million as of December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017. The process used to determine the Unfunded Reserve is consistent with the process for determining the Allowance, as adjusted for estimated funding probabilities.\nOther Credit Risks\nIn the normal course of business, we serve the needs of state and political subdivisions in multiple capacities, including traditional banking products such as deposit services, and by investing in municipal debt securities. The carrying value of our municipal debt securities was $798.6 million as of December 31, 2018 and $865.5 million as of December 31, 2017. We also maintained investments in corporate bonds with a carrying value of $320.4 million as of December 31, 2018 and $385.7 million as of December 31, 2017. We are exposed to credit risk in these investments should the issuer of a security be unable to meet its financial obligations. This may result in the issuer failing to make scheduled interest payments and/or being unable to repay the principal upon maturity. See the Analysis of Statements of Condition - Investment Securities\u201d section in MD&A for more information.\nOur use of derivative financial instruments has been very limited in recent years. However, these financial instruments do expose the Company to counterparty credit risk. See Note 17 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information.\nMarket Risk\nMarket risk is the potential of loss arising from adverse changes in interest rates and prices. We are exposed to market risk as a consequence of the normal course of conducting our business activities. Our market risk management process involves measuring, monitoring, controlling, and mitigating risks that can significantly impact our statements of income and condition. In this management process, market risks are balanced with expected returns in an effort to enhance earnings performance while limiting volatility.\nOur primary market risk exposure is interest rate risk.\nInterest Rate Risk\nThe objective of our interest rate risk management process is to maximize net interest income while operating within acceptable limits established for interest rate risk and maintaining adequate levels of funding and liquidity. The potential cash flows, sales, or replacement value of many of our assets and liabilities, especially those that earn or pay interest, are sensitive to changes in the general level of interest rates. This interest rate risk arises primarily from our core business activities of extending loans and accepting deposits. Our investment securities portfolio is also subject to significant interest rate risk.\nMany factors affect our exposure to changes in interest rates, such as general economic and financial conditions, customer preferences, historical pricing relationships, and repricing characteristics of financial instruments. Our earnings are affected not only by general economic conditions but also by the monetary and fiscal policies of the U.S. and its agencies, particularly the Federal Reserve Bank (the FRB\u201d). The monetary policies of the FRB can influence the overall growth of loans, investment securities, and deposits and the level of interest rates earned on assets and paid for liabilities.\nIn managing interest rate risk, we, through the Asset/Liability Management Committee ( ALCO\u201d), measure short and long-term sensitivities to changes in interest rates. The ALCO, which is comprised of members of executive management, utilizes several techniques to manage interest rate risk, which include:\nTable 59: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>adjusting the statement of condition mix or altering the interest rate characteristics of assets and liabilities;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 60: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>changing product pricing strategies;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 61: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>modifying characteristics of the investment securities portfolio; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 62: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>using derivative financial instruments.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOur use of derivative financial instruments, as detailed in Note 17 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, has generally been limited. This is due to natural on-balance sheet hedges arising out of offsetting interest rate exposures from loans and investment securities with deposits and other interest-bearing liabilities. In particular, the investment securities portfolio is utilized to manage the interest rate exposure and sensitivity to within the guidelines and limits established by the ALCO. We utilize natural and offsetting economic hedges in an effort to reduce the need to employ off-balance sheet derivative financial instruments to hedge interest rate risk exposures. Expected movements in interest rates are also considered in managing interest rate risk. Thus, as interest rates change, we may use different techniques to manage interest rate risk.\nA key element in our ongoing process to measure and monitor interest rate risk is the utilization of an asset/liability simulation model that attempts to capture the dynamic nature of the statement of condition. The model is used to estimate and measure the statement of condition sensitivity to changes in interest rates. These estimates are based on assumptions about the behavior of loan and deposit pricing, repayment rates on mortgage-based assets, and principal amortization and maturities on other financial instruments. The model's analytics include the effects of standard prepayment options on mortgages and customer withdrawal options for deposits. While such assumptions are inherently uncertain, we believe that our assumptions are reasonable.\nWe utilize net interest income simulations to analyze short-term income sensitivities to changes in interest rates. Table 20 presents, for the twelve months subsequent to December 31, 2018 and 2017, an estimate of the change in net interest income that would result from a gradual and immediate change in interest rates, moving in a parallel fashion over the entire yield curve, relative to the measured base case scenario. The base case scenario assumes the statement of condition and interest rates are generally unchanged. Based on our net interest income simulation as of December 31, 2018, net interest income is expected to increase as interest rates rise. This is due in part to our strategy to maintain a relatively short investment portfolio duration. In addition, rising interest rates would drive higher rates on loans and investment securities, as well as induce a slower pace of premium amortization on certain securities within our investment portfolio. However, lower interest rates would likely cause a decline in net interest income as lower rates would lead to lower yields on loans and investment securities, as well as drive higher premium amortization on existing investment securities. Based on our net interest income simulation as of December 31, 2018, net interest income sensitivity to changes in interest rates for the twelve months subsequent to December 31, 2018 was slightly less sensitive in comparison to the sensitivity profile for the twelve months subsequent to December 31, 2017.\nTable 63: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net Interest Income Sensitivity Profile\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Table 20\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Impact on Future Annual Net Interest Income\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(dollars in thousands)\n</td> <td>December 31, 2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>December 31, 2017\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gradual Change in Interest Rates (basis points)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>+200\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>11,014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.2\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>12,420\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.6\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>+100\n</td> <td>5,673\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6,622\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>-100\n</td> <td>(6,289\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1.2\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(6,789\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1.4\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Immediate Change in Interest Rates (basis points)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>+200\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>23,309\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.6\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>29,876\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6.2\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>+100\n</td> <td>12,517\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>16,328\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>-100\n</td> <td>(17,665\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(3.5\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(21,653\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(4.5\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTo analyze the impact of changes in interest rates in a more realistic manner, non-parallel interest rate scenarios are also simulated. These non-parallel interest rate scenarios indicate that net interest income may decrease from the base case scenario should the yield curve flatten or become inverted for a period of time. Conversely, if the yield curve were to steepen, net interest income may increase.\nOther Market Risks\nIn addition to interest rate risk, we are exposed to other forms of market risk in our normal business transactions. Foreign currency and foreign exchange contracts expose us to a small degree of foreign currency risk. These transactions are primarily executed on behalf of customers. Our trust and asset management income is at risk to fluctuations in the market values of underlying assets, particularly debt and equity securities. Also, our share-based compensation expense is dependent on the fair value of our stock options, restricted stock units, and restricted stock at the date of grant. The fair value of stock options, restricted stock units, and restricted stock is impacted by the market price of the Parent's common stock on the date of grant and is at risk to changes in equity markets, general economic conditions, and other factors.\nLiquidity Risk Management\nThe objective of our liquidity risk management process is to manage cash flow and liquidity in an effort to provide continuous access to sufficient, reasonably priced funds. Funding requirements are impacted by loan originations and refinancings, deposit balance changes, liability issuances and settlements, and off-balance sheet funding commitments. We consider and comply with various regulatory guidelines regarding required liquidity levels and periodically monitor our liquidity position in light of the changing economic environment and customer activity. Based on periodic liquidity assessments, we may alter our asset, liability, and off-balance sheet positions. The ALCO monitors sources and uses of funds and modifies asset and liability positions as liquidity requirements change. This process, combined with our ability to raise funds in money and capital markets and through private placements, provides flexibility in managing the exposure to liquidity risk.\nIn an effort to satisfy our liquidity needs, we actively manage our assets and liabilities. We have access to immediate liquid resources in the form of cash which is primarily on deposit with the FRB. Potential sources of liquidity also include investment securities in our available-for-sale securities portfolio, our ability to sell loans in the secondary market, and to secure borrowings from the FRB and FHLB. Our held-to-maturity securities, while not intended for sale, may also be utilized in repurchase agreements to obtain funding. Our core deposits have historically provided us with a long-term source of stable and relatively lower cost source of funding. Additional funding is available through the issuance of long-term debt or equity.\nMaturities and payments on outstanding loans and investment securities also provide a steady flow of funds. Liquidity is further enhanced by our ability to pledge loans to access secured borrowings from the FHLB and FRB. As of December 31, 2018, we could have borrowed an additional $2.2 billion from the FHLB and an additional $538.5 million from the FRB based on the amount of collateral pledged.\nWe continued our focus on maintaining a strong liquidity position throughout 2018. As of December 31, 2018, cash and cash equivalents were $526.0 million, the carrying value of our available-for-sale investment securities was $2.0 billion, and total deposits were $15.0 billion. As of December 31, 2018, our available-for-sale investment securities portfolio was comprised of securities with an average base duration of approximately 2.3 years.\nCapital Management\nWe actively manage capital, commensurate with our risk profile, in our efforts to enhance shareholder value. We also seek to maintain capital levels for the Company and the Bank at amounts in excess of the regulatory well-capitalized\u201d thresholds. Periodically, we may respond to market conditions by implementing changes to our overall balance sheet positioning to manage our capital position.\nThe Company and the Bank are each subject to regulatory capital requirements administered by the federal banking agencies. Failure to meet minimum capital requirements could cause certain mandatory and discretionary actions by regulators that, if undertaken, would likely have a material effect on our financial statements. Under capital adequacy guidelines and the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action, the Company and the Bank must meet specific capital guidelines that involve quantitative and qualitative measures. These measures were established by regulation intended to ensure capital adequacy. As of December 31, 2018, the Company's capital levels remained characterized as well-capitalized.\u201d The Company's regulatory capital ratios are presented in Table 21 below. There have been no conditions or events since December 31, 2018 that management believes have changed either the Company's or the Bank's capital classifications.\nAs of December 31, 2018, shareholders' equity was $1.3 billion, an increase of $36.3 million or 3% from December 31, 2017. Earnings for 2018 of $219.6 million, common stock issuances of $7.9 million, and share-based compensation of $8.1 million were offset by cash dividends paid of $98.5 million, common stock repurchases of $92.0 million, and other comprehensive loss of $8.9 million. In 2018, included in the amount of common stock repurchased were 1,079,397 shares repurchased under our share repurchase program. These shares were repurchased at an average cost per share of $81.80 and a total cost of $88.3 million. From the beginning of our share repurchase program in July 2001 through December 31, 2018, we repurchased a total of 55.3 million shares of common stock and returned total over $2.1 billion to our shareholders at an average cost of $39.14 per share.\nIn January 2019, the Parent's Board of Directors increased the authorization under the share repurchase program by an additional $130.0 million. From January 1, 2019 through February 15, 2019, the Parent repurchased an additional 298,500 shares of common stock at an average cost of $75.46 per share and a total cost of $22.5 million. Remaining buyback authority was $139.2 million as of February 15, 2019. The actual amount and timing of future share repurchases, if any, will depend on market and economic conditions, regulatory rules, applicable SEC rules, and various other factors.\nIn January 2019, the Parent's Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.62 per share on the Parent's outstanding shares. The dividend will be payable on March 14, 2019 to shareholders of record at the close of business on February 28, 2019.\nTable 21 presents a five-year history of activities and balances in our capital accounts, along with key capital ratios.\nTable 64: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>

available-for-sale investment securities to the held-to-maturity category.\nRegulatory Initiatives Affecting the Banking Industry\nBasel III\nUnder final FRB and FDIC approved rules implementing the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision's capital guidelines for U.S. banks minimum requirements increased for both the quantity and quality of capital held by the Company. The Basel III capital standards substantially revised the risk based capital requirements applicable to bank holding companies and their depository institution subsidiaries, including the definitions and the components of Tier 1 capital and Total Capital, the method of evaluating risk-weighted assets, institutions of a capital conservation buffer, and other matters affecting regulatory capital ratios. Strict eligibility criteria for regulatory capital instruments were also implemented under the rules.\nThe phase-in period for the final rules became effective for the Company on January 1, 2015, with full compliance with all of the final rules' requirements phased in over a multi-year schedule, to be fully implemented earlier this year on January 1, 2019. As of December 31, 2018, the Company's capital levels remained characterized as well-capitalized\u201d under the new rules.\nManagement continues to monitor regulatory developments and their potential impact to the Company's liquidity requirements.\nStress Testing\nEnactment of the Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief, and Consumer Protection Act in May 2018 significantly altered several provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act, including how stress tests are run. Bank holding companies with assets of less than $100 billion, such as the Company, are no longer subject to company-run stress testing requirements in section 165(i)(2) of the Dodd-Frank Act, including publishing a summary of results. At this time, the Company continues to run internal stress tests as a component of our comprehensive risk management and capital planning process.\nDeposit Insurance Fund ( DIF\u201d) Assessment\nIn March 2016, the FDIC approved a final rule that imposes on banks with at least $10 billion in assets, such as the Company, a surcharge of 4.5 cents per $100 of their assessment base, after making certain adjustments. The surcharge became effective for the third quarter of 2016 and the FDIC estimated the surcharge would be imposed for approximately two years. The surcharge took effect at the same time that the regular FDIC insurance assessment rates for all banks declined under a rule adopted by the FDIC in 2011. The surcharge ended on September 30, 2018. A further reduction in assessment rates will occur if and when the FDIC's Deposit Insurance Fund Reserve Ratio reaches 2.0 percent.\nOperational Risk\nOperational risk represents the risk of loss resulting from our operations, including, but not limited to, the risk of fraud by employees or persons outside the Company, errors relating to transaction processing and technology, failure to adhere to compliance requirements, and the risk of cyber attacks. We are also exposed to operational risk through our outsourcing arrangements, and the effect that changes in circumstances or capabilities of our outsourcing vendors can have on our ability to continue to perform operational functions necessary to our business. The risk of loss also includes the potential legal actions that could arise as a result of an operational deficiency or as a result of noncompliance with applicable regulatory standards, adverse business decisions or their implementation, and customer attrition due to potential negative publicity. Operational risk is inherent in all business activities, and management of this risk is important to the achievement of Company goals and objectives.\nOur Operating Risk Committee (the ORC\u201d) provides oversight and assesses the most significant operational risks facing the Company. We have developed a framework that provides for a centralized operating risk management function through the ORC, supplemented by business unit responsibility for managing operational risks specific to their business units. Our internal audit department also validates the system of internal controls through ongoing risk-based audit procedures and reports on the effectiveness of internal controls to executive management and the Audit and Risk Committee of the Board of Directors.\nWe continuously strive to strengthen our system of internal controls to improve the oversight of operational risk.\nWhile our internal controls have been designed to minimize operational risks, there is no assurance that business disruption or operational losses will not occur. On an ongoing basis, management reassesses operational risks, implements appropriate process changes, and invests in enhancements to our systems of internal controls.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements and Guarantees\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe hold interests in several unconsolidated variable interest entities ( VIEs\u201d). These unconsolidated VIEs are primarily low-income housing partnerships and solar energy tax credit partnership investments. Variable interests are defined as contractual ownership or other interests in an entity that change with fluctuations in an entity's net asset value. The primary beneficiary consolidates the VIE. We have determined that the Company is not the primary beneficiary of these entities. As a result, we do not consolidate these VIEs. See discussion of our accounting policy related to VIEs in Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nGuarantees\nWe pool Federal Housing Administration ( FHA\u201d) insured and U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs ( VA\u201d) guaranteed residential mortgage loans for sale to Ginnie Mae. We also sell residential mortgage loans in the secondary market to Fannie Mae. The agreements under which we sell residential mortgage loans to Ginnie Mae or Fannie Mae and the insurance or guaranty agreements with the FHA and VA contain provisions that include various representations and warranties regarding the origination and characteristics of the residential mortgage loans. Although these loans are primarily sold on a non-recourse basis, we may be obligated to repurchase residential mortgage loans or reimburse the respective investor if it is found that required documents were not delivered or were defective.\nWe also service substantially all of the loans we sell to investors in the secondary market. Each agreement under which we act as servicer generally specifies a standard of responsibility for our actions and provides protection against expenses and liabilities incurred by us when acting in compliance with the respective servicing agreements. However, if we commit a material breach of obligations as servicer, we may be subject to various penalties which may include the repurchase of an affected loan or a reimbursement to the respective investor.\nSee discussion of our risks related to representation and warranty provisions as well as our risks related to residential mortgage loan servicing activities in Note 20 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nContractual Obligations\nOur contractual obligations as of December 31, 2018 were as follows:\nTable 65: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Contractual Obligations 1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Table 22\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(dollars in thousands)\n</td> <td>Less Than One Year\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1-3 Years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4-5 Years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>After 5 Years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Deposits with No Stated Maturity\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>13,281,720\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>13,281,720\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Time Deposits\n</td> <td>1,441,580\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>235,422\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>60,916\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7,604\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,745,522\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Securities Sold Under Agreements to Repurchase\n</td> <td>4,296\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>275,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>225,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>504,296\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other Debt\n</td> <td>50,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>75,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>125,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Banker's Acceptances Outstanding\n</td> <td>51\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>51\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Capital Lease Obligations\n</td> <td>825\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,650\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,650\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>23,930\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>28,055\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Non-Cancelable Operating Leases\n</td> <td>12,455\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>22,291\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>19,898\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>104,877\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>159,521\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Purchase Obligations\n</td> <td>14,279\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>22,647\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,658\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,162\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>45,746\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Affordable Housing Commitments\n</td> <td>5,506\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8,411\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>163\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,118\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>15,198\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Pension and Postretirement Benefit Contributions 2\n</td> <td>1,331\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,821\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,103\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9,264\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>16,519\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total Contractual Obligations\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>14,812,043\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>643,242\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>315,388\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>150,955\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>15,921,628\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 66: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>1\n</td> <td>Our liability for UTBs as of December 31, 2018 was $5.5 million.

fourth quarter of 2018 was $53.9 million, an increase of $11.0 million or 26% compared to the fourth quarter of 2017. Diluted earnings per share were $1.30 for the fourth quarter of 2018, an increase of $0.29 or 29% compared to the fourth quarter of 2017.\nNet Interest Income\nNet interest income, on a taxable-equivalent basis, for the fourth quarter of 2018 was $125.2 million, an increase of $3.7 million or 3% compared to the fourth quarter of 2017. The increase was primarily due to the shift in the mix of our earning assets to loans, which generally have higher yields. Net interest margin was 3.10% for the fourth quarter of 2018, an increase of 12 basis point compared to the fourth quarter of 2017, primarily due to our loans, which generally have higher yields than our investment securities, comprising a larger percentage of our earning assets compared to 2017. In addition, yields increased for our commercial loans and investment portfolio. Yields on our loan portfolios increased primarily due to higher yields on floating rate loans.\nProvision for Credit Losses\nWe recorded a Provision of $2.0 million in the fourth quarter of 2018 compared to a Provision of $4.3 million recorded in the fourth quarter of 2017, while recording net charge-offs of loans and leases of $4.0 million and $3.8 million in the fourth quarters of 2018 and 2017, respectively. The Provision recorded was based on our determination that the allowance for loan and lease losses should be $106.7 million as of December 31, 2018.\nNoninterest Income\nNoninterest income, other than net gains on sales of investment securities, was $42.9 million in the fourth quarter of 2018, an increase of $0.5 million or 1% compared to the fourth quarter of 2017. This increase was primarily due to fees, exchange, and other service charges of $0.6 million in merchant income, which was recorded as a reduction of other noninterest expense in 2017. This accounting change was related to the 2018 adoption of the new revenue recognition accounting guidance. This increase was partially offset by a $0.4 decrease in mortgage banking income. This decrease was primarily due to reduced sales and margins on sales of conforming saleable loans from current production and from our mortgage loan portfolio.\nNoninterest Expense\nNoninterest expense was $95.9 million in the fourth quarter of 2018, an increase of $3.6 million or 4% compared to the fourth quarter of 2017. Salaries and benefit expense increased by $3.2 million primarily due to a $2.7 million increase in expenses related to our self-insured medical plans, a $2.5 million increase in merit and minimum wage increases, and a $1.0 million increase in separation expense. These increases were partially offset by a $0.9 million decrease in FDIC fees. In addition, during fourth quarter 2017 a one-time $2.2 million holiday bonus, inclusive of payroll taxes was paid.\nProvision for Income Taxes\nThe provision for income taxes was $14.3 million in the fourth quarter of 2018, a decrease of $6.8 million or 32% compared to the fourth quarter of 2017. The effective tax rate for the fourth quarter of 2018 was 20.92% compared with an effective tax rate of 32.93% for the fourth quarter of 2017. The lower effective rate in the fourth quarter of 2018 compared to the same period of 2017 was primarily due to the federal corporate tax rate changing from 35% to 21% as a result of the passage of the Tax Act, which was signed into law on December 22, 2017.\nCommon Stock Repurchase Program\nIn the fourth quarter of 2018, we repurchased 325,377 shares of our common stock under our share repurchase program at an average cost per share of $76.63 and a total cost of $24.9 million. See Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information related to our common stock repurchase program.", "item_7_truncated": "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nForward-Looking Statements\nThis report contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements can be identified by the fact that they do not relate strictly to historical or current facts and may include statements concerning, among other things, the anticipated economic and business environment in our service area and elsewhere, credit quality and other financial and business matters in future periods, our future results of operations and financial position, our business strategy and plans and our objectives and future operations. We also may make forward-looking statements in our other documents filed with or furnished to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC\u201d). In addition, our senior management may make forward-looking statements orally to analysts, investors, representatives of the media and others. Our forward-looking statements are based on numerous assumptions, any of which could prove to be inaccurate, and actual results may differ materially from those projected because of a variety of risks and uncertainties, including, but not limited to: 1) general economic conditions either nationally, internationally, or locally may be different than expected, and particularly, any event that negatively impacts the tourism industry in Hawaii; 2) unanticipated changes in the securities markets, public debt markets, and other capital markets in the U.S. and internationally; 3) competitive pressures in the markets for financial services and products; 4) the impact of legislative and regulatory initiatives, particularly the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 (the Dodd-Frank Act\u201d) and Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief, and Consumer Protection Act of 2018; 5) changes in fiscal and monetary policies of the markets in which we operate; 6) the increased cost of maintaining or the Company's ability to maintain adequate liquidity and capital, based on the requirements adopted by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision and U.S. regulators; 7) actual or alleged conduct which could harm our reputation; 8) changes in accounting standards; 9) changes in tax laws or regulations, including Public Law 115-97, commonly known as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, or the interpretation of such laws and regulations; 10) changes in our credit quality or risk profile that may increase or decrease the required level of our reserve for credit losses; 11) changes in market interest rates that may affect credit markets and our ability to maintain our net interest margin; 12) the impact of litigation and regulatory investigations of the Company, including costs, expenses, settlements, and judgments; 13) any failure in or breach of our operational systems, information systems or infrastructure, or those of our merchants, third party vendors and other service providers; 14) any interruption or breach of security of our information systems resulting in failures or disruptions in customer account management, general ledger processing, and loan or deposit systems; 15) changes to the amount and timing of proposed common stock repurchases; and 16) natural disasters, public unrest or adverse weather, public health, and other conditions impacting us and our customers' operations or negatively impacting the tourism industry in Hawaii. Given these risks and uncertainties, investors should not place undue reliance on any forward-looking statement as a prediction of our actual results. A detailed discussion of these and other risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results and events to differ materially from such forward-looking statements is included under the section entitled Risk Factors\u201d in Part I of this report. Words such as believes,\u201d anticipates,\u201d expects,\u201d intends,\u201d targeted,\u201d and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements but are not the exclusive means of identifying such statements. We undertake no obligation to update forward-looking statements to reflect later events or circumstances, except as may be required by law.\nCritical Accounting Policies\nOur Consolidated Financial Statements were prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ( GAAP\u201d) and follow general practices within the industries in which we operate. The most significant accounting policies we follow are presented in Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Application of these principles requires us to make estimates, assumptions, and judgments that affect the amounts reported in the Consolidated Financial Statements and accompanying notes. Most accounting policies are not considered by management to be critical accounting policies. Several factors are considered in determining whether or not a policy is critical in the preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements. These factors include among other things, whether the policy requires management to make difficult, subjective, and complex judgments about matters that are inherently uncertain and because it is likely that materially different amounts would be reported under different conditions or using different assumptions. The accounting policies which we believe to be most critical in preparing our Consolidated Financial Statements are those that are related to the determination of the reserve for credit losses, fair value estimates, leased asset residual values, and income taxes.\nReserve for Credit Losses\nA consequence of lending activities is that we may incur credit losses. The amount of such losses will vary depending upon the risk characteristics of the loan and lease portfolio as affected by economic conditions such as rising interest rates and the financial performance of borrowers. The reserve for credit losses consists of the allowance for loan and lease losses (the Allowance\u201d) and the reserve for unfunded commitments (the Unfunded Reserve\u201d). The Allowance provides for probable and estimable losses inherent in our loan and lease portfolio. The Allowance is increased or decreased through the provisioning process. There is no exact method of predicting specific losses or amounts that ultimately may be charged-off on particular segments of the loan and lease portfolio. The Unfunded Reserve is a component of other liabilities and represents the estimate for probable credit losses inherent in unfunded commitments to extend credit. The level of the Unfunded Reserve is adjusted by recording an expense or recovery in other noninterest expense.\nManagement's evaluation of the adequacy of the reserve for credit losses is often the most critical of accounting estimates for a financial institution. Our determination of the amount of the reserve for credit losses is a critical accounting estimate as it requires significant reliance on the accuracy of credit risk ratings on individual borrowers, the use of estimates and significant judgment as to the amount and timing of expected future cash flows on impaired loans, significant reliance on estimated loss rates on homogenous portfolios, and consideration of our quantitative and qualitative evaluation of economic factors and trends. While our methodology in establishing the reserve for credit losses attributes portions of the Allowance and Unfunded Reserve to the commercial and consumer portfolio segments, the entire Allowance and Unfunded Reserve is available to absorb credit losses inherent in the total loan and lease portfolio and total amount of unfunded credit commitments, respectively.\nThe reserve for credit losses related to our commercial portfolio segment is generally most sensitive to the accuracy of credit risk ratings assigned to each borrower. Commercial loan risk ratings are evaluated based on each situation by experienced senior credit officers and are subject to periodic review by an independent internal team of credit specialists. The reserve for credit losses related to our consumer portfolio segment is generally most sensitive to economic assumptions and delinquency trends. The reserve for credit losses attributable to each portfolio segment also includes an amount for inherent risks not reflected in the historical analyses. Relevant factors include, but are not limited to, concentrations of credit risk (geographic, large borrower, and industry), economic trends and conditions, changes in underwriting standards, experience and depth of lending staff, trends in delinquencies, and the level of criticized and classified loans.\nSee Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements and the Corporate Risk Profile - Credit Risk\u201d section in Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations ( MD&A\u201d) for more information on the Allowance and the Unfunded Reserve.\nFair Value Measurements\nFair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in the principal or most advantageous market for an asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. The degree of management judgment involved in determining the fair value of a financial instrument is dependent upon the availability of quoted market prices or observable market inputs. For financial instruments that are traded actively and have quoted market prices or observable market inputs, there is minimal subjectivity involved in measuring fair value. However, when quoted market prices or observable market inputs are not fully available, significant management judgment may be necessary to estimate fair value. In developing our fair value measurements, we maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs.\nThe fair value hierarchy defines Level 1 valuations as those based on quoted prices, unadjusted, for identical instruments traded in active markets. Level 2 valuations are those based on quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active, or model-based valuation techniques for which all significant assumptions are observable in the market. Level 3 valuations are based on model-based techniques that use at least one significant assumption not observable in the market, or significant management judgment or estimation, some of which may be internally developed.\nFinancial assets that are recorded at fair value on a recurring basis include available-for-sale investment securities, loans held for sale, mortgage servicing rights, investments related to deferred compensation arrangements, and derivative financial instruments. As of December 31, 2018 and 2017, $2.1 billion or 12% and $2.3 billion or 13%, respectively, of our total assets consisted of financial assets recorded at fair value on a recurring basis and most of these financial assets consisted of available-for-sale investment securities measured using information from a third-party pricing service. These investments in debt securities and mortgage-backed securities were all classified in either Levels 1 or 2 of the fair value hierarchy. Financial liabilities that are recorded at fair value on a recurring basis are comprised of derivative financial instruments. As of December 31, 2018 and 2017, $9.7 million or less than 1% of our total liabilities consisted of financial liabilities recorded at fair value on a recurring basis. As of December 31, 2018 and 2017, Level 3 financial assets recorded at fair value on a recurring basis were $15.1 million and $11.8 million, respectively, or less than 1% of our total assets, and were comprised of mortgage servicing rights and derivative financial instruments. As of December 31, 2018 and 2017, Level 3 financial liabilities recorded at fair value on a recurring basis were $9.4 million and $9.5 million, respectively, or less than 1% of our total liabilities, and were comprised of derivative financial instruments.\nOur third-party pricing service makes no representations or warranties that the pricing data provided to us is complete or free from errors, omissions, or defects. As a result, we have processes in place to monitor and periodically review the information provided to us by our third-party pricing service such as: 1) Our third-party pricing service provides us with documentation by asset class of inputs and methodologies used to value securities. We review this documentation to evaluate the inputs and valuation methodologies used to place securities into the appropriate level of the fair value hierarchy. This documentation is periodically updated by our third-party pricing service. Accordingly, transfers of securities within the fair value hierarchy are made if deemed necessary. 2) On a quarterly basis, management also selects a sample of securities priced by the Company's third-party pricing service and reviews the significant assumptions and valuation methodologies used by the pricing service with respect to those securities. The information provided is comprised of market reference data, which may include reported trades; bids, offers, or broker-dealer dealer quotes; benchmark yields and spreads; as well as other reference data as appropriate. Periodically, based on these reviews, management determines whether the current placement of the security in the fair value hierarchy is appropriate or whether transfers may be warranted. 3) On a quarterly basis, management reviews the pricing information received from our third-party pricing service. This review process includes a comparison to a second source. 4) Our third-party pricing service has also established processes for us to submit inquiries regarding quoted prices. Periodically, we will challenge the quoted prices provided by our third-party pricing service. Our third-party pricing service will review the inputs to the evaluation in light of the new market data presented by us. Our third-party pricing service may then affirm the original quoted price or may update the evaluation on a going forward basis. Generally, we do not adjust the price from the third-party service provider. 5) On an annual basis, we obtain and review the third-party's most recently issued Service Organization Controls report. related to controls placed in operation and tests of operating effectiveness, to update our understanding of the third-party pricing service's control environment.\nBased on the composition of our investment securities portfolio, we believe that we have developed appropriate internal controls and performed appropriate due diligence procedures to prevent or detect material misstatements. See Note 21 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information on our fair value measurements.\nIncome Taxes\nWe determine our liabilities for income taxes based on current tax regulations and interpretations in tax jurisdictions where our income is subject to taxation. Currently, we file tax returns in seven federal, state and local domestic jurisdictions, and four foreign jurisdictions. In estimating income taxes payable or receivable, we assess the relative merits and risks of the appropriate tax treatment considering statutory, judicial, and regulatory guidance in the context of each tax position. Accordingly, previously estimated liabilities are regularly reevaluated and adjusted through the provision for income taxes. Changes in the estimate of income taxes payable or receivable occur periodically due to changes in tax rates, interpretations of tax law, the status of examinations being conducted by various taxing authorities, and newly enacted statutory, judicial and regulatory guidance that impact the relative merits and risks of each tax position. These changes, when they occur, may affect the provision for income taxes as well as current and deferred income taxes, and may be significant to our statements of income and condition.\nManagement's determination of the realization of net deferred tax assets is based upon management's judgment of various future events and uncertainties, including the timing and amount of future income, as well as the implementation of various tax planning strategies to maximize realization of the deferred tax assets. A valuation allowance is provided when it is more likely than not that some portion of the deferred tax asset will not be realized. As of December 31, 2018 and 2017, we carried a valuation allowance of $1.1 million and $1.0 million, respectively, related to our deferred tax assets established in connection with our low-income housing investments.\nWe are also required to record a liability, referred to as an unrecognized tax benefit (\"UTB\"), for the entire amount of benefit taken in a prior or future income tax return when we determine that a tax position has a less than 50% likelihood of being accepted by the taxing authority. As of December 31, 2018 and 2017, our liabilities for UTBs were $5.5 million and $5.3 million, respectively.\nIn 2018, the Company recognized federal and State of Hawaii investment tax credits from energy investments. The Company uses the deferral method of accounting for its investment tax credit with the benefit recognized in the provision for income taxes. These credits reduced the Company's provision for income taxes by $5.0 million, 5.4 million, and 4.7 million in 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively.\nPublic law No. 115-97, known as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the \"Tax Act\"), which was enacted on December 22, 2017, reduced the U.S. federal corporate tax rate from 35% to 21% effective January 1, 2018. Also on December 22, 2017, the Securities and Exchange Commission issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118 ( SAB 118\u201d), which provides guidance on accounting for tax effects of the Tax Act. SAB 118 provides a measurement period of up to one year from the enactment date to complete the accounting. Any adjustments during this measurement period were included in net earnings from continuing operations as\nan adjustment to income tax expense in the reporting period when such adjustments were determined. Based on the information available and current interpretation of the rules, the Company calculated the impact of the reduction in the corporate tax rate and remeasurement of certain deferred tax assets and liabilities. The provisional amount recorded in the fourth quarter of 2017 related to the remeasurement of the Company's deferred tax balance resulted in additional income tax expense of $3.6 million. An additional $0.1 million was expensed in the first quarter of 2018 due to the remeasurement of the Company's deferred tax balance. In addition, during the first quarter of 2018, the Company recorded a $2.0 million basis adjustment on its low income\nhousing partnership investments, which consequently reduced income tax expense by the same amount. The remeasurement of the Company's deferred tax balance in the third quarter of 2018 resulted in an income tax expense reduction of $0.3 million. The Company finalized the impact of the Tax Act in the third quarter of 2018.\nOverview\nWe are a regional financial services company serving businesses, consumers, and governments in Hawaii, Guam, and other Pacific Islands. Our principal operating subsidiary, the Bank, was founded in 1897 and is the largest independent financial institution in Hawaii.\nOur business strategy is to use our unique market knowledge, prudent management discipline and brand strength to deliver exceptional value to our stakeholders. Our business plan is balanced between growth and risk management while maintaining flexibility to adjust to economic changes. We will continue to focus on providing customers with best-in-class service and an innovative mix of products and services. We will also remain focused on continuing to deliver strong financial results while maintaining prudent risk and capital management strategies as well as our commitment to support our local communities.\nHawaii Economy\nGeneral economic conditions in Hawaii remained healthy during 2018, led by a strong tourism industry, relatively low unemployment, rising real estate prices, and an active construction industry. Total visitor arrivals increased 5.9% and visitor spending increased 6.8% during 2018 compared to 2017. The statewide seasonally-adjusted unemployment rate was 2.5% in December 2018 compared to 3.9% nationally. The volume of single-family home sales on Oahu decreased 7.7% in 2018 compared to 2017, while the volume of condominium sales on Oahu decreased 2.5% in 2018 compared to 2017. The median price of single-family home sales and condominium sales on Oahu increased 4.6% and 3.7%, respectively, in 2018 compared to 2017. As of December 31, 2018, months of inventory of single-family homes and condominiums on Oahu remained low at approximately 2.8 months and 2.9 months, respectively.\nEarnings Summary\nNet income for 2018 was $219.6 million, an increase of $34.9 million or 19% compared to 2017. Diluted earnings per share were $5.23 in 2018, an increase of $0.90 or 21% compared to 2017. Our return on average assets was 1.29% in 2018, an increase of 19 basis points from 2017, and our return on average shareholders' equity was 17.63% in 2018, an increase of 236 basis points from 2017.\nOur higher net income in 2018 was primarily due to the following:\n \u2022 The provision for income taxes was $50.6 million in 2018, a decrease of $32.8 million or 39% compared to 2017 primarily due to the federal corporate tax rate changing from 35% to 21% as a result of the passage of the Tax Act. The effective tax rate was 18.73% in 2018 compared to 31.11% in 2017. \n \u2022 Net interest income was $486.4 million in 2018, an increase of $29.1 million or 6% compared to 2017. On a taxable-equivalent basis, net interest income was $491.5 million in 2018, an increase of $22.4 million or 5% compared to 2017. This increase was primarily due to a higher level of earning assets, including growth in both our commercial and consumer lending portfolios, and higher net interest margin. The higher level of earning assets was primarily funded by higher deposit balances. Net interest margin was 3.05% in 2018, a 12 basis point increase from 2017, primarily due to our loans, which generally have higher yields than our investment securities, comprising a larger percentage of our earning assets compared to 2017. In addition, yields increased for our commercial loans and investment portfolio. Yields on our loan portfolios increased primarily due to higher yields on floating rate loans. This was partially offset by an increase in rates offered on our deposit products. \n \u2022 We recorded a $13.4 million provision for credit losses in 2018 compared to a $16.9 million provision recorded in 2017. The provision recorded was based on our determination that the allowance for loan and lease losses should be $106.7 million as of December 31, 2018. \nThese items were partially offset by the following:\n \u2022 Investment securities gains (losses), net totaled $(3.9) million in 2018 compared to $10.4 million in 2017. The net losses in 2018 were due to fees paid to the counterparties of our prior Visa Class B share sale transactions combined with a $1.0 million payment related to a change in the Visa Class B share conversion ratio. The net gain in 2017 was primarily due the sale of 90,000 Visa Class B shares. \n \u2022 Salaries and benefits expense was $213.2 million in 2018, an increase of $9.5 million or 5% compared to 2017 primarily due to $9.8 million increase in merit and minimum wage increases. Medical, dental, and life insurance increased by $3.8 million primarily due to higher expenses related to our self-insured medical plans coupled with increased group medical insurance costs. These increases were partially offset by a $2.1 million decrease in incentive compensation. During the fourth quarter of 2017, the Company paid a $2.2 million bonus, inclusive of payroll taxes, partly due to anticipated future tax expense reductions resulting from the Tax Act. In addition, share-based compensation decreased by $2.1 million as a result of the Company's lower share price. Commission expense also decreased by $2.1 million primarily due to a decrease in loan origination and refinancing activity. \n \u2022 Mortgage banking income was $8.4 million in 2018, a decrease of $4.5 million or 35% compared to 2017. This decrease was primarily due to reduced sales and margins on sales of conforming saleable loans from current production and from our mortgage loan portfolio. \nWe maintained a strong balance sheet throughout 2018, with what we believe are adequate reserves for credit losses, and high levels of liquidity and capital.\n \u2022 Total loans and leases were $10.4 billion as of December 31, 2018, an increase of $0.7 billion or 7% from December 31, 2017 primarily due to growth in our consumer lending portfolios. \n \u2022 The allowance for loan and lease losses (the Allowance\u201d) was $106.7 million as of December 31, 2018, a decrease of $0.7 million or 1% from December 31, 2017. The ratio of our Allowance to total loans and leases outstanding decreased to 1.02% as of December 31, 2018, compared to 1.10% as of December 31, 2017. The level of our Allowance was commensurate with the Company's credit risk profile, loan portfolio growth and composition, and a healthy Hawaii economy. \n \u2022 The total carrying value of our investment securities portfolio was $5.5 billion as of December 31, 2018, a decrease of $671.1 million or 11% from December 31, 2017. In 2018, we reduced our positions primarily in mortgage-backed securities, municipal debt securities, and corporate debt securities. Government National Mortgage Corporation ( Ginnie Mae\u201d) mortgage-backed securities continue to be our largest concentration in our portfolio. \n \u2022 Total deposits were $15.0 billion as of December 31, 2018, an increase of $0.1 billion or 1% from December 31, 2017 primarily due to higher consumer core and time deposits. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in public and other deposits largely due to the strategic decision to reduce public time deposits. \n \u2022 Total shareholders' equity was $1.3 billion as of December 31, 2018, an increase of $36.3 million or 3% from December 31, 2017. We continued to return capital to our shareholders in the form of share repurchases and dividends. During 2018, we repurchased 1,120,755 shares of common stock at a total cost of $92.0 million under our share repurchase program and from employees and/or directors in connection with income tax withholdings related to the vesting of restricted stock, shares purchased for a deferred compensation plan, and stock swaps, less shares distributed from the deferred compensation plan. We also paid cash dividends of $98.5 million during 2018. \nAnalysis of Statements of Income\nAverage balances, related income and expenses, and resulting yields and rates are presented in Table 1.

in interest income and expense not solely due to changes in volume or rate has been allocated on a pro-rata basis to the volume and rate columns.\n2 Comprised of other consumer revolving credit, installment, and consumer lease financing.\nNet Interest Income\nNet interest income is affected by the size and mix of our balance sheet components as well as the spread between interest earned on assets and interest paid on liabilities. Net interest margin is defined as net interest income, on a taxable-equivalent basis, as a percentage of average earning assets.\nNet interest income was $486.4 million in 2018, an increase of $29.1 million or 6% compared to 2017. On a taxable-equivalent basis, net interest income was $491.5 million in 2018, an increase of $22.4 million or 5% compared to 2017. This increase was primarily due to a higher level of earning assets, including growth in both our commercial and consumer lending portfolios, and higher net interest margin. The higher level of earning assets was primarily funded by higher deposit balances. Net interest margin was 3.05% in 2018, a 12 basis point increase from 2017, primarily due to our loans, which generally have higher yields than our investment securities, comprising a larger percentage of our earning assets compared to 2017. In addition, yields increased for our commercial loans and investment portfolio. Yields on our loan portfolios increased primarily due to higher yields on floating rate loans.\nYields on our earning assets increased by 22 basis points in 2018 compared to 2017 primarily due to the shift in the mix of our earning assets from investment securities to loans, which generally have higher yields. Yields on our commercial and industrial and commercial mortgage portfolios increased by 46 basis points and 31 basis points, respectively, primarily due to higher yields on floating rate loans. In addition, yields on our investment securities portfolio increased by 14 basis points primarily due to the higher interest rate environment and lower premium amortization. These yield increases were partially offset by an 86 basis point decrease in yield for our automobile loans portfolio.\nInterest rates paid on our interest-bearing liabilities increased 15 basis points in 2018 compared to 2017. Increases to our funding costs were primarily due to higher rates paid on our interest-bearing deposits, a reflection of the higher rate environment. The increase in our funding costs was partially offset by a lower average balance of our public time deposits which decreased by $209.2 million. Interest rates paid on our securities sold under agreements to repurchase decreased by 19 basis points from 2017 primarily due to the restructuring of three repurchase agreements with private institutions with an aggregate total of $200.0 million. These repurchase agreements had a weighted-average interest rate of 3.94%. The restructuring of the agreements extended the maturity dates to June 2022 and lowered the weighted-average interest rate to 2.70% effective June 2017.\nAverage balances of our earning assets increased by $92.1 million or 1% in 2018 compared to 2017 primarily due to loan growth as the average balances of our loans and leases portfolio increased by $696.9 million. Offsetting this increase in the average balance of our loans and leases portfolio were a $371.5 million decrease in the average balance of investment securities and a $223.0 million decrease in the average balance of funds sold. The average balance of our residential mortgage portfolio increased by $238.9 million primarily due to a relatively constant level of loan originations combined with a slowdown in payoff activity. The average balance of our commercial mortgage portfolio increased by $187.5 million primarily due to continued demand from new and existing customers as a result of healthy Hawaii economy. The average balance of our home equity portfolio increased by $153.2 million as a result of continued loan demand in light of a healthy Hawaii economy and stable real estate market conditions. Additionally, utilization on new and existing home equity lines was strong during 2018.\nAverage balances of our interest-bearing liabilities increased by $228.3 million or 2% in 2018 compared to 2017 primarily due to growth in our consumer and commercial time deposits, along with continued growth in our relationship checking and savings products, offset by the aforementioned lower average balance in our public time deposits. Average balances in our time deposits and core deposits increased by $136.5 million and $132.9 million, respectively.\nNet interest income was $457.2 million in 2017, an increase of $39.7 million or 9% compared to 2016. On a taxable-equivalent basis, net interest income was $469.1 million in 2017, an increase of $39.5 million or 9% compared to 2016. This increase was primarily due to a higher level of earning assets, including growth in both our commercial and consumer lending portfolios, and higher net interest margin. The higher level of earning assets was primarily funded by higher deposit balances. Net interest margin was 2.93% in 2017, a 10 basis point increase from 2016, primarily due to our loans, which generally have higher yields than our investment securities, comprising a larger percentage of our earning assets compared to 2016. In addition, yields increased for our commercial loans and investment portfolio. Yields on our loan portfolios increased primarily due to higher yields on floating rate loans. This was partially offset by an increase in rates offered on our deposit products.\nYields on our earning assets increased by 12 basis points in 2017 compared to 2016 primarily due to the shift in the mix of our earning assets from funds sold to loans which generally have higher yields. Yields on our commercial and industrial and commercial mortgage portfolios increased by 10 basis points and 11 basis points, respectively, primarily due to higher yields on floating rate loans. In addition, yields on our investment securities portfolio increased by 10 basis points primarily due to the higher interest rate environment and lower premium amortization. These yield increases were partially offset by a 15 basis point yield decrease in our residential mortgage loan portfolio, primarily due to continued payoff activity of higher-rate mortgage loans and the addition of lower-rate mortgage loans to our portfolio.\nInterest rates paid on our interest-bearing liabilities increased four basis points in 2017 compared to 2016. Interest rates paid on our time deposits increased by 31 basis points due to new public time deposits at higher rates. Interest rates paid on our securities sold under agreements to repurchase decreased by 25 basis points from 2016 due to the restructuring of three repurchase agreements with private institutions with an aggregate total of $200.0 million during the second quarter of 2017. These repurchase agreements were to mature in 2018 and had a weighted-average interest rate of 3.94%. The restructuring of the agreements extended the maturity dates to June 2022 and lowered the weighted-average interest rate to 2.70% effective June 2017. The remaining balance in our repurchase agreements consists mainly of those with private entities which have relatively longer terms at higher interest rates. The increases to our funding costs were largely offset by growth in our demand and savings deposits, which generally have lower rates than other funding sources. The average balance of these core deposits increased by $284.7 million or 4% in 2017 compared to 2016.\nAverage balances of our earning assets increased by $865.6 million or 6% in 2017 compared to 2016 primarily due to loan growth as the average balances of our loans and leases portfolio increased by $984.6 million. The average balance of our commercial and industrial portfolio increased by $82.9 million due to increase in corporate demand for funding. The average balance of our commercial mortgage portfolio increased by $241.9 million as a result of continued demand from new and existing customers as the Hawaii economy continued to be strong coupled with the transfer of construction loans into this loan portfolio upon project completion. The average balance of our residential mortgage portfolio increased by $270.6 million primarily due to a relatively constant level of loan originations combined with a slowdown in payoff activity. The average balance of our home equity portfolio increased by $255.8 million as a result of healthy loan demand in light of a strong Hawaii economy and improved real estate market conditions. Additionally, utilization on new and existing home equity lines remained steady during 2017. In addition to the increase in the average balances of our loan and lease portfolio, there was a $63.0 million increase in the average balance of our investment securities portfolio in 2017.\nAverage balances of our interest-bearing liabilities increased by $584.8 million or 6% in 2017 compared to 2016 primarily due to growth in our time deposits, along with continued growth in our relationship checking and savings products.\nProvision for Credit Losses\nThe provision for credit losses (the Provision\u201d) reflects our judgment of the expense or benefit necessary to achieve the appropriate amount of the Allowance. We maintain the Allowance at levels adequate to cover our estimate of probable credit losses as of the end of the reporting period. The Allowance is determined through detailed quarterly analyses of our loan and lease portfolio. The Allowance is based on our loss experience and changes in the economic environment, as well as an ongoing assessment of our credit quality. We recorded a Provision of $13.4 million in 2018, $16.9 million in 2017, and $4.8 million in 2016.

These fees are largely based upon the market value of the assets that we manage and the fee rate charged to customers. Total trust assets under administration were $9.4 billion, $9.3 billion, and $8.8 billion as of December 31, 2018, 2017, and 2016, respectively. Trust and asset management income decreased by $1.6 million or 3% in 2018 compared to 2017 due to a decrease in special service fees ($0.6 million), employee benefit trust fees ($0.5 million), and other trust fees ($0.3 million) primarily due to a decline in the number of customer accounts under administration. Trust and asset management income decreased by $0.8 million or 2% in 2017 compared to 2016 primarily due to a $1.2 million decrease in special service fees mainly the result of a service fee received from the sale of real estate in second quarter of 2016. This increase was partially offset by a $0.7 million increase in agency fees primarily due to an increase in market value of accounts.\nMortgage banking income is highly influenced by mortgage interest rates, the housing market, the amount of our loan sales, and our valuation of mortgage servicing rights. Mortgage banking income decreased by $4.5 million or 35% in 2018 compared to 2017. This decrease was primarily due to reduced sales of conforming saleable loans from current production. There were no sales from our mortgage loan portfolio in 2018. Mortgage banking income decreased by $6.9 million or 35% in 2017 compared to 2016. This decrease was primarily due to reduced sales and margins on sales of conforming saleable loans from current production and from our mortgage loan portfolio.\nService charges on deposit accounts decreased by $3.8 million or 12% in 2018 compared to 2017. This decrease was primarily due to a $2.3 million decrease in account analysis fees and a $1.7 million decrease in overdraft fees, partially offset by an increase in other service and monthly fees. Service charges on deposit accounts decreased by $1.1 million or 3% in 2017 compared to 2016. This decrease was primarily due to a $0.8 million decrease in overdraft fees due in part to higher customer deposit balances and a $0.7 decrease in account analysis fees.\nFees, exchange, and other service charges are primarily comprised of debit and credit card income, fees from ATMs, merchant service activity, and other loan fees and special charges. Fees, exchange, and other service charges increased by $2.6 million or 5% primarily due to $2.3 million increase in merchant income, which was recorded as a reduction of other noninterest expense in 2017. This accounting change was related to the 2018 adoption of the new revenue recognition accounting guidance. Fees, exchange, and other service charges decreased $0.3 million or 1% in 2017 compared to 2016 primarily due to decreases in other loan fees ($0.8 million) and ATM fees ($0.5 million), largely offset by a $0.9 million increase in debit card fees primarily due to increased transaction volume.\nNet gains (losses) on sales of investment securities totaled $(3.9) million, $10.4 million, and $10.2 million, in 2018, 2017, and 2016, respectively. The net loss in 2018 was primarily due to fees paid to the counterparties of our prior Visa Class B share sale transactions. In addition, in June 2018, Visa announced a reduction of the conversion ratio of its Class B shares from 1.6483 to 1.6298 effective June 28, 2018. As a result, the Company recorded a $1.0 million liability in June 2018, which was paid to previous buyers of our Visa Class B shares in July 2018. The net gains in 2017 and 2016 were due to gains on the sale of 90,000 and 100,000 Visa Class B restricted shares in 2017 and 2016, respectively. We received these Class B shares in 2008 as part of Visa's initial public offering. These shares are transferable only under limited circumstances until they can be converted into the publicly traded Class A shares. This conversion will not occur until the settlement of certain litigation which is indemnified by Visa members such as the Company. Visa funded an escrow account from its initial public offering to settle these litigation claims. Should this escrow account not be sufficient to cover these litigation claims, Visa is entitled to fund additional amounts to the escrow account by reducing each member bank's Class B conversion ratio to unrestricted Class A shares. Concurrent with the sale of these Visa Class B shares, we entered into an agreement with the buyer that requires payment to the buyer in the event Visa further reduces the conversion ratio. Based on the existing transfer restriction and the uncertainty of the covered litigation, the remaining 83,014 Visa Class B shares (135,296 Class A equivalent shares) that we own are carried at a zero cost basis as of December 31, 2018. We also contributed to the Bank of Hawaii Foundation 3,600, 4,300, and 7,800, Visa Class B shares during 2018, 2017, and 2016, respectively.\nAnnuity and insurance income decreased by $1.0 million or 15% in 2018 compared to 2017 primarily due to a $0.7 million decrease in income related to our annuity products. Annuity and insurance income decreased by $0.2 million or 2% in 2017 compared to 2016 primarily due to a decrease in income related to our annuity products.\nBank-owned life insurance increased by $0.7 million or 10% in 2018 compared to 2017 primarily due to death benefits received. Bank-owned life insurance remained relatively unchanged in 2017 compared to 2016.\nOther noninterest income increased by $5.4 million or 34% in 2018 compared to 2017 primarily due to a distribution received in the first quarter of 2018 from a low-income housing investment sale totaling $2.8 million combined with a $1.1 million increase in fees from our customer interest rate swap derivatives and a $0.8 million increase in net gain on sale of leased assets. Other noninterest income decreased by $2.8 million or 15% in 2017 compared to 2016. This decrease was primarily due to a $2.3 million decrease in fees from our customer interest rate swap derivatives, and a $0.9 million decrease in net gain on sale of leased assets.\nNoninterest

As such $1.8 million previously reported in retirement and other benefits were reclassified to other noninterest expense for the year ended December 31, 2017 and 2016.\nTotal salaries and benefits increased by $9.5 million or 5% in 2018 compared to 2017 primarily due to $9.8 million in merit and minimum wage increases. Medical, dental, and life insurance increased by $3.8 million primarily due to higher expenses related to our self-insured medical plans coupled with increased group medical insurance costs. These increases were partially offset by a $2.1 million decrease in incentive compensation. During the fourth quarter of 2017, the Company paid a $2.2 million bonus, inclusive of payroll taxes, partly due to anticipated future tax expense reductions resulting from the Tax Act. In addition, share-based compensation decreased by $2.1 million as a result of the Company's lower share price. Commission expense also decreased by $2.1 million primarily due to a decrease in loan origination and refinancing activity. Total salaries and benefits increased by $4.4 million or 2% in 2017 compared to 2016 due in part to the aforementioned $2.2 million bonus, paid in the fourth quarter 2017. In addition, separation expense increased by $1.2 million. These increases were partially offset by a $2.0 million decrease in share-based compensation. Commission expense also decreased by $1.0 million primarily due to a decrease in loan origination and refinancing activity.\nNet occupancy expense increased by $2.2 million or 7% in 2018 compared to 2017 due to a $1.0 million increase in ATM lease space rental costs in 2018. These ATM lease space rental costs were recorded as a reduction of ATM fee income in 2017. This accounting change was related to the 2018 adoption of the new revenue recognition accounting guidance. In addition, this increase was due to the increases in utilities and depreciation expenses by $0.6 million and $0.3 million, respectively. Net occupancy expense increased by $2.3 million or 8% in compared to 2016 primarily due to a $3.4 million decrease in net gain on sale of real estate from $3.7 million in 2016 to $0.3 million in 2017. This increase was offset by a $0.9 million decrease in net rental expense.\nNet equipment expense increased by $1.8 million or 8% 2018 compared to 2017 primarily due to a $1.1 million increase in depreciation expense. In addition, branches and information technology rent expense increased by $0.6 million. Net equipment expense increased by $1.5 million or 7% in 2017 compared to 2016 primarily due to a $0.8 million increase in software license fees and maintenance and a $0.5 million increase in depreciation expense.\nData processing expense increased by $2.4 million or 15% in 2018 compared to 2017 due to ongoing information technology projects. Data processing expense remained relatively unchanged in 2017 compared to 2016.\nProfessional fees decreased by $1.7 million or 14% in 2018 compared to 2017 primarily due to a decrease in professional services in our mortgage division. Professional fees increased by $1.6 million or 16% in 2017 compared to 2016 primarily due to a $0.9 million increase in legal fees and a $0.8 million increase in professional services primarily in our mortgage division.\nOther noninterest expense increased by $0.7 million or 1% in 2018 compared to 2017 due to $2.7 million in legal reserves recorded during 2018. Operating losses, which include losses as a result of bank error, fraud, items processing, or theft, increased by $1.2 million, partially offset by a decrease in business travel of $0.9 million, a $0.9 million decrease in credit card expense due to the completed sale of our MyBankoh Rewards Credit Card portfolio on November 1, 2018, and a decrease in temporary services of $0.7 million. Other noninterest expense decreased by $3.0 million or 5% in 2017 compared to 2016 due to a $0.9 million decrease in delivery and postage services and a $0.8 million decrease in solar energy tax credit partnership amortization expense.\nIncome Taxes\nTable 5 presents our provision for income taxes and effective tax rates for 2018, 2017, and 2016:\nTable 36: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Provision for Income Taxes and Effective Tax Rates\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Table 5\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(dollars in thousands)\n</td> <td>Provision for Income Taxes\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Effective Tax Rates\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>50,624\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>18.73\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>83,392\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>31.11\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>78,133\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>30.10\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe provision for income taxes was $50.6 million in 2018, a decrease of $32.8 million or 39% compared to 2017. The effective tax rate was 18.73% in 2018 compared to 31.11% in 2017. The lower effective tax rate in 2018 compared to 2017 was due primarily to the Tax Act enacted into law on December 22, 2017. The Tax Act made changes to the U.S. tax code, including reducing the U.S. federal tax rate from 35% to 21% effective January 1, 2018.\nA reduction in the corporate tax rate set forth in the Tax Act discussed above also affected the Company's primary benefits received from low income housing investments. The impact of the change in tax rate on the Company's accounting for such investments was reevaluated, resulting in a $2 million reduction in the amortization of the net investment, which also favorably impacted the effective tax rate in 2018. These items were partially offset by a $3.3 million decrease in the release of valuation allowances for low income housing investments in 2018 compared to 2017.\nThe provision for income taxes was $83.4 million in 2017, an increase of $5.3 million or 7% compared to 2016. The effective tax rate was 31.11% in 2017 compared to 30.10% in 2016. The higher effective tax rate in 2017 compared to 2016 was primarily due to a $3.6 million charge for the write down of net deferred tax assets as a result of the Tax Act discussed above. A $3.0 million state tax reserve release in 2016 due to the lapse in the statute of limitations related to prior tax years also favorably impacted the effective tax rate in 2016. These items were partially offset by a $2.5 million tax benefit from the exercise of stock options and the vesting of restricted stock in 2017 and a $2.1 million increase in the release of valuation allowances for low income housing investments in 2017 compared to 2016.\nAnalysis of Business Segments\nOur business segments are Retail Banking, Commercial Banking, Investment Services and Private Banking, and Treasury and Other.

This was partially offset by a decrease in noninterest income, an increase in noninterest expense, and an increase in the Provision. The decrease in noninterest income was primarily due to reduced sales of conforming saleable loans from our mortgage portfolio and lower margins on those sales. In addition, overdraft fees decreased. Noninterest expense increased primarily due to a $2.0 million increase in legal reserves recorded in the first quarter of 2018 and higher allocated technology, operations, and finance expense. This was partially offset by the reclassification of certain ATM and debit transaction processing fees, in 2018, as contra revenue, and decreases in professional fees and salaries and benefits. The increase in the Provision was primarily due to higher net charge-offs in our credit card portfolio, which was sold on November 1, 2018, our home equity portfolio due to lower recoveries, as well as overdrafts; this was partially offset by lower net charge-offs in our residential mortgage portfolio.\nNet income increased by $6.1 million or 8% in 2017 compared to 2016 primarily due to an increase in net interest income, partially offset by a decrease in noninterest income and an increase in the Provision. The increase in net interest income was primarily due to higher volume in both the lending and deposit portfolios as well as higher earnings credits on the segment's deposit portfolio. The decrease in noninterest income is primarily due to lower mortgage loan sales and reduced margins on those sales. The increase in the Provision was primarily due to higher net charge-offs in our installment loan, credit card, auto loan, and mortgage loan portfolios, partially offset by lower net charge-offs in our home equity loan and personal credit line portfolios.\nCommercial Banking\nNet income increased by $17.4 million or 23% in 2018 compared to 2017 primarily due to increases in net interest income and noninterest income, and a decrease in the provision for income taxes. These were partially offset by an increase in noninterest expense. The increase in net interest income was primarily due to higher earnings credits on the segment's deposit portfolio. The increase in noninterest income was primarily due to higher merchant income stemming from the adoption of ASU No. 2014-09 Revenue from Contracts with Customers: (Topic 606), higher fees related to our customer interest rate swap derivative program, and to higher net gains on sale of leased equipment. This increase was partially offset by lower account analysis fees as a result of higher earnings credit rates on customer accounts. The decrease in the Provision was due to higher net recovery of loans and leases in 2018. The increase in noninterest expense was primarily due to higher salaries, operating and allocated expenses. The increase in operating expenses was due to the aforementioned adoption of ASU No. 2014-09s. The decrease in the provision for income taxes was due to the lower effective tax rate allocated to the segment.\nNet income decreased by $0.4 million or 1% in 2017 compared to 2016 primarily due to a decrease in noninterest income, and increases to the Provision and noninterest expense. This was partially offset by an increase in net interest income. The decrease in noninterest income was primarily due to lower net gains on sale of leased equipment, lower fees related to our customer interest rate swap derivatives and lower non-recurring loan fees. The increase in the Provision was due to lower net recoveries of loans and leases in 2017. The increase in noninterest expense was primarily due to higher salaries and benefits expense and to higher allocated expenses. The increase in net interest income was primarily due to higher volume in both the lending and deposit portfolios, and partially due to higher earnings credits on the segment's deposit portfolio.\nInvestment Services and Private Banking\nNet income increased by $6.8 million or 43% in 2018 compared to 2017 primarily due to an increase in net interest income, partially offset by an increase in noninterest expense and a decrease in noninterest revenue. The increase in net interest income was primarily driven by the transfer of deposits and loans from the Retail Banking segment and growth of the segment's deposit portfolio. The increase in noninterest expense was primarily due to higher salaries and benefits expense, a one-time charge-off, and higher allocated expenses. The decrease in noninterest revenue was driven by lower annuity sales and lower trust service fees.\nNet income increased by $1.8 million or 13% in 2017 compared to 2016 primarily due to an increase in net interest income, partially offset by increases in noninterest expense. The increase in net interest income was primarily driven by the transfer of deposits from the Retail Banking segment and growth of the segment's deposit portfolio. The increase in noninterest expense was primarily due to higher salaries and benefits expense and an operational recovery in the second quarter of 2016.\nTreasury and Other\nNet income increased by $3.8 million or 34% in 2018 compared to 2017 primarily due to an increase in net interest income, a decrease in the provision for loan losses and an decrease in the provision for taxes. The increase in net interest income was primarily due to an increase in funding income related to lending activities and an increase interest income from investment securities and funds sold resulting from an increase in associated yields partially offset by higher deposit funding costs. The Provision in this business segment represents the residual provision for credit losses to arrive at the total Provision for the Company. The decrease in noninterest income was primarily due to the sale of 90,000 Visa Class B shares amounting to $12.5 million in the first quarter of 2017. Partially offsetting this was a $2.8 million distribution from a low-income housing partnership in the first quarter of 2018. The provision for income taxes in this business segment represents the residual amount to arrive at the total tax expense for the Company. The overall effective tax rate decreased to 18.73% in 2018 compared to 31.11% in 2017.\nNet income decreased by $4.2 million or 27% in 2017 compared to 2016 primarily due to a decrease in net interest income, an increase in the provision for loan losses, and an increase in the provision for taxes. The decrease in net interest income was primarily due to higher deposit funding costs, partially offset by an increase in interest income from investment securities and funds sold under agreements to repurchase resulting from an increase in associated yields and an increase in funding income related to lending activities. The Provision in this business segment represents the residual provision for credit losses to arrive at the total Provision for the Company. The provision for income taxes in this business segment represents the residual amount to arrive at the total tax expense for the Company. The overall effective tax rate increased to 31.11% in 2017 compared to 30.10% in 2016.\nOther organizational units (Technology, Operations, Marketing, Human Resources, Finance, Credit and Risk Management, and Corporate and Regulatory Administration) included in Treasury and Other provide a wide range of support to the Company's other income earning segments. Expenses incurred by these support units are charged to the business segments through an internal cost allocation process.\nAnalysis of Statements of Condition\nInvestment Securities\nTable 7 presents the maturity distribution at amortized cost, weighted-average yield to maturity, and fair value of our investment securities.\nTable 38: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Maturities and Average Yield on Securities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Table 7\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(dollars in millions)\n</td> <td>1 Year\nor Less\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Weighted\nAverage\nYield\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>After 1\nYear-5\nYears\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Weighted\nAverage\nYield\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>After 5\nYears-10\nYears\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Weighted\nAverage\nYield\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Over 10\nYears\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Weighted\nAverage\nYield\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Weighted\nAverage\nYield\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Fair\nValue\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>As of December 31, 2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Available-for-Sale\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Debt Securities Issued by the U.S. Treasury and Government Agencies 2\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>0.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.6\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>114.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.9\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>279.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.7\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>394.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.1\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>392.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Debt Securities Issued by States and Political Subdivisions 1\n</td> <td>56.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>387.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>92.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>22.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>559.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>564.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Debt Securities Issued by U.S. Government-Sponsored Enterprises\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Debt Securities Issued by Corporations\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>225.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>225.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>223.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Mortgage-Backed Securities 2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Residential -

As of December 31, 2018, our investment securities portfolio was comprised of securities with an average base duration of approximately 3.4 years.\nWe continually evaluate our investment securities portfolio in response to established asset/liability management objectives, changing market conditions that could affect profitability, and the level of interest rate risk to which we are exposed. These evaluations may cause us to change the level of funds we deploy into investment securities, change the composition of our investment securities portfolio, and change the proportion of investments made into the available-for-sale and held-to-maturity investment categories.\nIn 2018, we reduced our positions primarily in mortgage-backed securities, municipal debt securities, and corporate debt securities. We re-invested these proceeds primarily into higher yielding loan products. Ginnie Mae mortgage-backed securities continue to be the largest concentration in our portfolio. As of December 31, 2018, our portfolio of Ginnie Mae mortgage-backed securities was primarily comprised of securities issued in 2008 or later. As of December 31, 2018, these mortgage-backed securities were all AAA-rated, with a low probability of a change in their credit ratings in the near future. As of December 31, 2018, our available-for-sale investment securities portfolio was comprised of securities with an average base duration of approximately 2.3 years.\nGross unrealized gains in our investment securities portfolio were $21.2 million as of December 31, 2018 and $36.6 million as of December 31, 2017. Gross unrealized losses on our temporarily impaired investment securities were $103.5 million as of December 31, 2018 and $73.9 million as of December 31, 2017. The gross unrealized loss positions were primarily related to mortgage-backed securities issued by Ginnie Mae, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, and corporate debt securities. See Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information.\nAs of December 31, 2018, included in our investment securities portfolio were debt securities issued by political subdivisions within the State of Hawaii of $451.1 million, representing 56% of the total fair value of the Company's municipal debt securities. Of the entire Hawaii municipal bond portfolio, 96% were credit-rated Aa2 or better by Moody's while the remaining Hawaii municipal bonds were credit-rated A1 or better by at least one nationally recognized statistical rating organization. Also, approximately 79% of the Company's Hawaii municipal bond holdings were general obligation issuances. As of December 31, 2018, there were no other holdings of municipal debt securities that were issued by a single state or political subdivision which comprised more than 10% of the total fair value of the Company's municipal debt securities.\nThe Company's corporate bond holdings as of December 31, 2018 had a fair value of $318.7 million. Of this total, $95.5 million or 30% was fully guaranteed by the Export-Import Bank of the United States, an agency of the U.S. government.

This represents a $0.7 billion or 7% increase from December 31, 2017 primarily due to growth in our consumer lending portfolio.\nThe commercial loan and lease portfolio is comprised of commercial and industrial loans, commercial mortgages, construction loans, and lease financing. Commercial and industrial loans are made primarily to corporations, middle market, and small businesses for the purpose of financing equipment acquisition, expansion, working capital, and other general business purposes. Commercial mortgages and construction loans are offered to real estate investors, developers, and builders primarily domiciled in Hawaii. Commercial mortgages are secured by first mortgages on commercial real estate at loan-to-value ratios generally not exceeding 75%. The commercial properties are predominantly developments such as retail centers, apartments, industrial properties, and to a lesser extent, specialized properties such as hotels. The primary source of repayment for investor property is cash flow from the property and for owner-occupied property is the operating cash flow from the business. Construction loans are for the purchase or construction of a property for which repayment will be generated by the property. We classify loans as construction until the completion of the construction phase. Following construction, if a loan is retained, the loan is reclassified to the commercial mortgage category. Lease financing consists of direct financing leases and leveraged leases and are used by commercial customers to finance capital purchases. Although our primary market is Hawaii, the commercial portfolio contains loans to some borrowers based on the U.S. Mainland, including some Shared National Credits.\nCommercial loans and leases were $4.0 billion as of December 31, 2018, an increase of $213.3 million or 6% from December 31, 2017. Commercial and industrial loans increased by $51.8 million or 4% from December 31, 2017. Commercial mortgage loans increased by $198.4 million or 9% from December 31, 2017 primarily due to continued demand from new and existing customers as the Hawaii economy continues to be strong. Construction loans decreased by $32.2 million or 16% from December 31, 2017 primarily due to paydowns and successful completion of construction projects such as condominiums and low-income housing, partially offset by increased activity in our portfolio.\nThe consumer loan and lease portfolio is comprised of residential mortgage loans, home equity lines and loans, indirect auto loans and leases, and other consumer loans including personal credit lines, direct installment loans, and rewards-based consumer credit cards. These products are generally offered in the geographic markets we serve. Although we offer a variety of products, our residential mortgage loan portfolio is primarily comprised of fixed-rate loans concentrated in Hawaii. We also offer a variety of home equity lines and loans, usually secured by second mortgages on residential property of the borrower. Automobile lending activities include loans and leases secured by new or used automobiles. We originate automobile loans and leases on an indirect basis through selected dealerships. Direct installment loans are generally unsecured and are often used for personal expenses or for debt consolidation.\nConsumer loans and leases were $6.5 billion as of December 31, 2018, an increase of $438.5 million or 7% from December 31, 2017. Residential mortgage loans increased by $207.0 million or 6% from December 31, 2017 primarily due to a relatively constant level of loan originations combined with a slowdown in payoff activity. Automobile loans increased by $129.7 million or 25% from December 31, 2017 primarily driven by steady automobile loan demand and competitive loan programs. Home equity lines and loans increased by $96.0 million or 6% from December 31, 2017 as a result of continued loan demand in light of a healthy Hawaii economy and stable real estate market conditions. Additionally, utilization on new and existing home equity lines was strong during 2018.\nSee Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements and the Corporate Risk Profile - Credit Risk\u201d section

Our consumer loan and lease portfolio includes limited lending activities on the U.S. Mainland.\nOur Hawaii loan and lease portfolio increased by $499.5 million or 6% from December 31, 2017, reflective of a healthy Hawaii economy.\nTable 10 presents a maturity distribution for selected loan categories.\nTable 46: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Maturities for Selected Loan Categories 1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Table 10\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>December 31, 2018\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(dollars in thousands)\n</td> <td>Due in\nOne Year or Less\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Due After One\nto Five Years 2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Due After\nFive Years 2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Commercial and Industrial\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>348,595\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>476,451\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>506,103\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,331,149\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Construction\n</td> <td>45,589\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>51,798\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>72,674\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>170,061\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>394,184\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>528,249\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>578,777\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,501,210\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n1 Based on contractual maturities.\n2 As of December 31, 2018, loans maturing after one year consisted of $633.2 million in variable rate loans and $473.8 million in fixed rate loans.\nGoodwill\nGoodwill was $31.5 million as of December 31, 2018 and 2017. As of December 31, 2018, based on our qualitative assessment, there were no reporting units where we believed it was more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit was less than its carrying amount, including goodwill. As a result, we had no reporting units where there was a reasonable possibility of failing Step 1 of the goodwill impairment test. See Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information on our goodwill impairment policy.\nOther Assets\nOther assets were $230.9 million as of December 31, 2018, a decrease of $21.7 million or 9% from December 31, 2017. This decrease was primarily due to a $30.3 million decrease in accounts receivable, which was primarily due to a $20.0 million decrease related to the settlement of a matured security coupled with a $16.4 million early buy-out on an equipment lease in the first quarter of 2018. These decreases were partially offset by a $7.8 million increase in other assets. The fair value of our interest rate swap agreements increased by $3.6 million, which is affected by prevailing interest rates. In addition, dealer advances increased by $3.3 million. See Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information on the composition of our other assets.\nDeposits\nTable 11 presents the components of our deposits by major customer categories as of December 31, 2018 and 2017.\nTable 47: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Deposits\n</td> <td>Table 11\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(dollars in thousands)\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Consumer\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>7,726,731\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>7,478,228\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Commercial\n</td> <td>6,098,186\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5,973,763\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Public and Other\n</td> <td>1,202,325\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,431,977\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total Deposits\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>15,027,242\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>14,883,968\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTotal deposits were $15.0 billion as of December 31, 2018, a $143.3 million or 1% increase from December 31, 2017. This increase was primarily due to a $248.5 million increase in consumer deposits due to an increase in time deposits and core deposits of $237.3 million and $11.2 million respectively. In addition, commercial deposits increased by $124.4 million primarily due to a $95.1 million increase in core deposits and a $29.3 million increase in time deposits. These increases were partially offset by a $230.0 million decrease in public and other deposits largely due to the strategic decision to reduce public time deposits.\nTable 12 presents the components of our savings deposits as of December 31, 2018 and 2017.\nTable 48: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Savings Deposits\n</td> <td>Table 12\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(dollars in thousands)\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Money Market\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,973,979\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,827,090\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Regular Savings\n</td> <td>3,565,220\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,561,923\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total Savings Deposits\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>5,539,199\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>5,389,013\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nSecurities Sold Under Agreements to Repurchase\nTable 13 presents the composition of our securities sold under agreements to repurchase.\nTable 49: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Securities Sold Under Agreements to Repurchase\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Table 13\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(dollars in thousands)\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Private Institutions\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>500,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>500,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Government Entities\n</td> <td>4,296\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5,293\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total Securities Sold Under Agreements to Repurchase\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>504,296\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>505,293\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nSecurities sold under agreements to repurchase as of December 31, 2018 remained relatively unchanged from December 31, 2017. As of December 31, 2018, the weighted-average maturity was 133 days for our repurchase agreements with government entities and 2.6 years for our repurchase agreements with private institutions. Some of our repurchase agreements with private institutions may be terminated at earlier specified dates by the private institution or in some cases by either the private institution or the Company. If all such agreements were to terminate at the earliest possible date, the weighted-average maturity for our repurchase agreements with private institutions would decrease to 2.0 years. As of December 31, 2018 and 2017, the weighted-average interest rate for repurchase agreements with government entities was 1.19% and 0.61%, respectively, while the weighted-average interest rate for repurchase agreements with private institutions as of December 31, 2018 and 2017 was 3.64%, with all rates being fixed. Each of our repurchase agreements is accounted for as collateralized financing arrangements (i.e., a secured borrowing) and not as a sale and subsequent repurchase of securities. See Note 9 and 19 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information.\nOther Debt\nOther debt was $135.6 million as of December 31, 2018, a decrease of $125.1 million or 48% from December 31, 2017. This decrease was primarily due to seven FHLB advances totaling $175.0 million which matured during 2018. As of December 31, 2018, this balance was mainly comprised of $125.0 million in FHLB advances with a weighted-average interest rate of 1.93% and maturity dates ranging from 2019 to 2020. These advances were primarily for asset/liability management purposes. As of December 31, 2018, our remaining line of credit with the FHLB was $2.2 billion.\nPension and Postretirement Plan Obligations\nRetirement benefits payable were $40.5 million as of December 31, 2018, an $3.2 million or 9% increase from December 31, 2017. Our pension and postretirement benefit obligations and net periodic benefit cost are actuarially determined based on a number of key assumptions, including the discount rate, the expected return on plan assets, and the health-care cost trend rate. The accounting for pension and postretirement benefit plans reflect the long-term nature of the obligations and the investment horizon of the plan assets. The increase in retirement benefits payable was primarily due to a net investment loss on assets during the year.\nThe discount rate is used to determine the present value of future benefit obligations and the net periodic benefit cost. The discount rate used to value the present value of future benefit obligations as of each year-end is the rate used to estimate the net periodic benefit cost for the following year. Table 14 presents a sensitivity analysis of a 25 basis point change in discount rates to the pension and postretirement benefit plan's net periodic benefit cost and benefit obligations:\nTable 50: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Discount Rate Sensitivity Analysis\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Table 14\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Impact of\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Base Discount Rate\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Discount Rate\n25 Basis Point Increase\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Discount Rate\n25 Basis Point Decrease\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(dollars in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Pension Benefit\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Postretirement Benefits\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Pension Benefits\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Postretirement Benefits\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Pension Benefits\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Postretirement Benefits\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2018 Net Periodic Benefit Cost\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.90\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.96\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>38\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(72\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(46\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>72\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Benefit Plan Obligations as of December 31, 2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.41\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.48\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(2,501\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(714\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,563\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>736\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Estimated 2019 Net Periodic Benefit Cost\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.41\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.48\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>31\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(66\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(38\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>66\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nSee Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information on our pension and postretirement benefit plans.\nForeign Activities\nCross-border outstandings are defined as loans (including accrued interest), acceptances, interest-bearing deposits with other banks, other interest-bearing investments, and any other monetary assets which are denominated in dollars or other non-local currency. As of December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, we did not have cross-border outstandings to any foreign country which exceeded 0.75% of our total assets.\nCorporate Risk Profile\nManaging risk is an essential part of successfully operating our business. Management believes that the most prominent risk exposures for the Company are credit risk, market risk, liquidity risk management, capital management, and operational risk.\nCredit Risk\nCredit risk is the risk that borrowers or counterparties will be unable or unwilling to repay their obligations in accordance with the underlying contractual terms. We manage and control credit risk in the loan and lease portfolio by adhering to well-defined underwriting criteria and account administration standards established by management. Written credit policies document underwriting standards, approval levels, exposure limits, and other limits or standards deemed necessary and prudent. Portfolio diversification at the obligor, industry, product, and/or geographic location levels is actively managed to mitigate concentration risk. In addition, credit risk management also includes an independent credit review process that assesses compliance with commercial and consumer credit policies, risk ratings, and other critical credit information. In addition to implementing risk management practices that are based upon established and sound lending practices, we adhere to sound credit principles. We understand and evaluate our customers' borrowing needs and capacity to repay, in conjunction with their character and history.\nCommercial and industrial loans are made primarily for the purpose of financing equipment acquisition, expansion, working capital, and other general business purposes. Lease financing consists of direct financing leases and leveraged leases that are used by commercial customers to finance capital purchases ranging from computer equipment to transportation equipment. The credit decisions for these transactions are based upon an assessment of the overall financial capacity of the applicant. A determination is made as to the applicant's ability to repay in accordance with the proposed terms as well as an overall assessment of the risks involved. In addition to an evaluation of the applicant's financial condition, a determination is made of the probable adequacy of the primary and secondary sources of repayment, such as additional collateral or personal guarantees, to be relied upon in the transaction. Credit agency reports of the applicant's credit history supplement the analysis of the applicant's creditworthiness.\nCommercial mortgages and construction loans are offered to real estate investors, developers, builders, and owner-occupants primarily domiciled in Hawaii. These loans are secured by first mortgages on real estate at loan-to-value ( LTV\u201d) ratios deemed appropriate based on the property type, location, overall quality, and sponsorship. Generally, these LTV ratios do not exceed 75%. The commercial properties are predominantly developments such as retail centers, apartments, industrial properties and, to a lesser extent, more specialized properties such as hotels. Substantially our entire commercial mortgage loans are secured by properties located in our primary market area.\nIn the underwriting of our commercial mortgage loans, we obtain appraisals for the underlying properties. Decisions to lend are based on the economic fundamentals of the property and the creditworthiness of the borrower. In evaluating a proposed commercial mortgage loan, we primarily emphasize the ratio of the property's projected net cash flows to the loan's debt service requirement. The debt service coverage ratio normally is not less than 120% and it is computed after deducting for a vacancy factor and property expenses as appropriate. In addition, a personal guarantee of the loan or a portion thereof is sometimes required from the principal(s) of the borrower. We typically require title insurance insuring the priority of our lien, fire, and extended coverage casualty insurance, and flood insurance, if appropriate, in order to protect our security interest in the underlying property. In addition, business interruption insurance or other insurance may be required. Owner-occupant commercial mortgage loans are underwritten based upon the cash flow of the business provided that the real estate asset is utilized in the operation of the business. Real estate is evaluated independently as a secondary source of repayment. As noted above, LTV ratios generally do not exceed 75%.\nConstruction loans are underwritten against projected cash flows derived from rental income, business income from an owner-occupant, or the sale of the property to an end-user. We may mitigate the risks associated with these types of loans by requiring fixed-price construction contracts, performance and payment bonding, controlled disbursements, and pre-sale contracts or pre-lease agreements.\nWe offer a variety of first mortgage and junior lien loans to consumers within our markets with residential home mortgages comprising our largest loan category. These loans are generally secured by a primary residence and are underwritten using traditional underwriting systems to assess the credit risks and financial capacity and repayment ability of the consumer. Decisions are primarily based on LTV ratios, debt-to-income ( DTI\u201d) ratios, liquidity, and credit scores. LTV ratios generally do not exceed 80%, although higher levels are permitted with mortgage insurance. We offer variable rate mortgage loans with interest rates that are subject to change every year after the first, third, fifth, or seventh year, depending on the product and are based on the London Interbank Offered Rate ( LIBOR\u201d). Variable rate mortgage loans are underwritten at fully-indexed interest rates. We do not offer payment-option facilities, sub-prime or Alt-A loans, or any product with negative amortization. We selectively offer interest-only mortgage loans to Private Banking clients.\u201d\nHome equity loans are secured by both first and second liens on residential property of the borrower. The underwriting terms for the home equity product generally permits borrowing availability, in the aggregate, up to 85% of the value of the collateral property at the time of origination. We offer fixed and variable rate home equity loans, with variable rate loans underwritten at fully-indexed interest rates. Our procedures for underwriting home equity loans include an assessment of an applicant's overall financial capacity and repayment ability. Decisions are primarily based on LTV ratios, DTI ratios, and credit scores. Maximum amount and LTVs are determined by collateral value and channel.\nAutomobile lending activities include loans and leases secured by new or used automobiles. We originate automobile loans and leases on an indirect basis through selected dealerships in Hawaii, Guam and Saipan. Our procedures for underwriting automobile loans include an assessment of an applicant's overall financial capacity and repayment ability, credit history, and the ability to meet existing obligations and payments on the proposed loan. Although an applicant's creditworthiness is the primary consideration, the underwriting process also includes a comparison of the value of the collateral security to the proposed loan amount. We require borrowers to maintain full coverage automobile insurance on automobile loans and leases, with the Bank listed as either the loss payee or additional insured.\nGeneral economic conditions in Hawaii remained healthy during 2018, led by a strong tourism industry, relatively low unemployment, rising real estate prices, and an active construction industry. Our overall credit risk position reflects these positive economic trends and our loan portfolio growth and composition.\nNon-Performing Assets and Accruing Loans and Leases Past Due 90 Days or

<td>$\n</td> <td>12,930\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nNPAs consist of non-accrual loans and leases, and foreclosed real estate. Changes in the level of non-accrual loans and leases typically represent increases for loans and leases that reach a specified past due status, offset by reductions for loans and leases that are charged-off, paid down, sold, transferred to foreclosed real estate, or are no longer classified as non-accrual because they have returned to accrual status.\nTotal NPAs were $12.9 million as of December 31, 2018, a decrease of $3.2 million or 20% from December 31, 2017. The decrease was experienced primarily in the consumer lending portfolio. The ratio of our NPAs to total loans and leases, and foreclosed real estate was 0.12% as of December 31, 2018 and 0.16% as of December 31, 2017.\nCommercial mortgage non-accrual loans increased by $0.6 million or 46% from December 31, 2017 primarily due to the addition of one loan. Although three loans were removed, the one loan addition has an amount greater than the three loans combined. We have individually evaluated the two commercial mortgage non-accrual loans for impairment and have no cumulative net charge-offs.\nCommercial and industrial non-accrual loans increased by $0.1 million or 21% from December 31, 2017 due to the addition of two loans. We have evaluated the two borrowers for impairment and have recorded a $0.2 million partial charge-off in 2018. As of December 31, 2018, the non-accrual balance in this category was comprised of six commercial borrowers.\nThe largest component of our NPAs continues to be residential mortgage loans. Residential mortgage non-accrual loans decreased by $3.9 million or 42% from December 31, 2017 primarily due to paydowns and payoffs. In addition, three loans modified in a troubled debt restructuring ( TDR\u201d) were returned to accrual status. As of December 31, 2018, our residential mortgage non-accrual loans were comprised of 21 loans with a weighted average current LTV ratio of 57%.\nForeclosed real estate represents property acquired as the result of borrower defaults on loans. Foreclosed real estate is recorded at fair value, less estimated selling costs, at the time of foreclosure. On an ongoing basis, properties are appraised as required by market conditions and applicable regulations. Foreclosed real estate increased by $0.3 million or 30% from December 31, 2017 primarily due to the addition of two residential properties as of December 31, 2018.\nLoans and Leases Past Due 90 Days or More and Still Accruing Interest\nLoans and leases in this category are 90 days or more past due, as to principal or interest, and are still accruing interest because they are well secured and in the process of collection. Loans and leases past due 90 days or more and still accruing interest were $6.6 million as of December 31, 2018, a $0.6 million or 8% decrease from December 31, 2017. This decrease was primarily in our other and automobile portfolios, which was offset by an increase in the home equity portfolio.\nImpaired Loans\nImpaired loans are defined as loans for which we believe it is probable we will not collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement. Included in impaired loans are all classes of commercial non-accruing loans (except lease financing and small business loans), all loans modified in a TDR (including accruing TDRs), and other loans where we believe that we will be unable to collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement. Impaired loans exclude lease financing and smaller balance homogeneous loans (consumer and small business non-accruing loans) that are collectively evaluated for impairment. Impaired loans were $54.6 million as of December 31, 2018 and $61.2 million as of December 31, 2017, and had a related Allowance of $4.0 million as of December 31, 2018 and $3.9 million as of December 31, 2017. The change in impaired loans was primarily due to the decrease in impaired Commercial Mortgage, Commercial and Industrial, and Residential Mortgage loans, which was partially offset by the increase in impaired Automobile, and Home Equity loans. As of December 31, 2018, we recorded cumulative net charge-offs of $7.6 million related to our total impaired loans. Our impaired loans are considered in management's assessment of the overall adequacy of the Allowance.\nIf interest due on the balances of all non-accrual loans as of December 31, 2018 had been accrued under the original terms, approximately $0.8 million in total interest income would have been recorded in 2018, compared to less than $0.1 million actually recorded as interest income on those loans.\nLoans Modified in a Troubled Debt Restructuring\nTable 17 presents information on loans whose terms have been modified in a TDR:\nTable 53: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Loans Modified in a Troubled Debt Restructuring\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Table 17\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(dollars in thousands)\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Commercial\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Commercial and Industrial\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>6,198\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>8,486\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Commercial Mortgage\n</td> <td>4,144\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9,205\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Construction\n</td> <td>1,321\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,416\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total Commercial\n</td> <td>11,663\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>19,107\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Consumer\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Residential Mortgage\n</td> <td>19,753\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>21,581\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Home Equity\n</td> <td>3,359\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,965\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Automobile\n</td> <td>17,117\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>14,811\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other 1\n</td> <td>2,098\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,645\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total Consumer\n</td> <td>42,327\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>41,002\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>53,990\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>60,109\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n1 Comprised of other revolving credit and installment financing.\nLoans modified in a TDR decreased by $6.1 million from December 31, 2017. The decrease was primarily due to the full repayments of commercial mortgage loans during the second quarter of 2018. Residential mortgage loans remain our largest TDR loan class. As of December 31, 2018, $48.7 million or 90% of loans modified in a TDR were performing in accordance with their modified contractual terms and were on accrual status.\nGenerally, loans modified in a TDR are returned to accrual status after the borrower has demonstrated performance under the modified terms by making at least six consecutive payments. See Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a description of the modification programs that we currently offer to our customers.\nReserve for Credit Losses\nThe Company's reserve for credit losses is comprised of two components, the Allowance and the reserve for unfunded commitments (the Unfunded Reserve\u201d).

other revolving credit, installment, and lease financing.\nAs of December 31, 2018, the Allowance was $106.7 million or 1.02% of total loans and leases outstanding, compared with an Allowance of $107.3 million or 1.10% of total loans and leases outstanding as of December 31, 2017. The level of the Allowance was commensurate with the Company's stable credit risk profile, loan portfolio growth and composition, and a healthy Hawaii economy.\nNet charge-offs of loans and leases were $14.1 million or 0.14% of total average loans and leases in 2018 compared to $13.8 million or 0.15% of total average loans and leases in 2017. Net charge-offs in our consumer portfolios were $14.6 million in 2018 compared to $13.9 million in 2017. This increase was primarily reflected in our credit card portfolio, which was sold on November 1, 2018, our home equity portfolio due to lower recoveries, as well as overdrafts. Net recoveries in our commercial portfolios were $0.5 million in 2018 compared to net recoveries of $0.1 million in 2017.\nAlthough we determine the amount of each component of the Allowance separately, the Allowance as a whole was considered appropriate by management as of December 31, 2018 based on our ongoing analysis of estimated probable credit losses, credit risk profiles, economic conditions, coverage ratios, and other relevant factors.\nThe allocation of the Allowance to our commercial portfolio segment increased by $1.1 million or 2% from December 31, 2017. This increase was primarily due to a $1.7 million increase in the Allowance allocated to the commercial and industrial portfolio due to loan growth. The increase was offset by a $0.7 million decrease in the Allowance allocated to the construction portfolio due to the completion of major construction projects and the resultant decline in construction outstandings.\nThe allocation of the Allowance to our consumer portfolio segment decreased by $1.7 million or 4% from December 31, 2017 and is consistent with current asset quality metrics and economic conditions.\nSee Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information on the Allowance and credit quality indicators.\nReserve for Unfunded Commitments\nThe Unfunded Reserve was $6.8 million as of December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017. The process used to determine the Unfunded Reserve is consistent with the process for determining the Allowance, as adjusted for estimated funding probabilities.\nOther Credit Risks\nIn the normal course of business, we serve the needs of state and political subdivisions in multiple capacities, including traditional banking products such as deposit services, and by investing in municipal debt securities. The carrying value of our municipal debt securities was $798.6 million as of December 31, 2018 and $865.5 million as of December 31, 2017. We also maintained investments in corporate bonds with a carrying value of $320.4 million as of December 31, 2018 and $385.7 million as of December 31, 2017. We are exposed to credit risk in these investments should the issuer of a security be unable to meet its financial obligations. This may result in the issuer failing to make scheduled interest payments and/or being unable to repay the principal upon maturity. See the Analysis of Statements of Condition - Investment Securities\u201d section in MD&A for more information.\nOur use of derivative financial instruments has been very limited in recent years. However, these financial instruments do expose the Company to counterparty credit risk. See Note 17 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information.\nMarket Risk\nMarket risk is the potential of loss arising from adverse changes in interest rates and prices. We are exposed to market risk as a consequence of the normal course of conducting our business activities. Our market risk management process involves measuring, monitoring, controlling, and mitigating risks that can significantly impact our statements of income and condition. In this management process, market risks are balanced with expected returns in an effort to enhance earnings performance while limiting volatility.\nOur primary market risk exposure is interest rate risk.\nInterest Rate Risk\nThe objective of our interest rate risk management process is to maximize net interest income while operating within acceptable limits established for interest rate risk and maintaining adequate levels of funding and liquidity. The potential cash flows, sales, or replacement value of many of our assets and liabilities, especially those that earn or pay interest, are sensitive to changes in the general level of interest rates. This interest rate risk arises primarily from our core business activities of extending loans and accepting deposits. Our investment securities portfolio is also subject to significant interest rate risk.\nMany factors affect our exposure to changes in interest rates, such as general economic and financial conditions, customer preferences, historical pricing relationships, and repricing characteristics of financial instruments. Our earnings are affected not only by general economic conditions but also by the monetary and fiscal policies of the U.S. and its agencies, particularly the Federal Reserve Bank (the FRB\u201d). The monetary policies of the FRB can influence the overall growth of loans, investment securities, and deposits and the level of interest rates earned on assets and paid for liabilities.\nIn managing interest rate risk, we, through the Asset/Liability Management Committee ( ALCO\u201d), measure short and long-term sensitivities to changes in interest rates. The ALCO, which is comprised of members of executive management, utilizes several techniques to manage interest rate risk, which include:\n \u2022 adjusting the statement of condition mix or altering the interest rate characteristics of assets and liabilities; \n \u2022 changing product pricing strategies; \n \u2022 modifying characteristics of the investment securities portfolio; and \n \u2022 using derivative financial instruments. \nOur use of derivative financial instruments, as detailed in Note 17 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, has generally been limited. This is due to natural on-balance sheet hedges arising out of offsetting interest rate exposures from loans and investment securities with deposits and other interest-bearing liabilities. In particular, the investment securities portfolio is utilized to manage the interest rate exposure and sensitivity to within the guidelines and limits established by the ALCO. We utilize natural and offsetting economic hedges in an effort to reduce the need to employ off-balance sheet derivative financial instruments to hedge interest rate risk exposures. Expected movements in interest rates are also considered in managing interest rate risk. Thus, as interest rates change, we may use different techniques to manage interest rate risk.\nA key element in our ongoing process to measure and monitor interest rate risk is the utilization of an asset/liability simulation model that attempts to capture the dynamic nature of the statement of condition. The model is used to estimate and measure the statement of condition sensitivity to changes in interest rates. These estimates are based on assumptions about the behavior of loan and deposit pricing, repayment rates on mortgage-based assets, and principal amortization and maturities on other financial instruments. The model's analytics include the effects of standard prepayment options on mortgages and customer withdrawal options for deposits. While such assumptions are inherently uncertain, we believe that our assumptions are reasonable.\nWe utilize net interest income simulations to analyze short-term income sensitivities to changes in interest rates. Table 20 presents, for the twelve months subsequent to December 31, 2018 and 2017, an estimate of the change in net interest income that would result from a gradual and immediate change in interest rates, moving in a parallel fashion over the entire yield curve, relative to the measured base case scenario. The base case scenario assumes the statement of condition and interest rates are generally unchanged. Based on our net interest income simulation as of December 31, 2018, net interest income is expected to increase as interest rates rise. This is due in part to our strategy to maintain a relatively short investment portfolio duration. In addition, rising interest rates would drive higher rates on loans and investment securities, as well as induce a slower pace of premium amortization on certain securities within our investment portfolio. However, lower interest rates would likely cause a decline in net interest income as lower rates would lead to lower yields on loans and investment securities, as well as drive higher premium amortization on existing investment securities. Based on our net interest income simulation as of December 31, 2018, net interest income sensitivity to changes in interest rates for the twelve months subsequent to December 31, 2018 was slightly less sensitive in comparison to the sensitivity profile for the twelve months subsequent to December 31, 2017.\nTable 63: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net Interest Income Sensitivity Profile\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Table 20\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Impact on Future Annual Net Interest Income\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(dollars in thousands)\n</td> <td>December 31, 2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>December 31, 2017\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gradual Change in Interest Rates (basis points)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>+200\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>11,014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.2\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>12,420\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.6\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>+100\n</td> <td>5,673\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6,622\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>-100\n</td> <td>(6,289\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1.2\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(6,789\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1.4\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Immediate Change in Interest Rates (basis points)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>+200\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>23,309\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.6\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>29,876\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6.2\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>+100\n</td> <td>12,517\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>16,328\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>-100\n</td> <td>(17,665\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(3.5\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(21,653\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(4.5\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTo analyze the impact of changes in interest rates in a more realistic manner, non-parallel interest rate scenarios are also simulated. These non-parallel interest rate scenarios indicate that net interest income may decrease from the base case scenario should the yield curve flatten or become inverted for a period of time. Conversely, if the yield curve were to steepen, net interest income may increase.\nOther Market Risks\nIn addition to interest rate risk, we are exposed to other forms of market risk in our normal business transactions. Foreign currency and foreign exchange contracts expose us to a small degree of foreign currency risk. These transactions are primarily executed on behalf of customers. Our trust and asset management income is at risk to fluctuations in the market values of underlying assets, particularly debt and equity securities. Also, our share-based compensation expense is dependent on the fair value of our stock options, restricted stock units, and restricted stock at the date of grant. The fair value of stock options, restricted stock units, and restricted stock is impacted by the market price of the Parent's common stock on the date of grant and is at risk to changes in equity markets, general economic conditions, and other factors.\nLiquidity Risk Management\nThe objective of our liquidity risk management process is to manage cash flow and liquidity in an effort to provide continuous access to sufficient, reasonably priced funds. Funding requirements are impacted by loan originations and refinancings, deposit balance changes, liability issuances and settlements, and off-balance sheet funding commitments. We consider and comply with various regulatory guidelines regarding required liquidity levels and periodically monitor our liquidity position in light of the changing economic environment and customer activity. Based on periodic liquidity assessments, we may alter our asset, liability, and off-balance sheet positions. The ALCO monitors sources and uses of funds and modifies asset and liability positions as liquidity requirements change. This process, combined with our ability to raise funds in money and capital markets and through private placements, provides flexibility in managing the exposure to liquidity risk.\nIn an effort to satisfy our liquidity needs, we actively manage our assets and liabilities. We have access to immediate liquid resources in the form of cash which is primarily on deposit with the FRB. Potential sources of liquidity also include investment securities in our available-for-sale securities portfolio, our ability to sell loans in the secondary market, and to secure borrowings from the FRB and FHLB. Our held-to-maturity securities, while not intended for sale, may also be utilized in repurchase agreements to obtain funding. Our core deposits have historically provided us with a long-term source of stable and relatively lower cost source of funding. Additional funding is available through the issuance of long-term debt or equity.\nMaturities and payments on outstanding loans and investment securities also provide a steady flow of funds. Liquidity is further enhanced by our ability to pledge loans to access secured borrowings from the FHLB and FRB. As of December 31, 2018, we could have borrowed an additional $2.2 billion from the FHLB and an additional $538.5 million from the FRB based on the amount of collateral pledged.\nWe continued our focus on maintaining a strong liquidity position throughout 2018. As of December 31, 2018, cash and cash equivalents were $526.0 million, the carrying value of our available-for-sale investment securities was $2.0 billion, and total deposits were $15.0 billion. As of December 31, 2018, our available-for-sale investment securities portfolio was comprised of securities with an average base duration of approximately 2.3 years.\nCapital Management\nWe actively manage capital, commensurate with our risk profile, in our efforts to enhance shareholder value. We also seek to maintain capital levels for the Company and the Bank at amounts in excess of the regulatory well-capitalized\u201d thresholds. Periodically, we may respond to market conditions by implementing changes to our overall balance sheet positioning to manage our capital position.\nThe Company and the Bank are each subject to regulatory capital requirements administered by the federal banking agencies. Failure to meet minimum capital requirements could cause certain mandatory and discretionary actions by regulators that, if undertaken, would likely have a material effect on our financial statements. Under capital adequacy guidelines and the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action, the Company and the Bank must meet specific capital guidelines that involve quantitative and qualitative measures. These measures were established by regulation intended to ensure capital adequacy. As of December 31, 2018, the Company's capital levels remained characterized as well-capitalized.\u201d The Company's regulatory capital ratios are presented in Table 21 below. There have been no conditions or events since December 31, 2018 that management believes have changed either the Company's or the Bank's capital classifications.\nAs of December 31, 2018, shareholders' equity was $1.3 billion, an increase of $36.3 million or 3% from December 31, 2017. Earnings for 2018 of $219.6 million, common stock issuances of $7.9 million, and share-based compensation of $8.1 million were offset by cash dividends paid of $98.5 million, common stock repurchases of $92.0 million, and other comprehensive loss of $8.9 million. In 2018, included in the amount of common stock repurchased were 1,079,397 shares repurchased under our share repurchase program. These shares were repurchased at an average cost per share of $81.80 and a total cost of $88.3 million. From the beginning of our share repurchase program in July 2001 through December 31, 2018, we repurchased a total of 55.3 million shares of common stock and returned total over $2.1 billion to our shareholders at an average cost of $39.14 per share.\nIn January 2019, the Parent's Board of Directors increased the authorization under the share repurchase program by an additional $130.0 million. From January 1, 2019 through February 15, 2019, the Parent repurchased an additional 298,500 shares of common stock at an average cost of $75.46 per share and a total cost of $22.5 million. Remaining buyback authority was $139.2 million as of February 15, 2019. The actual amount and timing of future share repurchases, if any, will depend on market and economic conditions, regulatory rules, applicable SEC rules, and various other factors.\nIn January 2019, the Parent's Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.62 per share on the Parent's outstanding shares. The dividend will be payable on March 14, 2019 to shareholders of record at the close of business on February 28, 2019.\nTable 21 presents a five-year history of activities and balances in our capital accounts, along with key capital ratios.\nTable 64: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>

available-for-sale investment securities to the held-to-maturity category.\nRegulatory Initiatives Affecting the Banking Industry\nBasel III\nUnder final FRB and FDIC approved rules implementing the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision's capital guidelines for U.S. banks minimum requirements increased for both the quantity and quality of capital held by the Company. The Basel III capital standards substantially revised the risk based capital requirements applicable to bank holding companies and their depository institution subsidiaries, including the definitions and the components of Tier 1 capital and Total Capital, the method of evaluating risk-weighted assets, institutions of a capital conservation buffer, and other matters affecting regulatory capital ratios. Strict eligibility criteria for regulatory capital instruments were also implemented under the rules.\nThe phase-in period for the final rules became effective for the Company on January 1, 2015, with full compliance with all of the final rules' requirements phased in over a multi-year schedule, to be fully implemented earlier this year on January 1, 2019. As of December 31, 2018, the Company's capital levels remained characterized as well-capitalized\u201d under the new rules.\nManagement continues to monitor regulatory developments and their potential impact to the Company's liquidity requirements.\nStress Testing\nEnactment of the Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief, and Consumer Protection Act in May 2018 significantly altered several provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act, including how stress tests are run. Bank holding companies with assets of less than $100 billion, such as the Company, are no longer subject to company-run stress testing requirements in section 165(i)(2) of the Dodd-Frank Act, including publishing a summary of results. At this time, the Company continues to run internal stress tests as a component of our comprehensive risk management and capital planning process.\nDeposit Insurance Fund ( DIF\u201d) Assessment\nIn March 2016, the FDIC approved a final rule that imposes on banks with at least $10 billion in assets, such as the Company, a surcharge of 4.5 cents per $100 of their assessment base, after making certain adjustments. The surcharge became effective for the third quarter of 2016 and the FDIC estimated the surcharge would be imposed for approximately two years. The surcharge took effect at the same time that the regular FDIC insurance assessment rates for all banks declined under a rule adopted by the FDIC in 2011. The surcharge ended on September 30, 2018. A further reduction in assessment rates will occur if and when the FDIC's Deposit Insurance Fund Reserve Ratio reaches 2.0 percent.\nOperational Risk\nOperational risk represents the risk of loss resulting from our operations, including, but not limited to, the risk of fraud by employees or persons outside the Company, errors relating to transaction processing and technology, failure to adhere to compliance requirements, and the risk of cyber attacks. We are also exposed to operational risk through our outsourcing arrangements, and the effect that changes in circumstances or capabilities of our outsourcing vendors can have on our ability to continue to perform operational functions necessary to our business. The risk of loss also includes the potential legal actions that could arise as a result of an operational deficiency or as a result of noncompliance with applicable regulatory standards, adverse business decisions or their implementation, and customer attrition due to potential negative publicity. Operational risk is inherent in all business activities, and management of this risk is important to the achievement of Company goals and objectives.\nOur Operating Risk Committee (the ORC\u201d) provides oversight and assesses the most significant operational risks facing the Company. We have developed a framework that provides for a centralized operating risk management function through the ORC, supplemented by business unit responsibility for managing operational risks specific to their business units. Our internal audit department also validates the system of internal controls through ongoing risk-based audit procedures and reports on the effectiveness of internal controls to executive management and the Audit and Risk Committee of the Board of Directors.\nWe continuously strive to strengthen our system of internal controls to improve the oversight of operational risk.\nWhile our internal controls have been designed to minimize operational risks, there is no assurance that business disruption or operational losses will not occur. On an ongoing basis, management reassesses operational risks, implements appropriate process changes, and invests in enhancements to our systems of internal controls.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements and Guarantees\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe hold interests in several unconsolidated variable interest entities ( VIEs\u201d). These unconsolidated VIEs are primarily low-income housing partnerships and solar energy tax credit partnership investments. Variable interests are defined as contractual ownership or other interests in an entity that change with fluctuations in an entity's net asset value. The primary beneficiary consolidates the VIE. We have determined that the Company is not the primary beneficiary of these entities. As a result, we do not consolidate these VIEs. See discussion of our accounting policy related to VIEs in Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nGuarantees\nWe pool Federal Housing Administration ( FHA\u201d) insured and U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs ( VA\u201d) guaranteed residential mortgage loans for sale to Ginnie Mae. We also sell residential mortgage loans in the secondary market to Fannie Mae. The agreements under which we sell residential mortgage loans to Ginnie Mae or Fannie Mae and the insurance or guaranty agreements with the FHA and VA contain provisions that include various representations and warranties regarding the origination and characteristics of the residential mortgage loans. Although these loans are primarily sold on a non-recourse basis, we may be obligated to repurchase residential mortgage loans or reimburse the respective investor if it is found that required documents were not delivered or were defective.\nWe also service substantially all of the loans we sell to investors in the secondary market. Each agreement under which we act as servicer generally specifies a standard of responsibility for our actions and provides protection against expenses and liabilities incurred by us when acting in compliance with the respective servicing agreements. However, if we commit a material breach of obligations as servicer, we may be subject to various penalties which may include the repurchase of an affected loan or a reimbursement to the respective investor.\nSee discussion of our risks related to representation and warranty provisions as well as our risks related to residential mortgage loan servicing activities in Note 20 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nContractual Obligations\nOur contractual obligations as of December 31, 2018 were as follows:\nTable 65: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Contractual Obligations 1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Table 22\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(dollars in thousands)\n</td> <td>Less Than One Year\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1-3 Years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4-5 Years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>After 5 Years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Deposits with No Stated Maturity\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>13,281,720\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>13,281,720\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Time Deposits\n</td> <td>1,441,580\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>235,422\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>60,916\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7,604\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,745,522\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Securities Sold Under Agreements to Repurchase\n</td> <td>4,296\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>275,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>225,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>504,296\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other Debt\n</td> <td>50,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>75,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>125,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Banker's Acceptances Outstanding\n</td> <td>51\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>51\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Capital Lease Obligations\n</td> <td>825\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,650\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,650\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>23,930\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>28,055\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Non-Cancelable Operating Leases\n</td> <td>12,455\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>22,291\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>19,898\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>104,877\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>159,521\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Purchase Obligations\n</td> <td>14,279\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>22,647\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,658\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,162\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>45,746\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Affordable Housing Commitments\n</td> <td>5,506\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8,411\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>163\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,118\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>15,198\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Pension and Postretirement Benefit Contributions 2\n</td> <td>1,331\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,821\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,103\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9,264\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>16,519\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total Contractual Obligations\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>14,812,043\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>643,242\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>315,388\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>150,955\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>15,921,628\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n 1 Our liability for UTBs as of December 31, 2018 was $5.5 million. We were unable to reasonably estimate the period of cash settlement with the respective taxing authority. As a result, our liability for UTBs is not included in this disclosure. \n 2 Amounts only include obligations related to the unfunded non-qualified pension plan and postretirement benefit plan. \nCommitments to extend credit, standby letters of credit, and commercial letters of credit do not necessarily represent future cash requirements in that these commitments often expire without being drawn upon; therefore, these items are not included in the above table (see Note 20 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information). Our non-cancelable operating leases and capital lease obligations are primarily related to branch premises, equipment, and a portion of the Company's headquarters' building with lease terms extending through 2052. Purchase obligations arise from agreements to purchase goods or services that are enforceable and legally binding. Other contracts included in purchase obligations primarily consist of service agreements for various systems and applications supporting bank operations. Pension and postretirement benefit contributions represent the minimum expected contribution to the unfunded non-qualified pension plan and postretirement benefit plan.

2 The net interest margin is defined as net interest income, on a taxable-equivalent basis, as a percentage of average earning assets. \nFourth Quarter Results and Other Matters\nNet Income\nNet income for the fourth quarter of 2018 was $53.9 million, an increase of $11.0 million or 26% compared to the fourth quarter of 2017. Diluted earnings per share were $1.30 for the fourth quarter of 2018, an increase of $0.29 or 29% compared to the fourth quarter of 2017.\nNet Interest Income\nNet interest income, on a taxable-equivalent basis, for the fourth quarter of 2018 was $125.2 million, an increase of $3.7 million or 3% compared to the fourth quarter of 2017. The increase was primarily due to the shift in the mix of our earning assets to loans, which generally have higher yields. Net interest margin was 3.10% for the fourth quarter of 2018, an increase of 12 basis point compared to the fourth quarter of 2017, primarily due to our loans, which generally have higher yields than our investment securities, comprising a larger percentage of our earning assets compared to 2017. In addition, yields increased for our commercial loans and investment portfolio. Yields on our loan portfolios increased primarily due to higher yields on floating rate loans.\nProvision for Credit Losses\nWe recorded a Provision of $2.0 million in the fourth quarter of 2018 compared to a Provision of $4.3 million recorded in the fourth quarter of 2017, while recording net charge-offs of loans and leases of $4.0 million and $3.8 million in the fourth quarters of 2018 and 2017, respectively. The Provision recorded was based on our determination that the allowance for loan and lease losses should be $106.7 million as of December 31, 2018.\nNoninterest Income\nNoninterest income, other than net gains on sales of investment securities, was $42.9 million in the fourth quarter of 2018, an increase of $0.5 million or 1% compared to the fourth quarter of 2017. This increase was primarily due to fees, exchange, and other service charges of $0.6 million in merchant income, which was recorded as a reduction of other noninterest expense in 2017. This accounting change was related to the 2018 adoption of the new revenue recognition accounting guidance. This increase was partially offset by a $0.4 decrease in mortgage banking income. This decrease was primarily due to reduced sales and margins on sales of conforming saleable loans from current production and from our mortgage loan portfolio.\nNoninterest Expense\nNoninterest expense was $95.9 million in the fourth quarter of 2018, an increase of $3.6 million or 4% compared to the fourth quarter of 2017. Salaries and benefit expense increased by $3.2 million primarily due to a $2.7 million increase in expenses related to our self-insured medical plans, a $2.5 million increase in merit and minimum wage increases, and a $1.0 million increase in separation expense. These increases were partially offset by a $0.9 million decrease in FDIC fees. In addition, during fourth quarter 2017 a one-time $2.2 million holiday bonus, inclusive of payroll taxes was paid.\nProvision for Income Taxes\nThe provision for income taxes was $14.3 million in the fourth quarter of 2018, a decrease of $6.8 million or 32% compared to the fourth quarter of 2017. The effective tax rate for the fourth quarter of 2018 was 20.92% compared with an effective tax rate of 32.93% for the fourth quarter of 2017. The lower effective rate in the fourth quarter of 2018 compared to the same period of 2017 was primarily due to the federal corporate tax rate changing from 35% to 21% as a result of the passage of the Tax Act, which was signed into law on December 22, 2017.\nCommon Stock Repurchase Program\nIn the fourth quarter of 2018, we repurchased 325,377 shares of our common stock under our share repurchase program at an average cost per share of $76.63 and a total cost of $24.9 million. See Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information related to our common stock repurchase program.", "item_7_text": "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nForward-Looking Statements\nThis report contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements can be identified by the fact that they do not relate strictly to historical or current facts and may include statements concerning, among other things, the anticipated economic and business environment in our service area and elsewhere, credit quality and other financial and business matters in future periods, our future results of operations and financial position, our business strategy and plans and our objectives and future operations. We also may make forward-looking statements in our other documents filed with or furnished to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC\u201d). In addition, our senior management may make forward-looking statements orally to analysts, investors, representatives of the media and others. Our forward-looking statements are based on numerous assumptions, any of which could prove to be inaccurate, and actual results may differ materially from those projected because of a variety of risks and uncertainties, including, but not limited to: 1) general economic conditions either nationally, internationally, or locally may be different than expected, and particularly, any event that negatively impacts the tourism industry in Hawaii; 2) unanticipated changes in the securities markets, public debt markets, and other capital markets in the U.S. and internationally; 3) competitive pressures in the markets for financial services and products; 4) the impact of legislative and regulatory initiatives, particularly the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 (the Dodd-Frank Act\u201d) and Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief, and Consumer Protection Act of 2018; 5) changes in fiscal and monetary policies of the markets in which we operate; 6) the increased cost of maintaining or the Company's ability to maintain adequate liquidity and capital, based on the requirements adopted by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision and U.S. regulators; 7) actual or alleged conduct which could harm our reputation; 8) changes in accounting standards; 9) changes in tax laws or regulations, including Public Law 115-97, commonly known as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, or the interpretation of such laws and regulations; 10) changes in our credit quality or risk profile that may increase or decrease the required level of our reserve for credit losses; 11) changes in market interest rates that may affect credit markets and our ability to maintain our net interest margin; 12) the impact of litigation and regulatory investigations of the Company, including costs, expenses, settlements, and judgments; 13) any failure in or breach of our operational systems, information systems or infrastructure, or those of our merchants, third party vendors and other service providers; 14) any interruption or breach of security of our information systems resulting in failures or disruptions in customer account management, general ledger processing, and loan or deposit systems; 15) changes to the amount and timing of proposed common stock repurchases; and 16) natural disasters, public unrest or adverse weather, public health, and other conditions impacting us and our customers' operations or negatively impacting the tourism industry in Hawaii. Given these risks and uncertainties, investors should not place undue reliance on any forward-looking statement as a prediction of our actual results. A detailed discussion of these and other risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results and events to differ materially from such forward-looking statements is included under the section entitled Risk Factors\u201d in Part I of this report. Words such as believes,\u201d anticipates,\u201d expects,\u201d intends,\u201d targeted,\u201d and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements but are not the exclusive means of identifying such statements. We undertake no obligation to update forward-looking statements to reflect later events or circumstances, except as may be required by law.\nCritical Accounting Policies\nOur Consolidated Financial Statements were prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ( GAAP\u201d) and follow general practices within the industries in which we operate. The most significant accounting policies we follow are presented in Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Application of these principles requires us to make estimates, assumptions, and judgments that affect the amounts reported in the Consolidated Financial Statements and accompanying notes. Most accounting policies are not considered by management to be critical accounting policies. Several factors are considered in determining whether or not a policy is critical in the preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements. These factors include among other things, whether the policy requires management to make difficult, subjective, and complex judgments about matters that are inherently uncertain and because it is likely that materially different amounts would be reported under different conditions or using different assumptions. The accounting policies which we believe to be most critical in preparing our Consolidated Financial Statements are those that are related to the determination of the reserve for credit losses, fair value estimates, leased asset residual values, and income taxes.\nReserve for Credit Losses\nA consequence of lending activities is that we may incur credit losses. The amount of such losses will vary depending upon the risk characteristics of the loan and lease portfolio as affected by economic conditions such as rising interest rates and the financial performance of borrowers. The reserve for credit losses consists of the allowance for loan and lease losses (the Allowance\u201d) and the reserve for unfunded commitments (the Unfunded Reserve\u201d). The Allowance provides for probable and estimable losses inherent in our loan and lease portfolio. The Allowance is increased or decreased through the provisioning process. There is no exact method of predicting specific losses or amounts that ultimately may be charged-off on particular segments of the loan and lease portfolio. The Unfunded Reserve is a component of other liabilities and represents the estimate for probable credit losses inherent in unfunded commitments to extend credit. The level of the Unfunded Reserve is adjusted by recording an expense or recovery in other noninterest expense.\nManagement's evaluation of the adequacy of the reserve for credit losses is often the most critical of accounting estimates for a financial institution. Our determination of the amount of the reserve for credit losses is a critical accounting estimate as it requires significant reliance on the accuracy of credit risk ratings on individual borrowers, the use of estimates and significant judgment as to the amount and timing of expected future cash flows on impaired loans, significant reliance on estimated loss rates on homogenous portfolios, and consideration of our quantitative and qualitative evaluation of economic factors and trends. While our methodology in establishing the reserve for credit losses attributes portions of the Allowance and Unfunded Reserve to the commercial and consumer portfolio segments, the entire Allowance and Unfunded Reserve is available to absorb credit losses inherent in the total loan and lease portfolio and total amount of unfunded credit commitments, respectively.\nThe reserve for credit losses related to our commercial portfolio segment is generally most sensitive to the accuracy of credit risk ratings assigned to each borrower. Commercial loan risk ratings are evaluated based on each situation by experienced senior credit officers and are subject to periodic review by an independent internal team of credit specialists. The reserve for credit losses related to our consumer portfolio segment is generally most sensitive to economic assumptions and delinquency trends. The reserve for credit losses attributable to each portfolio segment also includes an amount for inherent risks not reflected in the historical analyses. Relevant factors include, but are not limited to, concentrations of credit risk (geographic, large borrower, and industry), economic trends and conditions, changes in underwriting standards, experience and depth of lending staff, trends in delinquencies, and the level of criticized and classified loans.\nSee Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements and the Corporate Risk Profile - Credit Risk\u201d section in Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations ( MD&A\u201d) for more information on the Allowance and the Unfunded Reserve.\nFair Value Measurements\nFair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in the principal or most advantageous market for an asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. The degree of management judgment involved in determining the fair value of a financial instrument is dependent upon the availability of quoted market prices or observable market inputs. For financial instruments that are traded actively and have quoted market prices or observable market inputs, there is minimal subjectivity involved in measuring fair value. However, when quoted market prices or observable market inputs are not fully available, significant management judgment may be necessary to estimate fair value. In developing our fair value measurements, we maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs.\nThe fair value hierarchy defines Level 1 valuations as those based on quoted prices, unadjusted, for identical instruments traded in active markets. Level 2 valuations are those based on quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active, or model-based valuation techniques for which all significant assumptions are observable in the market. Level 3 valuations are based on model-based techniques that use at least one significant assumption not observable in the market, or significant management judgment or estimation, some of which may be internally developed.\nFinancial assets that are recorded at fair value on a recurring basis include available-for-sale investment securities, loans held for sale, mortgage servicing rights, investments related to deferred compensation arrangements, and derivative financial instruments. As of December 31, 2018 and 2017, $2.1 billion or 12% and $2.3 billion or 13%, respectively, of our total assets consisted of financial assets recorded at fair value on a recurring basis and most of these financial assets consisted of available-for-sale investment securities measured using information from a third-party pricing service. These investments in debt securities and mortgage-backed securities were all classified in either Levels 1 or 2 of the fair value hierarchy. Financial liabilities that are recorded at fair value on a recurring basis are comprised of derivative financial instruments. As of December 31, 2018 and 2017, $9.7 million or less than 1% of our total liabilities consisted of financial liabilities recorded at fair value on a recurring basis. As of December 31, 2018 and 2017, Level 3 financial assets recorded at fair value on a recurring basis were $15.1 million and $11.8 million, respectively, or less than 1% of our total assets, and were comprised of mortgage servicing rights and derivative financial instruments. As of December 31, 2018 and 2017, Level 3 financial liabilities recorded at fair value on a recurring basis were $9.4 million and $9.5 million, respectively, or less than 1% of our total liabilities, and were comprised of derivative financial instruments.\nOur third-party pricing service makes no representations or warranties that the pricing data provided to us is complete or free from errors, omissions, or defects. As a result, we have processes in place to monitor and periodically review the information provided to us by our third-party pricing service such as: 1) Our third-party pricing service provides us with documentation by asset class of inputs and methodologies used to value securities. We review this documentation to evaluate the inputs and valuation methodologies used to place securities into the appropriate level of the fair value hierarchy. This documentation is periodically updated by our third-party pricing service. Accordingly, transfers of securities within the fair value hierarchy are made if deemed necessary. 2) On a quarterly basis, management also selects a sample of securities priced by the Company's third-party pricing service and reviews the significant assumptions and valuation methodologies used by the pricing service with respect to those securities. The information provided is comprised of market reference data, which may include reported trades; bids, offers, or broker-dealer dealer quotes; benchmark yields and spreads; as well as other reference data as appropriate. Periodically, based on these reviews, management determines whether the current placement of the security in the fair value hierarchy is appropriate or whether transfers may be warranted. 3) On a quarterly basis, management reviews the pricing information received from our third-party pricing service. This review process includes a comparison to a second source. 4) Our third-party pricing service has also established processes for us to submit inquiries regarding quoted prices. Periodically, we will challenge the quoted prices provided by our third-party pricing service. Our third-party pricing service will review the inputs to the evaluation in light of the new market data presented by us. Our third-party pricing service may then affirm the original quoted price or may update the evaluation on a going forward basis. Generally, we do not adjust the price from the third-party service provider. 5) On an annual basis, we obtain and review the third-party's most recently issued Service Organization Controls report. related to controls placed in operation and tests of operating effectiveness, to update our understanding of the third-party pricing service's control environment.\nBased on the composition of our investment securities portfolio, we believe that we have developed appropriate internal controls and performed appropriate due diligence procedures to prevent or detect material misstatements. See Note 21 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information on our fair value measurements.\nIncome Taxes\nWe determine our liabilities for income taxes based on current tax regulations and interpretations in tax jurisdictions where our income is subject to taxation. Currently, we file tax returns in seven federal, state and local domestic jurisdictions, and four foreign jurisdictions. In estimating income taxes payable or receivable, we assess the relative merits and risks of the appropriate tax treatment considering statutory, judicial, and regulatory guidance in the context of each tax position. Accordingly, previously estimated liabilities are regularly reevaluated and adjusted through the provision for income taxes. Changes in the estimate of income taxes payable or receivable occur periodically due to changes in tax rates, interpretations of tax law, the status of examinations being conducted by various taxing authorities, and newly enacted statutory, judicial and regulatory guidance that impact the relative merits and risks of each tax position. These changes, when they occur, may affect the provision for income taxes as well as current and deferred income taxes, and may be significant to our statements of income and condition.\nManagement's determination of the realization of net deferred tax assets is based upon management's judgment of various future events and uncertainties, including the timing and amount of future income, as well as the implementation of various tax planning strategies to maximize realization of the deferred tax assets. A valuation allowance is provided when it is more likely than not that some portion of the deferred tax asset will not be realized. As of December 31, 2018 and 2017, we carried a valuation allowance of $1.1 million and $1.0 million, respectively, related to our deferred tax assets established in connection with our low-income housing investments.\nWe are also required to record a liability, referred to as an unrecognized tax benefit (\"UTB\"), for the entire amount of benefit taken in a prior or future income tax return when we determine that a tax position has a less than 50% likelihood of being accepted by the taxing authority. As of December 31, 2018 and 2017, our liabilities for UTBs were $5.5 million and $5.3 million, respectively.\nIn 2018, the Company recognized federal and State of Hawaii investment tax credits from energy investments. The Company uses the deferral method of accounting for its investment tax credit with the benefit recognized in the provision for income taxes. These credits reduced the Company's provision for income taxes by $5.0 million, 5.4 million, and 4.7 million in 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively.\nPublic law No. 115-97, known as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the \"Tax Act\"), which was enacted on December 22, 2017, reduced the U.S. federal corporate tax rate from 35% to 21% effective January 1, 2018. Also on December 22, 2017, the Securities and Exchange Commission issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118 ( SAB 118\u201d), which provides guidance on accounting for tax effects of the Tax Act. SAB 118 provides a measurement period of up to one year from the enactment date to complete the accounting. Any adjustments during this measurement period were included in net earnings from continuing operations as\nan adjustment to income tax expense in the reporting period when such adjustments were determined. Based on the information available and current interpretation of the rules, the Company calculated the impact of the reduction in the corporate tax rate and remeasurement of certain deferred tax assets and liabilities. The provisional amount recorded in the fourth quarter of 2017 related to the remeasurement of the Company's deferred tax balance resulted in additional income tax expense of $3.6 million. An additional $0.1 million was expensed in the first quarter of 2018 due to the remeasurement of the Company's deferred tax balance. In addition, during the first quarter of 2018, the Company recorded a $2.0 million basis adjustment on its low income\nhousing partnership investments, which consequently reduced income tax expense by the same amount. The remeasurement of the Company's deferred tax balance in the third quarter of 2018 resulted in an income tax expense reduction of $0.3 million. The Company finalized the impact of the Tax Act in the third quarter of 2018.\nOverview\nWe are a regional financial services company serving businesses, consumers, and governments in Hawaii, Guam, and other Pacific Islands. Our principal operating subsidiary, the Bank, was founded in 1897 and is the largest independent financial institution in Hawaii.\nOur business strategy is to use our unique market knowledge, prudent management discipline and brand strength to deliver exceptional value to our stakeholders. Our business plan is balanced between growth and risk management while maintaining flexibility to adjust to economic changes. We will continue to focus on providing customers with best-in-class service and an innovative mix of products and services. We will also remain focused on continuing to deliver strong financial results while maintaining prudent risk and capital management strategies as well as our commitment to support our local communities.\nHawaii Economy\nGeneral economic conditions in Hawaii remained healthy during 2018, led by a strong tourism industry, relatively low unemployment, rising real estate prices, and an active construction industry. Total visitor arrivals increased 5.9% and visitor spending increased 6.8% during 2018 compared to 2017. The statewide seasonally-adjusted unemployment rate was 2.5% in December 2018 compared to 3.9% nationally. The volume of single-family home sales on Oahu decreased 7.7% in 2018 compared to 2017, while the volume of condominium sales on Oahu decreased 2.5% in 2018 compared to 2017. The median price of single-family home sales and condominium sales on Oahu increased 4.6% and 3.7%, respectively, in 2018 compared to 2017. As of December 31, 2018, months of inventory of single-family homes and condominiums on Oahu remained low at approximately 2.8 months and 2.9 months, respectively.\nEarnings Summary\nNet income for 2018 was $219.6 million, an increase of $34.9 million or 19% compared to 2017. Diluted earnings per share were $5.23 in 2018, an increase of $0.90 or 21% compared to 2017. Our return on average assets was 1.29% in 2018, an increase of 19 basis points from 2017, and our return on average shareholders' equity was 17.63% in 2018, an increase of 236 basis points from 2017.\nOur higher net income in 2018 was primarily due to the following:\n \u2022 The provision for income taxes was $50.6 million in 2018, a decrease of $32.8 million or 39% compared to 2017 primarily due to the federal corporate tax rate changing from 35% to 21% as a result of the passage of the Tax Act. The effective tax rate was 18.73% in 2018 compared to 31.11% in 2017. \n \u2022 Net interest income was $486.4 million in 2018, an increase of $29.1 million or 6% compared to 2017. On a taxable-equivalent basis, net interest income was $491.5 million in 2018, an increase of $22.4 million or 5% compared to 2017. This increase was primarily due to a higher level of earning assets, including growth in both our commercial and consumer lending portfolios, and higher net interest margin. The higher level of earning assets was primarily funded by higher deposit balances. Net interest margin was 3.05% in 2018, a 12 basis point increase from 2017, primarily due to our loans, which generally have higher yields than our investment securities, comprising a larger percentage of our earning assets compared to 2017. In addition, yields increased for our commercial loans and investment portfolio. Yields on our loan portfolios increased primarily due to higher yields on floating rate loans. This was partially offset by an increase in rates offered on our deposit products. \n \u2022 We recorded a $13.4 million provision for credit losses in 2018 compared to a $16.9 million provision recorded in 2017. The provision recorded was based on our determination that the allowance for loan and lease losses should be $106.7 million as of December 31, 2018. \nThese items were partially offset by the following:\n \u2022 Investment securities gains (losses), net totaled $(3.9) million in 2018 compared to $10.4 million in 2017. The net losses in 2018 were due to fees paid to the counterparties of our prior Visa Class B share sale transactions combined with a $1.0 million payment related to a change in the Visa Class B share conversion ratio. The net gain in 2017 was primarily due the sale of 90,000 Visa Class B shares. \n \u2022 Salaries and benefits expense was $213.2 million in 2018, an increase of $9.5 million or 5% compared to 2017 primarily due to $9.8 million increase in merit and minimum wage increases. Medical, dental, and life insurance increased by $3.8 million primarily due to higher expenses related to our self-insured medical plans coupled with increased group medical insurance costs. These increases were partially offset by a $2.1 million decrease in incentive compensation. During the fourth quarter of 2017, the Company paid a $2.2 million bonus, inclusive of payroll taxes, partly due to anticipated future tax expense reductions resulting from the Tax Act. In addition, share-based compensation decreased by $2.1 million as a result of the Company's lower share price. Commission expense also decreased by $2.1 million primarily due to a decrease in loan origination and refinancing activity. \n \u2022 Mortgage banking income was $8.4 million in 2018, a decrease of $4.5 million or 35% compared to 2017. This decrease was primarily due to reduced sales and margins on sales of conforming saleable loans from current production and from our mortgage loan portfolio. \nWe maintained a strong balance sheet throughout 2018, with what we believe are adequate reserves for credit losses, and high levels of liquidity and capital.\n \u2022 Total loans and leases were $10.4 billion as of December 31, 2018, an increase of $0.7 billion or 7% from December 31, 2017 primarily due to growth in our consumer lending portfolios. \n \u2022 The allowance for loan and lease losses (the Allowance\u201d) was $106.7 million as of December 31, 2018, a decrease of $0.7 million or 1% from December 31, 2017. The ratio of our Allowance to total loans and leases outstanding decreased to 1.02% as of December 31, 2018, compared to 1.10% as of December 31, 2017. The level of our Allowance was commensurate with the Company's credit risk profile, loan portfolio growth and composition, and a healthy Hawaii economy. \n \u2022 The total carrying value of our investment securities portfolio was $5.5 billion as of December 31, 2018, a decrease of $671.1 million or 11% from December 31, 2017. In 2018, we reduced our positions primarily in mortgage-backed securities, municipal debt securities, and corporate debt securities. Government National Mortgage Corporation ( Ginnie Mae\u201d) mortgage-backed securities continue to be our largest concentration in our portfolio. \n \u2022 Total deposits were $15.0 billion as of December 31, 2018, an increase of $0.1 billion or 1% from December 31, 2017 primarily due to higher consumer core and time deposits. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in public and other deposits largely due to the strategic decision to reduce public time deposits. \n \u2022 Total shareholders' equity was $1.3 billion as of December 31, 2018, an increase of $36.3 million or 3% from December 31, 2017. We continued to return capital to our shareholders in the form of share repurchases and dividends. During 2018, we repurchased 1,120,755 shares of common stock at a total cost of $92.0 million under our share repurchase program and from employees and/or directors in connection with income tax withholdings related to the vesting of restricted stock, shares purchased for a deferred compensation plan, and stock swaps, less shares distributed from the deferred compensation plan. We also paid cash dividends of $98.5 million during 2018. \nAnalysis of Statements of Income\nAverage balances, related income and expenses, and resulting yields and rates are presented in Table 1. An analysis of the change in net interest income, on a taxable-equivalent basis, is presented in Table 2.\n\n 1 Non-performing loans and leases are included in the respective average loan and lease balances. Income, if any, on such loans and leases is recognized on a cash basis. \n 2 Comprised of other consumer revolving credit, installment, and consumer lease financing. \n 3 Interest income includes taxable-equivalent basis adjustments, based upon a federal statutory tax rate of 21% for 2018 and 35% for 2017 and 2016, of $5.2 million for 2018, $11.8 million for 2017, and $12.0 million for 2016. \n\n1 The change in interest income and expense not solely due to changes in volume or rate has been allocated on a pro-rata basis to the volume and rate columns.\n2 Comprised of other consumer revolving credit, installment, and consumer lease financing.\nNet Interest Income\nNet interest income is affected by the size and mix of our balance sheet components as well as the spread between interest earned on assets and interest paid on liabilities. Net interest margin is defined as net interest income, on a taxable-equivalent basis, as a percentage of average earning assets.\nNet interest income was $486.4 million in 2018, an increase of $29.1 million or 6% compared to 2017. On a taxable-equivalent basis, net interest income was $491.5 million in 2018, an increase of $22.4 million or 5% compared to 2017. This increase was primarily due to a higher level of earning assets, including growth in both our commercial and consumer lending portfolios, and higher net interest margin. The higher level of earning assets was primarily funded by higher deposit balances. Net interest margin was 3.05% in 2018, a 12 basis point increase from 2017, primarily due to our loans, which generally have higher yields than our investment securities, comprising a larger percentage of our earning assets compared to 2017. In addition, yields increased for our commercial loans and investment portfolio. Yields on our loan portfolios increased primarily due to higher yields on floating rate loans.\nYields on our earning assets increased by 22 basis points in 2018 compared to 2017 primarily due to the shift in the mix of our earning assets from investment securities to loans, which generally have higher yields. Yields on our commercial and industrial and commercial mortgage portfolios increased by 46 basis points and 31 basis points, respectively, primarily due to higher yields on floating rate loans. In addition, yields on our investment securities portfolio increased by 14 basis points primarily due to the higher interest rate environment and lower premium amortization. These yield increases were partially offset by an 86 basis point decrease in yield for our automobile loans portfolio.\nInterest rates paid on our interest-bearing liabilities increased 15 basis points in 2018 compared to 2017. Increases to our funding costs were primarily due to higher rates paid on our interest-bearing deposits, a reflection of the higher rate environment. The increase in our funding costs was partially offset by a lower average balance of our public time deposits which decreased by $209.2 million. Interest rates paid on our securities sold under agreements to repurchase decreased by 19 basis points from 2017 primarily due to the restructuring of three repurchase agreements with private institutions with an aggregate total of $200.0 million. These repurchase agreements had a weighted-average interest rate of 3.94%. The restructuring of the agreements extended the maturity dates to June 2022 and lowered the weighted-average interest rate to 2.70% effective June 2017.\nAverage balances of our earning assets increased by $92.1 million or 1% in 2018 compared to 2017 primarily due to loan growth as the average balances of our loans and leases portfolio increased by $696.9 million. Offsetting this increase in the average balance of our loans and leases portfolio were a $371.5 million decrease in the average balance of investment securities and a $223.0 million decrease in the average balance of funds sold. The average balance of our residential mortgage portfolio increased by $238.9 million primarily due to a relatively constant level of loan originations combined with a slowdown in payoff activity. The average balance of our commercial mortgage portfolio increased by $187.5 million primarily due to continued demand from new and existing customers as a result of healthy Hawaii economy. The average balance of our home equity portfolio increased by $153.2 million as a result of continued loan demand in light of a healthy Hawaii economy and stable real estate market conditions. Additionally, utilization on new and existing home equity lines was strong during 2018.\nAverage balances of our interest-bearing liabilities increased by $228.3 million or 2% in 2018 compared to 2017 primarily due to growth in our consumer and commercial time deposits, along with continued growth in our relationship checking and savings products, offset by the aforementioned lower average balance in our public time deposits. Average balances in our time deposits and core deposits increased by $136.5 million and $132.9 million, respectively.\nNet interest income was $457.2 million in 2017, an increase of $39.7 million or 9% compared to 2016. On a taxable-equivalent basis, net interest income was $469.1 million in 2017, an increase of $39.5 million or 9% compared to 2016. This increase was primarily due to a higher level of earning assets, including growth in both our commercial and consumer lending portfolios, and higher net interest margin. The higher level of earning assets was primarily funded by higher deposit balances. Net interest margin was 2.93% in 2017, a 10 basis point increase from 2016, primarily due to our loans, which generally have higher yields than our investment securities, comprising a larger percentage of our earning assets compared to 2016. In addition, yields increased for our commercial loans and investment portfolio. Yields on our loan portfolios increased primarily due to higher yields on floating rate loans. This was partially offset by an increase in rates offered on our deposit products.\nYields on our earning assets increased by 12 basis points in 2017 compared to 2016 primarily due to the shift in the mix of our earning assets from funds sold to loans which generally have higher yields. Yields on our commercial and industrial and commercial mortgage portfolios increased by 10 basis points and 11 basis points, respectively, primarily due to higher yields on floating rate loans. In addition, yields on our investment securities portfolio increased by 10 basis points primarily due to the higher interest rate environment and lower premium amortization. These yield increases were partially offset by a 15 basis point yield decrease in our residential mortgage loan portfolio, primarily due to continued payoff activity of higher-rate mortgage loans and the addition of lower-rate mortgage loans to our portfolio.\nInterest rates paid on our interest-bearing liabilities increased four basis points in 2017 compared to 2016. Interest rates paid on our time deposits increased by 31 basis points due to new public time deposits at higher rates. Interest rates paid on our securities sold under agreements to repurchase decreased by 25 basis points from 2016 due to the restructuring of three repurchase agreements with private institutions with an aggregate total of $200.0 million during the second quarter of 2017. These repurchase agreements were to mature in 2018 and had a weighted-average interest rate of 3.94%. The restructuring of the agreements extended the maturity dates to June 2022 and lowered the weighted-average interest rate to 2.70% effective June 2017. The remaining balance in our repurchase agreements consists mainly of those with private entities which have relatively longer terms at higher interest rates. The increases to our funding costs were largely offset by growth in our demand and savings deposits, which generally have lower rates than other funding sources. The average balance of these core deposits increased by $284.7 million or 4% in 2017 compared to 2016.\nAverage balances of our earning assets increased by $865.6 million or 6% in 2017 compared to 2016 primarily due to loan growth as the average balances of our loans and leases portfolio increased by $984.6 million. The average balance of our commercial and industrial portfolio increased by $82.9 million due to increase in corporate demand for funding. The average balance of our commercial mortgage portfolio increased by $241.9 million as a result of continued demand from new and existing customers as the Hawaii economy continued to be strong coupled with the transfer of construction loans into this loan portfolio upon project completion. The average balance of our residential mortgage portfolio increased by $270.6 million primarily due to a relatively constant level of loan originations combined with a slowdown in payoff activity. The average balance of our home equity portfolio increased by $255.8 million as a result of healthy loan demand in light of a strong Hawaii economy and improved real estate market conditions. Additionally, utilization on new and existing home equity lines remained steady during 2017. In addition to the increase in the average balances of our loan and lease portfolio, there was a $63.0 million increase in the average balance of our investment securities portfolio in 2017.\nAverage balances of our interest-bearing liabilities increased by $584.8 million or 6% in 2017 compared to 2016 primarily due to growth in our time deposits, along with continued growth in our relationship checking and savings products.\nProvision for Credit Losses\nThe provision for credit losses (the Provision\u201d) reflects our judgment of the expense or benefit necessary to achieve the appropriate amount of the Allowance. We maintain the Allowance at levels adequate to cover our estimate of probable credit losses as of the end of the reporting period. The Allowance is determined through detailed quarterly analyses of our loan and lease portfolio. The Allowance is based on our loss experience and changes in the economic environment, as well as an ongoing assessment of our credit quality. We recorded a Provision of $13.4 million in 2018, $16.9 million in 2017, and $4.8 million in 2016. For further discussion on the Allowance, see the Corporate Risk Profile - Credit Risk\u201d section in MD&A.\nNoninterest Income\nTable 3 presents the major components of noninterest income for 2018, 2017, and 2016.\n\nTrust and asset management income is comprised of fees earned from the management and administration of trusts and other customer assets. These fees are largely based upon the market value of the assets that we manage and the fee rate charged to customers. Total trust assets under administration were $9.4 billion, $9.3 billion, and $8.8 billion as of December 31, 2018, 2017, and 2016, respectively. Trust and asset management income decreased by $1.6 million or 3% in 2018 compared to 2017 due to a decrease in special service fees ($0.6 million), employee benefit trust fees ($0.5 million), and other trust fees ($0.3 million) primarily due to a decline in the number of customer accounts under administration. Trust and asset management income decreased by $0.8 million or 2% in 2017 compared to 2016 primarily due to a $1.2 million decrease in special service fees mainly the result of a service fee received from the sale of real estate in second quarter of 2016. This increase was partially offset by a $0.7 million increase in agency fees primarily due to an increase in market value of accounts.\nMortgage banking income is highly influenced by mortgage interest rates, the housing market, the amount of our loan sales, and our valuation of mortgage servicing rights. Mortgage banking income decreased by $4.5 million or 35% in 2018 compared to 2017. This decrease was primarily due to reduced sales of conforming saleable loans from current production. There were no sales from our mortgage loan portfolio in 2018. Mortgage banking income decreased by $6.9 million or 35% in 2017 compared to 2016. This decrease was primarily due to reduced sales and margins on sales of conforming saleable loans from current production and from our mortgage loan portfolio.\nService charges on deposit accounts decreased by $3.8 million or 12% in 2018 compared to 2017. This decrease was primarily due to a $2.3 million decrease in account analysis fees and a $1.7 million decrease in overdraft fees, partially offset by an increase in other service and monthly fees. Service charges on deposit accounts decreased by $1.1 million or 3% in 2017 compared to 2016. This decrease was primarily due to a $0.8 million decrease in overdraft fees due in part to higher customer deposit balances and a $0.7 decrease in account analysis fees.\nFees, exchange, and other service charges are primarily comprised of debit and credit card income, fees from ATMs, merchant service activity, and other loan fees and special charges. Fees, exchange, and other service charges increased by $2.6 million or 5% primarily due to $2.3 million increase in merchant income, which was recorded as a reduction of other noninterest expense in 2017. This accounting change was related to the 2018 adoption of the new revenue recognition accounting guidance. Fees, exchange, and other service charges decreased $0.3 million or 1% in 2017 compared to 2016 primarily due to decreases in other loan fees ($0.8 million) and ATM fees ($0.5 million), largely offset by a $0.9 million increase in debit card fees primarily due to increased transaction volume.\nNet gains (losses) on sales of investment securities totaled $(3.9) million, $10.4 million, and $10.2 million, in 2018, 2017, and 2016, respectively. The net loss in 2018 was primarily due to fees paid to the counterparties of our prior Visa Class B share sale transactions. In addition, in June 2018, Visa announced a reduction of the conversion ratio of its Class B shares from 1.6483 to 1.6298 effective June 28, 2018. As a result, the Company recorded a $1.0 million liability in June 2018, which was paid to previous buyers of our Visa Class B shares in July 2018. The net gains in 2017 and 2016 were due to gains on the sale of 90,000 and 100,000 Visa Class B restricted shares in 2017 and 2016, respectively. We received these Class B shares in 2008 as part of Visa's initial public offering. These shares are transferable only under limited circumstances until they can be converted into the publicly traded Class A shares. This conversion will not occur until the settlement of certain litigation which is indemnified by Visa members such as the Company. Visa funded an escrow account from its initial public offering to settle these litigation claims. Should this escrow account not be sufficient to cover these litigation claims, Visa is entitled to fund additional amounts to the escrow account by reducing each member bank's Class B conversion ratio to unrestricted Class A shares. Concurrent with the sale of these Visa Class B shares, we entered into an agreement with the buyer that requires payment to the buyer in the event Visa further reduces the conversion ratio. Based on the existing transfer restriction and the uncertainty of the covered litigation, the remaining 83,014 Visa Class B shares (135,296 Class A equivalent shares) that we own are carried at a zero cost basis as of December 31, 2018. We also contributed to the Bank of Hawaii Foundation 3,600, 4,300, and 7,800, Visa Class B shares during 2018, 2017, and 2016, respectively.\nAnnuity and insurance income decreased by $1.0 million or 15% in 2018 compared to 2017 primarily due to a $0.7 million decrease in income related to our annuity products. Annuity and insurance income decreased by $0.2 million or 2% in 2017 compared to 2016 primarily due to a decrease in income related to our annuity products.\nBank-owned life insurance increased by $0.7 million or 10% in 2018 compared to 2017 primarily due to death benefits received. Bank-owned life insurance remained relatively unchanged in 2017 compared to 2016.\nOther noninterest income increased by $5.4 million or 34% in 2018 compared to 2017 primarily due to a distribution received in the first quarter of 2018 from a low-income housing investment sale totaling $2.8 million combined with a $1.1 million increase in fees from our customer interest rate swap derivatives and a $0.8 million increase in net gain on sale of leased assets. Other noninterest income decreased by $2.8 million or 15% in 2017 compared to 2016. This decrease was primarily due to a $2.3 million decrease in fees from our customer interest rate swap derivatives, and a $0.9 million decrease in net gain on sale of leased assets.\nNoninterest Expense\nTable 4 presents the major components of noninterest expense for 2018, 2017, and 2016.\n\n1 The Company adopted ASU No. 2017-07 and applied the guidance retrospectively. As such $1.8 million previously reported in retirement and other benefits were reclassified to other noninterest expense for the year ended December 31, 2017 and 2016.\nTotal salaries and benefits increased by $9.5 million or 5% in 2018 compared to 2017 primarily due to $9.8 million in merit and minimum wage increases. Medical, dental, and life insurance increased by $3.8 million primarily due to higher expenses related to our self-insured medical plans coupled with increased group medical insurance costs. These increases were partially offset by a $2.1 million decrease in incentive compensation. During the fourth quarter of 2017, the Company paid a $2.2 million bonus, inclusive of payroll taxes, partly due to anticipated future tax expense reductions resulting from the Tax Act. In addition, share-based compensation decreased by $2.1 million as a result of the Company's lower share price. Commission expense also decreased by $2.1 million primarily due to a decrease in loan origination and refinancing activity. Total salaries and benefits increased by $4.4 million or 2% in 2017 compared to 2016 due in part to the aforementioned $2.2 million bonus, paid in the fourth quarter 2017. In addition, separation expense increased by $1.2 million. These increases were partially offset by a $2.0 million decrease in share-based compensation. Commission expense also decreased by $1.0 million primarily due to a decrease in loan origination and refinancing activity.\nNet occupancy expense increased by $2.2 million or 7% in 2018 compared to 2017 due to a $1.0 million increase in ATM lease space rental costs in 2018. These ATM lease space rental costs were recorded as a reduction of ATM fee income in 2017. This accounting change was related to the 2018 adoption of the new revenue recognition accounting guidance. In addition, this increase was due to the increases in utilities and depreciation expenses by $0.6 million and $0.3 million, respectively. Net occupancy expense increased by $2.3 million or 8% in compared to 2016 primarily due to a $3.4 million decrease in net gain on sale of real estate from $3.7 million in 2016 to $0.3 million in 2017. This increase was offset by a $0.9 million decrease in net rental expense.\nNet equipment expense increased by $1.8 million or 8% 2018 compared to 2017 primarily due to a $1.1 million increase in depreciation expense. In addition, branches and information technology rent expense increased by $0.6 million. Net equipment expense increased by $1.5 million or 7% in 2017 compared to 2016 primarily due to a $0.8 million increase in software license fees and maintenance and a $0.5 million increase in depreciation expense.\nData processing expense increased by $2.4 million or 15% in 2018 compared to 2017 due to ongoing information technology projects. Data processing expense remained relatively unchanged in 2017 compared to 2016.\nProfessional fees decreased by $1.7 million or 14% in 2018 compared to 2017 primarily due to a decrease in professional services in our mortgage division. Professional fees increased by $1.6 million or 16% in 2017 compared to 2016 primarily due to a $0.9 million increase in legal fees and a $0.8 million increase in professional services primarily in our mortgage division.\nOther noninterest expense increased by $0.7 million or 1% in 2018 compared to 2017 due to $2.7 million in legal reserves recorded during 2018. Operating losses, which include losses as a result of bank error, fraud, items processing, or theft, increased by $1.2 million, partially offset by a decrease in business travel of $0.9 million, a $0.9 million decrease in credit card expense due to the completed sale of our MyBankoh Rewards Credit Card portfolio on November 1, 2018, and a decrease in temporary services of $0.7 million. Other noninterest expense decreased by $3.0 million or 5% in 2017 compared to 2016 due to a $0.9 million decrease in delivery and postage services and a $0.8 million decrease in solar energy tax credit partnership amortization expense.\nIncome Taxes\nTable 5 presents our provision for income taxes and effective tax rates for 2018, 2017, and 2016:\n\nThe provision for income taxes was $50.6 million in 2018, a decrease of $32.8 million or 39% compared to 2017. The effective tax rate was 18.73% in 2018 compared to 31.11% in 2017. The lower effective tax rate in 2018 compared to 2017 was due primarily to the Tax Act enacted into law on December 22, 2017. The Tax Act made changes to the U.S. tax code, including reducing the U.S. federal tax rate from 35% to 21% effective January 1, 2018.\nA reduction in the corporate tax rate set forth in the Tax Act discussed above also affected the Company's primary benefits received from low income housing investments. The impact of the change in tax rate on the Company's accounting for such investments was reevaluated, resulting in a $2 million reduction in the amortization of the net investment, which also favorably impacted the effective tax rate in 2018. These items were partially offset by a $3.3 million decrease in the release of valuation allowances for low income housing investments in 2018 compared to 2017.\nThe provision for income taxes was $83.4 million in 2017, an increase of $5.3 million or 7% compared to 2016. The effective tax rate was 31.11% in 2017 compared to 30.10% in 2016. The higher effective tax rate in 2017 compared to 2016 was primarily due to a $3.6 million charge for the write down of net deferred tax assets as a result of the Tax Act discussed above. A $3.0 million state tax reserve release in 2016 due to the lapse in the statute of limitations related to prior tax years also favorably impacted the effective tax rate in 2016. These items were partially offset by a $2.5 million tax benefit from the exercise of stock options and the vesting of restricted stock in 2017 and a $2.1 million increase in the release of valuation allowances for low income housing investments in 2017 compared to 2016.\nAnalysis of Business Segments\nOur business segments are Retail Banking, Commercial Banking, Investment Services and Private Banking, and Treasury and Other. Table 6 summarizes net income from our business segments for 2018, 2017, and 2016. Additional information about segment performance is presented in Note 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\nRetail Banking\nNet income increased by $6.9 million or 9% in 2018 compared to 2017 primarily due to a decrease in the effective income tax rate used to allocate the provision for income taxes. This was partially offset by a decrease in noninterest income, an increase in noninterest expense, and an increase in the Provision. The decrease in noninterest income was primarily due to reduced sales of conforming saleable loans from our mortgage portfolio and lower margins on those sales. In addition, overdraft fees decreased. Noninterest expense increased primarily due to a $2.0 million increase in legal reserves recorded in the first quarter of 2018 and higher allocated technology, operations, and finance expense. This was partially offset by the reclassification of certain ATM and debit transaction processing fees, in 2018, as contra revenue, and decreases in professional fees and salaries and benefits. The increase in the Provision was primarily due to higher net charge-offs in our credit card portfolio, which was sold on November 1, 2018, our home equity portfolio due to lower recoveries, as well as overdrafts; this was partially offset by lower net charge-offs in our residential mortgage portfolio.\nNet income increased by $6.1 million or 8% in 2017 compared to 2016 primarily due to an increase in net interest income, partially offset by a decrease in noninterest income and an increase in the Provision. The increase in net interest income was primarily due to higher volume in both the lending and deposit portfolios as well as higher earnings credits on the segment's deposit portfolio. The decrease in noninterest income is primarily due to lower mortgage loan sales and reduced margins on those sales. The increase in the Provision was primarily due to higher net charge-offs in our installment loan, credit card, auto loan, and mortgage loan portfolios, partially offset by lower net charge-offs in our home equity loan and personal credit line portfolios.\nCommercial Banking\nNet income increased by $17.4 million or 23% in 2018 compared to 2017 primarily due to increases in net interest income and noninterest income, and a decrease in the provision for income taxes. These were partially offset by an increase in noninterest expense. The increase in net interest income was primarily due to higher earnings credits on the segment's deposit portfolio. The increase in noninterest income was primarily due to higher merchant income stemming from the adoption of ASU No. 2014-09 Revenue from Contracts with Customers: (Topic 606), higher fees related to our customer interest rate swap derivative program, and to higher net gains on sale of leased equipment. This increase was partially offset by lower account analysis fees as a result of higher earnings credit rates on customer accounts. The decrease in the Provision was due to higher net recovery of loans and leases in 2018. The increase in noninterest expense was primarily due to higher salaries, operating and allocated expenses. The increase in operating expenses was due to the aforementioned adoption of ASU No. 2014-09s. The decrease in the provision for income taxes was due to the lower effective tax rate allocated to the segment.\nNet income decreased by $0.4 million or 1% in 2017 compared to 2016 primarily due to a decrease in noninterest income, and increases to the Provision and noninterest expense. This was partially offset by an increase in net interest income. The decrease in noninterest income was primarily due to lower net gains on sale of leased equipment, lower fees related to our customer interest rate swap derivatives and lower non-recurring loan fees. The increase in the Provision was due to lower net recoveries of loans and leases in 2017. The increase in noninterest expense was primarily due to higher salaries and benefits expense and to higher allocated expenses. The increase in net interest income was primarily due to higher volume in both the lending and deposit portfolios, and partially due to higher earnings credits on the segment's deposit portfolio.\nInvestment Services and Private Banking\nNet income increased by $6.8 million or 43% in 2018 compared to 2017 primarily due to an increase in net interest income, partially offset by an increase in noninterest expense and a decrease in noninterest revenue. The increase in net interest income was primarily driven by the transfer of deposits and loans from the Retail Banking segment and growth of the segment's deposit portfolio. The increase in noninterest expense was primarily due to higher salaries and benefits expense, a one-time charge-off, and higher allocated expenses. The decrease in noninterest revenue was driven by lower annuity sales and lower trust service fees.\nNet income increased by $1.8 million or 13% in 2017 compared to 2016 primarily due to an increase in net interest income, partially offset by increases in noninterest expense. The increase in net interest income was primarily driven by the transfer of deposits from the Retail Banking segment and growth of the segment's deposit portfolio. The increase in noninterest expense was primarily due to higher salaries and benefits expense and an operational recovery in the second quarter of 2016.\nTreasury and Other\nNet income increased by $3.8 million or 34% in 2018 compared to 2017 primarily due to an increase in net interest income, a decrease in the provision for loan losses and an decrease in the provision for taxes. The increase in net interest income was primarily due to an increase in funding income related to lending activities and an increase interest income from investment securities and funds sold resulting from an increase in associated yields partially offset by higher deposit funding costs. The Provision in this business segment represents the residual provision for credit losses to arrive at the total Provision for the Company. The decrease in noninterest income was primarily due to the sale of 90,000 Visa Class B shares amounting to $12.5 million in the first quarter of 2017. Partially offsetting this was a $2.8 million distribution from a low-income housing partnership in the first quarter of 2018. The provision for income taxes in this business segment represents the residual amount to arrive at the total tax expense for the Company. The overall effective tax rate decreased to 18.73% in 2018 compared to 31.11% in 2017.\nNet income decreased by $4.2 million or 27% in 2017 compared to 2016 primarily due to a decrease in net interest income, an increase in the provision for loan losses, and an increase in the provision for taxes. The decrease in net interest income was primarily due to higher deposit funding costs, partially offset by an increase in interest income from investment securities and funds sold under agreements to repurchase resulting from an increase in associated yields and an increase in funding income related to lending activities. The Provision in this business segment represents the residual provision for credit losses to arrive at the total Provision for the Company. The provision for income taxes in this business segment represents the residual amount to arrive at the total tax expense for the Company. The overall effective tax rate increased to 31.11% in 2017 compared to 30.10% in 2016.\nOther organizational units (Technology, Operations, Marketing, Human Resources, Finance, Credit and Risk Management, and Corporate and Regulatory Administration) included in Treasury and Other provide a wide range of support to the Company's other income earning segments. Expenses incurred by these support units are charged to the business segments through an internal cost allocation process.\nAnalysis of Statements of Condition\nInvestment Securities\nTable 7 presents the maturity distribution at amortized cost, weighted-average yield to maturity, and fair value of our investment securities.\n\n 1 Weighted-average yields on obligations of states and political subdivisions are generally tax-exempt and are computed on a taxable-equivalent basis using a federal statutory tax rate of 21%. \n 2 Maturities for Small Business Administration debt securities and mortgage-backed securities anticipate future prepayments. \nThe carrying value of our investment securities portfolio was $5.5 billion as of December 31, 2018, a decrease of $671.1 million or 11% compared to December 31, 2017. As of December 31, 2018, our investment securities portfolio was comprised of securities with an average base duration of approximately 3.4 years.\nWe continually evaluate our investment securities portfolio in response to established asset/liability management objectives, changing market conditions that could affect profitability, and the level of interest rate risk to which we are exposed. These evaluations may cause us to change the level of funds we deploy into investment securities, change the composition of our investment securities portfolio, and change the proportion of investments made into the available-for-sale and held-to-maturity investment categories.\nIn 2018, we reduced our positions primarily in mortgage-backed securities, municipal debt securities, and corporate debt securities. We re-invested these proceeds primarily into higher yielding loan products. Ginnie Mae mortgage-backed securities continue to be the largest concentration in our portfolio. As of December 31, 2018, our portfolio of Ginnie Mae mortgage-backed securities was primarily comprised of securities issued in 2008 or later. As of December 31, 2018, these mortgage-backed securities were all AAA-rated, with a low probability of a change in their credit ratings in the near future. As of December 31, 2018, our available-for-sale investment securities portfolio was comprised of securities with an average base duration of approximately 2.3 years.\nGross unrealized gains in our investment securities portfolio were $21.2 million as of December 31, 2018 and $36.6 million as of December 31, 2017. Gross unrealized losses on our temporarily impaired investment securities were $103.5 million as of December 31, 2018 and $73.9 million as of December 31, 2017. The gross unrealized loss positions were primarily related to mortgage-backed securities issued by Ginnie Mae, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, and corporate debt securities. See Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information.\nAs of December 31, 2018, included in our investment securities portfolio were debt securities issued by political subdivisions within the State of Hawaii of $451.1 million, representing 56% of the total fair value of the Company's municipal debt securities. Of the entire Hawaii municipal bond portfolio, 96% were credit-rated Aa2 or better by Moody's while the remaining Hawaii municipal bonds were credit-rated A1 or better by at least one nationally recognized statistical rating organization. Also, approximately 79% of the Company's Hawaii municipal bond holdings were general obligation issuances. As of December 31, 2018, there were no other holdings of municipal debt securities that were issued by a single state or political subdivision which comprised more than 10% of the total fair value of the Company's municipal debt securities.\nThe Company's corporate bond holdings as of December 31, 2018 had a fair value of $318.7 million. Of this total, $95.5 million or 30% was fully guaranteed by the Export-Import Bank of the United States, an agency of the U.S. government. Of the remaining $223.2 million of corporate bonds, 49% were credit-rated A or better by Standard & Poor's while all of the remaining corporate bonds were credit-rated A- or better by at least one nationally recognized statistical rating organization.\nLoans and Leases\nTable 8 presents the composition of our loan and lease portfolio by major categories.\n\n1 Comprised of other revolving credit, installment, and lease financing.\nTotal loans and leases were $10.4 billion as of December 31, 2018. This represents a $0.7 billion or 7% increase from December 31, 2017 primarily due to growth in our consumer lending portfolio.\nThe commercial loan and lease portfolio is comprised of commercial and industrial loans, commercial mortgages, construction loans, and lease financing. Commercial and industrial loans are made primarily to corporations, middle market, and small businesses for the purpose of financing equipment acquisition, expansion, working capital, and other general business purposes. Commercial mortgages and construction loans are offered to real estate investors, developers, and builders primarily domiciled in Hawaii. Commercial mortgages are secured by first mortgages on commercial real estate at loan-to-value ratios generally not exceeding 75%. The commercial properties are predominantly developments such as retail centers, apartments, industrial properties, and to a lesser extent, specialized properties such as hotels. The primary source of repayment for investor property is cash flow from the property and for owner-occupied property is the operating cash flow from the business. Construction loans are for the purchase or construction of a property for which repayment will be generated by the property. We classify loans as construction until the completion of the construction phase. Following construction, if a loan is retained, the loan is reclassified to the commercial mortgage category. Lease financing consists of direct financing leases and leveraged leases and are used by commercial customers to finance capital purchases. Although our primary market is Hawaii, the commercial portfolio contains loans to some borrowers based on the U.S. Mainland, including some Shared National Credits.\nCommercial loans and leases were $4.0 billion as of December 31, 2018, an increase of $213.3 million or 6% from December 31, 2017. Commercial and industrial loans increased by $51.8 million or 4% from December 31, 2017. Commercial mortgage loans increased by $198.4 million or 9% from December 31, 2017 primarily due to continued demand from new and existing customers as the Hawaii economy continues to be strong. Construction loans decreased by $32.2 million or 16% from December 31, 2017 primarily due to paydowns and successful completion of construction projects such as condominiums and low-income housing, partially offset by increased activity in our portfolio.\nThe consumer loan and lease portfolio is comprised of residential mortgage loans, home equity lines and loans, indirect auto loans and leases, and other consumer loans including personal credit lines, direct installment loans, and rewards-based consumer credit cards. These products are generally offered in the geographic markets we serve. Although we offer a variety of products, our residential mortgage loan portfolio is primarily comprised of fixed-rate loans concentrated in Hawaii. We also offer a variety of home equity lines and loans, usually secured by second mortgages on residential property of the borrower. Automobile lending activities include loans and leases secured by new or used automobiles. We originate automobile loans and leases on an indirect basis through selected dealerships. Direct installment loans are generally unsecured and are often used for personal expenses or for debt consolidation.\nConsumer loans and leases were $6.5 billion as of December 31, 2018, an increase of $438.5 million or 7% from December 31, 2017. Residential mortgage loans increased by $207.0 million or 6% from December 31, 2017 primarily due to a relatively constant level of loan originations combined with a slowdown in payoff activity. Automobile loans increased by $129.7 million or 25% from December 31, 2017 primarily driven by steady automobile loan demand and competitive loan programs. Home equity lines and loans increased by $96.0 million or 6% from December 31, 2017 as a result of continued loan demand in light of a healthy Hawaii economy and stable real estate market conditions. Additionally, utilization on new and existing home equity lines was strong during 2018.\nSee Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements and the Corporate Risk Profile - Credit Risk\u201d section of MD&A for more information on our loan and lease portfolio.\nTable 9 presents the geographic distribution of our loan and lease portfolio.\n\n 1 For secured loans and leases, classification as U.S. Mainland is made based on where the collateral is located. For unsecured loans and leases, classification as U.S. Mainland is made based on the location where the majority of the borrower's business operations are conducted. \n 2 Loans classified as Foreign represent those which are recorded in the Company's international business units. \n 3 Comprised of other revolving credit, installment, and lease financing. \nOur commercial and consumer lending activities are concentrated primarily in Hawaii and the Pacific Islands. Our commercial loan and lease portfolio to borrowers based on the U.S. Mainland includes leveraged lease financing and participation in Shared National Credits. Our consumer loan and lease portfolio includes limited lending activities on the U.S. Mainland.\nOur Hawaii loan and lease portfolio increased by $499.5 million or 6% from December 31, 2017, reflective of a healthy Hawaii economy.\nTable 10 presents a maturity distribution for selected loan categories.\n\n1 Based on contractual maturities.\n2 As of December 31, 2018, loans maturing after one year consisted of $633.2 million in variable rate loans and $473.8 million in fixed rate loans.\nGoodwill\nGoodwill was $31.5 million as of December 31, 2018 and 2017. As of December 31, 2018, based on our qualitative assessment, there were no reporting units where we believed it was more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit was less than its carrying amount, including goodwill. As a result, we had no reporting units where there was a reasonable possibility of failing Step 1 of the goodwill impairment test. See Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information on our goodwill impairment policy.\nOther Assets\nOther assets were $230.9 million as of December 31, 2018, a decrease of $21.7 million or 9% from December 31, 2017. This decrease was primarily due to a $30.3 million decrease in accounts receivable, which was primarily due to a $20.0 million decrease related to the settlement of a matured security coupled with a $16.4 million early buy-out on an equipment lease in the first quarter of 2018. These decreases were partially offset by a $7.8 million increase in other assets. The fair value of our interest rate swap agreements increased by $3.6 million, which is affected by prevailing interest rates. In addition, dealer advances increased by $3.3 million. See Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information on the composition of our other assets.\nDeposits\nTable 11 presents the components of our deposits by major customer categories as of December 31, 2018 and 2017.\n\nTotal deposits were $15.0 billion as of December 31, 2018, a $143.3 million or 1% increase from December 31, 2017. This increase was primarily due to a $248.5 million increase in consumer deposits due to an increase in time deposits and core deposits of $237.3 million and $11.2 million respectively. In addition, commercial deposits increased by $124.4 million primarily due to a $95.1 million increase in core deposits and a $29.3 million increase in time deposits. These increases were partially offset by a $230.0 million decrease in public and other deposits largely due to the strategic decision to reduce public time deposits.\nTable 12 presents the components of our savings deposits as of December 31, 2018 and 2017.\n\nSecurities Sold Under Agreements to Repurchase\nTable 13 presents the composition of our securities sold under agreements to repurchase.\n\nSecurities sold under agreements to repurchase as of December 31, 2018 remained relatively unchanged from December 31, 2017. As of December 31, 2018, the weighted-average maturity was 133 days for our repurchase agreements with government entities and 2.6 years for our repurchase agreements with private institutions. Some of our repurchase agreements with private institutions may be terminated at earlier specified dates by the private institution or in some cases by either the private institution or the Company. If all such agreements were to terminate at the earliest possible date, the weighted-average maturity for our repurchase agreements with private institutions would decrease to 2.0 years. As of December 31, 2018 and 2017, the weighted-average interest rate for repurchase agreements with government entities was 1.19% and 0.61%, respectively, while the weighted-average interest rate for repurchase agreements with private institutions as of December 31, 2018 and 2017 was 3.64%, with all rates being fixed. Each of our repurchase agreements is accounted for as collateralized financing arrangements (i.e., a secured borrowing) and not as a sale and subsequent repurchase of securities. See Note 9 and 19 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information.\nOther Debt\nOther debt was $135.6 million as of December 31, 2018, a decrease of $125.1 million or 48% from December 31, 2017. This decrease was primarily due to seven FHLB advances totaling $175.0 million which matured during 2018. As of December 31, 2018, this balance was mainly comprised of $125.0 million in FHLB advances with a weighted-average interest rate of 1.93% and maturity dates ranging from 2019 to 2020. These advances were primarily for asset/liability management purposes. As of December 31, 2018, our remaining line of credit with the FHLB was $2.2 billion.\nPension and Postretirement Plan Obligations\nRetirement benefits payable were $40.5 million as of December 31, 2018, an $3.2 million or 9% increase from December 31, 2017. Our pension and postretirement benefit obligations and net periodic benefit cost are actuarially determined based on a number of key assumptions, including the discount rate, the expected return on plan assets, and the health-care cost trend rate. The accounting for pension and postretirement benefit plans reflect the long-term nature of the obligations and the investment horizon of the plan assets. The increase in retirement benefits payable was primarily due to a net investment loss on assets during the year.\nThe discount rate is used to determine the present value of future benefit obligations and the net periodic benefit cost. The discount rate used to value the present value of future benefit obligations as of each year-end is the rate used to estimate the net periodic benefit cost for the following year. Table 14 presents a sensitivity analysis of a 25 basis point change in discount rates to the pension and postretirement benefit plan's net periodic benefit cost and benefit obligations:\n\nSee Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information on our pension and postretirement benefit plans.\nForeign Activities\nCross-border outstandings are defined as loans (including accrued interest), acceptances, interest-bearing deposits with other banks, other interest-bearing investments, and any other monetary assets which are denominated in dollars or other non-local currency. As of December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, we did not have cross-border outstandings to any foreign country which exceeded 0.75% of our total assets.\nCorporate Risk Profile\nManaging risk is an essential part of successfully operating our business. Management believes that the most prominent risk exposures for the Company are credit risk, market risk, liquidity risk management, capital management, and operational risk.\nCredit Risk\nCredit risk is the risk that borrowers or counterparties will be unable or unwilling to repay their obligations in accordance with the underlying contractual terms. We manage and control credit risk in the loan and lease portfolio by adhering to well-defined underwriting criteria and account administration standards established by management. Written credit policies document underwriting standards, approval levels, exposure limits, and other limits or standards deemed necessary and prudent. Portfolio diversification at the obligor, industry, product, and/or geographic location levels is actively managed to mitigate concentration risk. In addition, credit risk management also includes an independent credit review process that assesses compliance with commercial and consumer credit policies, risk ratings, and other critical credit information. In addition to implementing risk management practices that are based upon established and sound lending practices, we adhere to sound credit principles. We understand and evaluate our customers' borrowing needs and capacity to repay, in conjunction with their character and history.\nCommercial and industrial loans are made primarily for the purpose of financing equipment acquisition, expansion, working capital, and other general business purposes. Lease financing consists of direct financing leases and leveraged leases that are used by commercial customers to finance capital purchases ranging from computer equipment to transportation equipment. The credit decisions for these transactions are based upon an assessment of the overall financial capacity of the applicant. A determination is made as to the applicant's ability to repay in accordance with the proposed terms as well as an overall assessment of the risks involved. In addition to an evaluation of the applicant's financial condition, a determination is made of the probable adequacy of the primary and secondary sources of repayment, such as additional collateral or personal guarantees, to be relied upon in the transaction. Credit agency reports of the applicant's credit history supplement the analysis of the applicant's creditworthiness.\nCommercial mortgages and construction loans are offered to real estate investors, developers, builders, and owner-occupants primarily domiciled in Hawaii. These loans are secured by first mortgages on real estate at loan-to-value ( LTV\u201d) ratios deemed appropriate based on the property type, location, overall quality, and sponsorship. Generally, these LTV ratios do not exceed 75%. The commercial properties are predominantly developments such as retail centers, apartments, industrial properties and, to a lesser extent, more specialized properties such as hotels. Substantially our entire commercial mortgage loans are secured by properties located in our primary market area.\nIn the underwriting of our commercial mortgage loans, we obtain appraisals for the underlying properties. Decisions to lend are based on the economic fundamentals of the property and the creditworthiness of the borrower. In evaluating a proposed commercial mortgage loan, we primarily emphasize the ratio of the property's projected net cash flows to the loan's debt service requirement. The debt service coverage ratio normally is not less than 120% and it is computed after deducting for a vacancy factor and property expenses as appropriate. In addition, a personal guarantee of the loan or a portion thereof is sometimes required from the principal(s) of the borrower. We typically require title insurance insuring the priority of our lien, fire, and extended coverage casualty insurance, and flood insurance, if appropriate, in order to protect our security interest in the underlying property. In addition, business interruption insurance or other insurance may be required. Owner-occupant commercial mortgage loans are underwritten based upon the cash flow of the business provided that the real estate asset is utilized in the operation of the business. Real estate is evaluated independently as a secondary source of repayment. As noted above, LTV ratios generally do not exceed 75%.\nConstruction loans are underwritten against projected cash flows derived from rental income, business income from an owner-occupant, or the sale of the property to an end-user. We may mitigate the risks associated with these types of loans by requiring fixed-price construction contracts, performance and payment bonding, controlled disbursements, and pre-sale contracts or pre-lease agreements.\nWe offer a variety of first mortgage and junior lien loans to consumers within our markets with residential home mortgages comprising our largest loan category. These loans are generally secured by a primary residence and are underwritten using traditional underwriting systems to assess the credit risks and financial capacity and repayment ability of the consumer. Decisions are primarily based on LTV ratios, debt-to-income ( DTI\u201d) ratios, liquidity, and credit scores. LTV ratios generally do not exceed 80%, although higher levels are permitted with mortgage insurance. We offer variable rate mortgage loans with interest rates that are subject to change every year after the first, third, fifth, or seventh year, depending on the product and are based on the London Interbank Offered Rate ( LIBOR\u201d). Variable rate mortgage loans are underwritten at fully-indexed interest rates. We do not offer payment-option facilities, sub-prime or Alt-A loans, or any product with negative amortization. We selectively offer interest-only mortgage loans to Private Banking clients.\u201d\nHome equity loans are secured by both first and second liens on residential property of the borrower. The underwriting terms for the home equity product generally permits borrowing availability, in the aggregate, up to 85% of the value of the collateral property at the time of origination. We offer fixed and variable rate home equity loans, with variable rate loans underwritten at fully-indexed interest rates. Our procedures for underwriting home equity loans include an assessment of an applicant's overall financial capacity and repayment ability. Decisions are primarily based on LTV ratios, DTI ratios, and credit scores. Maximum amount and LTVs are determined by collateral value and channel.\nAutomobile lending activities include loans and leases secured by new or used automobiles. We originate automobile loans and leases on an indirect basis through selected dealerships in Hawaii, Guam and Saipan. Our procedures for underwriting automobile loans include an assessment of an applicant's overall financial capacity and repayment ability, credit history, and the ability to meet existing obligations and payments on the proposed loan. Although an applicant's creditworthiness is the primary consideration, the underwriting process also includes a comparison of the value of the collateral security to the proposed loan amount. We require borrowers to maintain full coverage automobile insurance on automobile loans and leases, with the Bank listed as either the loss payee or additional insured.\nGeneral economic conditions in Hawaii remained healthy during 2018, led by a strong tourism industry, relatively low unemployment, rising real estate prices, and an active construction industry. Our overall credit risk position reflects these positive economic trends and our loan portfolio growth and composition.\nNon-Performing Assets and Accruing Loans and Leases Past Due 90 Days or More\nTable 15 presents a five-year history of non-performing assets and accruing loans and leases past due 90 days or more.\n\n1 Comprised of other revolving credit, installment, and lease financing.\nTable 16 presents the activity in Non-Performing Assets ( NPAs\u201d) for 2018:\n\nNPAs consist of non-accrual loans and leases, and foreclosed real estate. Changes in the level of non-accrual loans and leases typically represent increases for loans and leases that reach a specified past due status, offset by reductions for loans and leases that are charged-off, paid down, sold, transferred to foreclosed real estate, or are no longer classified as non-accrual because they have returned to accrual status.\nTotal NPAs were $12.9 million as of December 31, 2018, a decrease of $3.2 million or 20% from December 31, 2017. The decrease was experienced primarily in the consumer lending portfolio. The ratio of our NPAs to total loans and leases, and foreclosed real estate was 0.12% as of December 31, 2018 and 0.16% as of December 31, 2017.\nCommercial mortgage non-accrual loans increased by $0.6 million or 46% from December 31, 2017 primarily due to the addition of one loan. Although three loans were removed, the one loan addition has an amount greater than the three loans combined. We have individually evaluated the two commercial mortgage non-accrual loans for impairment and have no cumulative net charge-offs.\nCommercial and industrial non-accrual loans increased by $0.1 million or 21% from December 31, 2017 due to the addition of two loans. We have evaluated the two borrowers for impairment and have recorded a $0.2 million partial charge-off in 2018. As of December 31, 2018, the non-accrual balance in this category was comprised of six commercial borrowers.\nThe largest component of our NPAs continues to be residential mortgage loans. Residential mortgage non-accrual loans decreased by $3.9 million or 42% from December 31, 2017 primarily due to paydowns and payoffs. In addition, three loans modified in a troubled debt restructuring ( TDR\u201d) were returned to accrual status. As of December 31, 2018, our residential mortgage non-accrual loans were comprised of 21 loans with a weighted average current LTV ratio of 57%.\nForeclosed real estate represents property acquired as the result of borrower defaults on loans. Foreclosed real estate is recorded at fair value, less estimated selling costs, at the time of foreclosure. On an ongoing basis, properties are appraised as required by market conditions and applicable regulations. Foreclosed real estate increased by $0.3 million or 30% from December 31, 2017 primarily due to the addition of two residential properties as of December 31, 2018.\nLoans and Leases Past Due 90 Days or More and Still Accruing Interest\nLoans and leases in this category are 90 days or more past due, as to principal or interest, and are still accruing interest because they are well secured and in the process of collection. Loans and leases past due 90 days or more and still accruing interest were $6.6 million as of December 31, 2018, a $0.6 million or 8% decrease from December 31, 2017. This decrease was primarily in our other and automobile portfolios, which was offset by an increase in the home equity portfolio.\nImpaired Loans\nImpaired loans are defined as loans for which we believe it is probable we will not collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement. Included in impaired loans are all classes of commercial non-accruing loans (except lease financing and small business loans), all loans modified in a TDR (including accruing TDRs), and other loans where we believe that we will be unable to collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement. Impaired loans exclude lease financing and smaller balance homogeneous loans (consumer and small business non-accruing loans) that are collectively evaluated for impairment. Impaired loans were $54.6 million as of December 31, 2018 and $61.2 million as of December 31, 2017, and had a related Allowance of $4.0 million as of December 31, 2018 and $3.9 million as of December 31, 2017. The change in impaired loans was primarily due to the decrease in impaired Commercial Mortgage, Commercial and Industrial, and Residential Mortgage loans, which was partially offset by the increase in impaired Automobile, and Home Equity loans. As of December 31, 2018, we recorded cumulative net charge-offs of $7.6 million related to our total impaired loans. Our impaired loans are considered in management's assessment of the overall adequacy of the Allowance.\nIf interest due on the balances of all non-accrual loans as of December 31, 2018 had been accrued under the original terms, approximately $0.8 million in total interest income would have been recorded in 2018, compared to less than $0.1 million actually recorded as interest income on those loans.\nLoans Modified in a Troubled Debt Restructuring\nTable 17 presents information on loans whose terms have been modified in a TDR:\n\n1 Comprised of other revolving credit and installment financing.\nLoans modified in a TDR decreased by $6.1 million from December 31, 2017. The decrease was primarily due to the full repayments of commercial mortgage loans during the second quarter of 2018. Residential mortgage loans remain our largest TDR loan class. As of December 31, 2018, $48.7 million or 90% of loans modified in a TDR were performing in accordance with their modified contractual terms and were on accrual status.\nGenerally, loans modified in a TDR are returned to accrual status after the borrower has demonstrated performance under the modified terms by making at least six consecutive payments. See Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a description of the modification programs that we currently offer to our customers.\nReserve for Credit Losses\nThe Company's reserve for credit losses is comprised of two components, the Allowance and the reserve for unfunded commitments (the Unfunded Reserve\u201d). Table 18 presents the activity in the Company's reserve for credit losses for the years ended December 31: \n 1 Comprised of other revolving credit, installment, and lease financing. \n 2 Included in this analysis is activity related to the Company's reserve for unfunded commitments, which is separately recorded in other liabilities in the consolidated statements of condition. \nAllowance for Loan and Lease Losses\nTable 19 presents the allocation of the Allowance by loan and lease category.\n\n\n1 Comprised of other revolving credit, installment, and lease financing.\nAs of December 31, 2018, the Allowance was $106.7 million or 1.02% of total loans and leases outstanding, compared with an Allowance of $107.3 million or 1.10% of total loans and leases outstanding as of December 31, 2017. The level of the Allowance was commensurate with the Company's stable credit risk profile, loan portfolio growth and composition, and a healthy Hawaii economy.\nNet charge-offs of loans and leases were $14.1 million or 0.14% of total average loans and leases in 2018 compared to $13.8 million or 0.15% of total average loans and leases in 2017. Net charge-offs in our consumer portfolios were $14.6 million in 2018 compared to $13.9 million in 2017. This increase was primarily reflected in our credit card portfolio, which was sold on November 1, 2018, our home equity portfolio due to lower recoveries, as well as overdrafts. Net recoveries in our commercial portfolios were $0.5 million in 2018 compared to net recoveries of $0.1 million in 2017.\nAlthough we determine the amount of each component of the Allowance separately, the Allowance as a whole was considered appropriate by management as of December 31, 2018 based on our ongoing analysis of estimated probable credit losses, credit risk profiles, economic conditions, coverage ratios, and other relevant factors.\nThe allocation of the Allowance to our commercial portfolio segment increased by $1.1 million or 2% from December 31, 2017. This increase was primarily due to a $1.7 million increase in the Allowance allocated to the commercial and industrial portfolio due to loan growth. The increase was offset by a $0.7 million decrease in the Allowance allocated to the construction portfolio due to the completion of major construction projects and the resultant decline in construction outstandings.\nThe allocation of the Allowance to our consumer portfolio segment decreased by $1.7 million or 4% from December 31, 2017 and is consistent with current asset quality metrics and economic conditions.\nSee Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information on the Allowance and credit quality indicators.\nReserve for Unfunded Commitments\nThe Unfunded Reserve was $6.8 million as of December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017. The process used to determine the Unfunded Reserve is consistent with the process for determining the Allowance, as adjusted for estimated funding probabilities.\nOther Credit Risks\nIn the normal course of business, we serve the needs of state and political subdivisions in multiple capacities, including traditional banking products such as deposit services, and by investing in municipal debt securities. The carrying value of our municipal debt securities was $798.6 million as of December 31, 2018 and $865.5 million as of December 31, 2017. We also maintained investments in corporate bonds with a carrying value of $320.4 million as of December 31, 2018 and $385.7 million as of December 31, 2017. We are exposed to credit risk in these investments should the issuer of a security be unable to meet its financial obligations. This may result in the issuer failing to make scheduled interest payments and/or being unable to repay the principal upon maturity. See the Analysis of Statements of Condition - Investment Securities\u201d section in MD&A for more information.\nOur use of derivative financial instruments has been very limited in recent years. However, these financial instruments do expose the Company to counterparty credit risk. See Note 17 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information.\nMarket Risk\nMarket risk is the potential of loss arising from adverse changes in interest rates and prices. We are exposed to market risk as a consequence of the normal course of conducting our business activities. Our market risk management process involves measuring, monitoring, controlling, and mitigating risks that can significantly impact our statements of income and condition. In this management process, market risks are balanced with expected returns in an effort to enhance earnings performance while limiting volatility.\nOur primary market risk exposure is interest rate risk.\nInterest Rate Risk\nThe objective of our interest rate risk management process is to maximize net interest income while operating within acceptable limits established for interest rate risk and maintaining adequate levels of funding and liquidity. The potential cash flows, sales, or replacement value of many of our assets and liabilities, especially those that earn or pay interest, are sensitive to changes in the general level of interest rates. This interest rate risk arises primarily from our core business activities of extending loans and accepting deposits. Our investment securities portfolio is also subject to significant interest rate risk.\nMany factors affect our exposure to changes in interest rates, such as general economic and financial conditions, customer preferences, historical pricing relationships, and repricing characteristics of financial instruments. Our earnings are affected not only by general economic conditions but also by the monetary and fiscal policies of the U.S. and its agencies, particularly the Federal Reserve Bank (the FRB\u201d). The monetary policies of the FRB can influence the overall growth of loans, investment securities, and deposits and the level of interest rates earned on assets and paid for liabilities.\nIn managing interest rate risk, we, through the Asset/Liability Management Committee ( ALCO\u201d), measure short and long-term sensitivities to changes in interest rates. The ALCO, which is comprised of members of executive management, utilizes several techniques to manage interest rate risk, which include:\n \u2022 adjusting the statement of condition mix or altering the interest rate characteristics of assets and liabilities; \n \u2022 changing product pricing strategies; \n \u2022 modifying characteristics of the investment securities portfolio; and \n \u2022 using derivative financial instruments. \nOur use of derivative financial instruments, as detailed in Note 17 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, has generally been limited. This is due to natural on-balance sheet hedges arising out of offsetting interest rate exposures from loans and investment securities with deposits and other interest-bearing liabilities. In particular, the investment securities portfolio is utilized to manage the interest rate exposure and sensitivity to within the guidelines and limits established by the ALCO. We utilize natural and offsetting economic hedges in an effort to reduce the need to employ off-balance sheet derivative financial instruments to hedge interest rate risk exposures. Expected movements in interest rates are also considered in managing interest rate risk. Thus, as interest rates change, we may use different techniques to manage interest rate risk.\nA key element in our ongoing process to measure and monitor interest rate risk is the utilization of an asset/liability simulation model that attempts to capture the dynamic nature of the statement of condition. The model is used to estimate and measure the statement of condition sensitivity to changes in interest rates. These estimates are based on assumptions about the behavior of loan and deposit pricing, repayment rates on mortgage-based assets, and principal amortization and maturities on other financial instruments. The model's analytics include the effects of standard prepayment options on mortgages and customer withdrawal options for deposits. While such assumptions are inherently uncertain, we believe that our assumptions are reasonable.\nWe utilize net interest income simulations to analyze short-term income sensitivities to changes in interest rates. Table 20 presents, for the twelve months subsequent to December 31, 2018 and 2017, an estimate of the change in net interest income that would result from a gradual and immediate change in interest rates, moving in a parallel fashion over the entire yield curve, relative to the measured base case scenario. The base case scenario assumes the statement of condition and interest rates are generally unchanged. Based on our net interest income simulation as of December 31, 2018, net interest income is expected to increase as interest rates rise. This is due in part to our strategy to maintain a relatively short investment portfolio duration. In addition, rising interest rates would drive higher rates on loans and investment securities, as well as induce a slower pace of premium amortization on certain securities within our investment portfolio. However, lower interest rates would likely cause a decline in net interest income as lower rates would lead to lower yields on loans and investment securities, as well as drive higher premium amortization on existing investment securities. Based on our net interest income simulation as of December 31, 2018, net interest income sensitivity to changes in interest rates for the twelve months subsequent to December 31, 2018 was slightly less sensitive in comparison to the sensitivity profile for the twelve months subsequent to December 31, 2017.\n\nTo analyze the impact of changes in interest rates in a more realistic manner, non-parallel interest rate scenarios are also simulated. These non-parallel interest rate scenarios indicate that net interest income may decrease from the base case scenario should the yield curve flatten or become inverted for a period of time. Conversely, if the yield curve were to steepen, net interest income may increase.\nOther Market Risks\nIn addition to interest rate risk, we are exposed to other forms of market risk in our normal business transactions. Foreign currency and foreign exchange contracts expose us to a small degree of foreign currency risk. These transactions are primarily executed on behalf of customers. Our trust and asset management income is at risk to fluctuations in the market values of underlying assets, particularly debt and equity securities. Also, our share-based compensation expense is dependent on the fair value of our stock options, restricted stock units, and restricted stock at the date of grant. The fair value of stock options, restricted stock units, and restricted stock is impacted by the market price of the Parent's common stock on the date of grant and is at risk to changes in equity markets, general economic conditions, and other factors.\nLiquidity Risk Management\nThe objective of our liquidity risk management process is to manage cash flow and liquidity in an effort to provide continuous access to sufficient, reasonably priced funds. Funding requirements are impacted by loan originations and refinancings, deposit balance changes, liability issuances and settlements, and off-balance sheet funding commitments. We consider and comply with various regulatory guidelines regarding required liquidity levels and periodically monitor our liquidity position in light of the changing economic environment and customer activity. Based on periodic liquidity assessments, we may alter our asset, liability, and off-balance sheet positions. The ALCO monitors sources and uses of funds and modifies asset and liability positions as liquidity requirements change. This process, combined with our ability to raise funds in money and capital markets and through private placements, provides flexibility in managing the exposure to liquidity risk.\nIn an effort to satisfy our liquidity needs, we actively manage our assets and liabilities. We have access to immediate liquid resources in the form of cash which is primarily on deposit with the FRB. Potential sources of liquidity also include investment securities in our available-for-sale securities portfolio, our ability to sell loans in the secondary market, and to secure borrowings from the FRB and FHLB. Our held-to-maturity securities, while not intended for sale, may also be utilized in repurchase agreements to obtain funding. Our core deposits have historically provided us with a long-term source of stable and relatively lower cost source of funding. Additional funding is available through the issuance of long-term debt or equity.\nMaturities and payments on outstanding loans and investment securities also provide a steady flow of funds. Liquidity is further enhanced by our ability to pledge loans to access secured borrowings from the FHLB and FRB. As of December 31, 2018, we could have borrowed an additional $2.2 billion from the FHLB and an additional $538.5 million from the FRB based on the amount of collateral pledged.\nWe continued our focus on maintaining a strong liquidity position throughout 2018. As of December 31, 2018, cash and cash equivalents were $526.0 million, the carrying value of our available-for-sale investment securities was $2.0 billion, and total deposits were $15.0 billion. As of December 31, 2018, our available-for-sale investment securities portfolio was comprised of securities with an average base duration of approximately 2.3 years.\nCapital Management\nWe actively manage capital, commensurate with our risk profile, in our efforts to enhance shareholder value. We also seek to maintain capital levels for the Company and the Bank at amounts in excess of the regulatory well-capitalized\u201d thresholds. Periodically, we may respond to market conditions by implementing changes to our overall balance sheet positioning to manage our capital position.\nThe Company and the Bank are each subject to regulatory capital requirements administered by the federal banking agencies. Failure to meet minimum capital requirements could cause certain mandatory and discretionary actions by regulators that, if undertaken, would likely have a material effect on our financial statements. Under capital adequacy guidelines and the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action, the Company and the Bank must meet specific capital guidelines that involve quantitative and qualitative measures. These measures were established by regulation intended to ensure capital adequacy. As of December 31, 2018, the Company's capital levels remained characterized as well-capitalized.\u201d The Company's regulatory capital ratios are presented in Table 21 below. There have been no conditions or events since December 31, 2018 that management believes have changed either the Company's or the Bank's capital classifications.\nAs of December 31, 2018, shareholders' equity was $1.3 billion, an increase of $36.3 million or 3% from December 31, 2017. Earnings for 2018 of $219.6 million, common stock issuances of $7.9 million, and share-based compensation of $8.1 million were offset by cash dividends paid of $98.5 million, common stock repurchases of $92.0 million, and other comprehensive loss of $8.9 million. In 2018, included in the amount of common stock repurchased were 1,079,397 shares repurchased under our share repurchase program. These shares were repurchased at an average cost per share of $81.80 and a total cost of $88.3 million. From the beginning of our share repurchase program in July 2001 through December 31, 2018, we repurchased a total of 55.3 million shares of common stock and returned total over $2.1 billion to our shareholders at an average cost of $39.14 per share.\nIn January 2019, the Parent's Board of Directors increased the authorization under the share repurchase program by an additional $130.0 million. From January 1, 2019 through February 15, 2019, the Parent repurchased an additional 298,500 shares of common stock at an average cost of $75.46 per share and a total cost of $22.5 million. Remaining buyback authority was $139.2 million as of February 15, 2019. The actual amount and timing of future share repurchases, if any, will depend on market and economic conditions, regulatory rules, applicable SEC rules, and various other factors.\nIn January 2019, the Parent's Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.62 per share on the Parent's outstanding shares. The dividend will be payable on March 14, 2019 to shareholders of record at the close of business on February 28, 2019.\nTable 21 presents a five-year history of activities and balances in our capital accounts, along with key capital ratios.\n\n1 Includes unrealized gains and losses on available-for-sale investment securities, minimum pension liability adjustments, and common stock issuances under share-based compensation and related tax benefits.\n2 December 31, 2018, 2017, 2016, and 2015 calculated under Basel III rules, which became effective January 1, 2015.\n3 December 31, 2018, 2017, 2016, and 2015 calculated net of deferred tax liabilities.\n4 December 31, 2018, 2017, 2016, and 2015 includes unrealized gains and losses related to the Company's reclassification of available-for-sale investment securities to the held-to-maturity category.\nRegulatory Initiatives Affecting the Banking Industry\nBasel III\nUnder final FRB and FDIC approved rules implementing the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision's capital guidelines for U.S. banks minimum requirements increased for both the quantity and quality of capital held by the Company. The Basel III capital standards substantially revised the risk based capital requirements applicable to bank holding companies and their depository institution subsidiaries, including the definitions and the components of Tier 1 capital and Total Capital, the method of evaluating risk-weighted assets, institutions of a capital conservation buffer, and other matters affecting regulatory capital ratios. Strict eligibility criteria for regulatory capital instruments were also implemented under the rules.\nThe phase-in period for the final rules became effective for the Company on January 1, 2015, with full compliance with all of the final rules' requirements phased in over a multi-year schedule, to be fully implemented earlier this year on January 1, 2019. As of December 31, 2018, the Company's capital levels remained characterized as well-capitalized\u201d under the new rules.\nManagement continues to monitor regulatory developments and their potential impact to the Company's liquidity requirements.\nStress Testing\nEnactment of the Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief, and Consumer Protection Act in May 2018 significantly altered several provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act, including how stress tests are run. Bank holding companies with assets of less than $100 billion, such as the Company, are no longer subject to company-run stress testing requirements in section 165(i)(2) of the Dodd-Frank Act, including publishing a summary of results. At this time, the Company continues to run internal stress tests as a component of our comprehensive risk management and capital planning process.\nDeposit Insurance Fund ( DIF\u201d) Assessment\nIn March 2016, the FDIC approved a final rule that imposes on banks with at least $10 billion in assets, such as the Company, a surcharge of 4.5 cents per $100 of their assessment base, after making certain adjustments. The surcharge became effective for the third quarter of 2016 and the FDIC estimated the surcharge would be imposed for approximately two years. The surcharge took effect at the same time that the regular FDIC insurance assessment rates for all banks declined under a rule adopted by the FDIC in 2011. The surcharge ended on September 30, 2018. A further reduction in assessment rates will occur if and when the FDIC's Deposit Insurance Fund Reserve Ratio reaches 2.0 percent.\nOperational Risk\nOperational risk represents the risk of loss resulting from our operations, including, but not limited to, the risk of fraud by employees or persons outside the Company, errors relating to transaction processing and technology, failure to adhere to compliance requirements, and the risk of cyber attacks. We are also exposed to operational risk through our outsourcing arrangements, and the effect that changes in circumstances or capabilities of our outsourcing vendors can have on our ability to continue to perform operational functions necessary to our business. The risk of loss also includes the potential legal actions that could arise as a result of an operational deficiency or as a result of noncompliance with applicable regulatory standards, adverse business decisions or their implementation, and customer attrition due to potential negative publicity. Operational risk is inherent in all business activities, and management of this risk is important to the achievement of Company goals and objectives.\nOur Operating Risk Committee (the ORC\u201d) provides oversight and assesses the most significant operational risks facing the Company. We have developed a framework that provides for a centralized operating risk management function through the ORC, supplemented by business unit responsibility for managing operational risks specific to their business units. Our internal audit department also validates the system of internal controls through ongoing risk-based audit procedures and reports on the effectiveness of internal controls to executive management and the Audit and Risk Committee of the Board of Directors.\nWe continuously strive to strengthen our system of internal controls to improve the oversight of operational risk.\nWhile our internal controls have been designed to minimize operational risks, there is no assurance that business disruption or operational losses will not occur. On an ongoing basis, management reassesses operational risks, implements appropriate process changes, and invests in enhancements to our systems of internal controls.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements and Guarantees\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe hold interests in several unconsolidated variable interest entities ( VIEs\u201d). These unconsolidated VIEs are primarily low-income housing partnerships and solar energy tax credit partnership investments. Variable interests are defined as contractual ownership or other interests in an entity that change with fluctuations in an entity's net asset value. The primary beneficiary consolidates the VIE. We have determined that the Company is not the primary beneficiary of these entities. As a result, we do not consolidate these VIEs. See discussion of our accounting policy related to VIEs in Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nGuarantees\nWe pool Federal Housing Administration ( FHA\u201d) insured and U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs ( VA\u201d) guaranteed residential mortgage loans for sale to Ginnie Mae. We also sell residential mortgage loans in the secondary market to Fannie Mae. The agreements under which we sell residential mortgage loans to Ginnie Mae or Fannie Mae and the insurance or guaranty agreements with the FHA and VA contain provisions that include various representations and warranties regarding the origination and characteristics of the residential mortgage loans. Although these loans are primarily sold on a non-recourse basis, we may be obligated to repurchase residential mortgage loans or reimburse the respective investor if it is found that required documents were not delivered or were defective.\nWe also service substantially all of the loans we sell to investors in the secondary market. Each agreement under which we act as servicer generally specifies a standard of responsibility for our actions and provides protection against expenses and liabilities incurred by us when acting in compliance with the respective servicing agreements. However, if we commit a material breach of obligations as servicer, we may be subject to various penalties which may include the repurchase of an affected loan or a reimbursement to the respective investor.\nSee discussion of our risks related to representation and warranty provisions as well as our risks related to residential mortgage loan servicing activities in Note 20 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nContractual Obligations\nOur contractual obligations as of December 31, 2018 were as follows:\n\n 1 Our liability for UTBs as of December 31, 2018 was $5.5 million. We were unable to reasonably estimate the period of cash settlement with the respective taxing authority. As a result, our liability for UTBs is not included in this disclosure. \n 2 Amounts only include obligations related to the unfunded non-qualified pension plan and postretirement benefit plan. \nCommitments to extend credit, standby letters of credit, and commercial letters of credit do not necessarily represent future cash requirements in that these commitments often expire without being drawn upon; therefore, these items are not included in the above table (see Note 20 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information). Our non-cancelable operating leases and capital lease obligations are primarily related to branch premises, equipment, and a portion of the Company's headquarters' building with lease terms extending through 2052. Purchase obligations arise from agreements to purchase goods or services that are enforceable and legally binding. Other contracts included in purchase obligations primarily consist of service agreements for various systems and applications supporting bank operations. Pension and postretirement benefit contributions represent the minimum expected contribution to the unfunded non-qualified pension plan and postretirement benefit plan. Actual contributions may differ from these estimates.\nSee discussion of credit, lease, and other contractual commitments in Note 20 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nFuture Application of Accounting Pronouncements\nSee discussion of the expected impact of accounting pronouncements recently issued but that we have not adopted as of December 31, 2018 in Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nSelected Quarterly Consolidated Financial Data\nTable 23 presents our selected quarterly financial data for 2018 and 2017.\n\n 1 The efficiency ratio is defined as noninterest expense divided by total revenue (net interest income and noninterest income). \n 2 The net interest margin is defined as net interest income, on a taxable-equivalent basis, as a percentage of average earning assets. \nFourth Quarter Results and Other Matters\nNet Income\nNet income for the fourth quarter of 2018 was $53.9 million, an increase of $11.0 million or 26% compared to the fourth quarter of 2017. Diluted earnings per share were $1.30 for the fourth quarter of 2018, an increase of $0.29 or 29% compared to the fourth quarter of 2017.\nNet Interest Income\nNet interest income, on a taxable-equivalent basis, for the fourth quarter of 2018 was $125.2 million, an increase of $3.7 million or 3% compared to the fourth quarter of 2017. The increase was primarily due to the shift in the mix of our earning assets to loans, which generally have higher yields. Net interest margin was 3.10% for the fourth quarter of 2018, an increase of 12 basis point compared to the fourth quarter of 2017, primarily due to our loans, which generally have higher yields than our investment securities, comprising a larger percentage of our earning assets compared to 2017. In addition, yields increased for our commercial loans and investment portfolio. Yields on our loan portfolios increased primarily due to higher yields on floating rate loans.\nProvision for Credit Losses\nWe recorded a Provision of $2.0 million in the fourth quarter of 2018 compared to a Provision of $4.3 million recorded in the fourth quarter of 2017, while recording net charge-offs of loans and leases of $4.0 million and $3.8 million in the fourth quarters of 2018 and 2017, respectively. The Provision recorded was based on our determination that the allowance for loan and lease losses should be $106.7 million as of December 31, 2018.\nNoninterest Income\nNoninterest income, other than net gains on sales of investment securities, was $42.9 million in the fourth quarter of 2018, an increase of $0.5 million or 1% compared to the fourth quarter of 2017. This increase was primarily due to fees, exchange, and other service charges of $0.6 million in merchant income, which was recorded as a reduction of other noninterest expense in 2017. This accounting change was related to the 2018 adoption of the new revenue recognition accounting guidance. This increase was partially offset by a $0.4 decrease in mortgage banking income. This decrease was primarily due to reduced sales and margins on sales of conforming saleable loans from current production and from our mortgage loan portfolio.\nNoninterest Expense\nNoninterest expense was $95.9 million in the fourth quarter of 2018, an increase of $3.6 million or 4% compared to the fourth quarter of 2017. Salaries and benefit expense increased by $3.2 million primarily due to a $2.7 million increase in expenses related to our self-insured medical plans, a $2.5 million increase in merit and minimum wage increases, and a $1.0 million increase in separation expense. These increases were partially offset by a $0.9 million decrease in FDIC fees. In addition, during fourth quarter 2017 a one-time $2.2 million holiday bonus, inclusive of payroll taxes was paid.\nProvision for Income Taxes\nThe provision for income taxes was $14.3 million in the fourth quarter of 2018, a decrease of $6.8 million or 32% compared to the fourth quarter of 2017. The effective tax rate for the fourth quarter of 2018 was 20.92% compared with an effective tax rate of 32.93% for the fourth quarter of 2017. The lower effective rate in the fourth quarter of 2018 compared to the same period of 2017 was primarily due to the federal corporate tax rate changing from 35% to 21% as a result of the passage of the Tax Act, which was signed into law on December 22, 2017.\nCommon Stock Repurchase Program\nIn the fourth quarter of 2018, we repurchased 325,377 shares of our common stock under our share repurchase program at an average cost per share of $76.63 and a total cost of $24.9 million.

income taxes resulting from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. \n\n- Net interest income increased 6% in 2018 compared to 2017, driven by loan growth and higher net interest margin. The provision for credit losses decreased from $16.9 million in 2017 to $13.4 million in 2018.\n\n- Noninterest income decreased 9% in 2018 compared to 2017, primarily due to lower mortgage banking income and losses on investment securities.
