MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following discussion should be read in conjunction with our audited consolidated financial statements and related notes and other financial information appearing elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. In addition to historical information, the following discussion and other parts of this Annual Report on Form 10-K contain forward-looking information that involves risks and uncertainties.\nPlease see \u201cRisk Factors\u201d and \u201cSpecial Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\u201d for a discussion of the uncertainties, risks and assumptions associated with these statements.\nOverview Monroe Capital Corporation is an externally managed, closed-end, non-diversified management investment company that has elected to be treated as a business development company (\u201cBDC\u201d) under the 1940 Act. In addition, for tax purposes, we have elected to be treated as a regulated investment company (\u201cRIC\u201d) under the subchapter M of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the \u201cCode\u201d). We were incorporated under the Maryland General Corporation Law on February 9, 2011. We are a specialty finance company focused on providing financing solutions primarily to lower middle-market companies in the United States. We provide customized financing solutions focused primarily on senior secured, junior secured and unitranche (a combination of senior secured and junior secured debt in the same facility in which we syndicate a \u201cfirst out\u201d portion of the loan to an investor and retain a \u201clast out\u201d portion of the loan) debt and, to a lesser extent, unsecured subordinated debt and equity, including equity co-investments in preferred and common stock, and warrants.\nOur shares are currently listed on the NASDAQ Global Select Market under the symbol \u201cMRCC.\u201d\nOur investment objective is to maximize the total return to our stockholders in the form of current income and capital appreciation through investment in senior, unitranche and junior secured debt and, to a lesser extent, subordinated debt and equity investments. We seek to use our extensive leveraged finance origination infrastructure and broad expertise in sourcing loans to invest in primarily senior, unitranche and junior secured debt of middle-market companies. Our investments in senior, unitranche, junior secured debt and other investments generally will range between $2.0 million and $18.0 million each, although this investment size may vary proportionately with the size of our capital base. As of December 31, 2016, our portfolio included approximately 66.7% senior secured debt, 12.5% unitranche secured debt, 14.4% junior secured debt and 6.4% equity securities compared to December 31, 2015, our portfolio included approximately 55.9% senior secured debt, 20.0% unitranche secured debt, 18.6% junior secured debt and 5.5% equity securities. We expect that the companies in which we invest may be leveraged, often as a result of leveraged buy-outs or other recapitalization transactions, and, in certain cases, will not be rated by national ratings agencies. If such companies were rated, we believe that they would typically receive a rating below investment grade (between BB and CCC under the Standard & Poor's system) from the national rating agencies.\nWhile our primary focus is to maximize current income and capital appreciation through debt investments in thinly traded or private U.S. companies, we may invest a portion of the portfolio in opportunistic investments in order to seek to enhance returns to stockholders. Such investments may include investments in high-yield bonds, distressed debt, private equity or securities of public companies that are not thinly traded and securities of middle-market companies located outside of the United States. We expect that these public companies generally will have debt securities that are non-investment grade.\nOn February 28, 2014, our wholly-owned subsidiary, Monroe Capital Corporation SBIC, LP (\u201cMRCC SBIC\u201d), a Delaware limited partnership, received a license from the Small Business Administration (\u201cSBA\u201d) to operate as a Small Business Investment Company (\u201cSBIC\u201d) under Section 301(c) of the Small Business Investment Act of 1958. MRCC SBIC commenced operations on September 16, 2013. As of December 31, 2016, MRCC SBIC had $41.0 million in leveragable capital and $51.5 million in SBA-guaranteed debentures outstanding. See \u201cSBA Debentures\u201d below for more information.\nInvestment income We generate interest income on the debt investments in portfolio company investments that we originate or acquire. Our debt investments, whether in the form of senior, junior or unitranche secured debt, typically have an initial term of three to seven years and bear interest at a fixed or floating rate. In some instances we receive payments on our debt investment based on scheduled amortization of the outstanding balances. In addition, we receive repayments of some of our debt investments prior to their scheduled maturity date. In some cases, our investments provide for deferred interest of payment-in-kind (\u201cPIK\u201d) interest. In addition, we may generate revenue in the form of commitment, origination, amendment, structuring or due diligence fees, fees for providing managerial assistance and consulting fees. Loan origination fees, original issue discount and market discount or premium are capitalized, and we accrete or amortize such amounts as interest income. We record prepayment premiums and prepayment gains (losses) on loans as interest income. As the frequency or volume of the repayments which trigger these prepayment premiums and prepayment gains (losses) may fluctuate significantly from period to period, the associated interest income recorded may also fluctuate significantly from period to period. Interest and fee income is recorded on the accrual basis to the extent we expect to collect such amounts. In addition, we also generate dividend income on preferred equity securities, common equity securities and LLC interests in accordance with our revenue recognition policies.\nExpenses Our primary operating expenses include the payment of fees to MC Advisors under the Investment Advisory and Management Agreement (management and incentive fees), and the payment of fees to Monroe Capital Management Advisors, LLC (\u201cMC Management\u201d) for our allocable portion of overhead and other expenses under the Administration Agreement and other operating costs. See Note 6 to our consolidated financial statements and \u201cRelated Party Transactions\u201d below for additional information on our Investment Advisory and Management Agreement and Administration agreement. Our expenses also include interest expense on our revolving credit facility, our SBA-guaranteed debentures and our secured borrowings. We bear all other out-of-pocket costs and expenses of our operations and transactions.\nNet gain (loss) on investments and secured borrowings We recognize realized gains or losses on investments based on the difference between the net proceeds from the disposition and the cost basis of the investment without regard to unrealized gains or losses previously recognized. We record current period changes in fair value of investments and secured borrowings within net change in unrealized appreciation (depreciation) on investments and net change in unrealized (appreciation) depreciation on secured borrowings, respectively, in the consolidated statements of operations.\nPortfolio and Investment Activity During the year ended December 31, 2016, we invested $105.2 million in 21 new portfolio companies and $42.6 million in 16 existing portfolio companies and had $81.4 million in aggregate amount of sales and principal repayments, resulting in net investments of $66.4 million for the year.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2015, we invested $144.8 million in 24 new portfolio companies and $48.8 million in 16 existing portfolio companies and had $88.4 million in aggregate amount of sales and principal repayments, resulting in net investments of $105.2 million for the year.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2014, we invested $120.4 million in 25 new portfolio companies and $11.8 million in six existing portfolio companies and had $107.1 million in aggregate amount of sales and principal repayments, resulting in net investments of $25.1 million for the year.\nThe following tables show the composition of the investment portfolio (in thousands) and associated yield data:\nTable 158: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>December 31, 2016 </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Fair Value </td> <td> </td> <td>Percentage of\nTotal Portfolio </td> <td> </td> <td>Weighted Average\nAnnualized\nContractual\nCoupon Yield(1) </td> <td> </td> <td>Weighted Average\nAnnualized Effective\nYield(1) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Senior secured loans </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>275,253 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>66.7 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>9.2 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>9.2 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Unitranche loans </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>51,638 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>12.5 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>10.9 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>11.4 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Junior secured loans </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>59,366 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>14.4 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>9.7 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>9.7 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Equity securities </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>26,663 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6.4 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>10.8 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>10.8 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Total </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>412,920 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>100.0 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>9.5 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>9.6 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 159: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>December 31, 2015 </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Fair Value </td> <td> </td> <td>Percentage of\nTotal Portfolio </td> <td> </td> <td>Weighted Average\nAnnualized\nContractual\nCoupon Yield(1) </td> <td> </td> <td>Weighted Average\nAnnualized Effective\nYield(1) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Senior secured loans </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>190,559 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>55.9 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>10.4 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>10.4 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Unitranche loans </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>68,090 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>20.0 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>10.7 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>12.0 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Junior secured loans </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>63,388 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>18.6 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>9.4 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>9.4 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Equity securities </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>19,054 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5.5 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>10.8 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>10.8 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Total </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>341,091 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>100.0 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>10.3 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>10.6 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 160: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>(1) </td> <td>Based upon the par value of our debt investments and the cost basis of our preferred equity investments. </td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe shift in portfolio composition from December 31, 2015 primarily reflects our investment of a substantial portion of the capital from our public offering during the year ended December 31, 2016 into senior secured loan assets. The decline in effective rate reflects the general market yield pressure on new loans originated and acquired during the year ended December 31, 2016 and the shift in portfolio mix toward senior secured loans. Additionally, the placement of our investments in TPP Operating Inc. and Answers Corporation on non-accrual status during the year ended December 31, 2016 contributed to the decline in effective rates.\nThe following table shows the portfolio composition by industry grouping at fair value (dollars in thousands):\nTable 161: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td>

agented and more complex investments. MC Advisors segregates our capital markets investments by industry. The MC Advisors' monitoring process and projections developed by Monroe Capital both have daily, weekly, monthly and quarterly components and related reports, each to evaluate performance against historical, budget and underwriting expectations. MC Advisors' analysts will monitor performance using standard industry software tools to provide consistent disclosure of performance. MC Advisors also monitors our investment exposure using a proprietary trend analysis tool. When necessary, MC Advisors will update our internal risk ratings, borrowing base criteria and covenant compliance reports.\nAs part of the monitoring process, MC Advisors regularly assesses the risk profile of each of our investments and rates each of them based on an internal proprietary system that uses the categories listed below, which we refer to as MC Advisors' investment performance rating. For any investment rated in grades 3, 4 or 5, MC Advisors will increase its monitoring intensity and prepare regular updates for the investment committee, summarizing current operating results and material impending events and suggesting recommended actions. MC Advisors monitors and, when appropriate, changes the investment ratings assigned to each investment in our portfolio. In connection with our valuation process, MC Advisors reviews these investment ratings on a quarterly basis, and our board of directors (the \u201cBoard\u201d) reviews and affirms such ratings. A definition of the rating system follows:\nTable 163: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Investment Performance Risk Rating </td> <td> </td> <td>Summary Description </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Grade 1 </td> <td> </td> <td>Includes investments exhibiting the least amount of risk in our portfolio. The issuer is performing above expectations or the issuer's operating trends and risk factors are generally positive. </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Grade 2 </td> <td> </td> <td>Includes investments exhibiting an acceptable level of risk that is similar to the risk at the time of origination. The issuer is generally performing as expected or the risk factors are neutral to positive. </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Grade 3 </td> <td> </td> <td>Includes investments performing below expectations and indicates that the investment's risk has increased somewhat since origination. The issuer may be out of compliance with debt covenants; however, scheduled loan payments are generally not past due. </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Grade 4 </td> <td> </td> <td>Includes an issuer performing materially below expectations and indicates that the issuer's risk has increased materially since origination. In addition to the issuer being generally out of compliance with debt covenants, scheduled loan payments may be past due (but generally not more than six months past due). For grade 4 investments, we intend to increase monitoring of the issuer. </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 164: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Investment Performance Risk Rating </td> <td> </td> <td>Summary Description </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Grade 5 </td> <td> </td> <td>Indicates that the issuer is performing substantially below expectations and the investment risk has substantially increased since origination. Most or all of the debt covenants are out of compliance or payments are substantially delinquent. Investments graded 5 are not anticipated to be repaid in full and we will reduce the fair market value of the loan to the amount we expect to recover. </td> </tr>\n</table>\nOur investment performance risk ratings do not constitute any rating of investments by a nationally recognized statistical rating organization or reflect or represent any third-party assessment of any of our investments.\nIn the event of a delinquency or a decision to rate an investment grade 4 or grade 5, the applicable analyst, in consultation with a member of the investment committee, will develop an action plan. Such a plan may require a meeting with the borrower's management or the lender group to discuss reasons for the default and the steps management is undertaking to address the under-performance, as well as required amendments and waivers that may be required. In the event of a dramatic deterioration of a credit, MC Advisors intends to form a team or engage outside advisors to analyze, evaluate and take further steps to preserve its value in the credit. In this regard, we would expect to explore all options, including in a private equity sponsored investment, assuming certain responsibilities for the private equity sponsor or a formal sale of the business with oversight of the sale process by us. Several of Monroe Capital's professionals are experienced in running debt work-out transactions and bankruptcies.\nThe following table shows the distribution of our investments on the 1 to 5

The increase in investment income of $7.0 million during the year ended December 31, 2015 is primarily due to an increase in average outstanding loan balances.\nOperating Expenses The composition of our operating expenses was as follows (dollars in thousands):\nTable 169: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>For the years ended\nDecember 31, </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2016 </td> <td> </td> <td>2015 </td> <td> </td> <td>2014 </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Interest and other debt financing expenses </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>6,782 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>5,400 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>4,342 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Base management fees </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6,347 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5,129 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4,091 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Incentive fees, net of incentive fee waiver </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5,504 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4,685 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3,512 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Professional fees </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>988 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>835 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,138 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Administrative service fees </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,287 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,078 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>876 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>General and administrative expenses </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>779 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>799 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>659 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Excise taxes </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>679 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>83 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>70 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Directors fees </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>146 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>148 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>150 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Total expenses, net of incentive fee waiver </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>22,512 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>18,157 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>14,838 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe composition of our interest and other debt financing expenses was as follows (dollars in thousands):\nTable 170: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>For the years ended\nDecember 31, </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2016 </td> <td> </td> <td>2015 </td> <td> </td> <td>2014 </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Interest expense - revolving credit facility </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>4,422 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>3,290 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>3,183 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Interest expense - SBA debentures </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,340 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,080 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>161 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Amortization of deferred financing costs </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>820 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>742 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>576 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Interest expense - secured borrowings </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>123 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>198 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>374 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Other </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>77 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>90 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>48 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Total interest and other debt financing expenses </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>6,782 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>5,400 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>4,342 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe increase in expenses of $4.4 million during the year ended December 31, 2016 is primarily due to an increase in base management fees and incentive fees primarily due to the growth in invested assets. Increases in interest expense also contributed to the increase in expenses during the year ended December 31, 2016 as a result of additional borrowings (including SBA-guaranteed debenture borrowings) required to support the growth of the portfolio. The increase in expenses of $3.3 million during the year ended December 31, 2015 is primarily due to an increase in base management fees due to the growth in invested assets and increased incentive fees resulting from improvement in performance. Increases in interest expense also contributed to the increase in expenses during the year ended December 31, 2015 as a result of additional borrowings (including SBA-guaranteed debentures) required to support the growth of the portfolio.\nNet Realized Gain (Loss) on Investments During the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, we had sales of investments of $0.6 million, $0.4 million and $19.0 million, respectively, resulting in net realized gain (loss) on investments of $0.6 million, $0.3 million and $0.3 million, respectively.\nNet Change in Unrealized Appreciation (Depreciation) on Investments and Secured Borrowings For the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, our investments had $1.3 million, ($1.1) million and ($1.5) million of net change in unrealized appreciation (depreciation), respectively. Net change in unrealized appreciation (depreciation) includes both unrealized appreciation on investments in our portfolio with mark-to-market gains during the year and unrealized depreciation on investments in our portfolio with mark-to-market losses during the year. During the year ended December 31, 2016, one of our portfolio companies, TPP Operating, Inc. (formerly TPP Acquisition, Inc., collectively, \u201cTPP\u201d) filed for bankruptcy and underwent a restructuring process. Net unrealized depreciation on our investments in TPP were $5.1 million and $5.7 million during the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. See Note 5 in our attached consolidated financial statements for additional information on the TPP restructuring and the valuation of these investments. For the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014 our secured borrowings had ($0.1) million, ($0.1) million and $0.1 million of net change in unrealized (appreciation) depreciation, respectively.\nNet Increase (Decrease) in Net Assets Resulting from Operations For the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, we recorded a net increase in net assets resulting from operations of $24.4 million, $17.9 million and $13.9 million, respectively. Based on the weighted average shares of common stock outstanding for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014 our per share net increase in net assets resulting from operations was $1.68, $1.53 and $1.45, respectively. The increase of $6.5 million during the year ended December 31, 2016 is primarily the result of increases in net investment income due to portfolio growth and increases in net unrealized appreciation in the investment portfolio. The increase of $4.0 million during the year ended December 31, 2015 is primarily the result of increases in net investment income due to portfolio growth.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources As of December 31, 2016, we had $6.0 million in cash, $2.4 million in cash at MRCC SBIC, $129.0 million of total debt outstanding on our revolving credit facility and $51.5 million in outstanding\nSBA-guaranteed debentures. We had $31.0 million available for additional borrowings on our revolving credit facility and $63.5 million in available SBA-guaranteed debentures. See \u201cBorrowings\u201d below for additional information.\nCash Flows For the year ended December 31, 2016, we experienced a net decrease in cash and restricted cash of $5.5 million. During the same period we used $51.9 million in operating activities, primarily as a result of purchases of portfolio investments, partially offset by sales of and principal repayments on portfolio investments. During the same year, we generated $46.3 million from financing activities, principally from net proceeds from our capital raises during the period, net borrowings on our revolving credit facility and SBA-guaranteed debenture borrowings, partially offset by distributions to stockholders and decreases in secured borrowings.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2015, we experienced a net increase in cash and restricted cash of $8.1 million. During the same period we used $82.7 million in operating activities, primarily as a result of purchases of portfolio investments, partially offset by sales of and principal repayments on portfolio investments. During the same period, we generated $90.8 million from financing activities, principally from net proceeds from our capital raises during the period, net borrowings on our revolving credit facility and SBA-guaranteed debenture borrowings, partially offset by distributions to stockholders and decreases in secured borrowings.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2014, we experienced a net decrease in cash and restricted cash of $8.9 million. During the same period we used $11.5 million in operating activities, primarily as a result of purchases of portfolio investments, partially offset by sales of and principal repayments on portfolio investments. During the same period, we generated $2.6 million from financing activities, principally from net borrowings on our revolving credit facility and SBA-guaranteed debenture borrowings, partially offset by distributions to stockholders, repurchases of our common stock and decreases in secured borrowings.\nCapital Resources As a BDC, we distribute substantially all of our net income to our stockholders and have an ongoing need to raise additional capital for investment purposes. We intend to generate additional cash primarily from future offerings of securities, future borrowings and cash flows from operations, including income earned from investments in our portfolio companies. On both a short-term and long-term basis, our primary use of funds will be to invest in portfolio companies and make cash distributions to our stockholders.\nAs a BDC, we are generally not permitted to issue and sell our common stock at a price below net asset value per share. We may, however, sell our common stock, or warrants, options or rights to acquire our common stock, at a price below the then-current net asset value per share of our common stock if our Board, including independent directors, determines that such sale is in the best interests of us and our stockholders, and if our stockholders approved such sales. On July 14, 2016, our stockholders voted to allow us to sell or otherwise issue common stock at a price below net asset value per share for a period of one year, subject to certain limitations. As of December 31, 2016 and 2015, we had 16,581,869 and 13,008,007 shares outstanding, respectively.\nOn June 24, 2015, our stockholders approved a proposal to authorize us to issue warrants, options or rights to subscribe to, convert to, or purchase our common stock in one or more offerings. This is a standing authorization and does not require annual re-approval by our stockholders.\nStock Issuances: On February 6, 2015, we entered into an at-the-market (\u201cATM\u201d) securities offering program with MLV & Co. LLC and JMP Securities LLC through which we may sell, by means of ATM offerings from time to time, up to $50.0 million of our common stock. During the year ended December 31, 2015, we sold 672,597 shares at an average price of $14.88 per share for gross proceeds of $10.0 million under the ATM program. Aggregate underwriters' discounts and commissions were $0.2 million and offering costs were $0.08 million, resulting in net proceeds of approximately $9.8 million.\nOn April 20, 2015, we closed a public offering of 2,450,000 shares of its common stock at a public offering price of $14.85 per share, raising approximately $36.4 million in gross proceeds. On May 18, 2015,\nwe sold an additional 367,500 shares of our common stock, at a public offering price of $14.85 per share, raising approximately $5.5 million in gross proceeds pursuant to the underwriters' exercise of the over-allotment option. Aggregate underwriters discounts and commissions were $1.7 million and offering costs were $0.3 million, resulting in net proceeds of $39.9 million on these non-ATM program issuances during the year ended December 31, 2015.\nOn July 1, 2016, we entered into an amendment to MLV's equity distribution agreement and an assignment agreement to replace MLV with FBR Capital Markets & Co., an affiliate of MLV. During the year ended December 31, 2016, we did not make any sales of our common stock under the ATM program.\nOn July 25, 2016, we closed a public offering of 3,100,000 shares of our common stock at a public offering price of $15.50 per share, raising approximately $48.1 million in gross proceeds. On August 3, 2016, we sold an additional 465,000 shares of our common stock, at a public offering price of $15.50 per share, raising approximately $7.2 million in gross proceeds pursuant to the underwriters' exercise of the over-allotment option. Aggregate underwriters' discounts and commissions were $2.2 million and offering costs were $0.5 million, resulting in net proceeds of $52.5 million.\nBorrowings Revolving Credit Facility: As of December 31, 2016 and 2015, we had $129.0 million and $123.7 million outstanding, respectively, under our revolving credit facility with ING Capital LLC, as agent, to finance the purchase of our assets. As of December 31, 2016 and 2015, the maximum amount we were able to borrow under the revolving credit facility was $160.0 million and this maximum borrowing can be increased to $300.0 million pursuant to an accordion feature (subject to maintaining 200% asset coverage, as defined by the 1940 Act). The maturity date on the facility is December 14, 2020.\nThe revolving credit facility is secured by a lien on all of our assets, including cash on hand, but excluding the assets of our wholly-owned subsidiary, MRCC SBIC. Our ability to borrow under the revolving credit facility is subject to availability under a defined borrowing base, which varies based on our portfolio characteristics and certain eligibility criteria and concentration limits, as well as required valuation methodologies. We may make draws under the revolving credit facility to make or purchase additional investments through December 2019 and for general working capital purposes until the maturity date of the revolving credit facility. Borrowings under the revolving credit facility bear interest, at our election, at an annual rate of LIBOR (one-month, two-month, three-month or six-month at our discretion based on the term of the borrowing) plus 3.00%, with a further step-down to LIBOR plus 2.75% when net worth (excluding investments in MRCC SBIC) exceeds $225.0 million or at a daily rate equal to 2.00% per annum plus the greater of the prime interest rate, the federal funds rate plus 0.5% or LIBOR plus 1.0%. In addition to the stated interest rate on borrowings under the revolving credit facility, we are required to pay a fee of 0.5% per annum on any unused portion of the revolving credit facility if the unused portion of the facility is less than 65% of the then available maximum borrowing or a fee of 1.0% per annum on any unused portion of the revolving credit facility if the unused portion of the facility is greater than or equal to 65% of the then available maximum borrowing. As of December 31, 2016 and 2015, the outstanding borrowings were accruing at an average interest rate of 3.8% and 3.4% (based on one-month LIBOR), respectively. The weighted average interest rate of our revolving credit facility borrowings (excluding debt issuance costs) for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014 was 3.6%, 3.6% and 3.4%, respectively. The weighted average fee rate on our unused portion of the revolving credit facility for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014 was 0.5%, 0.5% and 0.5%, respectively.\nOur ability to borrow under the revolving credit facility is subject to availability under the borrowing base, which permits us to borrow up to 70% of the fair market value of our portfolio company investments depending on the type of the investment we hold and whether the investment is quoted. Our ability to borrow is also subject to certain concentration limits, and our continued compliance with the representations, warranties and covenants given by us under the facility. The revolving credit facility contains certain financial and restrictive covenants, including, but not limited to, our maintenance of: (1) a minimum consolidated net worth at least equal to the greater of (a) 40% of the consolidated total assets on the last day of each quarter or (b) $120.0 million plus 65% of the net proceeds to us from sales of our securities after December 14, 2015; (2) a ratio of total assets (less total liabilities other than indebtedness) to total indebtedness of not less than\n2.1 times; and (3) a ratio of earnings before interest and taxes to interest expense of at least 2.5 times. The credit facility also requires us to undertake customary indemnification obligations with respect to ING Capital LLC and other members of the lending group and to reimburse the lenders for expenses associated with entering into the credit facility. The revolving credit facility also has customary provisions regarding events of default, including events of default for nonpayment, change in control transactions at both Monroe Capital Corporation and MC Advisors, failure to comply with financial and negative covenants, and failure to maintain our relationship with MC Advisors. If we incur an event of default under the revolving credit facility and fail to remedy such default under any applicable grace period, if any, then the entire revolving credit facility could become immediately due and payable, which would materially and adversely affect our liquidity, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nOur revolving credit facility also imposes certain conditions that may limit the amount of our distributions to stockholders. Distributions payable in our common stock under the DRIP are not limited by the revolving credit facility. Distributions in cash or property other than common stock are generally limited to 115% of the amount of distributions required to maintain our status as a RIC.\nSBA Debentures: On February 28, 2014, our wholly-owned subsidiary, MRCC SBIC, received a license from the SBA to operate as a SBIC under Section 301(c) of the Small Business Investment Act of 1958, as amended. MRCC SBIC commenced operations on September 16, 2013.\nThe SBIC license allows MRCC SBIC to obtain leverage by issuing SBA-guaranteed debentures, subject to the issuance of a leverage commitment by the SBA and other customary procedures. SBA-guaranteed debentures are non-recourse, interest only debentures with interest payable semi-annually and have a ten year maturity. The principal amount of SBA-guaranteed debentures is not required to be paid prior to maturity but may be prepaid at any time without penalty. The interest rate of SBA-guaranteed debentures is fixed on a semi-annual basis (pooling date) at a market-driven spread over U.S. Treasury Notes with 10-year maturities. The SBA, as a creditor, has a superior claim to MRCC SBIC's assets over our stockholders in the event we liquidate MRCC SBIC or the SBA exercises its remedies upon an event of default.\nSBA regulations currently limit the amount that an individual SBIC may borrow to a maximum of $150.0 million when it has at least $75.0 million in regulatory capital, receives a leverage commitment from the SBA and has been through an audit examination by the SBA subsequent to licensing. The SBA also historically limited a related group of SBICs (commonly referred to as a \u201cfamily of funds\u201d) to a maximum of $225.0 million in total borrowings. On December 18, 2015, this family of funds limitation was raised to $350.0 million in total borrowings. As we have other affiliated SBICs already in operation, MRCC SBIC was historically limited to a maximum of $40.0 million in borrowings. Pursuant to the increase in the family of funds limitation, we submitted a commitment application to the SBA and on April 13, 2016 we were approved for $75.0 million in additional SBA-guaranteed debentures for MRCC SBIC for a total of $115.0 million in available debentures.\nAs of December 31, 2016, MRCC SBIC had $41.0 million in leveragable capital and $51.5 million in SBA-guaranteed debentures outstanding. In order to gain access to the entirety of the $63.5 million in remaining available debentures, we would be required to contribute to MRCC SBIC an additional $16.5 million in leveragable capital. As of December 31, 2015, MRCC SBIC had $20.0 million in leveragable capital and $40.0 million in SBA-guaranteed debentures outstanding.\nAs of December 31, 2016, MRCC SBIC had the following SBA-guaranteed debentures outstanding (dollars in thousands):\nTable 171: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Maturity Date </td> <td> </td> <td>Interest Rate </td> <td> </td> <td>Amount </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>September 2024 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3.4 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>12,920 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>March 2025 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3.3 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>14,800 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>March 2025 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2.9 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>7,080 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>September 2025 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3.6 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5,200 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>March 2027 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2.1 </td> <td>%(1) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>9,200 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>March 2027 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2.0 </td> <td>%(1) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,300 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Total </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>51,500 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 172: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>(1) </td> <td>Represents an interim rate of interest as the SBA-guaranteed debentures have not yet pooled. </td> </tr>\n</table>\nAs of December 31, 2015, MRCC SBIC had the following SBA-guaranteed debentures outstanding (dollars in thousands):\nTable 173: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Maturity Date </td> <td> </td> <td>Interest Rate </td> <td> </td> <td>Amount </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>September 2024 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3.4 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>12,920 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>March 2025 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3.3 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>14,800 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>March 2025 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2.9 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>7,080 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>September 2025 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3.6 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5,200 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Total </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>40,000 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nOn October 2, 2014, we were granted exemptive relief from the SEC for permission to exclude the debt of MRCC SBIC guaranteed by the SBA from the 200% asset coverage test under the 1940 Act. The receipt of this exemption for this SBA-guaranteed debt increases flexibility under the 200% asset coverage test.\nSecured Borrowings: Certain partial loan sales do not qualify for sale accounting under ASC Topic 860 - Transfers and Servicing (\u201cASC Topic 860\u201d) because these sales do not meet the definition of a \u201cparticipating interest,\u201d as defined in the guidance, in order for sale treatment to be allowed. Participations or other partial loan sales which do not meet the definition of a participating interest remain as an investment on the accompanying consolidated statements of assets and liabilities and the portion sold is recorded as a secured borrowing in the liabilities section of the consolidated statements of assets and liabilities. For these partial loan sales, the interest earned on the entire loan balance is recorded within \u201cinterest income\u201d and the interest earned by the buyer in the partial loan sale is recorded within \u201cinterest and other debt financing expenses\u201d in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations.\nAs of December 31, 2016, secured borrowings at fair value totaled $1.3 million and the fair value of the loans that are associated with these secured borrowings was $5.8 million. As of December 31, 2015, secured borrowings at fair value totaled $2.5 million and the fair value of the loans that are associated with these secured borrowings was $11.8 million. These secured borrowings were created as a result of our completion of partial loan sales of certain unitranche loan assets during the year ended December 31, 2013, that did not meet the definition of a \u201cparticipating interest.\u201d As a result, sale treatment was not allowed and these partial loan sales were treated as secured borrowings. No such partial loan sales occurred during the year ended December 31, 2016 and 2015. During the year ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, repayments on secured borrowings totaled $1.2 million and $1.6 million, respectively. The weighted average interest rate on our secured borrowings was approximately 6.3% and 5.8% as of December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively.\nShare Repurchase Plan On November 11, 2013, our Board approved a share repurchase plan (\u201cPlan\u201d) under which up to $7.5 million of our outstanding common stock was allowed to be acquired in the open market at prices below our NAV as reported in our then most recently published consolidated financial statements. The Plan was implemented at the discretion of management and expired on November 10, 2014.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2014, we repurchased 400,359 shares of common stock in open market transactions for an aggregate cost (including transaction costs) of $5.2 million. Over the life of the Plan, we repurchased 485,162 shares of common stock in open market transactions for an aggregate cost (including transaction costs) of $6.3 million. We are incorporated in Maryland and under the law of that state, shares repurchased are considered retired (repurchased shares become authorized but unissued shares) rather than treasury stock. As a result, the cost of stock repurchases is recorded as a reduction to capital in excess of par value on the consolidated statements of changes in net assets.\nDistribution Policy Our Board will determine the timing and amount, if any, of our distributions. We intend to pay distributions on a quarterly basis. In order to avoid corporate-level tax on the income we distribute as a RIC, we must distribute to our stockholders at least 90% of our ordinary income and realized net short-term capital gains in excess of realized net long-term capital losses, if any, on an annual basis out of the assets legally available for such distributions. In addition, we also intend to distribute any realized net capital gains (i.e., realized net long-term capital gains in excess of realized net short-term capital losses) at least annually\nout of the assets legally available for such distributions. Distributions to stockholders for years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014 totaled $20.6 million ($1.40 per share), $16.7 million ($1.40 per share) and $13.0 million ($1.36 per share), respectively, none of which represented return of capital.\nWe have adopted an \u201copt out\u201d dividend reinvestment plan (\u201cDRIP\u201d) for our common stockholders. As a result, if we declare a distribution, our stockholders' cash distributions will be automatically reinvested in additional shares of our common stock unless a stockholder specifically \u201copts out\u201d of our DRIP. If a stockholder opts out, that stockholder will receive cash distributions. Although distributions paid in the form of additional shares of our common stock will generally be subject to U.S. federal, state and local taxes in the same manner as cash distributions, stockholders participating in our DRIP will not receive any corresponding cash distributions with which to pay any such applicable taxes.\nRelated Party Transactions We have a number of business relationships with affiliated or related parties, including the following:\nTable 174: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u2022 </td> <td>We have an Investment Advisory and Management Agreement with MC Advisors, an investment advisor registered with the SEC, to manage our day-to-day operating and investing activities.

See Note 6 to our consolidated financial statements and \u201cSignificant Accounting Estimates and Critical Accounting Policies - Capital Gains Incentive Fee\u201d for additional information. </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 175: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u2022 </td> <td>We have an Administration Agreement with MC Management to provide us with the office facilities and administrative services necessary to conduct our day-to-day operations.

Our officers and directors also remain subject to the duties imposed by both the 1940 Act and Maryland General Corporation Law.\nContractual Obligations and Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements The following table shows our significant contractual payment obligations for repayment as of December 31, 2016 (dollars in thousands):\nTable 178: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Total </td> <td> </td> <td>Less than\n1 year </td> <td> </td> <td>1 - 3 years </td> <td> </td> <td>3 - 5 years </td> <td> </td> <td>More than\n5 years </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Revolving credit facility </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>129,000 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>129,000 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>SBA debentures payable </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>51,500 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>51,500 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Unfunded commitments(1) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>37,716 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>37,716 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Total contractual obligations(2) </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>218,216 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>37,716 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>129,000 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>51,500 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 179: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>(1) </td> <td>Unfunded commitments represent all amounts unfunded as of December 31, 2016.

These instruments may include commitments\nto extend credit and involve, to varying degrees, elements of liquidity and credit risk in excess of the amount recognized in the consolidated statements of assets and liabilities.\nIf any of the contractual obligations discussed above are terminated, our costs under any new agreements that we enter into may increase.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements We have no off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources.\nMarket Trends We have identified the following trends that may affect our business:\nTarget Market: We believe that small and middle-market companies in the United States with annual revenues between $10.0 million and $2.5 billion represent a significant growth segment of the U.S. economy and often require substantial capital investments to grow. Middle-market companies have generated a significant number of investment opportunities for investment funds managed or advised by Monroe Capital, and we believe that this market segment will continue to produce significant investment opportunities for us.\nSpecialized Lending Requirements: We believe that several factors render many U.S. financial institutions ill-suited to lend to U.S. middle-market companies. For example, based on the experience of our management team, lending to U.S. middle-market companies (1) is generally more labor intensive than lending to larger companies due to the smaller size of each investment and the fragmented nature of information for such companies, (2) requires due diligence and underwriting practices consistent with the demands and economic limitations of the middle-market and (3) may also require more extensive ongoing monitoring by the lender.\nDemand for Debt Capital: We believe there is a large pool of uninvested private equity capital for middle-market companies. We expect private equity firms will seek to leverage their investments by combining equity capital with senior secured loans and mezzanine debt from other sources, such as us.\nCompetition from Other Lenders: We believe that many traditional bank lenders, in recent years, de-emphasized their service and product offerings to middle-market businesses in favor of lending to large corporate clients and managing capital market transactions. In addition, many commercial banks face significant balance sheet constraints as they seek to build capital and meet future regulatory capital requirements. These factors may result in opportunities for alternative funding sources to middle-market companies and therefore drive increased new investment opportunities for us. Conversely, there is increased competitive pressure in the BDC and investment company marketplace for senior and subordinated debt which could result in lower yields for increasingly riskier assets.\nPricing and Deal Structures: We believe that the volatility in global markets over the last several years and current macroeconomic issues such as a weakened U.S. economy has reduced access to, and availability of, debt capital to middle-market companies, causing a reduction in competition and generally more favorable capital structures and deal terms. Recent capital raises in the BDC and investment company marketplace have created increased competition; however, we believe that current market conditions may continue to create favorable opportunities to invest at attractive risk-adjusted returns.\nRecent Developments On February 22, 2017, we closed a $40.0 million upsize to our revolving credit facility led by ING, from $160.0 million to $200.0 million in revolving commitments, in accordance with the facility's accordion feature.\nOn March 7, 2017, the Board declared a quarterly dividend of $0.35 per share payable on March 31, 2017 to holders of record on March 17, 2017.\nSignificant Accounting Estimates and Critical Accounting Policies Revenue Recognition We record interest and fee income on an accrual basis to the extent that we expect to collect such amounts. For loans and debt securities with contractual PIK interest, we do not accrue PIK interest if the portfolio company valuation indicates that such PIK interest is not collectible. We do not accrue as a receivable interest on loans and debt securities if we have reason to doubt our ability to collect such interest. Loan origination fees, original issue discount and market discount or premium is capitalized, and we then amortize such amounts using the effective interest method as interest income over the life of the investment. Upon the prepayment of a loan or debt security, any unamortized premium or discount or loan origination fees are recorded as interest income. We record prepayment premiums on loans and debt securities as interest income when we receive such amounts.\nDividend income on preferred equity securities is recorded as dividend income on an accrual basis to the extent that such amounts are payable by the portfolio company and are expected to be collected. Dividend income on common equity securities is recorded on the record date for private portfolio companies. Each distribution received from limited liability company (\u201cLLC\u201d) and limited partnership (\u201cLP\u201d) investments is evaluated to determine if the distribution should be recorded as dividend income or a return of capital. Generally, we will not record distributions from equity investments in LLCs and LPs as dividend income unless there are sufficient accumulated tax-basis earnings and profits in the LLC or LP prior to the distribution. Distributions that are classified as a return of capital are recorded as a reduction in the cost basis of the investment.\nValuation of Portfolio Investments As a BDC, we generally invest in illiquid securities including debt and, to a lesser extent, equity securities of middle-market companies. Under procedures established by our Board, we value investments for which market quotations are readily available and within a recent date at such market quotations. We obtain these market values from an independent pricing service or at the mean between the bid and ask prices obtained from at least two brokers or dealers (if available, otherwise by a principal market maker or a primary market dealer). When doing so, we determine whether the quote obtained is sufficient in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (\u201cGAAP\u201d) to determine the fair value of the security. Investments purchased within 60 days of maturity are valued at cost plus accreted discount, or minus amortized premium, which approximates fair value.\nOur Board is ultimately and solely responsible for determining the fair value of the portfolio investments that are not publicly traded, whose market prices are not readily available on a quarterly basis in good faith or any other situation where portfolio investments require a fair value determination. Because we expect that there will not be a readily available market for many of the investments in our portfolio, we expect to value many of our portfolio investments at fair value as determined in good faith by our Board using a documented valuation policy and a consistently applied valuation process. Due to the inherent uncertainty of determining the fair value of investments that do not have a readily available market value, the fair value of our investments may differ significantly from the values that would have been used had a readily available market value existed for such investments, and the differences could be material.\nWith respect to investments for which market quotations are not readily available, our Board undertakes a multi-step valuation process each quarter, as described below:\nTable 181: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u2022 </td> <td>the quarterly valuation process begins with each portfolio company or investment being initially evaluated and rated by the investment professionals responsible for the credit monitoring of the portfolio investment; </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 182: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u2022 </td> <td>preliminary valuation conclusions are then documented and discussed with the investment committee; </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 183: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u2022 </td> <td>our Board engages one or more independent valuation firm(s) to conduct fair value appraisals of material investments for which market quotations are not readily available. These fair value appraisals for material investments are received at least once in every calendar year for each portfolio company investment, but are generally received quarterly; </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 184: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u2022 </td> <td>our audit committee of the Board reviews the preliminary valuations of MC Advisors and of the independent valuation firm(s) and responds and supplements the valuation recommendations to reflect any comments; and </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 185: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u2022 </td> <td>our Board discusses these valuations and determines the fair value of each investment in the portfolio in good faith, based on the input of MC Advisors, the independent valuation firm(s) and the audit committee. </td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe Board, together with our independent valuation firms, generally uses the yield approach to determine fair value for loans where market quotations are not readily available, as long as it is appropriate. If there is deterioration in credit quality or a debt investment is in workout status, we may consider other factors in determining the fair value, including the value attributable to the debt investment from the enterprise value of the portfolio company under the market approach or the proceeds that would be received in a liquidation analysis. We generally consider our debt to be performing if the borrower is not in default, the borrower is remitting payments in a timely manner; the loan is in covenant compliance or is otherwise not deemed to be impaired. In determining the fair value of the performing debt, the Company considers fluctuations in current interest rates, the trends in yields of debt instruments with similar credit ratings, financial condition of the borrower, economic conditions and other relevant factors, both qualitative and quantitative. In the event that a debt instrument is not performing, as defined above, we will evaluate the value of the collateral utilizing the same framework described above for a performing loan to determine the value of the loan.\nUnder the yield approach, we utilize discounted cash flow models to determine the present value of the future cash flow streams of our debt investments, based on future interest and principal payments as set forth in the associated loan agreements. In determining fair value under the yield approach, we also consider the following factors: applicable market yields and leverage levels, credit quality, prepayment penalties, the nature and realizable value of any collateral, the portfolio company's ability to make payments, and changes in the interest rate environment and the credit markets that generally may affect the price at which similar investments may be made.\nUnder the market approach, we typically use the enterprise value methodology to determine the fair value of an investment. There is no one methodology to estimate enterprise value and, in fact, for any one portfolio company, enterprise value is generally best expressed as a range of values, from which we derive a single estimate of enterprise value. In estimating the enterprise value of a portfolio company, we analyzes various factors consistent with industry practice, including but not limited to original transaction multiples, the portfolio company's historical and projected financial results, applicable market trading and transaction comparables, applicable market yields and leverage levels, the nature and realizable value of any collateral, the markets in which the portfolio company does business, and comparisons of financial ratios of peer companies that are public. Typically, the enterprise values of private companies are based on multiples of earnings before interest, income taxes, depreciation and amortization (\u201cEBITDA\u201d), cash flows, net income, revenues, or in limited cases, book value.\nNet Realized Gains or Losses and Net Change in Unrealized Appreciation or Depreciation We measure realized gains or losses by the difference between the net proceeds from the sale and the amortized cost basis of the investment, without regard to unrealized appreciation or depreciation previously recognized. Net change in unrealized appreciation or depreciation reflects the change in portfolio investment values during the reporting period, including any reversal of previously recorded unrealized appreciation or depreciation, when gains or losses are realized. We report changes in the fair value of secured borrowings that are measured at fair value as a component of the net change in unrealized (appreciation) depreciation on secured borrowings in the consolidated statements of operations.\nCapital Gains Incentive Fee Pursuant to the terms of the Investment Advisory and Management Agreement with MC Advisors, the incentive fee on capital gains earned on liquidated investments of our portfolio is determined and payable in arrears as of the end of each calendar year (or upon termination of the investment advisory and administrative services agreement). This fee equals 20.0% of our incentive fee capital gains (i.e., our realized capital gains on a cumulative basis from inception, calculated as of the end of the applicable period, net of all realized\ncapital losses and unrealized capital depreciation on a cumulative basis), less the aggregate amount of any previously paid capital gains incentive fees. On a quarterly basis, we accrue for the capital gains incentive fee by calculating such fee as if it were due and payable as of the end of such period.\nWhile the Investment Advisory and Management Agreement with MC Advisors neither includes nor contemplates the inclusion of unrealized gains in the calculation of the capital gains incentive fee, pursuant to an interpretation of an American Institute for Certified Public Accountants Technical Practice Aid for investment companies, we include unrealized gains in the calculation of the capital gains incentive fee expense and related accrued capital gains incentive fee. This accrual reflects the incentive fees that would be payable to MC Advisors if our entire portfolio was liquidated at its fair value as of the balance sheet date even though MC Advisors is not entitled to an incentive fee with respect to unrealized gains unless and until such gains are actually realized.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2016, we accrued capital gains incentive fees of $0.2 million based on the performance of our portfolio, none of which was payable to MC Advisors. During the year ended December 31, 2015, we did not accrue any capital gains incentive fees based on the performance of our portfolio. During the year ended December 31, 2014, we had a reduction in accrued capital gains incentive fees of $0.2 million, primarily as a result of declines in certain portfolio valuations.\nNew Accounting Pronouncements In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (\u201cFASB\u201d) issued Accounting Standards Update (\u201cASU\u201d) 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (ASC Topic 606) (\u201cASU 2014-09\u201d). The core principle of ASU 2014-09 is that an entity should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. To achieve that core principle, an entity should apply the following steps: Step 1: Identify the contract(s) with a customer. Step 2: Identify the performance obligations in the contract. Step 3: Determine the transaction price. Step 4: Allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract. Step 5: Recognize revenue when (or as) the entity satisfies a performance obligation.\nASU 2014-09 also specified the accounting for some costs to obtain or fulfill a contract with a customer. In addition, ASU 2014-09 requires that an entity disclose sufficient information to enable users of financial statements to understand the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from contracts with customers. The initial effective date of ASU 2014-09 was for fiscal periods beginning after December 15, 2016. However, in August 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-14, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (ASC Topic 606): Deferral of the Effective Date, which deferred the effective date to fiscal periods beginning after December 15, 2017. Management is currently evaluating the impact these changes will have on our consolidated financial statements and disclosures.\nIn February 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-02, Consolidation (ASC Topic 810): Amendments to the Consolidation Analysis (\u201cASU 2015-02\u201d). ASU 2015-02 significantly changes the consolidation analysis required under GAAP and ends the deferral granted to investment companies from applying the variable interest entity guidance. ASU 2015-02 is effective for interim and annual reporting periods in fiscal years that begin after December 15, 2015 and early adoption is permitted. We have adopted ASU 2015-02 and the adoption did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements and disclosures.\nIn April 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-03, Interest - Imputation of Interest (Subtopic 835-30): Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs (\u201cASU 2015-03\u201d). ASU 2015-03 requires that debt issuance costs related to a recognized debt liability be presented in the statements of assets and liabilities as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of that debt liability, consistent with debt discounts. The recognition and measurement guidance for debt issuance costs are not affected by the amendments in this ASU. ASU 2015-03 is effective for fiscal years that begin after December 15, 2015 and early adoption is permitted. We have adopted ASU 2015-03 and the revised presentation is reflected in our consolidated financial statements for the periods presented.\nIn January 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-01, Financial Instruments - Overall (Subtopic 825-10): Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities (\u201cASU 2016-01\u201d). ASU 2016-01\nretains many current requirements for the classification and measurement of financial instruments; however, it significantly revises an entity's accounting related to (1) the classification and measurement of investments in equity securities and (2) the presentation of certain fair value changes for financial liabilities measured at fair value. ASU 2016-01 also amends certain disclosure requirements associated with the fair value of financial instruments. This guidance is effective for annual and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2017, and early adoption is not permitted for public business entities. Management is currently evaluating the impact these changes will have on our consolidated financial statements and disclosures.\nIn November 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-18, Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Restricted Cash (\u201cASU 2016-18\u201d). ASU 2016-18 requires that the statements of cash flows explain the change during the period in the total of cash, cash equivalents, and amounts generally described as restricted cash or restricted cash equivalents. Therefore, amounts generally described as restricted cash and restricted cash equivalents should be included with cash and cash equivalents when reconciling the beginning-of-period and end-of-period total amounts shown on the statements of cash flows. The new guidance is effective for annual and interim periods, beginning after December 15, 2017, and early adoption is permitted and is to be applied on a retrospective basis. We have adopted ASU 2016-18 and the revised presentation is reflected in our consolidated financial statements for the periods presented.", "item_7_truncated": "ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following discussion should be read in conjunction with our audited consolidated financial statements and related notes and other financial information appearing elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. In addition to historical information, the following discussion and other parts of this Annual Report on Form 10-K contain forward-looking information that involves risks and uncertainties.\nPlease see \u201cRisk Factors\u201d and \u201cSpecial Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\u201d for a discussion of the uncertainties, risks and assumptions associated with these statements.\nOverview Monroe Capital Corporation is an externally managed, closed-end, non-diversified management investment company that has elected to be treated as a business development company (\u201cBDC\u201d) under the 1940 Act. In addition, for tax purposes, we have elected to be treated as a regulated investment company (\u201cRIC\u201d) under the subchapter M of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the \u201cCode\u201d). We were incorporated under the Maryland General Corporation Law on February 9, 2011. We are a specialty finance company focused on providing financing solutions primarily to lower middle-market companies in the United States. We provide customized financing solutions focused primarily on senior secured, junior secured and unitranche (a combination of senior secured and junior secured debt in the same facility in which we syndicate a \u201cfirst out\u201d portion of the loan to an investor and retain a \u201clast out\u201d portion of the loan) debt and, to a lesser extent, unsecured subordinated debt and equity, including equity co-investments in preferred and common stock, and warrants.\nOur shares are currently listed on the NASDAQ Global Select Market under the symbol \u201cMRCC.\u201d\nOur investment objective is to maximize the total return to our stockholders in the form of current income and capital appreciation through investment in senior, unitranche and junior secured debt and, to a lesser extent, subordinated debt and equity investments. We seek to use our extensive leveraged finance origination infrastructure and broad expertise in sourcing loans to invest in primarily senior, unitranche and junior secured debt of middle-market companies. Our investments in senior, unitranche, junior secured debt and other investments generally will range between $2.0 million and $18.0 million each, although this investment size may vary proportionately with the size of our capital base. As of December 31, 2016, our portfolio included approximately 66.7% senior secured debt, 12.5% unitranche secured debt, 14.4% junior secured debt and 6.4% equity securities compared to December 31, 2015, our portfolio included approximately 55.9% senior secured debt, 20.0% unitranche secured debt, 18.6% junior secured debt and 5.5% equity securities. We expect that the companies in which we invest may be leveraged, often as a result of leveraged buy-outs or other recapitalization transactions, and, in certain cases, will not be rated by national ratings agencies. If such companies were rated, we believe that they would typically receive a rating below investment grade (between BB and CCC under the Standard & Poor's system) from the national rating agencies.\nWhile our primary focus is to maximize current income and capital appreciation through debt investments in thinly traded or private U.S. companies, we may invest a portion of the portfolio in opportunistic investments in order to seek to enhance returns to stockholders. Such investments may include investments in high-yield bonds, distressed debt, private equity or securities of public companies that are not thinly traded and securities of middle-market companies located outside of the United States. We expect that these public companies generally will have debt securities that are non-investment grade.\nOn February 28, 2014, our wholly-owned subsidiary, Monroe Capital Corporation SBIC, LP (\u201cMRCC SBIC\u201d), a Delaware limited partnership, received a license from the Small Business Administration (\u201cSBA\u201d) to operate as a Small Business Investment Company (\u201cSBIC\u201d) under Section 301(c) of the Small Business Investment Act of 1958. MRCC SBIC commenced operations on September 16, 2013. As of December 31, 2016, MRCC SBIC had $41.0 million in leveragable capital and $51.5 million in SBA-guaranteed debentures outstanding. See \u201cSBA Debentures\u201d below for more information.\nInvestment income We generate interest income on the debt investments in portfolio company investments that we originate or acquire. Our debt investments, whether in the form of senior, junior or unitranche secured debt, typically have an initial term of three to seven years and bear interest at a fixed or floating rate. In some instances we receive payments on our debt investment based on scheduled amortization of the outstanding balances. In addition, we receive repayments of some of our debt investments prior to their scheduled maturity date. In some cases, our investments provide for deferred interest of payment-in-kind (\u201cPIK\u201d) interest. In addition, we may generate revenue in the form of commitment, origination, amendment, structuring or due diligence fees, fees for providing managerial assistance and consulting fees. Loan origination fees, original issue discount and market discount or premium are capitalized, and we accrete or amortize such amounts as interest income. We record prepayment premiums and prepayment gains (losses) on loans as interest income. As the frequency or volume of the repayments which trigger these prepayment premiums and prepayment gains (losses) may fluctuate significantly from period to period, the associated interest income recorded may also fluctuate significantly from period to period. Interest and fee income is recorded on the accrual basis to the extent we expect to collect such amounts. In addition, we also generate dividend income on preferred equity securities, common equity securities and LLC interests in accordance with our revenue recognition policies.\nExpenses Our primary operating expenses include the payment of fees to MC Advisors under the Investment Advisory and Management Agreement (management and incentive fees), and the payment of fees to Monroe Capital Management Advisors, LLC (\u201cMC Management\u201d) for our allocable portion of overhead and other expenses under the Administration Agreement and other operating costs. See Note 6 to our consolidated financial statements and \u201cRelated Party Transactions\u201d below for additional information on our Investment Advisory and Management Agreement and Administration agreement. Our expenses also include interest expense on our revolving credit facility, our SBA-guaranteed debentures and our secured borrowings. We bear all other out-of-pocket costs and expenses of our operations and transactions.\nNet gain (loss) on investments and secured borrowings We recognize realized gains or losses on investments based on the difference between the net proceeds from the disposition and the cost basis of the investment without regard to unrealized gains or losses previously recognized. We record current period changes in fair value of investments and secured borrowings within net change in unrealized appreciation (depreciation) on investments and net change in unrealized (appreciation) depreciation on secured borrowings, respectively, in the consolidated statements of operations.\nPortfolio and Investment Activity During the year ended December 31, 2016, we invested $105.2 million in 21 new portfolio companies and $42.6 million in 16 existing portfolio companies and had $81.4 million in aggregate amount of sales and principal repayments, resulting in net investments of $66.4 million for the year.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2015, we invested $144.8 million in 24 new portfolio companies and $48.8 million in 16 existing portfolio companies and had $88.4 million in aggregate amount of sales and principal repayments, resulting in net investments of $105.2 million for the year.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2014, we invested $120.4 million in 25 new portfolio companies and $11.8 million in six existing portfolio companies and had $107.1 million in aggregate amount of sales and principal repayments, resulting in net investments of $25.1 million for the year.\nThe following tables show the composition of the investment portfolio (in thousands) and associated yield data:\nTable 158: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>December 31, 2016 </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Fair Value </td> <td> </td> <td>Percentage of\nTotal Portfolio </td> <td> </td> <td>Weighted Average\nAnnualized\nContractual\nCoupon Yield(1) </td> <td> </td> <td>Weighted Average\nAnnualized Effective\nYield(1) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Senior secured loans </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>275,253 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>66.7 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>9.2 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>9.2 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Unitranche loans </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>51,638 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>12.5 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>10.9 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>11.4 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Junior secured loans </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>59,366 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>14.4 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>9.7 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>9.7 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Equity securities </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>26,663 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6.4 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>10.8 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>10.8 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Total </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>412,920 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>100.0 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>9.5 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>9.6 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 159: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>December 31, 2015 </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Fair Value </td> <td> </td> <td>Percentage of\nTotal Portfolio </td> <td> </td> <td>Weighted Average\nAnnualized\nContractual\nCoupon Yield(1) </td> <td> </td> <td>Weighted Average\nAnnualized Effective\nYield(1) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Senior secured loans </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>190,559 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>55.9 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>10.4 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>10.4 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Unitranche loans </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>68,090 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>20.0 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>10.7 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>12.0 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Junior secured loans </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>63,388 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>18.6 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>9.4 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>9.4 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Equity securities </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>19,054 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5.5 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>10.8 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>10.8 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Total </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>341,091 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>100.0 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>10.3 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>10.6 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table>\n (1) Based upon the par value of our debt investments and the cost basis of our preferred equity investments. \nThe shift in portfolio composition from December 31, 2015 primarily reflects our investment of a substantial portion of the capital from our public offering during the year ended December 31, 2016 into senior secured loan assets. The decline in effective rate reflects the general market yield pressure on new loans originated and acquired during the year ended December 31, 2016 and the shift in portfolio mix toward senior secured loans. Additionally, the placement of our investments in TPP Operating Inc. and Answers Corporation on non-accrual status during the year ended December 31, 2016 contributed to the decline in effective rates.\nThe following table shows the portfolio composition by industry grouping at fair value (dollars in thousands):\nTable 161: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td>

agented and more complex investments. MC Advisors segregates our capital markets investments by industry. The MC Advisors' monitoring process and projections developed by Monroe Capital both have daily, weekly, monthly and quarterly components and related reports, each to evaluate performance against historical, budget and underwriting expectations. MC Advisors' analysts will monitor performance using standard industry software tools to provide consistent disclosure of performance. MC Advisors also monitors our investment exposure using a proprietary trend analysis tool. When necessary, MC Advisors will update our internal risk ratings, borrowing base criteria and covenant compliance reports.\nAs part of the monitoring process, MC Advisors regularly assesses the risk profile of each of our investments and rates each of them based on an internal proprietary system that uses the categories listed below, which we refer to as MC Advisors' investment performance rating. For any investment rated in grades 3, 4 or 5, MC Advisors will increase its monitoring intensity and prepare regular updates for the investment committee, summarizing current operating results and material impending events and suggesting recommended actions. MC Advisors monitors and, when appropriate, changes the investment ratings assigned to each investment in our portfolio. In connection with our valuation process, MC Advisors reviews these investment ratings on a quarterly basis, and our board of directors (the \u201cBoard\u201d) reviews and affirms such ratings. A definition of the rating system follows:\n Investment Performance Risk Rating Summary Description Grade 1 Includes investments exhibiting the least amount of risk in our portfolio. The issuer is performing above expectations or the issuer's operating trends and risk factors are generally positive. Grade 2 Includes investments exhibiting an acceptable level of risk that is similar to the risk at the time of origination. The issuer is generally performing as expected or the risk factors are neutral to positive. Grade 3 Includes investments performing below expectations and indicates that the investment's risk has increased somewhat since origination. The issuer may be out of compliance with debt covenants; however, scheduled loan payments are generally not past due. Grade 4 Includes an issuer performing materially below expectations and indicates that the issuer's risk has increased materially since origination. In addition to the issuer being generally out of compliance with debt covenants, scheduled loan payments may be past due (but generally not more than six months past due). For grade 4 investments, we intend to increase monitoring of the issuer. \n Investment Performance Risk Rating Summary Description Grade 5 Indicates that the issuer is performing substantially below expectations and the investment risk has substantially increased since origination. Most or all of the debt covenants are out of compliance or payments are substantially delinquent. Investments graded 5 are not anticipated to be repaid in full and we will reduce the fair market value of the loan to the amount we expect to recover. \nOur investment performance risk ratings do not constitute any rating of investments by a nationally recognized statistical rating organization or reflect or represent any third-party assessment of any of our investments.\nIn the event of a delinquency or a decision to rate an investment grade 4 or grade 5, the applicable analyst, in consultation with a member of the investment committee, will develop an action plan. Such a plan may require a meeting with the borrower's management or the lender group to discuss reasons for the default and the steps management is undertaking to address the under-performance, as well as required amendments and waivers that may be required. In the event of a dramatic deterioration of a credit, MC Advisors intends to form a team or engage outside advisors to analyze, evaluate and take further steps to preserve its value in the credit. In this regard, we would expect to explore all options, including in a private equity sponsored investment, assuming certain responsibilities for the private equity sponsor or a formal sale of the business with oversight of the sale process by us. Several of Monroe Capital's professionals are experienced in running debt work-out transactions and bankruptcies.\nThe following table shows the distribution of our investments on the 1 to 5

The increase in investment income of $7.0 million during the year ended December 31, 2015 is primarily due to an increase in average outstanding loan balances.\nOperating Expenses The composition of our operating expenses was as follows (dollars in thousands):\nTable 169: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>For the years ended\nDecember 31, </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2016 </td> <td> </td> <td>2015 </td> <td> </td> <td>2014 </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Interest and other debt financing expenses </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>6,782 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>5,400 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>4,342 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Base management fees </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6,347 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5,129 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4,091 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Incentive fees, net of incentive fee waiver </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5,504 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4,685 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3,512 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Professional fees </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>988 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>835 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,138 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Administrative service fees </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,287 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,078 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>876 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>General and administrative expenses </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>779 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>799 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>659 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Excise taxes </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>679 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>83 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>70 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Directors fees </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>146 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>148 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>150 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Total expenses, net of incentive fee waiver </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>22,512 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>18,157 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>14,838 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe composition of our interest and other debt financing expenses was as follows (dollars in thousands):\nTable 170: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>For the years ended\nDecember 31, </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2016 </td> <td> </td> <td>2015 </td> <td> </td> <td>2014 </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Interest expense - revolving credit facility </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>4,422 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>3,290 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>3,183 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Interest expense - SBA debentures </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,340 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,080 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>161 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Amortization of deferred financing costs </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>820 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>742 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>576 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Interest expense - secured borrowings </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>123 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>198 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>374 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Other </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>77 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>90 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>48 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Total interest and other debt financing expenses </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>6,782 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>5,400 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>4,342 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe increase in expenses of $4.4 million during the year ended December 31, 2016 is primarily due to an increase in base management fees and incentive fees primarily due to the growth in invested assets. Increases in interest expense also contributed to the increase in expenses during the year ended December 31, 2016 as a result of additional borrowings (including SBA-guaranteed debenture borrowings) required to support the growth of the portfolio. The increase in expenses of $3.3 million during the year ended December 31, 2015 is primarily due to an increase in base management fees due to the growth in invested assets and increased incentive fees resulting from improvement in performance. Increases in interest expense also contributed to the increase in expenses during the year ended December 31, 2015 as a result of additional borrowings (including SBA-guaranteed debentures) required to support the growth of the portfolio.\nNet Realized Gain (Loss) on Investments During the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, we had sales of investments of $0.6 million, $0.4 million and $19.0 million, respectively, resulting in net realized gain (loss) on investments of $0.6 million, $0.3 million and $0.3 million, respectively.\nNet Change in Unrealized Appreciation (Depreciation) on Investments and Secured Borrowings For the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, our investments had $1.3 million, ($1.1) million and ($1.5) million of net change in unrealized appreciation (depreciation), respectively. Net change in unrealized appreciation (depreciation) includes both unrealized appreciation on investments in our portfolio with mark-to-market gains during the year and unrealized depreciation on investments in our portfolio with mark-to-market losses during the year. During the year ended December 31, 2016, one of our portfolio companies, TPP Operating, Inc. (formerly TPP Acquisition, Inc., collectively, \u201cTPP\u201d) filed for bankruptcy and underwent a restructuring process. Net unrealized depreciation on our investments in TPP were $5.1 million and $5.7 million during the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. See Note 5 in our attached consolidated financial statements for additional information on the TPP restructuring and the valuation of these investments. For the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014 our secured borrowings had ($0.1) million, ($0.1) million and $0.1 million of net change in unrealized (appreciation) depreciation, respectively.\nNet Increase (Decrease) in Net Assets Resulting from Operations For the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, we recorded a net increase in net assets resulting from operations of $24.4 million, $17.9 million and $13.9 million, respectively. Based on the weighted average shares of common stock outstanding for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014 our per share net increase in net assets resulting from operations was $1.68, $1.53 and $1.45, respectively. The increase of $6.5 million during the year ended December 31, 2016 is primarily the result of increases in net investment income due to portfolio growth and increases in net unrealized appreciation in the investment portfolio. The increase of $4.0 million during the year ended December 31, 2015 is primarily the result of increases in net investment income due to portfolio growth.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources As of December 31, 2016, we had $6.0 million in cash, $2.4 million in cash at MRCC SBIC, $129.0 million of total debt outstanding on our revolving credit facility and $51.5 million in outstanding\nSBA-guaranteed debentures. We had $31.0 million available for additional borrowings on our revolving credit facility and $63.5 million in available SBA-guaranteed debentures. See \u201cBorrowings\u201d below for additional information.\nCash Flows For the year ended December 31, 2016, we experienced a net decrease in cash and restricted cash of $5.5 million. During the same period we used $51.9 million in operating activities, primarily as a result of purchases of portfolio investments, partially offset by sales of and principal repayments on portfolio investments. During the same year, we generated $46.3 million from financing activities, principally from net proceeds from our capital raises during the period, net borrowings on our revolving credit facility and SBA-guaranteed debenture borrowings, partially offset by distributions to stockholders and decreases in secured borrowings.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2015, we experienced a net increase in cash and restricted cash of $8.1 million. During the same period we used $82.7 million in operating activities, primarily as a result of purchases of portfolio investments, partially offset by sales of and principal repayments on portfolio investments. During the same period, we generated $90.8 million from financing activities, principally from net proceeds from our capital raises during the period, net borrowings on our revolving credit facility and SBA-guaranteed debenture borrowings, partially offset by distributions to stockholders and decreases in secured borrowings.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2014, we experienced a net decrease in cash and restricted cash of $8.9 million. During the same period we used $11.5 million in operating activities, primarily as a result of purchases of portfolio investments, partially offset by sales of and principal repayments on portfolio investments. During the same period, we generated $2.6 million from financing activities, principally from net borrowings on our revolving credit facility and SBA-guaranteed debenture borrowings, partially offset by distributions to stockholders, repurchases of our common stock and decreases in secured borrowings.\nCapital Resources As a BDC, we distribute substantially all of our net income to our stockholders and have an ongoing need to raise additional capital for investment purposes. We intend to generate additional cash primarily from future offerings of securities, future borrowings and cash flows from operations, including income earned from investments in our portfolio companies. On both a short-term and long-term basis, our primary use of funds will be to invest in portfolio companies and make cash distributions to our stockholders.\nAs a BDC, we are generally not permitted to issue and sell our common stock at a price below net asset value per share. We may, however, sell our common stock, or warrants, options or rights to acquire our common stock, at a price below the then-current net asset value per share of our common stock if our Board, including independent directors, determines that such sale is in the best interests of us and our stockholders, and if our stockholders approved such sales. On July 14, 2016, our stockholders voted to allow us to sell or otherwise issue common stock at a price below net asset value per share for a period of one year, subject to certain limitations. As of December 31, 2016 and 2015, we had 16,581,869 and 13,008,007 shares outstanding, respectively.\nOn June 24, 2015, our stockholders approved a proposal to authorize us to issue warrants, options or rights to subscribe to, convert to, or purchase our common stock in one or more offerings. This is a standing authorization and does not require annual re-approval by our stockholders.\nStock Issuances: On February 6, 2015, we entered into an at-the-market (\u201cATM\u201d) securities offering program with MLV & Co. LLC and JMP Securities LLC through which we may sell, by means of ATM offerings from time to time, up to $50.0 million of our common stock. During the year ended December 31, 2015, we sold 672,597 shares at an average price of $14.88 per share for gross proceeds of $10.0 million under the ATM program. Aggregate underwriters' discounts and commissions were $0.2 million and offering costs were $0.08 million, resulting in net proceeds of approximately $9.8 million.\nOn April 20, 2015, we closed a public offering of 2,450,000 shares of its common stock at a public offering price of $14.85 per share, raising approximately $36.4 million in gross proceeds. On May 18, 2015,\nwe sold an additional 367,500 shares of our common stock, at a public offering price of $14.85 per share, raising approximately $5.5 million in gross proceeds pursuant to the underwriters' exercise of the over-allotment option. Aggregate underwriters discounts and commissions were $1.7 million and offering costs were $0.3 million, resulting in net proceeds of $39.9 million on these non-ATM program issuances during the year ended December 31, 2015.\nOn July 1, 2016, we entered into an amendment to MLV's equity distribution agreement and an assignment agreement to replace MLV with FBR Capital Markets & Co., an affiliate of MLV. During the year ended December 31, 2016, we did not make any sales of our common stock under the ATM program.\nOn July 25, 2016, we closed a public offering of 3,100,000 shares of our common stock at a public offering price of $15.50 per share, raising approximately $48.1 million in gross proceeds. On August 3, 2016, we sold an additional 465,000 shares of our common stock, at a public offering price of $15.50 per share, raising approximately $7.2 million in gross proceeds pursuant to the underwriters' exercise of the over-allotment option. Aggregate underwriters' discounts and commissions were $2.2 million and offering costs were $0.5 million, resulting in net proceeds of $52.5 million.\nBorrowings Revolving Credit Facility: As of December 31, 2016 and 2015, we had $129.0 million and $123.7 million outstanding, respectively, under our revolving credit facility with ING Capital LLC, as agent, to finance the purchase of our assets. As of December 31, 2016 and 2015, the maximum amount we were able to borrow under the revolving credit facility was $160.0 million and this maximum borrowing can be increased to $300.0 million pursuant to an accordion feature (subject to maintaining 200% asset coverage, as defined by the 1940 Act). The maturity date on the facility is December 14, 2020.\nThe revolving credit facility is secured by a lien on all of our assets, including cash on hand, but excluding the assets of our wholly-owned subsidiary, MRCC SBIC. Our ability to borrow under the revolving credit facility is subject to availability under a defined borrowing base, which varies based on our portfolio characteristics and certain eligibility criteria and concentration limits, as well as required valuation methodologies. We may make draws under the revolving credit facility to make or purchase additional investments through December 2019 and for general working capital purposes until the maturity date of the revolving credit facility. Borrowings under the revolving credit facility bear interest, at our election, at an annual rate of LIBOR (one-month, two-month, three-month or six-month at our discretion based on the term of the borrowing) plus 3.00%, with a further step-down to LIBOR plus 2.75% when net worth (excluding investments in MRCC SBIC) exceeds $225.0 million or at a daily rate equal to 2.00% per annum plus the greater of the prime interest rate, the federal funds rate plus 0.5% or LIBOR plus 1.0%. In addition to the stated interest rate on borrowings under the revolving credit facility, we are required to pay a fee of 0.5% per annum on any unused portion of the revolving credit facility if the unused portion of the facility is less than 65% of the then available maximum borrowing or a fee of 1.0% per annum on any unused portion of the revolving credit facility if the unused portion of the facility is greater than or equal to 65% of the then available maximum borrowing. As of December 31, 2016 and 2015, the outstanding borrowings were accruing at an average interest rate of 3.8% and 3.4% (based on one-month LIBOR), respectively. The weighted average interest rate of our revolving credit facility borrowings (excluding debt issuance costs) for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014 was 3.6%, 3.6% and 3.4%, respectively. The weighted average fee rate on our unused portion of the revolving credit facility for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014 was 0.5%, 0.5% and 0.5%, respectively.\nOur ability to borrow under the revolving credit facility is subject to availability under the borrowing base, which permits us to borrow up to 70% of the fair market value of our portfolio company investments depending on the type of the investment we hold and whether the investment is quoted. Our ability to borrow is also subject to certain concentration limits, and our continued compliance with the representations, warranties and covenants given by us under the facility. The revolving credit facility contains certain financial and restrictive covenants, including, but not limited to, our maintenance of: (1) a minimum consolidated net worth at least equal to the greater of (a) 40% of the consolidated total assets on the last day of each quarter or (b) $120.0 million plus 65% of the net proceeds to us from sales of our securities after December 14, 2015; (2) a ratio of total assets (less total liabilities other than indebtedness) to total indebtedness of not less than\n2.1 times; and (3) a ratio of earnings before interest and taxes to interest expense of at least 2.5 times. The credit facility also requires us to undertake customary indemnification obligations with respect to ING Capital LLC and other members of the lending group and to reimburse the lenders for expenses associated with entering into the credit facility. The revolving credit facility also has customary provisions regarding events of default, including events of default for nonpayment, change in control transactions at both Monroe Capital Corporation and MC Advisors, failure to comply with financial and negative covenants, and failure to maintain our relationship with MC Advisors. If we incur an event of default under the revolving credit facility and fail to remedy such default under any applicable grace period, if any, then the entire revolving credit facility could become immediately due and payable, which would materially and adversely affect our liquidity, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nOur revolving credit facility also imposes certain conditions that may limit the amount of our distributions to stockholders. Distributions payable in our common stock under the DRIP are not limited by the revolving credit facility. Distributions in cash or property other than common stock are generally limited to 115% of the amount of distributions required to maintain our status as a RIC.\nSBA Debentures: On February 28, 2014, our wholly-owned subsidiary, MRCC SBIC, received a license from the SBA to operate as a SBIC under Section 301(c) of the Small Business Investment Act of 1958, as amended. MRCC SBIC commenced operations on September 16, 2013.\nThe SBIC license allows MRCC SBIC to obtain leverage by issuing SBA-guaranteed debentures, subject to the issuance of a leverage commitment by the SBA and other customary procedures. SBA-guaranteed debentures are non-recourse, interest only debentures with interest payable semi-annually and have a ten year maturity. The principal amount of SBA-guaranteed debentures is not required to be paid prior to maturity but may be prepaid at any time without penalty. The interest rate of SBA-guaranteed debentures is fixed on a semi-annual basis (pooling date) at a market-driven spread over U.S. Treasury Notes with 10-year maturities. The SBA, as a creditor, has a superior claim to MRCC SBIC's assets over our stockholders in the event we liquidate MRCC SBIC or the SBA exercises its remedies upon an event of default.\nSBA regulations currently limit the amount that an individual SBIC may borrow to a maximum of $150.0 million when it has at least $75.0 million in regulatory capital, receives a leverage commitment from the SBA and has been through an audit examination by the SBA subsequent to licensing. The SBA also historically limited a related group of SBICs (commonly referred to as a \u201cfamily of funds\u201d) to a maximum of $225.0 million in total borrowings. On December 18, 2015, this family of funds limitation was raised to $350.0 million in total borrowings. As we have other affiliated SBICs already in operation, MRCC SBIC was historically limited to a maximum of $40.0 million in borrowings. Pursuant to the increase in the family of funds limitation, we submitted a commitment application to the SBA and on April 13, 2016 we were approved for $75.0 million in additional SBA-guaranteed debentures for MRCC SBIC for a total of $115.0 million in available debentures.\nAs of December 31, 2016, MRCC SBIC had $41.0 million in leveragable capital and $51.5 million in SBA-guaranteed debentures outstanding. In order to gain access to the entirety of the $63.5 million in remaining available debentures, we would be required to contribute to MRCC SBIC an additional $16.5 million in leveragable capital. As of December 31, 2015, MRCC SBIC had $20.0 million in leveragable capital and $40.0 million in SBA-guaranteed debentures outstanding.\nAs of December 31, 2016, MRCC SBIC had the following SBA-guaranteed debentures outstanding (dollars in thousands):\nTable 171: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Maturity Date </td> <td> </td> <td>Interest Rate </td> <td> </td> <td>Amount </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>September 2024 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3.4 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>12,920 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>March 2025 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3.3 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>14,800 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>March 2025 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2.9 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>7,080 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>September 2025 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3.6 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5,200 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>March 2027 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2.1 </td> <td>%(1) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>9,200 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>March 2027 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2.0 </td> <td>%(1) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,300 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Total </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>51,500 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\n (1) Represents an interim rate of interest as the SBA-guaranteed debentures have not yet pooled. \nAs of December 31, 2015, MRCC SBIC had the following SBA-guaranteed debentures outstanding (dollars in thousands):\nTable 173: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Maturity Date </td> <td> </td> <td>Interest Rate </td> <td> </td> <td>Amount </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>September 2024 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3.4 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>12,920 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>March 2025 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3.3 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>14,800 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>March 2025 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2.9 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>7,080 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>September 2025 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3.6 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5,200 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Total </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>40,000 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nOn October 2, 2014, we were granted exemptive relief from the SEC for permission to exclude the debt of MRCC SBIC guaranteed by the SBA from the 200% asset coverage test under the 1940 Act. The receipt of this exemption for this SBA-guaranteed debt increases flexibility under the 200% asset coverage test.\nSecured Borrowings: Certain partial loan sales do not qualify for sale accounting under ASC Topic 860 - Transfers and Servicing (\u201cASC Topic 860\u201d) because these sales do not meet the definition of a \u201cparticipating interest,\u201d as defined in the guidance, in order for sale treatment to be allowed. Participations or other partial loan sales which do not meet the definition of a participating interest remain as an investment on the accompanying consolidated statements of assets and liabilities and the portion sold is recorded as a secured borrowing in the liabilities section of the consolidated statements of assets and liabilities. For these partial loan sales, the interest earned on the entire loan balance is recorded within \u201cinterest income\u201d and the interest earned by the buyer in the partial loan sale is recorded within \u201cinterest and other debt financing expenses\u201d in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations.\nAs of December 31, 2016, secured borrowings at fair value totaled $1.3 million and the fair value of the loans that are associated with these secured borrowings was $5.8 million. As of December 31, 2015, secured borrowings at fair value totaled $2.5 million and the fair value of the loans that are associated with these secured borrowings was $11.8 million. These secured borrowings were created as a result of our completion of partial loan sales of certain unitranche loan assets during the year ended December 31, 2013, that did not meet the definition of a \u201cparticipating interest.\u201d As a result, sale treatment was not allowed and these partial loan sales were treated as secured borrowings. No such partial loan sales occurred during the year ended December 31, 2016 and 2015. During the year ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, repayments on secured borrowings totaled $1.2 million and $1.6 million, respectively. The weighted average interest rate on our secured borrowings was approximately 6.3% and 5.8% as of December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively.\nShare Repurchase Plan On November 11, 2013, our Board approved a share repurchase plan (\u201cPlan\u201d) under which up to $7.5 million of our outstanding common stock was allowed to be acquired in the open market at prices below our NAV as reported in our then most recently published consolidated financial statements. The Plan was implemented at the discretion of management and expired on November 10, 2014.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2014, we repurchased 400,359 shares of common stock in open market transactions for an aggregate cost (including transaction costs) of $5.2 million. Over the life of the Plan, we repurchased 485,162 shares of common stock in open market transactions for an aggregate cost (including transaction costs) of $6.3 million. We are incorporated in Maryland and under the law of that state, shares repurchased are considered retired (repurchased shares become authorized but unissued shares) rather than treasury stock. As a result, the cost of stock repurchases is recorded as a reduction to capital in excess of par value on the consolidated statements of changes in net assets.\nDistribution Policy Our Board will determine the timing and amount, if any, of our distributions. We intend to pay distributions on a quarterly basis. In order to avoid corporate-level tax on the income we distribute as a RIC, we must distribute to our stockholders at least 90% of our ordinary income and realized net short-term capital gains in excess of realized net long-term capital losses, if any, on an annual basis out of the assets legally available for such distributions. In addition, we also intend to distribute any realized net capital gains (i.e., realized net long-term capital gains in excess of realized net short-term capital losses) at least annually\nout of the assets legally available for such distributions. Distributions to stockholders for years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014 totaled $20.6 million ($1.40 per share), $16.7 million ($1.40 per share) and $13.0 million ($1.36 per share), respectively, none of which represented return of capital.\nWe have adopted an \u201copt out\u201d dividend reinvestment plan (\u201cDRIP\u201d) for our common stockholders. As a result, if we declare a distribution, our stockholders' cash distributions will be automatically reinvested in additional shares of our common stock unless a stockholder specifically \u201copts out\u201d of our DRIP. If a stockholder opts out, that stockholder will receive cash distributions. Although distributions paid in the form of additional shares of our common stock will generally be subject to U.S. federal, state and local taxes in the same manner as cash distributions, stockholders participating in our DRIP will not receive any corresponding cash distributions with which to pay any such applicable taxes.\nRelated Party Transactions We have a number of business relationships with affiliated or related parties, including the following:\n \u2022 We have an Investment Advisory and Management Agreement with MC Advisors, an investment advisor registered with the SEC, to manage our day-to-day operating and investing activities. We pay MC Advisors a fee for its services under the Investment Advisory and Management Agreement consisting of two components - a base management fee and an incentive fee. See Note 6 to our consolidated financial statements and \u201cSignificant Accounting Estimates and Critical Accounting Policies - Capital Gains Incentive Fee\u201d for additional information. \n \u2022 We have an Administration Agreement with MC Management to provide us with the office facilities and administrative services necessary to conduct our day-to-day operations. See Note 6 to our consolidated financial statements for additional information. \n \u2022 Theodore L. Koenig, our Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of our Board is also a manager of MC Advisors and the President and Chief Executive Officer of MC Management. Aaron D. Peck, our Chief Financial Officer and Chief Investment Officer, serves as a director on our Board and is also a managing director of MC Management. \n \u2022 We have a license agreement with Monroe Capital LLC, under which Monroe Capital LLC has agreed to grant us a non-exclusive, royalty-free license to use the name \u201cMonroe Capital\u201d for specified purposes in our business. \nIn addition, we have adopted a formal code of ethics that governs the conduct of MC Advisors' officers, directors and employees. Our officers and directors also remain subject to the duties imposed by both the 1940 Act and Maryland General Corporation Law.\nContractual Obligations and Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements The following table shows our significant contractual payment obligations for repayment as of December 31, 2016 (dollars in thousands):\nTable 178: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Total </td> <td> </td> <td>Less than\n1 year </td> <td> </td> <td>1 - 3 years </td> <td> </td> <td>3 - 5 years </td> <td> </td> <td>More than\n5 years </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Revolving credit facility </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>129,000 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>129,000 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>SBA debentures payable </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>51,500 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>51,500 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Unfunded commitments(1) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>37,716 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>37,716 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Total contractual obligations(2) </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>218,216 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>37,716 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>129,000 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>51,500 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\n (1) Unfunded commitments represent all amounts unfunded as of December 31, 2016. These amounts may or may not be funded to the borrowing party now or in the future. The unfunded commitments relate to loans with various maturity dates, but we are showing this amount in the less than one year category as this entire amount was eligible for funding to the borrowers as of December 31, 2016. \n (2) Total contractual obligations excludes $1.3 million of secured borrowings. \nWe may become a party to financial instruments with off-balance sheet risk in the normal course of our business to meet the financial needs of our portfolio companies. These instruments may include commitments\nto extend credit and involve, to varying degrees, elements of liquidity and credit risk in excess of the amount recognized in the consolidated statements of assets and liabilities.\nIf any of the contractual obligations discussed above are terminated, our costs under any new agreements that we enter into may increase.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements We have no off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources.\nMarket Trends We have identified the following trends that may affect our business:\nTarget Market: We believe that small and middle-market companies in the United States with annual revenues between $10.0 million and $2.5 billion represent a significant growth segment of the U.S. economy and often require substantial capital investments to grow. Middle-market companies have generated a significant number of investment opportunities for investment funds managed or advised by Monroe Capital, and we believe that this market segment will continue to produce significant investment opportunities for us.\nSpecialized Lending Requirements: We believe that several factors render many U.S. financial institutions ill-suited to lend to U.S. middle-market companies. For example, based on the experience of our management team, lending to U.S. middle-market companies (1) is generally more labor intensive than lending to larger companies due to the smaller size of each investment and the fragmented nature of information for such companies, (2) requires due diligence and underwriting practices consistent with the demands and economic limitations of the middle-market and (3) may also require more extensive ongoing monitoring by the lender.\nDemand for Debt Capital: We believe there is a large pool of uninvested private equity capital for middle-market companies. We expect private equity firms will seek to leverage their investments by combining equity capital with senior secured loans and mezzanine debt from other sources, such as us.\nCompetition from Other Lenders: We believe that many traditional bank lenders, in recent years, de-emphasized their service and product offerings to middle-market businesses in favor of lending to large corporate clients and managing capital market transactions. In addition, many commercial banks face significant balance sheet constraints as they seek to build capital and meet future regulatory capital requirements. These factors may result in opportunities for alternative funding sources to middle-market companies and therefore drive increased new investment opportunities for us. Conversely, there is increased competitive pressure in the BDC and investment company marketplace for senior and subordinated debt which could result in lower yields for increasingly riskier assets.\nPricing and Deal Structures: We believe that the volatility in global markets over the last several years and current macroeconomic issues such as a weakened U.S. economy has reduced access to, and availability of, debt capital to middle-market companies, causing a reduction in competition and generally more favorable capital structures and deal terms. Recent capital raises in the BDC and investment company marketplace have created increased competition; however, we believe that current market conditions may continue to create favorable opportunities to invest at attractive risk-adjusted returns.\nRecent Developments On February 22, 2017, we closed a $40.0 million upsize to our revolving credit facility led by ING, from $160.0 million to $200.0 million in revolving commitments, in accordance with the facility's accordion feature.\nOn March 7, 2017, the Board declared a quarterly dividend of $0.35 per share payable on March 31, 2017 to holders of record on March 17, 2017.\nSignificant Accounting Estimates and Critical Accounting Policies Revenue Recognition We record interest and fee income on an accrual basis to the extent that we expect to collect such amounts. For loans and debt securities with contractual PIK interest, we do not accrue PIK interest if the portfolio company valuation indicates that such PIK interest is not collectible. We do not accrue as a receivable interest on loans and debt securities if we have reason to doubt our ability to collect such interest. Loan origination fees, original issue discount and market discount or premium is capitalized, and we then amortize such amounts using the effective interest method as interest income over the life of the investment. Upon the prepayment of a loan or debt security, any unamortized premium or discount or loan origination fees are recorded as interest income. We record prepayment premiums on loans and debt securities as interest income when we receive such amounts.\nDividend income on preferred equity securities is recorded as dividend income on an accrual basis to the extent that such amounts are payable by the portfolio company and are expected to be collected. Dividend income on common equity securities is recorded on the record date for private portfolio companies. Each distribution received from limited liability company (\u201cLLC\u201d) and limited partnership (\u201cLP\u201d) investments is evaluated to determine if the distribution should be recorded as dividend income or a return of capital. Generally, we will not record distributions from equity investments in LLCs and LPs as dividend income unless there are sufficient accumulated tax-basis earnings and profits in the LLC or LP prior to the distribution. Distributions that are classified as a return of capital are recorded as a reduction in the cost basis of the investment.\nValuation of Portfolio Investments As a BDC, we generally invest in illiquid securities including debt and, to a lesser extent, equity securities of middle-market companies. Under procedures established by our Board, we value investments for which market quotations are readily available and within a recent date at such market quotations. We obtain these market values from an independent pricing service or at the mean between the bid and ask prices obtained from at least two brokers or dealers (if available, otherwise by a principal market maker or a primary market dealer). When doing so, we determine whether the quote obtained is sufficient in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (\u201cGAAP\u201d) to determine the fair value of the security. Investments purchased within 60 days of maturity are valued at cost plus accreted discount, or minus amortized premium, which approximates fair value.\nOur Board is ultimately and solely responsible for determining the fair value of the portfolio investments that are not publicly traded, whose market prices are not readily available on a quarterly basis in good faith or any other situation where portfolio investments require a fair value determination. Because we expect that there will not be a readily available market for many of the investments in our portfolio, we expect to value many of our portfolio investments at fair value as determined in good faith by our Board using a documented valuation policy and a consistently applied valuation process. Due to the inherent uncertainty of determining the fair value of investments that do not have a readily available market value, the fair value of our investments may differ significantly from the values that would have been used had a readily available market value existed for such investments, and the differences could be material.\nWith respect to investments for which market quotations are not readily available, our Board undertakes a multi-step valuation process each quarter, as described below:\n \u2022 the quarterly valuation process begins with each portfolio company or investment being initially evaluated and rated by the investment professionals responsible for the credit monitoring of the portfolio investment; \n \u2022 preliminary valuation conclusions are then documented and discussed with the investment committee; \n \u2022 our Board engages one or more independent valuation firm(s) to conduct fair value appraisals of material investments for which market quotations are not readily available. These fair value appraisals for material investments are received at least once in every calendar year for each portfolio company investment, but are generally received quarterly; \n \u2022 our audit committee of the Board reviews the preliminary valuations of MC Advisors and of the independent valuation firm(s) and responds and supplements the valuation recommendations to reflect any comments; and \n \u2022 our Board discusses these valuations and determines the fair value of each investment in the portfolio in good faith, based on the input of MC Advisors, the independent valuation firm(s) and the audit committee. \nThe Board, together with our independent valuation firms, generally uses the yield approach to determine fair value for loans where market quotations are not readily available, as long as it is appropriate. If there is deterioration in credit quality or a debt investment is in workout status, we may consider other factors in determining the fair value, including the value attributable to the debt investment from the enterprise value of the portfolio company under the market approach or the proceeds that would be received in a liquidation analysis. We generally consider our debt to be performing if the borrower is not in default, the borrower is remitting payments in a timely manner; the loan is in covenant compliance or is otherwise not deemed to be impaired. In determining the fair value of the performing debt, the Company considers fluctuations in current interest rates, the trends in yields of debt instruments with similar credit ratings, financial condition of the borrower, economic conditions and other relevant factors, both qualitative and quantitative. In the event that a debt instrument is not performing, as defined above, we will evaluate the value of the collateral utilizing the same framework described above for a performing loan to determine the value of the loan.\nUnder the yield approach, we utilize discounted cash flow models to determine the present value of the future cash flow streams of our debt investments, based on future interest and principal payments as set forth in the associated loan agreements. In determining fair value under the yield approach, we also consider the following factors: applicable market yields and leverage levels, credit quality, prepayment penalties, the nature and realizable value of any collateral, the portfolio company's ability to make payments, and changes in the interest rate environment and the credit markets that generally may affect the price at which similar investments may be made.\nUnder the market approach, we typically use the enterprise value methodology to determine the fair value of an investment. There is no one methodology to estimate enterprise value and, in fact, for any one portfolio company, enterprise value is generally best expressed as a range of values, from which we derive a single estimate of enterprise value. In estimating the enterprise value of a portfolio company, we analyzes various factors consistent with industry practice, including but not limited to original transaction multiples, the portfolio company's historical and projected financial results, applicable market trading and transaction comparables, applicable market yields and leverage levels, the nature and realizable value of any collateral, the markets in which the portfolio company does business, and comparisons of financial ratios of peer companies that are public. Typically, the enterprise values of private companies are based on multiples of earnings before interest, income taxes, depreciation and amortization (\u201cEBITDA\u201d), cash flows, net income, revenues, or in limited cases, book value.\nNet Realized Gains or Losses and Net Change in Unrealized Appreciation or Depreciation We measure realized gains or losses by the difference between the net proceeds from the sale and the amortized cost basis of the investment, without regard to unrealized appreciation or depreciation previously recognized. Net change in unrealized appreciation or depreciation reflects the change in portfolio investment values during the reporting period, including any reversal of previously recorded unrealized appreciation or depreciation, when gains or losses are realized. We report changes in the fair value of secured borrowings that are measured at fair value as a component of the net change in unrealized (appreciation) depreciation on secured borrowings in the consolidated statements of operations.\nCapital Gains Incentive Fee Pursuant to the terms of the Investment Advisory and Management Agreement with MC Advisors, the incentive fee on capital gains earned on liquidated investments of our portfolio is determined and payable in arrears as of the end of each calendar year (or upon termination of the investment advisory and administrative services agreement). This fee equals 20.0% of our incentive fee capital gains (i.e., our realized capital gains on a cumulative basis from inception, calculated as of the end of the applicable period, net of all realized\ncapital losses and unrealized capital depreciation on a cumulative basis), less the aggregate amount of any previously paid capital gains incentive fees. On a quarterly basis, we accrue for the capital gains incentive fee by calculating such fee as if it were due and payable as of the end of such period.\nWhile the Investment Advisory and Management Agreement with MC Advisors neither includes nor contemplates the inclusion of unrealized gains in the calculation of the capital gains incentive fee, pursuant to an interpretation of an American Institute for Certified Public Accountants Technical Practice Aid for investment companies, we include unrealized gains in the calculation of the capital gains incentive fee expense and related accrued capital gains incentive fee. This accrual reflects the incentive fees that would be payable to MC Advisors if our entire portfolio was liquidated at its fair value as of the balance sheet date even though MC Advisors is not entitled to an incentive fee with respect to unrealized gains unless and until such gains are actually realized.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2016, we accrued capital gains incentive fees of $0.2 million based on the performance of our portfolio, none of which was payable to MC Advisors. During the year ended December 31, 2015, we did not accrue any capital gains incentive fees based on the performance of our portfolio. During the year ended December 31, 2014, we had a reduction in accrued capital gains incentive fees of $0.2 million, primarily as a result of declines in certain portfolio valuations.\nNew Accounting Pronouncements In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (\u201cFASB\u201d) issued Accounting Standards Update (\u201cASU\u201d) 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (ASC Topic 606) (\u201cASU 2014-09\u201d). The core principle of ASU 2014-09 is that an entity should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. To achieve that core principle, an entity should apply the following steps: Step 1: Identify the contract(s) with a customer. Step 2: Identify the performance obligations in the contract. Step 3: Determine the transaction price. Step 4: Allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract. Step 5: Recognize revenue when (or as) the entity satisfies a performance obligation.\nASU 2014-09 also specified the accounting for some costs to obtain or fulfill a contract with a customer. In addition, ASU 2014-09 requires that an entity disclose sufficient information to enable users of financial statements to understand the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from contracts with customers. The initial effective date of ASU 2014-09 was for fiscal periods beginning after December 15, 2016. However, in August 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-14, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (ASC Topic 606): Deferral of the Effective Date, which deferred the effective date to fiscal periods beginning after December 15, 2017. Management is currently evaluating the impact these changes will have on our consolidated financial statements and disclosures.\nIn February 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-02, Consolidation (ASC Topic 810): Amendments to the Consolidation Analysis (\u201cASU 2015-02\u201d). ASU 2015-02 significantly changes the consolidation analysis required under GAAP and ends the deferral granted to investment companies from applying the variable interest entity guidance. ASU 2015-02 is effective for interim and annual reporting periods in fiscal years that begin after December 15, 2015 and early adoption is permitted. We have adopted ASU 2015-02 and the adoption did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements and disclosures.\nIn April 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-03, Interest - Imputation of Interest (Subtopic 835-30): Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs (\u201cASU 2015-03\u201d). ASU 2015-03 requires that debt issuance costs related to a recognized debt liability be presented in the statements of assets and liabilities as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of that debt liability, consistent with debt discounts. The recognition and measurement guidance for debt issuance costs are not affected by the amendments in this ASU. ASU 2015-03 is effective for fiscal years that begin after December 15, 2015 and early adoption is permitted. We have adopted ASU 2015-03 and the revised presentation is reflected in our consolidated financial statements for the periods presented.\nIn January 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-01, Financial Instruments - Overall (Subtopic 825-10): Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities (\u201cASU 2016-01\u201d). ASU 2016-01\nretains many current requirements for the classification and measurement of financial instruments; however, it significantly revises an entity's accounting related to (1) the classification and measurement of investments in equity securities and (2) the presentation of certain fair value changes for financial liabilities measured at fair value. ASU 2016-01 also amends certain disclosure requirements associated with the fair value of financial instruments. This guidance is effective for annual and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2017, and early adoption is not permitted for public business entities. Management is currently evaluating the impact these changes will have on our consolidated financial statements and disclosures.\nIn November 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-18, Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Restricted Cash (\u201cASU 2016-18\u201d). ASU 2016-18 requires that the statements of cash flows explain the change during the period in the total of cash, cash equivalents, and amounts generally described as restricted cash or restricted cash equivalents. Therefore, amounts generally described as restricted cash and restricted cash equivalents should be included with cash and cash equivalents when reconciling the beginning-of-period and end-of-period total amounts shown on the statements of cash flows. The new guidance is effective for annual and interim periods, beginning after December 15, 2017, and early adoption is permitted and is to be applied on a retrospective basis. We have adopted ASU 2016-18 and the revised presentation is reflected in our consolidated financial statements for the periods presented.", "item_7_text": "ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following discussion should be read in conjunction with our audited consolidated financial statements and related notes and other financial information appearing elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. In addition to historical information, the following discussion and other parts of this Annual Report on Form 10-K contain forward-looking information that involves risks and uncertainties.\nPlease see \u201cRisk Factors\u201d and \u201cSpecial Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\u201d for a discussion of the uncertainties, risks and assumptions associated with these statements.\nOverview Monroe Capital Corporation is an externally managed, closed-end, non-diversified management investment company that has elected to be treated as a business development company (\u201cBDC\u201d) under the 1940 Act. In addition, for tax purposes, we have elected to be treated as a regulated investment company (\u201cRIC\u201d) under the subchapter M of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the \u201cCode\u201d). We were incorporated under the Maryland General Corporation Law on February 9, 2011. We are a specialty finance company focused on providing financing solutions primarily to lower middle-market companies in the United States. We provide customized financing solutions focused primarily on senior secured, junior secured and unitranche (a combination of senior secured and junior secured debt in the same facility in which we syndicate a \u201cfirst out\u201d portion of the loan to an investor and retain a \u201clast out\u201d portion of the loan) debt and, to a lesser extent, unsecured subordinated debt and equity, including equity co-investments in preferred and common stock, and warrants.\nOur shares are currently listed on the NASDAQ Global Select Market under the symbol \u201cMRCC.\u201d\nOur investment objective is to maximize the total return to our stockholders in the form of current income and capital appreciation through investment in senior, unitranche and junior secured debt and, to a lesser extent, subordinated debt and equity investments. We seek to use our extensive leveraged finance origination infrastructure and broad expertise in sourcing loans to invest in primarily senior, unitranche and junior secured debt of middle-market companies. Our investments in senior, unitranche, junior secured debt and other investments generally will range between $2.0 million and $18.0 million each, although this investment size may vary proportionately with the size of our capital base. As of December 31, 2016, our portfolio included approximately 66.7% senior secured debt, 12.5% unitranche secured debt, 14.4% junior secured debt and 6.4% equity securities compared to December 31, 2015, our portfolio included approximately 55.9% senior secured debt, 20.0% unitranche secured debt, 18.6% junior secured debt and 5.5% equity securities. We expect that the companies in which we invest may be leveraged, often as a result of leveraged buy-outs or other recapitalization transactions, and, in certain cases, will not be rated by national ratings agencies. If such companies were rated, we believe that they would typically receive a rating below investment grade (between BB and CCC under the Standard & Poor's system) from the national rating agencies.\nWhile our primary focus is to maximize current income and capital appreciation through debt investments in thinly traded or private U.S. companies, we may invest a portion of the portfolio in opportunistic investments in order to seek to enhance returns to stockholders. Such investments may include investments in high-yield bonds, distressed debt, private equity or securities of public companies that are not thinly traded and securities of middle-market companies located outside of the United States. We expect that these public companies generally will have debt securities that are non-investment grade.\nOn February 28, 2014, our wholly-owned subsidiary, Monroe Capital Corporation SBIC, LP (\u201cMRCC SBIC\u201d), a Delaware limited partnership, received a license from the Small Business Administration (\u201cSBA\u201d) to operate as a Small Business Investment Company (\u201cSBIC\u201d) under Section 301(c) of the Small Business Investment Act of 1958. MRCC SBIC commenced operations on September 16, 2013. As of December 31, 2016, MRCC SBIC had $41.0 million in leveragable capital and $51.5 million in SBA-guaranteed debentures outstanding. See \u201cSBA Debentures\u201d below for more information.\nInvestment income We generate interest income on the debt investments in portfolio company investments that we originate or acquire. Our debt investments, whether in the form of senior, junior or unitranche secured debt, typically have an initial term of three to seven years and bear interest at a fixed or floating rate. In some instances we receive payments on our debt investment based on scheduled amortization of the outstanding balances. In addition, we receive repayments of some of our debt investments prior to their scheduled maturity date. In some cases, our investments provide for deferred interest of payment-in-kind (\u201cPIK\u201d) interest. In addition, we may generate revenue in the form of commitment, origination, amendment, structuring or due diligence fees, fees for providing managerial assistance and consulting fees. Loan origination fees, original issue discount and market discount or premium are capitalized, and we accrete or amortize such amounts as interest income. We record prepayment premiums and prepayment gains (losses) on loans as interest income. As the frequency or volume of the repayments which trigger these prepayment premiums and prepayment gains (losses) may fluctuate significantly from period to period, the associated interest income recorded may also fluctuate significantly from period to period. Interest and fee income is recorded on the accrual basis to the extent we expect to collect such amounts. In addition, we also generate dividend income on preferred equity securities, common equity securities and LLC interests in accordance with our revenue recognition policies.\nExpenses Our primary operating expenses include the payment of fees to MC Advisors under the Investment Advisory and Management Agreement (management and incentive fees), and the payment of fees to Monroe Capital Management Advisors, LLC (\u201cMC Management\u201d) for our allocable portion of overhead and other expenses under the Administration Agreement and other operating costs. See Note 6 to our consolidated financial statements and \u201cRelated Party Transactions\u201d below for additional information on our Investment Advisory and Management Agreement and Administration agreement. Our expenses also include interest expense on our revolving credit facility, our SBA-guaranteed debentures and our secured borrowings. We bear all other out-of-pocket costs and expenses of our operations and transactions.\nNet gain (loss) on investments and secured borrowings We recognize realized gains or losses on investments based on the difference between the net proceeds from the disposition and the cost basis of the investment without regard to unrealized gains or losses previously recognized. We record current period changes in fair value of investments and secured borrowings within net change in unrealized appreciation (depreciation) on investments and net change in unrealized (appreciation) depreciation on secured borrowings, respectively, in the consolidated statements of operations.\nPortfolio and Investment Activity During the year ended December 31, 2016, we invested $105.2 million in 21 new portfolio companies and $42.6 million in 16 existing portfolio companies and had $81.4 million in aggregate amount of sales and principal repayments, resulting in net investments of $66.4 million for the year.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2015, we invested $144.8 million in 24 new portfolio companies and $48.8 million in 16 existing portfolio companies and had $88.4 million in aggregate amount of sales and principal repayments, resulting in net investments of $105.2 million for the year.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2014, we invested $120.4 million in 25 new portfolio companies and $11.8 million in six existing portfolio companies and had $107.1 million in aggregate amount of sales and principal repayments, resulting in net investments of $25.1 million for the year.\nThe following tables show the composition of the investment portfolio (in thousands) and associated yield data:\n\n\n (1) Based upon the par value of our debt investments and the cost basis of our preferred equity investments. \nThe shift in portfolio composition from December 31, 2015 primarily reflects our investment of a substantial portion of the capital from our public offering during the year ended December 31, 2016 into senior secured loan assets. The decline in effective rate reflects the general market yield pressure on new loans originated and acquired during the year ended December 31, 2016 and the shift in portfolio mix toward senior secured loans. Additionally, the placement of our investments in TPP Operating Inc. and Answers Corporation on non-accrual status during the year ended December 31, 2016 contributed to the decline in effective rates.\nThe following table shows the portfolio composition by industry grouping at fair value (dollars in thousands):\n\n\nPortfolio Asset Quality MC Advisors' portfolio management staff closely monitors all credits, with senior portfolio managers covering agented and more complex investments. MC Advisors segregates our capital markets investments by industry. The MC Advisors' monitoring process and projections developed by Monroe Capital both have daily, weekly, monthly and quarterly components and related reports, each to evaluate performance against historical, budget and underwriting expectations. MC Advisors' analysts will monitor performance using standard industry software tools to provide consistent disclosure of performance. MC Advisors also monitors our investment exposure using a proprietary trend analysis tool. When necessary, MC Advisors will update our internal risk ratings, borrowing base criteria and covenant compliance reports.\nAs part of the monitoring process, MC Advisors regularly assesses the risk profile of each of our investments and rates each of them based on an internal proprietary system that uses the categories listed below, which we refer to as MC Advisors' investment performance rating. For any investment rated in grades 3, 4 or 5, MC Advisors will increase its monitoring intensity and prepare regular updates for the investment committee, summarizing current operating results and material impending events and suggesting recommended actions. MC Advisors monitors and, when appropriate, changes the investment ratings assigned to each investment in our portfolio. In connection with our valuation process, MC Advisors reviews these investment ratings on a quarterly basis, and our board of directors (the \u201cBoard\u201d) reviews and affirms such ratings. A definition of the rating system follows:\n Investment Performance Risk Rating Summary Description Grade 1 Includes investments exhibiting the least amount of risk in our portfolio. The issuer is performing above expectations or the issuer's operating trends and risk factors are generally positive. Grade 2 Includes investments exhibiting an acceptable level of risk that is similar to the risk at the time of origination. The issuer is generally performing as expected or the risk factors are neutral to positive. Grade 3 Includes investments performing below expectations and indicates that the investment's risk has increased somewhat since origination. The issuer may be out of compliance with debt covenants; however, scheduled loan payments are generally not past due. Grade 4 Includes an issuer performing materially below expectations and indicates that the issuer's risk has increased materially since origination. In addition to the issuer being generally out of compliance with debt covenants, scheduled loan payments may be past due (but generally not more than six months past due). For grade 4 investments, we intend to increase monitoring of the issuer. \n Investment Performance Risk Rating Summary Description Grade 5 Indicates that the issuer is performing substantially below expectations and the investment risk has substantially increased since origination. Most or all of the debt covenants are out of compliance or payments are substantially delinquent. Investments graded 5 are not anticipated to be repaid in full and we will reduce the fair market value of the loan to the amount we expect to recover. \nOur investment performance risk ratings do not constitute any rating of investments by a nationally recognized statistical rating organization or reflect or represent any third-party assessment of any of our investments.\nIn the event of a delinquency or a decision to rate an investment grade 4 or grade 5, the applicable analyst, in consultation with a member of the investment committee, will develop an action plan. Such a plan may require a meeting with the borrower's management or the lender group to discuss reasons for the default and the steps management is undertaking to address the under-performance, as well as required amendments and waivers that may be required. In the event of a dramatic deterioration of a credit, MC Advisors intends to form a team or engage outside advisors to analyze, evaluate and take further steps to preserve its value in the credit. In this regard, we would expect to explore all options, including in a private equity sponsored investment, assuming certain responsibilities for the private equity sponsor or a formal sale of the business with oversight of the sale process by us. Several of Monroe Capital's professionals are experienced in running debt work-out transactions and bankruptcies.\nThe following table shows the distribution of our investments on the 1 to 5 investment performance rating scale as of December 31, 2016 (dollars in thousands):\n\nThe following table shows the distribution of our investments on the 1 to 5 investment performance rating scale as of December 31, 2015 (dollars in thousands):\n\nResults of Operations Operating results are as follows (dollars in thousands):\n\nInvestment Income The composition of our investment income was as follows (dollars in thousands):\n\nThe increase in investment income of $8.1 million during the year ended December 31, 2016 is primarily due to an increase in average outstanding loan balances and increases in dividend income, partially offset by declines in the effective yield on the investment portfolio. The increase in investment income of $7.0 million during the year ended December 31, 2015 is primarily due to an increase in average outstanding loan balances.\nOperating Expenses The composition of our operating expenses was as follows (dollars in thousands):\n\nThe composition of our interest and other debt financing expenses was as follows (dollars in thousands):\n\nThe increase in expenses of $4.4 million during the year ended December 31, 2016 is primarily due to an increase in base management fees and incentive fees primarily due to the growth in invested assets. Increases in interest expense also contributed to the increase in expenses during the year ended December 31, 2016 as a result of additional borrowings (including SBA-guaranteed debenture borrowings) required to support the growth of the portfolio. The increase in expenses of $3.3 million during the year ended December 31, 2015 is primarily due to an increase in base management fees due to the growth in invested assets and increased incentive fees resulting from improvement in performance. Increases in interest expense also contributed to the increase in expenses during the year ended December 31, 2015 as a result of additional borrowings (including SBA-guaranteed debentures) required to support the growth of the portfolio.\nNet Realized Gain (Loss) on Investments During the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, we had sales of investments of $0.6 million, $0.4 million and $19.0 million, respectively, resulting in net realized gain (loss) on investments of $0.6 million, $0.3 million and $0.3 million, respectively.\nNet Change in Unrealized Appreciation (Depreciation) on Investments and Secured Borrowings For the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, our investments had $1.3 million, ($1.1) million and ($1.5) million of net change in unrealized appreciation (depreciation), respectively. Net change in unrealized appreciation (depreciation) includes both unrealized appreciation on investments in our portfolio with mark-to-market gains during the year and unrealized depreciation on investments in our portfolio with mark-to-market losses during the year. During the year ended December 31, 2016, one of our portfolio companies, TPP Operating, Inc. (formerly TPP Acquisition, Inc., collectively, \u201cTPP\u201d) filed for bankruptcy and underwent a restructuring process. Net unrealized depreciation on our investments in TPP were $5.1 million and $5.7 million during the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. See Note 5 in our attached consolidated financial statements for additional information on the TPP restructuring and the valuation of these investments. For the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014 our secured borrowings had ($0.1) million, ($0.1) million and $0.1 million of net change in unrealized (appreciation) depreciation, respectively.\nNet Increase (Decrease) in Net Assets Resulting from Operations For the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, we recorded a net increase in net assets resulting from operations of $24.4 million, $17.9 million and $13.9 million, respectively. Based on the weighted average shares of common stock outstanding for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014 our per share net increase in net assets resulting from operations was $1.68, $1.53 and $1.45, respectively. The increase of $6.5 million during the year ended December 31, 2016 is primarily the result of increases in net investment income due to portfolio growth and increases in net unrealized appreciation in the investment portfolio. The increase of $4.0 million during the year ended December 31, 2015 is primarily the result of increases in net investment income due to portfolio growth.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources As of December 31, 2016, we had $6.0 million in cash, $2.4 million in cash at MRCC SBIC, $129.0 million of total debt outstanding on our revolving credit facility and $51.5 million in outstanding\nSBA-guaranteed debentures. We had $31.0 million available for additional borrowings on our revolving credit facility and $63.5 million in available SBA-guaranteed debentures. See \u201cBorrowings\u201d below for additional information.\nCash Flows For the year ended December 31, 2016, we experienced a net decrease in cash and restricted cash of $5.5 million. During the same period we used $51.9 million in operating activities, primarily as a result of purchases of portfolio investments, partially offset by sales of and principal repayments on portfolio investments. During the same year, we generated $46.3 million from financing activities, principally from net proceeds from our capital raises during the period, net borrowings on our revolving credit facility and SBA-guaranteed debenture borrowings, partially offset by distributions to stockholders and decreases in secured borrowings.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2015, we experienced a net increase in cash and restricted cash of $8.1 million. During the same period we used $82.7 million in operating activities, primarily as a result of purchases of portfolio investments, partially offset by sales of and principal repayments on portfolio investments. During the same period, we generated $90.8 million from financing activities, principally from net proceeds from our capital raises during the period, net borrowings on our revolving credit facility and SBA-guaranteed debenture borrowings, partially offset by distributions to stockholders and decreases in secured borrowings.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2014, we experienced a net decrease in cash and restricted cash of $8.9 million. During the same period we used $11.5 million in operating activities, primarily as a result of purchases of portfolio investments, partially offset by sales of and principal repayments on portfolio investments. During the same period, we generated $2.6 million from financing activities, principally from net borrowings on our revolving credit facility and SBA-guaranteed debenture borrowings, partially offset by distributions to stockholders, repurchases of our common stock and decreases in secured borrowings.\nCapital Resources As a BDC, we distribute substantially all of our net income to our stockholders and have an ongoing need to raise additional capital for investment purposes. We intend to generate additional cash primarily from future offerings of securities, future borrowings and cash flows from operations, including income earned from investments in our portfolio companies. On both a short-term and long-term basis, our primary use of funds will be to invest in portfolio companies and make cash distributions to our stockholders.\nAs a BDC, we are generally not permitted to issue and sell our common stock at a price below net asset value per share. We may, however, sell our common stock, or warrants, options or rights to acquire our common stock, at a price below the then-current net asset value per share of our common stock if our Board, including independent directors, determines that such sale is in the best interests of us and our stockholders, and if our stockholders approved such sales. On July 14, 2016, our stockholders voted to allow us to sell or otherwise issue common stock at a price below net asset value per share for a period of one year, subject to certain limitations. As of December 31, 2016 and 2015, we had 16,581,869 and 13,008,007 shares outstanding, respectively.\nOn June 24, 2015, our stockholders approved a proposal to authorize us to issue warrants, options or rights to subscribe to, convert to, or purchase our common stock in one or more offerings. This is a standing authorization and does not require annual re-approval by our stockholders.\nStock Issuances: On February 6, 2015, we entered into an at-the-market (\u201cATM\u201d) securities offering program with MLV & Co. LLC and JMP Securities LLC through which we may sell, by means of ATM offerings from time to time, up to $50.0 million of our common stock. During the year ended December 31, 2015, we sold 672,597 shares at an average price of $14.88 per share for gross proceeds of $10.0 million under the ATM program. Aggregate underwriters' discounts and commissions were $0.2 million and offering costs were $0.08 million, resulting in net proceeds of approximately $9.8 million.\nOn April 20, 2015, we closed a public offering of 2,450,000 shares of its common stock at a public offering price of $14.85 per share, raising approximately $36.4 million in gross proceeds. On May 18, 2015,\nwe sold an additional 367,500 shares of our common stock, at a public offering price of $14.85 per share, raising approximately $5.5 million in gross proceeds pursuant to the underwriters' exercise of the over-allotment option. Aggregate underwriters discounts and commissions were $1.7 million and offering costs were $0.3 million, resulting in net proceeds of $39.9 million on these non-ATM program issuances during the year ended December 31, 2015.\nOn July 1, 2016, we entered into an amendment to MLV's equity distribution agreement and an assignment agreement to replace MLV with FBR Capital Markets & Co., an affiliate of MLV. During the year ended December 31, 2016, we did not make any sales of our common stock under the ATM program.\nOn July 25, 2016, we closed a public offering of 3,100,000 shares of our common stock at a public offering price of $15.50 per share, raising approximately $48.1 million in gross proceeds. On August 3, 2016, we sold an additional 465,000 shares of our common stock, at a public offering price of $15.50 per share, raising approximately $7.2 million in gross proceeds pursuant to the underwriters' exercise of the over-allotment option. Aggregate underwriters' discounts and commissions were $2.2 million and offering costs were $0.5 million, resulting in net proceeds of $52.5 million.\nBorrowings Revolving Credit Facility: As of December 31, 2016 and 2015, we had $129.0 million and $123.7 million outstanding, respectively, under our revolving credit facility with ING Capital LLC, as agent, to finance the purchase of our assets. As of December 31, 2016 and 2015, the maximum amount we were able to borrow under the revolving credit facility was $160.0 million and this maximum borrowing can be increased to $300.0 million pursuant to an accordion feature (subject to maintaining 200% asset coverage, as defined by the 1940 Act). The maturity date on the facility is December 14, 2020.\nThe revolving credit facility is secured by a lien on all of our assets, including cash on hand, but excluding the assets of our wholly-owned subsidiary, MRCC SBIC. Our ability to borrow under the revolving credit facility is subject to availability under a defined borrowing base, which varies based on our portfolio characteristics and certain eligibility criteria and concentration limits, as well as required valuation methodologies. We may make draws under the revolving credit facility to make or purchase additional investments through December 2019 and for general working capital purposes until the maturity date of the revolving credit facility. Borrowings under the revolving credit facility bear interest, at our election, at an annual rate of LIBOR (one-month, two-month, three-month or six-month at our discretion based on the term of the borrowing) plus 3.00%, with a further step-down to LIBOR plus 2.75% when net worth (excluding investments in MRCC SBIC) exceeds $225.0 million or at a daily rate equal to 2.00% per annum plus the greater of the prime interest rate, the federal funds rate plus 0.5% or LIBOR plus 1.0%. In addition to the stated interest rate on borrowings under the revolving credit facility, we are required to pay a fee of 0.5% per annum on any unused portion of the revolving credit facility if the unused portion of the facility is less than 65% of the then available maximum borrowing or a fee of 1.0% per annum on any unused portion of the revolving credit facility if the unused portion of the facility is greater than or equal to 65% of the then available maximum borrowing. As of December 31, 2016 and 2015, the outstanding borrowings were accruing at an average interest rate of 3.8% and 3.4% (based on one-month LIBOR), respectively. The weighted average interest rate of our revolving credit facility borrowings (excluding debt issuance costs) for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014 was 3.6%, 3.6% and 3.4%, respectively. The weighted average fee rate on our unused portion of the revolving credit facility for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014 was 0.5%, 0.5% and 0.5%, respectively.\nOur ability to borrow under the revolving credit facility is subject to availability under the borrowing base, which permits us to borrow up to 70% of the fair market value of our portfolio company investments depending on the type of the investment we hold and whether the investment is quoted. Our ability to borrow is also subject to certain concentration limits, and our continued compliance with the representations, warranties and covenants given by us under the facility. The revolving credit facility contains certain financial and restrictive covenants, including, but not limited to, our maintenance of: (1) a minimum consolidated net worth at least equal to the greater of (a) 40% of the consolidated total assets on the last day of each quarter or (b) $120.0 million plus 65% of the net proceeds to us from sales of our securities after December 14, 2015; (2) a ratio of total assets (less total liabilities other than indebtedness) to total indebtedness of not less than\n2.1 times; and (3) a ratio of earnings before interest and taxes to interest expense of at least 2.5 times. The credit facility also requires us to undertake customary indemnification obligations with respect to ING Capital LLC and other members of the lending group and to reimburse the lenders for expenses associated with entering into the credit facility. The revolving credit facility also has customary provisions regarding events of default, including events of default for nonpayment, change in control transactions at both Monroe Capital Corporation and MC Advisors, failure to comply with financial and negative covenants, and failure to maintain our relationship with MC Advisors. If we incur an event of default under the revolving credit facility and fail to remedy such default under any applicable grace period, if any, then the entire revolving credit facility could become immediately due and payable, which would materially and adversely affect our liquidity, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nOur revolving credit facility also imposes certain conditions that may limit the amount of our distributions to stockholders. Distributions payable in our common stock under the DRIP are not limited by the revolving credit facility. Distributions in cash or property other than common stock are generally limited to 115% of the amount of distributions required to maintain our status as a RIC.\nSBA Debentures: On February 28, 2014, our wholly-owned subsidiary, MRCC SBIC, received a license from the SBA to operate as a SBIC under Section 301(c) of the Small Business Investment Act of 1958, as amended. MRCC SBIC commenced operations on September 16, 2013.\nThe SBIC license allows MRCC SBIC to obtain leverage by issuing SBA-guaranteed debentures, subject to the issuance of a leverage commitment by the SBA and other customary procedures. SBA-guaranteed debentures are non-recourse, interest only debentures with interest payable semi-annually and have a ten year maturity. The principal amount of SBA-guaranteed debentures is not required to be paid prior to maturity but may be prepaid at any time without penalty. The interest rate of SBA-guaranteed debentures is fixed on a semi-annual basis (pooling date) at a market-driven spread over U.S. Treasury Notes with 10-year maturities. The SBA, as a creditor, has a superior claim to MRCC SBIC's assets over our stockholders in the event we liquidate MRCC SBIC or the SBA exercises its remedies upon an event of default.\nSBA regulations currently limit the amount that an individual SBIC may borrow to a maximum of $150.0 million when it has at least $75.0 million in regulatory capital, receives a leverage commitment from the SBA and has been through an audit examination by the SBA subsequent to licensing. The SBA also historically limited a related group of SBICs (commonly referred to as a \u201cfamily of funds\u201d) to a maximum of $225.0 million in total borrowings. On December 18, 2015, this family of funds limitation was raised to $350.0 million in total borrowings. As we have other affiliated SBICs already in operation, MRCC SBIC was historically limited to a maximum of $40.0 million in borrowings. Pursuant to the increase in the family of funds limitation, we submitted a commitment application to the SBA and on April 13, 2016 we were approved for $75.0 million in additional SBA-guaranteed debentures for MRCC SBIC for a total of $115.0 million in available debentures.\nAs of December 31, 2016, MRCC SBIC had $41.0 million in leveragable capital and $51.5 million in SBA-guaranteed debentures outstanding. In order to gain access to the entirety of the $63.5 million in remaining available debentures, we would be required to contribute to MRCC SBIC an additional $16.5 million in leveragable capital. As of December 31, 2015, MRCC SBIC had $20.0 million in leveragable capital and $40.0 million in SBA-guaranteed debentures outstanding.\nAs of December 31, 2016, MRCC SBIC had the following SBA-guaranteed debentures outstanding (dollars in thousands):\n\n (1) Represents an interim rate of interest as the SBA-guaranteed debentures have not yet pooled. \nAs of December 31, 2015, MRCC SBIC had the following SBA-guaranteed debentures outstanding (dollars in thousands):\n\nOn October 2, 2014, we were granted exemptive relief from the SEC for permission to exclude the debt of MRCC SBIC guaranteed by the SBA from the 200% asset coverage test under the 1940 Act. The receipt of this exemption for this SBA-guaranteed debt increases flexibility under the 200% asset coverage test.\nSecured Borrowings: Certain partial loan sales do not qualify for sale accounting under ASC Topic 860 - Transfers and Servicing (\u201cASC Topic 860\u201d) because these sales do not meet the definition of a \u201cparticipating interest,\u201d as defined in the guidance, in order for sale treatment to be allowed. Participations or other partial loan sales which do not meet the definition of a participating interest remain as an investment on the accompanying consolidated statements of assets and liabilities and the portion sold is recorded as a secured borrowing in the liabilities section of the consolidated statements of assets and liabilities. For these partial loan sales, the interest earned on the entire loan balance is recorded within \u201cinterest income\u201d and the interest earned by the buyer in the partial loan sale is recorded within \u201cinterest and other debt financing expenses\u201d in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations.\nAs of December 31, 2016, secured borrowings at fair value totaled $1.3 million and the fair value of the loans that are associated with these secured borrowings was $5.8 million. As of December 31, 2015, secured borrowings at fair value totaled $2.5 million and the fair value of the loans that are associated with these secured borrowings was $11.8 million. These secured borrowings were created as a result of our completion of partial loan sales of certain unitranche loan assets during the year ended December 31, 2013, that did not meet the definition of a \u201cparticipating interest.\u201d As a result, sale treatment was not allowed and these partial loan sales were treated as secured borrowings. No such partial loan sales occurred during the year ended December 31, 2016 and 2015. During the year ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, repayments on secured borrowings totaled $1.2 million and $1.6 million, respectively. The weighted average interest rate on our secured borrowings was approximately 6.3% and 5.8% as of December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively.\nShare Repurchase Plan On November 11, 2013, our Board approved a share repurchase plan (\u201cPlan\u201d) under which up to $7.5 million of our outstanding common stock was allowed to be acquired in the open market at prices below our NAV as reported in our then most recently published consolidated financial statements. The Plan was implemented at the discretion of management and expired on November 10, 2014.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2014, we repurchased 400,359 shares of common stock in open market transactions for an aggregate cost (including transaction costs) of $5.2 million. Over the life of the Plan, we repurchased 485,162 shares of common stock in open market transactions for an aggregate cost (including transaction costs) of $6.3 million. We are incorporated in Maryland and under the law of that state, shares repurchased are considered retired (repurchased shares become authorized but unissued shares) rather than treasury stock. As a result, the cost of stock repurchases is recorded as a reduction to capital in excess of par value on the consolidated statements of changes in net assets.\nDistribution Policy Our Board will determine the timing and amount, if any, of our distributions. We intend to pay distributions on a quarterly basis. In order to avoid corporate-level tax on the income we distribute as a RIC, we must distribute to our stockholders at least 90% of our ordinary income and realized net short-term capital gains in excess of realized net long-term capital losses, if any, on an annual basis out of the assets legally available for such distributions. In addition, we also intend to distribute any realized net capital gains (i.e., realized net long-term capital gains in excess of realized net short-term capital losses) at least annually\nout of the assets legally available for such distributions. Distributions to stockholders for years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014 totaled $20.6 million ($1.40 per share), $16.7 million ($1.40 per share) and $13.0 million ($1.36 per share), respectively, none of which represented return of capital.\nWe have adopted an \u201copt out\u201d dividend reinvestment plan (\u201cDRIP\u201d) for our common stockholders. As a result, if we declare a distribution, our stockholders' cash distributions will be automatically reinvested in additional shares of our common stock unless a stockholder specifically \u201copts out\u201d of our DRIP. If a stockholder opts out, that stockholder will receive cash distributions. Although distributions paid in the form of additional shares of our common stock will generally be subject to U.S. federal, state and local taxes in the same manner as cash distributions, stockholders participating in our DRIP will not receive any corresponding cash distributions with which to pay any such applicable taxes.\nRelated Party Transactions We have a number of business relationships with affiliated or related parties, including the following:\n \u2022 We have an Investment Advisory and Management Agreement with MC Advisors, an investment advisor registered with the SEC, to manage our day-to-day operating and investing activities. We pay MC Advisors a fee for its services under the Investment Advisory and Management Agreement consisting of two components - a base management fee and an incentive fee. See Note 6 to our consolidated financial statements and \u201cSignificant Accounting Estimates and Critical Accounting Policies - Capital Gains Incentive Fee\u201d for additional information. \n \u2022 We have an Administration Agreement with MC Management to provide us with the office facilities and administrative services necessary to conduct our day-to-day operations. See Note 6 to our consolidated financial statements for additional information. \n \u2022 Theodore L. Koenig, our Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of our Board is also a manager of MC Advisors and the President and Chief Executive Officer of MC Management. Aaron D. Peck, our Chief Financial Officer and Chief Investment Officer, serves as a director on our Board and is also a managing director of MC Management. \n \u2022 We have a license agreement with Monroe Capital LLC, under which Monroe Capital LLC has agreed to grant us a non-exclusive, royalty-free license to use the name \u201cMonroe Capital\u201d for specified purposes in our business. \nIn addition, we have adopted a formal code of ethics that governs the conduct of MC Advisors' officers, directors and employees. Our officers and directors also remain subject to the duties imposed by both the 1940 Act and Maryland General Corporation Law.\nContractual Obligations and Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements The following table shows our significant contractual payment obligations for repayment as of December 31, 2016 (dollars in thousands):\n\n (1) Unfunded commitments represent all amounts unfunded as of December 31, 2016. These amounts may or may not be funded to the borrowing party now or in the future. The unfunded commitments relate to loans with various maturity dates, but we are showing this amount in the less than one year category as this entire amount was eligible for funding to the borrowers as of December 31, 2016. \n (2) Total contractual obligations excludes $1.3 million of secured borrowings. \nWe may become a party to financial instruments with off-balance sheet risk in the normal course of our business to meet the financial needs of our portfolio companies. These instruments may include commitments\nto extend credit and involve, to varying degrees, elements of liquidity and credit risk in excess of the amount recognized in the consolidated statements of assets and liabilities.\nIf any of the contractual obligations discussed above are terminated, our costs under any new agreements that we enter into may increase.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements We have no off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources.\nMarket Trends We have identified the following trends that may affect our business:\nTarget Market: We believe that small and middle-market companies in the United States with annual revenues between $10.0 million and $2.5 billion represent a significant growth segment of the U.S. economy and often require substantial capital investments to grow. Middle-market companies have generated a significant number of investment opportunities for investment funds managed or advised by Monroe Capital, and we believe that this market segment will continue to produce significant investment opportunities for us.\nSpecialized Lending Requirements: We believe that several factors render many U.S. financial institutions ill-suited to lend to U.S. middle-market companies. For example, based on the experience of our management team, lending to U.S. middle-market companies (1) is generally more labor intensive than lending to larger companies due to the smaller size of each investment and the fragmented nature of information for such companies, (2) requires due diligence and underwriting practices consistent with the demands and economic limitations of the middle-market and (3) may also require more extensive ongoing monitoring by the lender.\nDemand for Debt Capital: We believe there is a large pool of uninvested private equity capital for middle-market companies. We expect private equity firms will seek to leverage their investments by combining equity capital with senior secured loans and mezzanine debt from other sources, such as us.\nCompetition from Other Lenders: We believe that many traditional bank lenders, in recent years, de-emphasized their service and product offerings to middle-market businesses in favor of lending to large corporate clients and managing capital market transactions. In addition, many commercial banks face significant balance sheet constraints as they seek to build capital and meet future regulatory capital requirements. These factors may result in opportunities for alternative funding sources to middle-market companies and therefore drive increased new investment opportunities for us. Conversely, there is increased competitive pressure in the BDC and investment company marketplace for senior and subordinated debt which could result in lower yields for increasingly riskier assets.\nPricing and Deal Structures: We believe that the volatility in global markets over the last several years and current macroeconomic issues such as a weakened U.S. economy has reduced access to, and availability of, debt capital to middle-market companies, causing a reduction in competition and generally more favorable capital structures and deal terms. Recent capital raises in the BDC and investment company marketplace have created increased competition; however, we believe that current market conditions may continue to create favorable opportunities to invest at attractive risk-adjusted returns.\nRecent Developments On February 22, 2017, we closed a $40.0 million upsize to our revolving credit facility led by ING, from $160.0 million to $200.0 million in revolving commitments, in accordance with the facility's accordion feature.\nOn March 7, 2017, the Board declared a quarterly dividend of $0.35 per share payable on March 31, 2017 to holders of record on March 17, 2017.\nSignificant Accounting Estimates and Critical Accounting Policies Revenue Recognition We record interest and fee income on an accrual basis to the extent that we expect to collect such amounts. For loans and debt securities with contractual PIK interest, we do not accrue PIK interest if the portfolio company valuation indicates that such PIK interest is not collectible. We do not accrue as a receivable interest on loans and debt securities if we have reason to doubt our ability to collect such interest. Loan origination fees, original issue discount and market discount or premium is capitalized, and we then amortize such amounts using the effective interest method as interest income over the life of the investment. Upon the prepayment of a loan or debt security, any unamortized premium or discount or loan origination fees are recorded as interest income. We record prepayment premiums on loans and debt securities as interest income when we receive such amounts.\nDividend income on preferred equity securities is recorded as dividend income on an accrual basis to the extent that such amounts are payable by the portfolio company and are expected to be collected. Dividend income on common equity securities is recorded on the record date for private portfolio companies. Each distribution received from limited liability company (\u201cLLC\u201d) and limited partnership (\u201cLP\u201d) investments is evaluated to determine if the distribution should be recorded as dividend income or a return of capital. Generally, we will not record distributions from equity investments in LLCs and LPs as dividend income unless there are sufficient accumulated tax-basis earnings and profits in the LLC or LP prior to the distribution. Distributions that are classified as a return of capital are recorded as a reduction in the cost basis of the investment.\nValuation of Portfolio Investments As a BDC, we generally invest in illiquid securities including debt and, to a lesser extent, equity securities of middle-market companies. Under procedures established by our Board, we value investments for which market quotations are readily available and within a recent date at such market quotations. We obtain these market values from an independent pricing service or at the mean between the bid and ask prices obtained from at least two brokers or dealers (if available, otherwise by a principal market maker or a primary market dealer). When doing so, we determine whether the quote obtained is sufficient in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (\u201cGAAP\u201d) to determine the fair value of the security. Investments purchased within 60 days of maturity are valued at cost plus accreted discount, or minus amortized premium, which approximates fair value.\nOur Board is ultimately and solely responsible for determining the fair value of the portfolio investments that are not publicly traded, whose market prices are not readily available on a quarterly basis in good faith or any other situation where portfolio investments require a fair value determination. Because we expect that there will not be a readily available market for many of the investments in our portfolio, we expect to value many of our portfolio investments at fair value as determined in good faith by our Board using a documented valuation policy and a consistently applied valuation process. Due to the inherent uncertainty of determining the fair value of investments that do not have a readily available market value, the fair value of our investments may differ significantly from the values that would have been used had a readily available market value existed for such investments, and the differences could be material.\nWith respect to investments for which market quotations are not readily available, our Board undertakes a multi-step valuation process each quarter, as described below:\n \u2022 the quarterly valuation process begins with each portfolio company or investment being initially evaluated and rated by the investment professionals responsible for the credit monitoring of the portfolio investment; \n \u2022 preliminary valuation conclusions are then documented and discussed with the investment committee; \n \u2022 our Board engages one or more independent valuation firm(s) to conduct fair value appraisals of material investments for which market quotations are not readily available. These fair value appraisals for material investments are received at least once in every calendar year for each portfolio company investment, but are generally received quarterly; \n \u2022 our audit committee of the Board reviews the preliminary valuations of MC Advisors and of the independent valuation firm(s) and responds and supplements the valuation recommendations to reflect any comments; and \n \u2022 our Board discusses these valuations and determines the fair value of each investment in the portfolio in good faith, based on the input of MC Advisors, the independent valuation firm(s) and the audit committee. \nThe Board, together with our independent valuation firms, generally uses the yield approach to determine fair value for loans where market quotations are not readily available, as long as it is appropriate. If there is deterioration in credit quality or a debt investment is in workout status, we may consider other factors in determining the fair value, including the value attributable to the debt investment from the enterprise value of the portfolio company under the market approach or the proceeds that would be received in a liquidation analysis. We generally consider our debt to be performing if the borrower is not in default, the borrower is remitting payments in a timely manner; the loan is in covenant compliance or is otherwise not deemed to be impaired. In determining the fair value of the performing debt, the Company considers fluctuations in current interest rates, the trends in yields of debt instruments with similar credit ratings, financial condition of the borrower, economic conditions and other relevant factors, both qualitative and quantitative. In the event that a debt instrument is not performing, as defined above, we will evaluate the value of the collateral utilizing the same framework described above for a performing loan to determine the value of the loan.\nUnder the yield approach, we utilize discounted cash flow models to determine the present value of the future cash flow streams of our debt investments, based on future interest and principal payments as set forth in the associated loan agreements. In determining fair value under the yield approach, we also consider the following factors: applicable market yields and leverage levels, credit quality, prepayment penalties, the nature and realizable value of any collateral, the portfolio company's ability to make payments, and changes in the interest rate environment and the credit markets that generally may affect the price at which similar investments may be made.\nUnder the market approach, we typically use the enterprise value methodology to determine the fair value of an investment. There is no one methodology to estimate enterprise value and, in fact, for any one portfolio company, enterprise value is generally best expressed as a range of values, from which we derive a single estimate of enterprise value. In estimating the enterprise value of a portfolio company, we analyzes various factors consistent with industry practice, including but not limited to original transaction multiples, the portfolio company's historical and projected financial results, applicable market trading and transaction comparables, applicable market yields and leverage levels, the nature and realizable value of any collateral, the markets in which the portfolio company does business, and comparisons of financial ratios of peer companies that are public. Typically, the enterprise values of private companies are based on multiples of earnings before interest, income taxes, depreciation and amortization (\u201cEBITDA\u201d), cash flows, net income, revenues, or in limited cases, book value.\nNet Realized Gains or Losses and Net Change in Unrealized Appreciation or Depreciation We measure realized gains or losses by the difference between the net proceeds from the sale and the amortized cost basis of the investment, without regard to unrealized appreciation or depreciation previously recognized. Net change in unrealized appreciation or depreciation reflects the change in portfolio investment values during the reporting period, including any reversal of previously recorded unrealized appreciation or depreciation, when gains or losses are realized. We report changes in the fair value of secured borrowings that are measured at fair value as a component of the net change in unrealized (appreciation) depreciation on secured borrowings in the consolidated statements of operations.\nCapital Gains Incentive Fee Pursuant to the terms of the Investment Advisory and Management Agreement with MC Advisors, the incentive fee on capital gains earned on liquidated investments of our portfolio is determined and payable in arrears as of the end of each calendar year (or upon termination of the investment advisory and administrative services agreement). This fee equals 20.0% of our incentive fee capital gains (i.e., our realized capital gains on a cumulative basis from inception, calculated as of the end of the applicable period, net of all realized\ncapital losses and unrealized capital depreciation on a cumulative basis), less the aggregate amount of any previously paid capital gains incentive fees. On a quarterly basis, we accrue for the capital gains incentive fee by calculating such fee as if it were due and payable as of the end of such period.\nWhile the Investment Advisory and Management Agreement with MC Advisors neither includes nor contemplates the inclusion of unrealized gains in the calculation of the capital gains incentive fee, pursuant to an interpretation of an American Institute for Certified Public Accountants Technical Practice Aid for investment companies, we include unrealized gains in the calculation of the capital gains incentive fee expense and related accrued capital gains incentive fee. This accrual reflects the incentive fees that would be payable to MC Advisors if our entire portfolio was liquidated at its fair value as of the balance sheet date even though MC Advisors is not entitled to an incentive fee with respect to unrealized gains unless and until such gains are actually realized.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2016, we accrued capital gains incentive fees of $0.2 million based on the performance of our portfolio, none of which was payable to MC Advisors. During the year ended December 31, 2015, we did not accrue any capital gains incentive fees based on the performance of our portfolio. During the year ended December 31, 2014, we had a reduction in accrued capital gains incentive fees of $0.2 million, primarily as a result of declines in certain portfolio valuations.\nNew Accounting Pronouncements In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (\u201cFASB\u201d) issued Accounting Standards Update (\u201cASU\u201d) 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (ASC Topic 606) (\u201cASU 2014-09\u201d). The core principle of ASU 2014-09 is that an entity should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. To achieve that core principle, an entity should apply the following steps: Step 1: Identify the contract(s) with a customer. Step 2: Identify the performance obligations in the contract. Step 3: Determine the transaction price. Step 4: Allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract. Step 5: Recognize revenue when (or as) the entity satisfies a performance obligation.\nASU 2014-09 also specified the accounting for some costs to obtain or fulfill a contract with a customer. In addition, ASU 2014-09 requires that an entity disclose sufficient information to enable users of financial statements to understand the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from contracts with customers. The initial effective date of ASU 2014-09 was for fiscal periods beginning after December 15, 2016. However, in August 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-14, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (ASC Topic 606): Deferral of the Effective Date, which deferred the effective date to fiscal periods beginning after December 15, 2017. Management is currently evaluating the impact these changes will have on our consolidated financial statements and disclosures.\nIn February 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-02, Consolidation (ASC Topic 810): Amendments to the Consolidation Analysis (\u201cASU 2015-02\u201d). ASU 2015-02 significantly changes the consolidation analysis required under GAAP and ends the deferral granted to investment companies from applying the variable interest entity guidance. ASU 2015-02 is effective for interim and annual reporting periods in fiscal years that begin after December 15, 2015 and early adoption is permitted. We have adopted ASU 2015-02 and the adoption did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements and disclosures.\nIn April 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-03, Interest - Imputation of Interest (Subtopic 835-30): Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs (\u201cASU 2015-03\u201d). ASU 2015-03 requires that debt issuance costs related to a recognized debt liability be presented in the statements of assets and liabilities as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of that debt liability, consistent with debt discounts. The recognition and measurement guidance for debt issuance costs are not affected by the amendments in this ASU. ASU 2015-03 is effective for fiscal years that begin after December 15, 2015 and early adoption is permitted. We have adopted ASU 2015-03 and the revised presentation is reflected in our consolidated financial statements for the periods presented.\nIn January 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-01, Financial Instruments - Overall (Subtopic 825-10): Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities (\u201cASU 2016-01\u201d). ASU 2016-01\nretains many current requirements for the classification and measurement of financial instruments; however, it significantly revises an entity's accounting related to (1) the classification and measurement of investments in equity securities and (2) the presentation of certain fair value changes for financial liabilities measured at fair value. ASU 2016-01 also amends certain disclosure requirements associated with the fair value of financial instruments. This guidance is effective for annual and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2017, and early adoption is not permitted for public business entities. Management is currently evaluating the impact these changes will have on our consolidated financial statements and disclosures.\nIn November 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-18, Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Restricted Cash (\u201cASU 2016-18\u201d). ASU 2016-18 requires that the statements of cash flows explain the change during the period in the total of cash, cash equivalents, and amounts generally described as restricted cash or restricted cash equivalents. Therefore, amounts generally described as restricted cash and restricted cash equivalents should be included with cash and cash equivalents when reconciling the beginning-of-period and end-of-period total amounts shown on the statements of cash flows. The new guidance is effective for annual and interim periods, beginning after December 15, 2017, and early adoption is permitted and is to be applied on a retrospective basis. We have adopted ASU 2016-18 and the revised presentation is reflected in our consolidated financial statements for the periods presented.", "item_7_tables": "Table 158: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>

solutions to lower middle-market companies in the US. Its investment objective is to maximize total return through senior, unitranche and junior secured debt and equity investments.\n\n- As of December 31, 2016, the portfolio was comprised of 66.7% senior secured debt, 12.5% unitranche loans, 14.4% junior secured debt and 6.4% equity securities. This represents a shift towards more senior secured loan assets compared to the prior year. \n\n- For 2016, total investment income was $45 million, up from $36.9 million in 2015, primarily due to portfolio growth. Net investment income was $22.5 million, up from $18.7 million in 2015.\n\n- Net increase in net assets from operations was $24.4 million in 2016 compared to $17.9 million in 2015, largely driven by higher net investment income and net unrealized appreciation on investments.\n\n- As of December 31, 2016, Monroe had $129 million drawn on its credit facility, $51.5 million in outstanding SBA debentures, and $6 million in cash. It had remaining borrowing capacity of $31 million on the credit facility and $63.5 million in available SBA debentures.\n\n- The portfolio remains relatively strong, with 87.3% of investments rated 2 (acceptable level of risk) and only 3% rated 4 (higher risk). No investments were rated 5 (substantial risk).\n\nIn summary, Monroe continued to grow its investment portfolio and operating income in 2016 through additional leverage and equity funding, while maintaining a relatively low-risk investment portfolio."}
