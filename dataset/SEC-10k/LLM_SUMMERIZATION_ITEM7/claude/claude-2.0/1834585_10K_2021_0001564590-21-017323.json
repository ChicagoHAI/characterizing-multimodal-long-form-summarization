Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nYou should read the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations together with our Consolidated Financial Statements and the related notes and other financial information included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Some of the information included in this discussion and analysis or set forth elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including information with respect to our plans and strategy for our business, includes forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. You should review the Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements,\u201d Summary Risk Factors\u201d and Risk Factors\u201d sections of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a discussion of important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the results described in or implied by the forward-looking statements contained in the following discussion and analysis.\nWe report on the basis of a 52- or 53-week fiscal year, which ends on the Saturday closest to the last day of January. Accordingly, references herein to fiscal 2019\u201d relate to the 52 weeks ended February 2, 2019, references herein to fiscal 2020\u201d relate the 52 weeks ended February 1, 2020 and references herein to fiscal 2021\u201d relate to the 52 weeks ended January 30, 2021.\nJOANN Overview\nJOANN is the nation's category leader in Sewing and one of the fastest growing competitors in the arts and crafts category. The Creative Products industry is a large and growing market, which according to a 2017 AFCI study is in excess of $40 billion. The industry is currently experiencing a significant acceleration for product demand in response to multiple themes that have been further solidified during the COVID-19 pandemic, such as heightened DIY customer behavior, amplified participation from both new and existing customers and increased digital engagement, of which we are a key beneficiary because we have positioned ourselves and our go-forward strategies to capitalize on increased demand for Creative Products. As a well-established and trusted brand for over 75 years, we believe we have a deep understanding of our customers, what inspires their creativity and what fuels their incredibly diverse projects. Since 2016, we have embarked on a strategy to transform JOANN, which has helped us pivot from a traditional retailer to a fully-integrated, digitally-connected provider of Creative Products.\nAs the nation's category leader in Sewing with approximately one-third market share, based on our internal research estimates of market share of the Creative Products industry that primarily consist of an annual survey of Creative Product consumers as of July 31, 2020, we believe we offer the broadest selection of products while being committed to providing the most inspiration, helpful service and education to our customers. While we continue to gain market share and solidify this leadership position in Sewing, which represented 48% of our total net sales in fiscal 2021, we have also been growing our share of and believe we have further significant share opportunity in the arts and crafts category. We are well-positioned in the marketplace and have multiple competitive advantages, including our broad assortment, established omni-channel platform, multi-faceted digital interface with customers and skilled and knowledgeable team members. We offer an extensive assortment, which at its peak, averages more than 95,000 SKUs in stores and over 245,000 SKUs online, across Creative Product categories. Over 50% of our in-store net sales cannot be directly comparison-shopped because of our strong and growing own-brand portfolio, including our copyrighted or proprietary fabric patterns and designs and factory direct relationships. We have expanded access to this broad assortment through e-commerce and digital capabilities that complement our physical network, drive customer engagement and deliver an exceptional customer experience while supporting consistently strong gross margins. Through our omni-channel platform, we serve our customers in a differentiated manner by offering several convenient fulfillment options, including BOPIS, curbside pick-up and ship-to-home offerings. Our omni-channel platform operates at a large scale, having generated approximately $511 million, $126 million and $103 million in net sales in fiscal 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Our data-driven digital capabilities further reinforce our relationship with our customers. Customers can interact with our brand whenever and however they want. Customers connect with us through our newly re-designed mobile-first website, joann.com, and our widely-used mobile application with more than 12 million downloads. As of the end of fiscal 2021, we had approximately 71 million addressable customers in our vast database, nearly 17 million customers in our email database and over four million customers in our very large SMS text database. These points of differentiation are reinforced by our knowledgeable, friendly and trusted team members, a significant number of whom are sewing and craft enthusiasts, who offer a service-oriented experience for our customers that we believe cannot be replicated by mass retailers or pure play online players.\nIn 2016, we accelerated our journey to transform JOANN by reinventing the in-store and digital customer experience. We recruited talent at every level of the company and across all key business areas to complement our existing expertise. This undertaking has resulted in significant enhancements to our value proposition, including reinvigorating our core merchandise assortment, refreshing our branding, developing a location refresh prototype and improving the customer experience. We improved our assortment by conducting a systematic review of all categories at a product-level and all layouts at a location-\nlevel in order to optimize sales and gross margin. We have also expanded our data-driven digital footprint, which includes our extensive digital marketing assets, CRM system, social media platforms and e-commerce capabilities. We better understand our customers through our centralized database that brings together how each customer interacts in our physical and digital properties and provides a holistic view of their behavior. We are able to utilize this data to drive engagement with our brand, create loyalty and inspire, educate and ensure we are increasing our share of customer spend through timely and relevant marketing. By using data and digital contact channels, including email and SMS digital display, and leveraging our mobile application, we are able to contact customers with personalized content and provide the convenience to shop wherever and however they choose. We believe that these core initiatives and transformational investments have driven our performance and increased customer engagement over the last several years and strategically position us to continue to create long-term value. This momentum was temporarily interrupted in fiscal 2020 by the unanticipated headwind of incremental U.S. tariffs on Chinese imports that we estimate, before mitigation, would have amounted to $75 million of additional annual costs, as these tariffs applied to a broad range our products. However, after working to partially offset their effects and having incorporated the balance of these tariffs into our cost base, we are driving strong operating profit growth across both our locations and e-commerce platform as well as achieving margin expansion.\nFactors Affecting Our Business\nOverall economic trends. The overall economic environment and related changes in consumer behavior have a significant impact on our business. Spending by customers on our products and services is primarily discretionary, and as a result generally positive economic conditions create increased discretionary household income that promotes higher levels of spending across our business. However, the creative activities we support tend to be lower cost than other leisure activities, which could protect us to a certain degree from economic downturns. Macroeconomic factors that can affect customer spending patterns, and thereby our results of operations, include employment rates, availability of consumer credit, interest rates, tax rates and inflation, and fuel and energy costs. Macroeconomic factors can also affect our input and labor costs, notably inflation, as our financial results and ability to invest in the business are directly impacted by increases or decreases in the cost of goods and services required in our operations and initiatives. In addition to inflation, our input and labor costs are impacted by mandated costs such as minimum wages and trade policies, most significantly tariffs and duties on our products imported from foreign countries. The implementation of incremental U.S. tariffs on Chinese imports in particular has had a significant impact on our cost of goods sold, product demand and sourcing strategies. Before mitigation, we estimate that incremental U.S. tariffs on Chinese imports in fiscal 2020 would have amounted to $75 million of additional annual costs, as these tariffs applied to a broad range of our products.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic. As described below, the COVID-19 pandemic has had and is expected to continue to have a substantial impact on our business.\nConsumer demand for our products and services. Our industry supports activities that are discretionary in nature and can be highly influenced by consumer trends. Our ability to achieve our desired results, including attracting new customers and growing share of spend with existing customers, depends on our ability to develop compelling product assortments and services delivered within a convenient and engaging shopping experience. Moreover, due to the nature of our business, we purchase much of our inventory well in advance of each selling season. If we misjudge consumer preferences and demand for certain products, we could be faced with excess inventories that would impact our net sales and profits.\nSize and loyalty of our customer database. Our ability to effectively market to our customers is a critical component of our business success. We tier our customers based on total sales volume and frequency of purchase. For fiscal 2021, 29% of our net sales were generated by our top three million customers. Our recent success is also being largely driven by new customers added to our database, as 15% of our net sales for fiscal 2021 were generated by new customers added to our database over that same time period.\nCompetition. The Creative Products industry includes specialty retailers and mass merchandisers that provide assortments in many of our categories albeit typically with more limited breadth, local shops that tend to feature select categories (e.g. quilting and yarn shops) and pure play e-commerce players. We compete with all of these providers for customer attention, shopping visits, exclusive vendor relationships, leadership talent and in some cases front line employees and retail locations. Our ability to be effective across all of those points of competition has a significant effect on our results of operations.\nEffective development and sourcing of products. Our business success requires that we provide relevant and innovative products to our customers at competitive prices. Development of those products is dependent on effective relationships with key suppliers and in many cases internal development of new products or application of current consumer trends to existing product lines. Our ability to develop, promote and apply our exclusive brands to new products is a critical component of\nbuilding competitive assortments that drive our sales. Our ability to effectively source products, including through factory direct relationships, allows us to offer assortments at competitive prices while maintaining profitable product margins.\nManagement of inventory and our supply chain. We offer an extensive assortment, which at its peak, averages more than 95,000 SKUs in stores and over 245,000 SKUs through our e-commerce platforms, across Creative Product categories. The high number of SKUs required to support our business as well as the need to introduce new products and manage seasonality create complexity in our operations. We also sometimes experience long lead times for manufacture and delivery of our products, particularly those that we source directly from foreign suppliers, which further increases inventory carrying costs. The ability to effectively forecast product demand, maintain a high number of vendor relationships and order volume, replenish and allocate product and manage distribution and logistics are all critical to our success. Issues with any of these processes could result in lost sales or excess inventories which would have a negative impact on our results of operations.\nInvestments in our locations, technology, infrastructure, team members and new business opportunities. We have made, and will continue to make, significant investments in our business and operations. We believe these investments have laid the foundation for our results of operations and continued profitable growth. Refreshing our locations, enhancing our omni-channel and other customer-facing and supporting technologies, strengthening our core business processes, adding talent while developing our current team and making investments in ventures that augment our current business are critical to sustaining a vibrant enterprise that will drive strong financial results.\nSeasonality in quarterly results. Historically, our net sales and operating profits have been materially higher in our third and fourth fiscal quarters, particularly in the months of September through December, coinciding with fall and holiday selling seasons. We incur significantly higher expenses and working capital needs in April through August in order to procure inventory to support higher levels of sales activity later in the year. Our ability to generate cash flow or otherwise finance increased costs in the earlier portion of our fiscal year is critical to achieving strong net sales and operating profit in our historically busier fall and holiday seasons.\nEffects of COVID-19 on Our Business\nWe continue to closely monitor the impact of the COVID-19 outbreak on all facets of our business. We have taken actions to protect the safety of our team members and customers and to manage the business through the resulting fluid and challenging environment.\nIn late 2019, an outbreak of COVID-19 emerged and by March 11, 2020 was declared a global pandemic by The World Health Organization. Federal, state, and local governments have since implemented various restrictions, including travel restrictions, border closings, restrictions on public gatherings, quarantining of people who may have been exposed to the virus, shelter-in-place restrictions and limitations on business operations. In response to government closure orders, we were forced to close hundreds of our locations. During the second half of March 2020 and the beginning of April 2020, approximately half of our locations were closed, either completely or to in-store traffic. However, we immediately began working diligently with local and national government officials in advocating that our business and the products we sell were essential in the fight against COVID-19, and therefore exempt from shelter-in-place and stay-at-home orders. Over the ensuing weeks, we began to re-open many of our locations across the country. Initially, many of these locations were re-opened for curbside pick-up only via our BOPIS ordering process. At the beginning of the second quarter of fiscal 2021, we had fewer than 30 locations fully closed and roughly 400 locations open for curbside pick-up only, and by mid-June 2020, all locations were fully operational and open to walk-in traffic. Throughout the entirety of the third and fourth quarters of fiscal 2021, all locations remained opened other than for temporary deep cleanings required to maintain sanitation protocols or for weather and other related hazards. Since that time, certain state and local governments have continued to impose retail closure orders and capacity restrictions, impacting some of our locations. During this time, our ability to fulfill e-commerce orders via both our BOPIS and ship-to-home programs without interruption has had a significant positive impact on our financial performance. We have also experienced an increase in sales in certain merchandise categories due to the effects of the pandemic, as consumers created personal protective equipment, or PPE, such as face masks, and engaged in more DIY projects due to additional time spent at home. This increase in activity has led to significant additions to our marketing database, which has grown by over 10 million customers in fiscal 2021. Our ability to directly market to these new customers through our robust and efficient digital channels has led to repeat purchases across a broad array of our merchandise assortments. We have also experienced declines in sales of a limited number of categories that are tied to activities that are restricted due to the pandemic such as special occasion fabrics used by customers that plan a wedding or that make their own Halloween costumes. In addition, we incurred additional supply chain expenses to ensure we were adequately stocked on key merchandise and to mitigate supply interruptions that the pandemic caused. Our COVID-19 related costs for fiscal 2021 were $65.0 million. Throughout the pandemic, we have worked closely with our suppliers to manage flow of inventory and prioritize our most urgently required merchandise, as in many cases our needs have varied from earlier expectations and our suppliers have often needed to react to their own challenges presented\nby COVID-19. While it is difficult to estimate the sales to date that have been attributable to PPE-making with precision, we have been able to note significant changes in normal sales trends in categories that support that effort. These categories include cotton fabric, certain sewing supplies such as elastic, and sewing machines. Those favorable impacts to our sales were partially offset by mandated store closures and reduced sales in categories such as special occasion fabrics and seasonal d\u00e9cor and entertaining, which have been negatively impacted by broad restrictions on customer gatherings and celebrations. We estimate the net result of those impacts amount to a one-time annualized benefit to our sales of 8% to 9% for fiscal 2021. However, we view the significant number of new customers and increased engagement by new and current customers as an encouraging signal for the future of our business. We also believe the rapid adoption by customers of our digital and omni-channel offerings is a highly scalable platform that we can leverage to increase sales and reduce costs.\nIn response to the pandemic, we have instituted modified or reduced hours, as well as reduced occupancy limits, for all of our locations. In certain jurisdictions, our occupancy is further limited by the relevant government authority. We have also implemented, and may need to take further steps to, make adjustments to staffing levels and location configurations to reflect not only applicable restrictions and guidelines but also potential levels of consumer engagement. We are prioritizing the health and safety of our team members and customers and, to that end, we have instituted the following guidelines within all locations:\nTable 134: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> requiring all team members in our locations to perform a health screening before each shift, which includes temperature checks, and instructing team members to stay home if they exhibit any COVID-19 symptoms;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 135: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> putting up signs and other indicators to promote social distancing while shopping and standing in line;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 136: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> implementing increased cleaning and sanitization practices throughout the location, with additional focus on high-traffic and high-touch areas such as carts, cutting counters and checkout counters;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 137: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> wearing a face mask or face shield; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 138: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> conducting a pre-opening checklist in each location each day.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOur steps to manage operation of our locations during the pandemic have added costs to our business, some of which are non-recurring in nature, including, but not limited to premium pay for our hourly employees as well as incremental labor hours and supplies to maintain sanitation and social distancing protocols. These precautions may change from time to time as local conditions and applicable health mandates change, and therefore, it is possible we may be required to temporarily close locations or limit our operations. See Risk Factors-Risks Relating to our Business-Our business is subject to continued uncertainty with respect to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.\u201d\nHow We Assess the Performance of Our Business\nIn assessing our performance, we consider a variety of performance and financial measures. The key accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ( GAAP\u201d) measures include net sales, cost of sales, selling, general and administrative expenses and operating profit. In addition, we also review other important non-GAAP metrics such as Adjusted EBITDA and other performance indicators such as total comparable sales.\nNet Sales\nNet sales are derived from direct retail sales to customers in our locations and online, net of merchandise returns, discounts and coupons, and excluding sales tax. Growth in net sales is impacted by total comparable sales, new location openings, location refreshes and closures.\nTotal Comparable Sales\nTotal comparable sales are an important measure throughout the retail industry. This measure allows us to evaluate how our location base and e-commerce business are performing by measuring the change in period-over-period net sales in locations that have been open for the applicable period. We define total comparable sales as net sales for locations that have been open for at least 13 months as well as net sales for locations that have not been remodeled, expanded or downsized in the last 13 months. In addition, total comparable sales include our e-commerce sales generated via joann.com (online sales for all products) and creativebug.com (online sales of digital videos for crafting projects). There may be variations in the way in which some of our competitors and other retailers calculate comparable sales. As a result, data in this Annual Report on Form 10-K regarding our total comparable sales may not be comparable to similar data made available by other retailers.\nGross Margin\nGross margin is calculated as net sales less cost of sales. Cost of sales consists primarily of the direct cost of merchandise sold at our locations and through our e-commerce platforms, along with several other costs including freight expense, vendor allowances and cash discounts, inventory shrink and clearance activity. We define gross margin rate as gross margin divided by net sales.\nOur calculations of gross margins may not be directly comparable to those of our competitors. Some retailers include all of the costs related to their distribution network in cost of sales, while we exclude the indirect portion from gross margin and include it within selling, general and administrative expenses, or SG&A expenses. We include distribution costs that are directly associated with the acquisition of our merchandise and delivery to our locations in cost of sales. These costs are primarily freight incurred when we receive merchandise shipments from the vendor to our distribution centers or directly to our locations and also when we ship merchandise from our distribution centers to our locations. Freight incurred to ship e-commerce orders to our customers is also included in our cost of sales. These freight costs as well as duties, including tariffs, related to import purchases and internal transfer costs are considered to be direct costs of our merchandise and, accordingly, are recognized as cost of sales when the related merchandise is sold.\nPurchasing, receiving, warehousing, fulfillment of e-commerce orders (excluding shipping costs) and other costs of our distribution network (including depreciation) and location occupancy costs are considered to be period costs not directly attributable to the value of merchandise and, accordingly, are expensed as incurred as SG&A expenses.\nSelling, General and Administrative Expenses\nSG&A expenses consist of various costs related to supporting and facilitating the sale of merchandise in our locations and via our e-commerce platforms. These costs include but are not limited to location, distribution center and administrative payroll, employee benefits, stock-based compensation, occupancy, facility and operating costs for our locations, distribution centers and corporate office, advertising expenses, payment card acceptance and interchange fees, location pre-opening and closing costs and other administrative expenses.\nResults of Operations\nThe following tables summarize key components of our results of operations for the periods indicated. The following discussion should be read in conjunction with our Consolidated Financial Statements and related notes included elsewhere in this Annual Report on form 10-K. Discussion of the year ended February 1, 2020 compared with the year ended February 2, 2019 is included in Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d in our Final Prospectus.\nStatement of Consolidated Income Data:\nTable 139: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Fiscal Year-Ended\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (In millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> January 30,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> February 1,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> February 2,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net sales\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 2,762.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 2,241.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 2,324.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Gross margin\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,366.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,105.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,176.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> SG&A expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,132.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 977.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 951.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Depreciation and amortization\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 80.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 77.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 76.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Goodwill and trade name impairment\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 486.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Operating profit (loss)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 154.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (436.4\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 149.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOther Operational Data:\nTable 140: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Fiscal Year-Ended\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (Dollars in millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> January 30,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> February 1,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> February 2,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total comparable sales vs. prior year\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 23.5\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (3.6\n</td> <td> )%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1.9\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Gross margin rate\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 49.5\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 49.3\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 50.6\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> SG&A expenses as a % of net sales\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 41.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 43.6\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 40.9\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Operating profit (loss) as a % of net sales\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 5.6\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (19.5\n</td> <td> )%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 6.4\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net income (loss)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 212.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (546.6\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 35.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Adjusted EBITDA (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 323.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 153.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 252.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Adjusted EBITDA as a % of net sales\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 11.7\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 6.8\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 10.8\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total retail location count at end of period\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 141: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> (1)\n</td> <td> See Non-GAAP Financial Measures\u201d for a definition of Adjusted EBITDA and a reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to net income (loss).\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nComparison of the 52 Weeks Ended January 30, 2021 and February 1, 2020\nNet Sales\nNet sales were $2,762.3 million for fiscal 2021, an increase of $521.1 million or 23.3% compared to fiscal 2020. Total comparable sales increased 23.5% for fiscal 2021 compared to a 3.6% total comparable sales decrease for the prior year. Our total comparable sales growth resulted from an 18% increase in average transaction value and a 4% increase in transactions in our retail locations along with increases in third party fulfilled e-commerce sales and freight revenue on e-commerce orders. Increases in average transaction value were primarily driven by higher average unit retail values as well as increases in the average number of items purchased per transaction. Omni-channel net sales grew by 305% in fiscal 2021 as compared to fiscal 2020 and represented 19% of total sales.\nGross Margin\nGross margin was $1,366.2 million for fiscal 2021, an increase of $260.9 million or 23.6% compared to fiscal 2020. The increase was primarily driven by an increase in net sales and further supported by an increase in our gross margin rate. Gross margin rate was 49.5% for fiscal 2021, an increase of 14 basis points compared to fiscal 2020. Improvements in product costs obtained through our strategic sourcing efforts and the reduced depth of our promotional offers were partially offset by incremental U.S. tariffs on Chinese imports, higher freight expense associated with the increased volume of e-commerce orders, and increases in clearance activity as well as increases in theft, loss and damage of merchandise inventory, which we refer to as inventory shrink.\nWe also experienced increases in costs related to the COVID-19 pandemic, including import costs to expedite delivery of critical merchandise and costs of donated product related to our community support efforts.\nSelling, General and Administrative Expenses\nSG&A expenses were $1,132.0 million for fiscal 2021, an increase of $154.6 million or 15.8% compared to fiscal 2020. This increase was primarily driven by several factors, including $50.9 million of incremental one-time expenses throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, which included maintaining protocols to ensure a safe environment for our customers and team members through intensified cleaning and stronger focus on capacity management along with additional labor costs associated with premium pay provided from April through January to all of our essential store and distribution center team members. In addition, we provided for increases in expected payments under our incentive compensation plans of $42.5 million which were based on our favorable financial performance during the year compared to our expectations. Finally, we experienced higher location labor of $40.0 million along with payment card interchange fees and other variable expenses of $10.0 million due to our higher total comparable sales in fiscal 2021 compared to fiscal 2020.\nAs a percentage of net sales, SG&A expenses for fiscal 2021 were 41.0%, a decrease of 262 basis points compared to fiscal 2020. This improvement was driven by our ability to leverage our net sales increase against expenses that have grown more slowly, even after absorbing incremental expenses to manage through the COVID-19 pandemic.\nDepreciation and Amortization\nDepreciation and amortization expense was $80.0 million in fiscal 2021, an increase of $2.5 million compared to fiscal 2020. This increase was driven primarily by investments in location refresh and technology projects in fiscal 2020.\nGoodwill and Trade Name Impairment\nThere were no goodwill or trade name impairment losses recorded in fiscal 2021 due to no indication of impairment. We did record impairment charges of $486.8 million in fiscal 2020, which were predominantly the result of negative total comparable sales and declining margins, driven primarily by the incremental U.S. tariffs on Chinese imports, along with a weaker than expected peak selling season. See Note 8-Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets to our Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further details.\nInterest Expense\nInterest expense for fiscal 2021 was $69.0 million, a decrease of $32.9 million compared to fiscal 2020. This decrease in interest expense was due to lower average borrowings and lower interest rates as a result of decreases in LIBOR rates. The average debt level in fiscal 2021 was $1,054.6 million compared to $1,256.7 million in fiscal 2020.\nWe had $793.7 million of debt outstanding (face value) as of January 30, 2021 versus $1,235.5 million as of February 1, 2020.\nDebt Related (Gain) Loss\nDuring fiscal 2021, we repurchased $351.5 million in face value of the term loans provided pursuant to our First Lien Facility and our Second Lien Facility, at an average of 54% of par, resulting in a $155.2 million gain, which is included in debt related (gain) loss within the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income (Loss) and the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. A write-off of the deferred charges and original issue discount, totaling $6.0 million, associated with the original debt issuance was recognized as an offset to the gain recognized. The term loan repurchases were executed, following a competitive market bidding process, through several open market purchases on arm's length terms and in compliance with the terms of the underlying credit agreements. See Note 2-Financing to our Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further details.\nIncome Taxes\nOur effective income tax rate for fiscal 2021 was 11.7% compared to (2.3)% on a pre-tax loss for fiscal 2020. The increase in the effective income tax rate in fiscal 2021, as compared to fiscal 2020, relates primarily to the reversal of the valuation allowance for the deferred tax asset relating to the interest expense carryover, an effective tax rate benefit for a net operating loss carried back to tax years with a Federal tax rate of 35% versus 21%, as well as the impact of the nondeductible goodwill impairment.\nNet Income (Loss)\nNet income was $212.3 million for fiscal 2021, an increase of $758.9 million compared to fiscal 2020. The increase was driven by the factors described above.\nAdjusted EBITDA\nAdjusted EBITDA increased 110.8% to $323.3 million or 11.7% of net sales for fiscal 2021 compared to $153.4 million or 6.8% of sales for fiscal 2020. Our growth in Adjusted EBITDA of $169.9 million and expansion of Adjusted EBITDA as a percentage of net sales of 487 basis points was driven primarily by growth in total comparable sales that exceeded our rate of growth in SG&A expenses, as well as improvements in our gross margin rate.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nWe present Adjusted EBITDA, which is not a recognized financial measure under GAAP, because we believe it assists investors and analysts in comparing our performance across reporting periods on a consistent basis by excluding items that we\ndo not believe are indicative of our core operating performance. Management believes Adjusted EBITDA is helpful in highlighting trends in our core operating performance compared to other measures, which can differ significantly depending on long-term strategic decisions regarding capital structure, the tax jurisdictions in which companies operate and capital investments. We also use Adjusted EBITDA in connection with establishing discretionary annual incentive compensation; to supplement GAAP measures of performance in the evaluation of the effectiveness of our business strategies; to make budgeting decisions; to compare our performance against that of other peer companies using similar measures; and because our Credit Facilities use measures similar to Adjusted EBITDA to measure our compliance with certain covenants.\nWe define Adjusted EBITDA as net income (loss) plus income tax provision (benefit), interest expense, net, debt related (gain) loss and depreciation and amortization, as further adjusted to eliminate the impact of certain non-cash items and other items that we do not consider indicative of our ongoing operating performance, including costs related to strategic initiatives, COVID-19 costs, technology development expense, stock-based compensation expense, loss on disposal and impairment of fixed and operating lease assets, goodwill and trade name impairment, sponsor management fees and other one-time costs. The further adjustments are itemized in the table below.\nAdjusted EBITDA has limitations as an analytical tool, and you should not consider it in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under GAAP. Some of these limitations are:\nTable 142: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect our cash expenditures or future requirements for capital expenditures or contractual commitments;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 143: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect changes in our cash requirements for our working capital

We believe that our cash and cash equivalents on hand, cash from operations and availability under our ABL Facility will be sufficient to cover our working capital, capital expenditure and debt service requirement needs for the foreseeable future. Please refer to Note 2-Financing to our Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a description of the material terms of our Credit Facilities. As of January 30, 2021 and February 1, 2020, we were in compliance with all covenants under our Credit Facilities.\nOn March 12, 2021, in connection with our initial public offering, we issued and sold 5,468,750 shares of our common stock at a price to the public of $12.00 per share, resulting in net proceeds to us of approximately $57.8 million, after deducting the underwriting discount of approximately $4.3 million and offering expenses of approximately $3.5 million.\nWe define Credit Facility Adjusted EBITDA\u201d as Adjusted EBITDA (as defined above) plus location pre-opening and closing costs excluding loss on disposal and impairment of fixed assets, which is calculated consistently with our calculation of Adjusted EBITDA under our Credit Facilities. We reference Credit Facility Adjusted EBITDA because it is a measure that is calculated in accordance with our Credit Facilities and used to determine our compliance with certain ratios in our Credit Facilities, tested each quarter on the basis of the preceding four quarters. For example, we are permitted to prepay debt and make distributions on account of equity up to a certain amount (i) under our First Lien Facility if our ratio of consolidated net debt to Credit Facility Adjusted EBITDA for the prior four quarters as of the quarterly test is not greater than 4.90 to 1.0 and our ratio of consolidated senior secured net debt to Credit Facility Adjusted EBITDA for such period is not greater than 3.60 to 1.0 and (ii) under our Second Lien Facility if our ratio of consolidated net debt to Credit Facility Adjusted EBITDA for such period is not greater than 4.50 to 1.0. As of January 30, 2021, our ratio of consolidated net debt to Credit Facility Adjusted EBITDA was 3.3 to 1.0, and of consolidated senior secured net debt to Credit Facility Adjusted EBITDA was 2.1 to 1.0. Other provisions in our Credit Facilities utilize ratios including Credit Facility Adjusted EBITDA for calculating permitted limits for us to incur additional debt and make certain investments. Additionally, our ratio of consolidated senior secured net debt to Credit Facility Adjusted EBITDA is measured once per year following the completion of our annual Consolidated Financial Statements and determines what percentage of our excess cash flow (as defined in our First Lien Facility and our Second Lien Facility) we are required to apply for the repayment of principal on our First Lien Facility (or if paid off or terminated, our Second Lien Facility), ranging from 50% of excess cash flow for ratios in excess of 2.50x to 0% of excess cash flow for ratios\nof less than 2.00x. For fiscal 2021, no excess cash flow payment was required . Accordingly, we believe that Credit Facility Adjusted EBITDA is material to an investor's understanding of our financial condition and liquidity.\nTable 158: <table> <tr> <td> (in millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Fiscal\nYear-Ended\nJanuary 30,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net cash provided by operating activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 327.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Non-cash operating lease expense\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (152.4\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Depreciation and amortization excluding content cost amortization\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (80.0\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Deferred income taxes\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Stock-based compensation expense\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (1.5\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Amortization of deferred financing costs and original issue discount\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (3.7\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Debt related gain\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 155.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Loss on disposal and impairment of fixed assets\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (3.4\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Change in operating assets and liabilities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (32.8\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 212.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Income tax provision\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 28.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Interest expense, net\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 69.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Debt related gain\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (155.1\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Depreciation and amortization\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 80.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Strategic initiatives\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 6.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> COVID-19 costs\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 65.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Technology development expense\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 5.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Stock-based compensation expense\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Loss on disposal and impairment of fixed and operating lease assets\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 5.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Sponsor management fee\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Adjusted EBITDA\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 323.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Location pre-opening and closing costs excluding loss on disposal of fixed assets\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 5.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Credit Facility Adjusted EBITDA\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 328.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOur capital requirements are primarily for capital expenditures in connection with new location openings, location remodels, investments in information technology, other infrastructure investments and working capital requirements for seasonal inventory build.

The increase in net cash provided by operating activities was primarily driven by our positive total comparable sales results, the significant improvement in working capital efficiency and the deferral of certain cash payments either negotiated with our landlords or allowed under the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. The majority of deferred payments will be remitted over the course of fiscal 2022.\nNet cash used for investing activities\nCash used for investing activities consists primarily of capital expenditures, the majority of which are focused on strategic initiatives including: new location openings, location remodels and refreshes and information technology investments, particularly those supporting our omni-channel platforms and other customer facing systems. We also incur capital outlays for equipment and facility management in our distribution centers, locations and corporate offices.\nSpecifically, investment for each refresh project is tailored to each location's needs and unit economics. We have four general levels of investment and project scope tailored to what would benefit each location, with future investment expected to range from $150,000 for lightest-touch refreshes to $3 million for the relatively few but most-extensive refreshes. Over 50% of our existing locations are refresh project targets over the next seven to ten years and we expect investments in relation to these future refresh projects to remain consistent with our capital expenditures in connection with completed refresh projects.\nHistorical capital expenditures are summarized as follows:\nTable 160: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Fiscal Year-Ended\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (In millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> January 30,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> February 1,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> February 2,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Retail locations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 21.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 52.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 33.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Information technology\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 10.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 20.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 13.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 6.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total capital expenditures\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 36.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 78.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 48.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Landlord contributions\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (4.4\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (9.1\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (7.4\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total capital expenditures, net of landlord contributions\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 31.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 69.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 41.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTotal capital expenditures, net of landlord contributions decreased by $37.9 million in fiscal 2021 compared to the prior fiscal year. This decrease was related to specific actions taken to defer projects in an effort to preserve liquidity at the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. Also, due to the need to maintain sanitation and social distancing protocols in our locations throughout the pandemic, execution of capital projects has often not been feasible.\nNet cash (used for) provided by financing activities\nNet cash used for financing activities was $(288.4) million in fiscal 2021 compared with $86.3 million of net cash provided by financing activities in fiscal 2020. The change in net cash (used for) provided by financing activities was primarily the result of the repurchase of portions of the First Lien Facility and Second Lien Facility, as well as an increase in payments on the ABL Facility.\nOff-Balance Sheet Transactions\nOur liquidity is currently not dependent on the use of off-balance sheet transactions other than letters of credit which are typical in a retail environment.\nContractual Obligations and Commitments\nThe following table summarizes our future cash outflows resulting from contractual obligations and commitments as of January 30, 2021:\nTable 161: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Payments Due by Fiscal Year\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (In millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2023-2024\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2025-2026\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Thereafter\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Standby letters of credit\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 23.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 23.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Purchase commitments (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 20.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 8.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 10.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Operating leases\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,135.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 235.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 400.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 278.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 221.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Finance leases\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 13.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 5.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 7.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> ABL Facility (2)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 85.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 85.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> ABL Facility interest (2)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 5.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> First Lien Facility (3)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 635.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 635.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> First Lien Facility interest (3)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 109.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 41.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 67.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Second Lien Facility (4)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 72.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 72.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Second Lien Facility interest (4)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 25.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 7.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 15.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total contractual cash obligations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 2,126.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 324.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,138.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 442.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 221.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 162: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> (1)\n</td> <td> Purchase commitments include significant future inventory purchases as well as agreements for technology, in which minimum guaranteed payments are required.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 163: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> (2)\n</td> <td> We had $85.5 million in outstanding borrowings under our ABL Facility at January 30, 2021.

Our net sales are stronger in the second half of the year than the first half of the year. Net income is highest during the months of September through December when sales volumes provide significant operating leverage. Working capital needed to finance our operations fluctuate during the year and reach their highest levels during the second and third fiscal quarters as we increase our inventory in preparation for our peak selling season. However, the COVID-19 pandemic may have an impact to consumer behaviors and customer traffic that result in changes in the seasonal fluctuations of our business. For example, our fiscal 2021 second, third and fourth quarter results were positively impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic due to the demand for select merchandise categories.\nSummarized below are key

</tr>\n</table>\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nWe strive to report our financial results in a clear and understandable manner. We follow GAAP in preparing our Consolidated Financial Statements. These principles require us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, expenses and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. We base our estimates on historical experience and on other assumptions that we believe to be relevant under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results could differ from these estimates under different assumptions and/or conditions. We continually evaluate the information used to make these estimates as our business and the economic environment change. The use of estimates is pervasive throughout our financial statements. The accounting policies that involve estimates or assumptions that are material due to levels of subjectivity and judgment necessary to account for highly uncertain matters or are susceptible to change and we consider most critical are as follows:\nInventory Valuation\nInventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value with cost determined on a weighted average basis. Inventory valuation methods require certain management estimates and judgments, the most significant of which involves estimates of net realizable value on product designated for clearance, which affects the ending inventory valuation at cost, as well as the cost of sales reported for the year.\nWe estimate our reserve for clearance product based on a number of factors, including, but not limited to, quantities of slow-moving or carryover seasonal merchandise on hand, historical recovery statistics and future merchandising plans. The accuracy of our estimates can be affected by many factors, some of which are beyond our control, including changes in economic conditions and consumer buying trends. The corresponding adjustment to cost of sales is recorded in the period the decision is made. We do not believe that the assumptions used in our estimate will change significantly based on prior experience.\nOur accrual for inventory shrink is estimated as a percent of sales. The percent used in the determination of the accrual is based on actual historical inventory shrink results of our locations. This estimated percent is applied to sales of our locations for the periods following each location's most recent physical inventory. In addition, we analyze our accrual using actual results as physical inventory counts are taken and reconciled to the general ledger. Substantially all of our location physical inventory counts are taken in the first three quarters of each year. A majority of locations that have been open one year or longer are physically inventoried once a year. See Note 1-Significant Accounting Policies to our audited financial statements-Inventories included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further details.\nImpairment of Long-Lived and Operating Lease Assets\nWe evaluate recoverability of long-lived and operating lease assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable (for example, when a location's performance falls below minimum company standards). In the fourth quarter of each fiscal year or earlier if indicators of impairment exist, we review the performance of individual locations. Underperforming locations are selected for further evaluation of the recoverability of the location's net asset values. If the evaluation, done on an undiscounted cash flow basis, indicates that a location's net asset value may not be recoverable, the potential impairment is measured as the excess of carrying value over the fair value of the impaired asset. We estimate fair value based on a projected discounted cash flow method using a discount rate that is considered to be commensurate with the risk inherent in our current business model. Additional factors are taken into consideration, such as local market conditions and operating environment. See Note 1-Significant Accounting Policies to our audited financial statements-Impairment of Long-Lived and Operating Lease Assets included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further details.\nGoodwill and Other Indefinite Lived Intangible Assets\nWe assess the carrying value of goodwill at the reporting unit level. A reporting unit is the operating segment, or a business unit one level below that operating segment, for which discrete financial information is prepared and regularly reviewed by segment management.\nAnnually, as of the first day of the fourth quarter, or more frequently if circumstances indicate impairment may exist, we assess qualitative factors to determine whether any circumstances exist which would indicate that it is more-likely-than-not that the fair values of the reporting units are below their respective carrying values. If such circumstances exist, a quantitative assessment is performed. The quantitative assessment compares the fair value of a reporting unit to its current carrying value. We determine the estimated fair value of a reporting unit based on valuation techniques including discounted cash flows as well as a market comparable method. If the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds the carrying value of the net assets assigned to that reporting unit, goodwill is not considered impaired.\nAnnually, as of the first day of the fourth quarter, or more frequently if circumstances indicate impairment may exist, we assess qualitative factors to determine whether any circumstances exist which would indicate that it is more-likely-than-not that the fair values of the indefinite-lived intangible assets not subject to amortization (JOANN Trade Name and joann.com Domain Name) are below their respective carrying values. If such circumstances exist, a quantitative assessment is performed. The quantitative assessment compares the fair value of an intangible asset to its current carrying value. We determine the estimated fair value of an intangible asset based upon the relief from royalty method which evaluates the appropriate royalty rate for the asset.\nSee Note 8-Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets to our Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further details.\nSelf-Insurance Reserves\nWe are self-insured for certain losses relating to general liability, workers' compensation, and employee medical benefit claims. The ultimate cost of our workers' compensation and general liability insurance accruals are recorded based on actuarial valuations and historical claims experience. Our employee medical insurance accruals are recorded based on its medical claims processed, as well as historical medical claims experience for claims incurred but not yet reported. We maintain stop-loss coverage to limit the exposure to certain insurance-related risks. Management believes that the various assumptions developed, and actuarial methods used to determine our self- insurance reserves are reasonable and provide meaningful data and information that is used to make the best estimate of our exposure to these risks. Differences in estimates and assumptions could result in an accrual requirement materially different from the calculated accrual. Historically, such differences have not been significant. A 10% change in our self-insured liabilities as of January 30, 2021 would have affected selling and administrative expenses, operating profit, and income before income taxes by approximately $3.0 million.\nIncome Taxes\nIncome taxes are estimated for federal and each state jurisdiction in which we operate. This approach involves assessing the current tax exposure together with temporary differences which result from differing treatment of items for tax and book purposes. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are established based on these assessments. Deferred tax assets are evaluated for recoverability based on future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences, future taxable income exclusive of reversing temporary differences and carryforwards, taxable income in carryback years and tax-planning strategies. To the extent that recovery is deemed unlikely, a valuation allowance is recorded. Our valuation allowance was $4.4 million and $30.7 million as of January 30, 2021 and February 1, 2020, respectively. In fiscal 2020, the valuation allowance primarily related to the deferred tax assets for interest expense and charitable contribution carryforwards. The valuation allowance decreased in fiscal 2021 because taxable income is sufficient in the current fiscal year to fully utilize charitable contribution and interest expense carryforwards. Many years of data have been incorporated into the determination of tax reserves and our estimates have historically proven to be reasonable.\nStock-Based Compensation\nThe fair value of stock-based awards to employees is recognized as compensation expense on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period of the awards. The fair value of the stock-based awards is determined using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. Determining the fair value of options at the grant date requires judgment, including estimating the expected life that stock options will be outstanding prior to exercise and the associated volatility. The absence of an active market for our common stock prior to our public offering has also required our board of directors to determine the fair value of our common stock for purposes of granting stock options. Following the listing of our common stock on Nasdaq, it is not necessary to determine the fair value of our common stock, as our shares are traded in the public market.\nThe risk-free interest rate is an estimated average interest rate based on U.S. Treasury zero-coupon notes with terms consistent with the expected term of the awards. Until our public offering, there was no observable market for our common stock. Therefore, stock price volatility was calculated using the historical stock price volatility of comparable companies over the expected life of the options granted. We have not recently declared or paid any cash dividends and had not planned to pay cash dividends at the date of grants. Consequently, we used an expected dividend yield of zero. Expected life represents the period that our stock-based awards are expected to be outstanding. The expected life assumptions are determined based on the vesting terms, exercise terms, and contractual lives of the options. We account for forfeiture of non-vested options as they occur. Changes in the assumptions can materially affect the estimate of fair value of stock-based compensation and consequently, the related amount recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income (Loss). See Note 10-Stock-Based Compensation to our Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further details.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nSee Note 1-Significant Accounting Policies included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for information regarding recently issued and adopted accounting pronouncements.", "item_7_truncated": "Item 7.

The Creative Products industry is a large and growing market, which according to a 2017 AFCI study is in excess of $40 billion. The industry is currently experiencing a significant acceleration for product demand in response to multiple themes that have been further solidified during the COVID-19 pandemic, such as heightened DIY customer behavior, amplified participation from both new and existing customers and increased digital engagement, of which we are a key beneficiary because we have positioned ourselves and our go-forward strategies to capitalize on increased demand for Creative Products. As a well-established and trusted brand for over 75 years, we believe we have a deep understanding of our customers, what inspires their creativity and what fuels their incredibly diverse projects. Since 2016, we have embarked on a strategy to transform JOANN, which has helped us pivot from a traditional retailer to a fully-integrated, digitally-connected provider of Creative Products.\nAs the nation's category leader in Sewing with approximately one-third market share, based on our internal research estimates of market share of the Creative Products industry that primarily consist of an annual survey of Creative Product consumers as of July 31, 2020, we believe we offer the broadest selection of products while being committed to providing the most inspiration, helpful service and education to our customers. While we continue to gain market share and solidify this leadership position in Sewing, which represented 48% of our total net sales in fiscal 2021, we have also been growing our share of and believe we have further significant share opportunity in the arts and crafts category. We are well-positioned in the marketplace and have multiple competitive advantages, including our broad assortment, established omni-channel platform, multi-faceted digital interface with customers and skilled and knowledgeable team members. We offer an extensive assortment, which at its peak, averages more than 95,000 SKUs in stores and over 245,000 SKUs online, across Creative Product categories. Over 50% of our in-store net sales cannot be directly comparison-shopped because of our strong and growing own-brand portfolio, including our copyrighted or proprietary fabric patterns and designs and factory direct relationships. We have expanded access to this broad assortment through e-commerce and digital capabilities that complement our physical network, drive customer engagement and deliver an exceptional customer experience while supporting consistently strong gross margins. Through our omni-channel platform, we serve our customers in a differentiated manner by offering several convenient fulfillment options, including BOPIS, curbside pick-up and ship-to-home offerings. Our omni-channel platform operates at a large scale, having generated approximately $511 million, $126 million and $103 million in net sales in fiscal 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Our data-driven digital capabilities further reinforce our relationship with our customers. Customers can interact with our brand whenever and however they want. Customers connect with us through our newly re-designed mobile-first website, joann.com, and our widely-used mobile application with more than 12 million downloads. As of the end of fiscal 2021, we had approximately 71 million addressable customers in our vast database, nearly 17 million customers in our email database and over four million customers in our very large SMS text database. These points of differentiation are reinforced by our knowledgeable, friendly and trusted team members, a significant number of whom are sewing and craft enthusiasts, who offer a service-oriented experience for our customers that we believe cannot be replicated by mass retailers or pure play online players.\nIn 2016, we accelerated our journey to transform JOANN by reinventing the in-store and digital customer experience. We recruited talent at every level of the company and across all key business areas to complement our existing expertise. This undertaking has resulted in significant enhancements to our value proposition, including reinvigorating our core merchandise assortment, refreshing our branding, developing a location refresh prototype and improving the customer experience. We improved our assortment by conducting a systematic review of all categories at a product-level and all layouts at a location-\nlevel in order to optimize sales and gross margin. We have also expanded our data-driven digital footprint, which includes our extensive digital marketing assets, CRM system, social media platforms and e-commerce capabilities. We better understand our customers through our centralized database that brings together how each customer interacts in our physical and digital properties and provides a holistic view of their behavior. We are able to utilize this data to drive engagement with our brand, create loyalty and inspire, educate and ensure we are increasing our share of customer spend through timely and relevant marketing. By using data and digital contact channels, including email and SMS digital display, and leveraging our mobile application, we are able to contact customers with personalized content and provide the convenience to shop wherever and however they choose. We believe that these core initiatives and transformational investments have driven our performance and increased customer engagement over the last several years and strategically position us to continue to create long-term value. This momentum was temporarily interrupted in fiscal 2020 by the unanticipated headwind of incremental U.S. tariffs on Chinese imports that we estimate, before mitigation, would have amounted to $75 million of additional annual costs, as these tariffs applied to a broad range our products. However, after working to partially offset their effects and having incorporated the balance of these tariffs into our cost base, we are driving strong operating profit growth across both our locations and e-commerce platform as well as achieving margin expansion.\nFactors Affecting Our Business\nOverall economic trends. The overall economic environment and related changes in consumer behavior have a significant impact on our business. Spending by customers on our products and services is primarily discretionary, and as a result generally positive economic conditions create increased discretionary household income that promotes higher levels of spending across our business. However, the creative activities we support tend to be lower cost than other leisure activities, which could protect us to a certain degree from economic downturns. Macroeconomic factors that can affect customer spending patterns, and thereby our results of operations, include employment rates, availability of consumer credit, interest rates, tax rates and inflation, and fuel and energy costs. Macroeconomic factors can also affect our input and labor costs, notably inflation, as our financial results and ability to invest in the business are directly impacted by increases or decreases in the cost of goods and services required in our operations and initiatives. In addition to inflation, our input and labor costs are impacted by mandated costs such as minimum wages and trade policies, most significantly tariffs and duties on our products imported from foreign countries. The implementation of incremental U.S. tariffs on Chinese imports in particular has had a significant impact on our cost of goods sold, product demand and sourcing strategies. Before mitigation, we estimate that incremental U.S. tariffs on Chinese imports in fiscal 2020 would have amounted to $75 million of additional annual costs, as these tariffs applied to a broad range of our products.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic. As described below, the COVID-19 pandemic has had and is expected to continue to have a substantial impact on our business.\nConsumer demand for our products and services. Our industry supports activities that are discretionary in nature and can be highly influenced by consumer trends. Our ability to achieve our desired results, including attracting new customers and growing share of spend with existing customers, depends on our ability to develop compelling product assortments and services delivered within a convenient and engaging shopping experience. Moreover, due to the nature of our business, we purchase much of our inventory well in advance of each selling season. If we misjudge consumer preferences and demand for certain products, we could be faced with excess inventories that would impact our net sales and profits.\nSize and loyalty of our customer database. Our ability to effectively market to our customers is a critical component of our business success. We tier our customers based on total sales volume and frequency of purchase. For fiscal 2021, 29% of our net sales were generated by our top three million customers. Our recent success is also being largely driven by new customers added to our database, as 15% of our net sales for fiscal 2021 were generated by new customers added to our database over that same time period.\nCompetition. The Creative Products industry includes specialty retailers and mass merchandisers that provide assortments in many of our categories albeit typically with more limited breadth, local shops that tend to feature select categories (e.g. quilting and yarn shops) and pure play e-commerce players. We compete with all of these providers for customer attention, shopping visits, exclusive vendor relationships, leadership talent and in some cases front line employees and retail locations. Our ability to be effective across all of those points of competition has a significant effect on our results of operations.\nEffective development and sourcing of products. Our business success requires that we provide relevant and innovative products to our customers at competitive prices. Development of those products is dependent on effective relationships with key suppliers and in many cases internal development of new products or application of current consumer trends to existing product lines. Our ability to develop, promote and apply our exclusive brands to new products is a critical component of\nbuilding competitive assortments that drive our sales. Our ability to effectively source products, including through factory direct relationships, allows us to offer assortments at competitive prices while maintaining profitable product margins.\nManagement of inventory and our supply chain. We offer an extensive assortment, which at its peak, averages more than 95,000 SKUs in stores and over 245,000 SKUs through our e-commerce platforms, across Creative Product categories. The high number of SKUs required to support our business as well as the need to introduce new products and manage seasonality create complexity in our operations. We also sometimes experience long lead times for manufacture and delivery of our products, particularly those that we source directly from foreign suppliers, which further increases inventory carrying costs. The ability to effectively forecast product demand, maintain a high number of vendor relationships and order volume, replenish and allocate product and manage distribution and logistics are all critical to our success. Issues with any of these processes could result in lost sales or excess inventories which would have a negative impact on our results of operations.\nInvestments in our locations, technology, infrastructure, team members and new business opportunities. We have made, and will continue to make, significant investments in our business and operations. We believe these investments have laid the foundation for our results of operations and continued profitable growth. Refreshing our locations, enhancing our omni-channel and other customer-facing and supporting technologies, strengthening our core business processes, adding talent while developing our current team and making investments in ventures that augment our current business are critical to sustaining a vibrant enterprise that will drive strong financial results.\nSeasonality in quarterly results. Historically, our net sales and operating profits have been materially higher in our third and fourth fiscal quarters, particularly in the months of September through December, coinciding with fall and holiday selling seasons. We incur significantly higher expenses and working capital needs in April through August in order to procure inventory to support higher levels of sales activity later in the year. Our ability to generate cash flow or otherwise finance increased costs in the earlier portion of our fiscal year is critical to achieving strong net sales and operating profit in our historically busier fall and holiday seasons.\nEffects of COVID-19 on Our Business\nWe continue to closely monitor the impact of the COVID-19 outbreak on all facets of our business. We have taken actions to protect the safety of our team members and customers and to manage the business through the resulting fluid and challenging environment.\nIn late 2019, an outbreak of COVID-19 emerged and by March 11, 2020 was declared a global pandemic by The World Health Organization. Federal, state, and local governments have since implemented various restrictions, including travel restrictions, border closings, restrictions on public gatherings, quarantining of people who may have been exposed to the virus, shelter-in-place restrictions and limitations on business operations. In response to government closure orders, we were forced to close hundreds of our locations. During the second half of March 2020 and the beginning of April 2020, approximately half of our locations were closed, either completely or to in-store traffic. However, we immediately began working diligently with local and national government officials in advocating that our business and the products we sell were essential in the fight against COVID-19, and therefore exempt from shelter-in-place and stay-at-home orders. Over the ensuing weeks, we began to re-open many of our locations across the country. Initially, many of these locations were re-opened for curbside pick-up only via our BOPIS ordering process. At the beginning of the second quarter of fiscal 2021, we had fewer than 30 locations fully closed and roughly 400 locations open for curbside pick-up only, and by mid-June 2020, all locations were fully operational and open to walk-in traffic. Throughout the entirety of the third and fourth quarters of fiscal 2021, all locations remained opened other than for temporary deep cleanings required to maintain sanitation protocols or for weather and other related hazards. Since that time, certain state and local governments have continued to impose retail closure orders and capacity restrictions, impacting some of our locations. During this time, our ability to fulfill e-commerce orders via both our BOPIS and ship-to-home programs without interruption has had a significant positive impact on our financial performance. We have also experienced an increase in sales in certain merchandise categories due to the effects of the pandemic, as consumers created personal protective equipment, or PPE, such as face masks, and engaged in more DIY projects due to additional time spent at home. This increase in activity has led to significant additions to our marketing database, which has grown by over 10 million customers in fiscal 2021. Our ability to directly market to these new customers through our robust and efficient digital channels has led to repeat purchases across a broad array of our merchandise assortments. We have also experienced declines in sales of a limited number of categories that are tied to activities that are restricted due to the pandemic such as special occasion fabrics used by customers that plan a wedding or that make their own Halloween costumes. In addition, we incurred additional supply chain expenses to ensure we were adequately stocked on key merchandise and to mitigate supply interruptions that the pandemic caused. Our COVID-19 related costs for fiscal 2021 were $65.0 million. Throughout the pandemic, we have worked closely with our suppliers to manage flow of inventory and prioritize our most urgently required merchandise, as in many cases our needs have varied from earlier expectations and our suppliers have often needed to react to their own challenges presented\nby COVID-19. While it is difficult to estimate the sales to date that have been attributable to PPE-making with precision, we have been able to note significant changes in normal sales trends in categories that support that effort. These categories include cotton fabric, certain sewing supplies such as elastic, and sewing machines. Those favorable impacts to our sales were partially offset by mandated store closures and reduced sales in categories such as special occasion fabrics and seasonal d\u00e9cor and entertaining, which have been negatively impacted by broad restrictions on customer gatherings and celebrations. We estimate the net result of those impacts amount to a one-time annualized benefit to our sales of 8% to 9% for fiscal 2021. However, we view the significant number of new customers and increased engagement by new and current customers as an encouraging signal for the future of our business. We also believe the rapid adoption by customers of our digital and omni-channel offerings is a highly scalable platform that we can leverage to increase sales and reduce costs.\nIn response to the pandemic, we have instituted modified or reduced hours, as well as reduced occupancy limits, for all of our locations. In certain jurisdictions, our occupancy is further limited by the relevant government authority. We have also implemented, and may need to take further steps to, make adjustments to staffing levels and location configurations to reflect not only applicable restrictions and guidelines but also potential levels of consumer engagement. We are prioritizing the health and safety of our team members and customers and, to that end, we have instituted the following guidelines within all locations:\n \u2022 requiring all team members in our locations to perform a health screening before each shift, which includes temperature checks, and instructing team members to stay home if they exhibit any COVID-19 symptoms; \n \u2022 putting up signs and other indicators to promote social distancing while shopping and standing in line; \n \u2022 implementing increased cleaning and sanitization practices throughout the location, with additional focus on high-traffic and high-touch areas such as carts, cutting counters and checkout counters; \n \u2022 wearing a face mask or face shield; and \n \u2022 conducting a pre-opening checklist in each location each day. \nOur steps to manage operation of our locations during the pandemic have added costs to our business, some of which are non-recurring in nature, including, but not limited to premium pay for our hourly employees as well as incremental labor hours and supplies to maintain sanitation and social distancing protocols. These precautions may change from time to time as local conditions and applicable health mandates change, and therefore, it is possible we may be required to temporarily close locations or limit our operations. See Risk Factors-Risks Relating to our Business-Our business is subject to continued uncertainty with respect to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.\u201d\nHow We Assess the Performance of Our Business\nIn assessing our performance, we consider a variety of performance and financial measures. The key accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ( GAAP\u201d) measures include net sales, cost of sales, selling, general and administrative expenses and operating profit. In addition, we also review other important non-GAAP metrics such as Adjusted EBITDA and other performance indicators such as total comparable sales.\nNet Sales\nNet sales are derived from direct retail sales to customers in our locations and online, net of merchandise returns, discounts and coupons, and excluding sales tax. Growth in net sales is impacted by total comparable sales, new location openings, location refreshes and closures.\nTotal Comparable Sales\nTotal comparable sales are an important measure throughout the retail industry. This measure allows us to evaluate how our location base and e-commerce business are performing by measuring the change in period-over-period net sales in locations that have been open for the applicable period. We define total comparable sales as net sales for locations that have been open for at least 13 months as well as net sales for locations that have not been remodeled, expanded or downsized in the last 13 months. In addition, total comparable sales include our e-commerce sales generated via joann.com (online sales for all products) and creativebug.com (online sales of digital videos for crafting projects). There may be variations in the way in which some of our competitors and other retailers calculate comparable sales. As a result, data in this Annual Report on Form 10-K regarding our total comparable sales may not be comparable to similar data made available by other retailers.\nGross Margin\nGross margin is calculated as net sales less cost of sales. Cost of sales consists primarily of the direct cost of merchandise sold at our locations and through our e-commerce platforms, along with several other costs including freight expense, vendor allowances and cash discounts, inventory shrink and clearance activity. We define gross margin rate as gross margin divided by net sales.\nOur calculations of gross margins may not be directly comparable to those of our competitors. Some retailers include all of the costs related to their distribution network in cost of sales, while we exclude the indirect portion from gross margin and include it within selling, general and administrative expenses, or SG&A expenses. We include distribution costs that are directly associated with the acquisition of our merchandise and delivery to our locations in cost of sales. These costs are primarily freight incurred when we receive merchandise shipments from the vendor to our distribution centers or directly to our locations and also when we ship merchandise from our distribution centers to our locations. Freight incurred to ship e-commerce orders to our customers is also included in our cost of sales. These freight costs as well as duties, including tariffs, related to import purchases and internal transfer costs are considered to be direct costs of our merchandise and, accordingly, are recognized as cost of sales when the related merchandise is sold.\nPurchasing, receiving, warehousing, fulfillment of e-commerce orders (excluding shipping costs) and other costs of our distribution network (including depreciation) and location occupancy costs are considered to be period costs not directly attributable to the value of merchandise and, accordingly, are expensed as incurred as SG&A expenses.\nSelling, General and Administrative Expenses\nSG&A expenses consist of various costs related to supporting and facilitating the sale of merchandise in our locations and via our e-commerce platforms. These costs include but are not limited to location, distribution center and administrative payroll, employee benefits, stock-based compensation, occupancy, facility and operating costs for our locations, distribution centers and corporate office, advertising expenses, payment card acceptance and interchange fees, location pre-opening and closing costs and other administrative expenses.\nResults of Operations\nThe following tables summarize key components of our results of operations for the periods indicated. The following discussion should be read in conjunction with our Consolidated Financial Statements and related notes included elsewhere in this Annual Report on form 10-K.

Total comparable sales increased 23.5% for fiscal 2021 compared to a 3.6% total comparable sales decrease for the prior year. Our total comparable sales growth resulted from an 18% increase in average transaction value and a 4% increase in transactions in our retail locations along with increases in third party fulfilled e-commerce sales and freight revenue on e-commerce orders. Increases in average transaction value were primarily driven by higher average unit retail values as well as increases in the average number of items purchased per transaction. Omni-channel net sales grew by 305% in fiscal 2021 as compared to fiscal 2020 and represented 19% of total sales.\nGross Margin\nGross margin was $1,366.2 million for fiscal 2021, an increase of $260.9 million or 23.6% compared to fiscal 2020. The increase was primarily driven by an increase in net sales and further supported by an increase in our gross margin rate. Gross margin rate was 49.5% for fiscal 2021, an increase of 14 basis points compared to fiscal 2020. Improvements in product costs obtained through our strategic sourcing efforts and the reduced depth of our promotional offers were partially offset by incremental U.S. tariffs on Chinese imports, higher freight expense associated with the increased volume of e-commerce orders, and increases in clearance activity as well as increases in theft, loss and damage of merchandise inventory, which we refer to as inventory shrink.\nWe also experienced increases in costs related to the COVID-19 pandemic, including import costs to expedite delivery of critical merchandise and costs of donated product related to our community support efforts.\nSelling, General and Administrative Expenses\nSG&A expenses were $1,132.0 million for fiscal 2021, an increase of $154.6 million or 15.8% compared to fiscal 2020. This increase was primarily driven by several factors, including $50.9 million of incremental one-time expenses throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, which included maintaining protocols to ensure a safe environment for our customers and team members through intensified cleaning and stronger focus on capacity management along with additional labor costs associated with premium pay provided from April through January to all of our essential store and distribution center team members. In addition, we provided for increases in expected payments under our incentive compensation plans of $42.5 million which were based on our favorable financial performance during the year compared to our expectations. Finally, we experienced higher location labor of $40.0 million along with payment card interchange fees and other variable expenses of $10.0 million due to our higher total comparable sales in fiscal 2021 compared to fiscal 2020.\nAs a percentage of net sales, SG&A expenses for fiscal 2021 were 41.0%, a decrease of 262 basis points compared to fiscal 2020. This improvement was driven by our ability to leverage our net sales increase against expenses that have grown more slowly, even after absorbing incremental expenses to manage through the COVID-19 pandemic.\nDepreciation and Amortization\nDepreciation and amortization expense was $80.0 million in fiscal 2021, an increase of $2.5 million compared to fiscal 2020. This increase was driven primarily by investments in location refresh and technology projects in fiscal 2020.\nGoodwill and Trade Name Impairment\nThere were no goodwill or trade name impairment losses recorded in fiscal 2021 due to no indication of impairment. We did record impairment charges of $486.8 million in fiscal 2020, which were predominantly the result of negative total comparable sales and declining margins, driven primarily by the incremental U.S. tariffs on Chinese imports, along with a weaker than expected peak selling season. See Note 8-Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets to our Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further details.\nInterest Expense\nInterest expense for fiscal 2021 was $69.0 million, a decrease of $32.9 million compared to fiscal 2020. This decrease in interest expense was due to lower average borrowings and lower interest rates as a result of decreases in LIBOR rates. The average debt level in fiscal 2021 was $1,054.6 million compared to $1,256.7 million in fiscal 2020.\nWe had $793.7 million of debt outstanding (face value) as of January 30, 2021 versus $1,235.5 million as of February 1, 2020.\nDebt Related (Gain) Loss\nDuring fiscal 2021, we repurchased $351.5 million in face value of the term loans provided pursuant to our First Lien Facility and our Second Lien Facility, at an average of 54% of par, resulting in a $155.2 million gain, which is included in debt related (gain) loss within the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income (Loss) and the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. A write-off of the deferred charges and original issue discount, totaling $6.0 million, associated with the original debt issuance was recognized as an offset to the gain recognized. The term loan repurchases were executed, following a competitive market bidding process, through several open market purchases on arm's length terms and in compliance with the terms of the underlying credit agreements. See Note 2-Financing to our Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further details.\nIncome Taxes\nOur effective income tax rate for fiscal 2021 was 11.7% compared to (2.3)% on a pre-tax loss for fiscal 2020. The increase in the effective income tax rate in fiscal 2021, as compared to fiscal 2020, relates primarily to the reversal of the valuation allowance for the deferred tax asset relating to the interest expense carryover, an effective tax rate benefit for a net operating loss carried back to tax years with a Federal tax rate of 35% versus 21%, as well as the impact of the nondeductible goodwill impairment.\nNet Income (Loss)\nNet income was $212.3 million for fiscal 2021, an increase of $758.9 million compared to fiscal 2020. The increase was driven by the factors described above.\nAdjusted EBITDA\nAdjusted EBITDA increased 110.8% to $323.3 million or 11.7% of net sales for fiscal 2021 compared to $153.4 million or 6.8% of sales for fiscal 2020. Our growth in Adjusted EBITDA of $169.9 million and expansion of Adjusted EBITDA as a percentage of net sales of 487 basis points was driven primarily by growth in total comparable sales that exceeded our rate of growth in SG&A expenses, as well as improvements in our gross margin rate.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nWe present Adjusted EBITDA, which is not a recognized financial measure under GAAP, because we believe it assists investors and analysts in comparing our performance across reporting periods on a consistent basis by excluding items that we\ndo not believe are indicative of our core operating performance. Management believes Adjusted EBITDA is helpful in highlighting trends in our core operating performance compared to other measures, which can differ significantly depending on long-term strategic decisions regarding capital structure, the tax jurisdictions in which companies operate and capital investments. We also use Adjusted EBITDA in connection with establishing discretionary annual incentive compensation; to supplement GAAP measures of performance in the evaluation of the effectiveness of our business strategies; to make budgeting decisions; to compare our performance against that of other peer companies using similar measures; and because our Credit Facilities use measures similar to Adjusted EBITDA to measure our compliance with certain covenants.\nWe define Adjusted EBITDA as net income (loss) plus income tax provision (benefit), interest expense, net, debt related (gain) loss and depreciation and amortization, as further adjusted to eliminate the impact of certain non-cash items and other items that we do not consider indicative of our ongoing operating performance, including costs related to strategic initiatives, COVID-19 costs, technology development expense, stock-based compensation expense, loss on disposal and impairment of fixed and operating lease assets, goodwill and trade name impairment, sponsor management fees and other one-time costs. The further adjustments are itemized in the table below.\nAdjusted EBITDA has limitations as an analytical tool, and you should not consider it in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under GAAP. Some of these limitations are:\n \u2022 Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect our cash expenditures or future requirements for capital expenditures or contractual commitments; \n \u2022 Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect changes in our cash requirements for our working capital needs; \n \u2022 Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect the interest expense and the cash requirements necessary to service interest and principal payments on our debt; \n \u2022 Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect cash requirements for replacement of assets that are being depreciated and amortized; \n \u2022 Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect non-cash compensation, which is a key element of our overall long-term incentive compensation; \n \u2022 Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect the impact of certain cash charges or cash receipts resulting from matters we do not find indicative of our ongoing operations; and \n \u2022 other companies in our industry may calculate Adjusted EBITDA differently than we do, limiting its usefulness as a comparative measure. \nWe compensate for these limitations by relying primarily on our GAAP results and using Adjusted EBITDA only as supplemental information.\nThe following is a reconciliation of our net income (loss) to Adjusted EBITDA for the periods presented:\nTable 149: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Fiscal Year Ended\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (In millions)\n</td>

related (gain) loss\u201d represents gains associated with debt repurchases below par and write off of unamortized fees and original issue discount associated with debt refinancings. \n (2) Depreciation and amortization\u201d represents depreciation, amortization of intangible assets, amortization of favorable and unfavorable lease rights, and amortization of content costs. \n (3) Strategic initiatives\u201d represents non-recurring costs, such as third-party consulting costs and one-time start-up costs, that are not part of our ongoing operations and are incurred to execute differentiated, project-based strategic initiatives, including costs (i) to design a new prototype and assortment optimization process for locations, (ii) related to our efforts to initially evaluate and implement opportunities to offset the significant costs incurred due to the new U.S. tariffs on merchandise produced in China, (iii) to start up a new technology product that would traditionally be incurred by our vendors, (iv) to evaluate our opportunity in new potential lines of business, (v) to analyze improved supply chain capabilities, (vi) related to one-time legal and accounting fees associated with our initial public offering and (vii) to establish our foreign sourcing office. \n (4) COVID-19 costs\u201d represents premium pay for location team members (including cleaning and location capacity management labor), incremental seasonal clearance associated with location closures, donations for our mask making initiative and additional location cleaning supplies. \n (5) Technology development expense\u201d represents one-time IT project management and implementation expenses, such as internal project management labor, third-party consulting fees and user fees incurred during the development period of a new software application, that are not part of our ongoing operations and are typically redundant during the initial implementation of software applications or other technology systems across different functional operations of our business before they are in productive use. \n (6) Based on our evaluation for impairment of the carrying amount of goodwill and trade name on our balance sheet. Impairment recorded was driven predominantly by the result of negative total comparable sales and declining margins, primarily resulting from the incremental U.S. tariffs on Chinese imports, along with a weaker than expected peak selling season. See Note 8-Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets to our Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further details. \n (7) Sponsor management fee\u201d represents management fees paid to our sponsor, LGP (or advisory affiliates thereof), in accordance with our management services agreement, which terminated upon the consummation our initial public offering. Following our offering, LGP does not provide managerial services to us in any form. \n (8) Other\u201d represents one-time severance, certain legal, executive leadership transition and business transition expenses. \nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nPrior to our initial public offering, we had three principal sources of liquidity: cash generated from operations, cash and cash equivalents on hand and available borrowings under our ABL Facility. We believe that our cash and cash equivalents on hand, cash from operations and availability under our ABL Facility will be sufficient to cover our working capital, capital expenditure and debt service requirement needs for the foreseeable future. Please refer to Note 2-Financing to our Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a description of the material terms of our Credit Facilities. As of January 30, 2021 and February 1, 2020, we were in compliance with all covenants under our Credit Facilities.\nOn March 12, 2021, in connection with our initial public offering, we issued and sold 5,468,750 shares of our common stock at a price to the public of $12.00 per share, resulting in net proceeds to us of approximately $57.8 million, after deducting the underwriting discount of approximately $4.3 million and offering expenses of approximately $3.5 million.\nWe define Credit Facility Adjusted EBITDA\u201d as Adjusted EBITDA (as defined above) plus location pre-opening and closing costs excluding loss on disposal and impairment of fixed assets, which is calculated consistently with our calculation of Adjusted EBITDA under our Credit Facilities. We reference Credit Facility Adjusted EBITDA because it is a measure that is calculated in accordance with our Credit Facilities and used to determine our compliance with certain ratios in our Credit Facilities, tested each quarter on the basis of the preceding four quarters. For example, we are permitted to prepay debt and make distributions on account of equity up to a certain amount (i) under our First Lien Facility if our ratio of consolidated net debt to Credit Facility Adjusted EBITDA for the prior four quarters as of the quarterly test is not greater than 4.90 to 1.0 and our ratio of consolidated senior secured net debt to Credit Facility Adjusted EBITDA for such period is not greater than 3.60 to 1.0 and (ii) under our Second Lien Facility if our ratio of consolidated net debt to Credit Facility Adjusted EBITDA for such period is not greater than 4.50 to 1.0. As of January 30, 2021, our ratio of consolidated net debt to Credit Facility Adjusted EBITDA was 3.3 to 1.0, and of consolidated senior secured net debt to Credit Facility Adjusted EBITDA was 2.1 to 1.0. Other provisions in our Credit Facilities utilize ratios including Credit Facility Adjusted EBITDA for calculating permitted limits for us to incur additional debt and make certain investments. Additionally, our ratio of consolidated senior secured net debt to Credit Facility Adjusted EBITDA is measured once per year following the completion of our annual Consolidated Financial Statements and determines what percentage of our excess cash flow (as defined in our First Lien Facility and our Second Lien Facility) we are required to apply for the repayment of principal on our First Lien Facility (or if paid off or terminated, our Second Lien Facility), ranging from 50% of excess cash flow for ratios in excess of 2.50x to 0% of excess cash flow for ratios\nof less than 2.00x. For fiscal 2021, no excess cash flow payment was required. Accordingly, we believe that Credit Facility Adjusted EBITDA is material to an investor's understanding of our financial condition and liquidity.\nTable 158: <table> <tr> <td> (in millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Fiscal\nYear-Ended\nJanuary 30,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net cash provided by operating activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 327.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Non-cash operating lease expense\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (152.4\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Depreciation and amortization excluding content cost amortization\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (80.0\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Deferred income taxes\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Stock-based compensation expense\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (1.5\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Amortization of deferred financing costs and original issue discount\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (3.7\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Debt related gain\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 155.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Loss on disposal and impairment of fixed assets\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (3.4\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Change in operating assets and liabilities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (32.8\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 212.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Income tax provision\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 28.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Interest expense, net\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 69.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Debt related gain\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (155.1\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Depreciation and amortization\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 80.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Strategic initiatives\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 6.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> COVID-19 costs\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 65.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Technology development expense\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 5.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Stock-based compensation expense\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Loss on disposal and impairment of fixed and operating lease assets\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 5.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Sponsor management fee\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Adjusted EBITDA\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 323.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Location pre-opening and closing costs excluding loss on disposal of fixed assets\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 5.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Credit Facility Adjusted EBITDA\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 328.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOur capital requirements are primarily for capital expenditures in connection with new location openings, location remodels, investments in information technology, other infrastructure investments and working capital requirements for seasonal inventory build. These requirements fluctuate during the year and reach their highest levels during the second and third fiscal quarters as we increase our inventory in preparation for our peak selling season during the months of September through December and complete most of our capital spending projects.\nThe following table provides a summary of our cash provided by operating, investing and financing activities:\nTable 159: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Fiscal Year-Ended\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (In millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> January 30,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> February 1,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> February 2,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net cash provided by (used for) operating activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 327.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (33.9\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 99.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net cash used for investing activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (35.7\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (79.5\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (49.7\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net cash (used for) provided by financing activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (288.4\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 86.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (25.1\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 3.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (27.1\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 24.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nComparison of the 52 Weeks Ended January 30, 2021 and February 1, 2020\nNet cash provided by (used for) operating activities\nNet cash provided by operating activities was $327.1 million in fiscal 2021 compared with $(33.9) million of net cash used for operating activities in fiscal 2020. The increase in net cash provided by operating activities was primarily driven by our positive total comparable sales results, the significant improvement in working capital efficiency and the deferral of certain cash payments either negotiated with our landlords or allowed under the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. The majority of deferred payments will be remitted over the course of fiscal 2022.\nNet cash used for investing activities\nCash used for investing activities consists primarily of capital expenditures, the majority of which are focused on strategic initiatives including: new location openings, location remodels and refreshes and information technology investments, particularly those supporting our omni-channel platforms and other customer facing systems. We also incur capital outlays for equipment and facility management in our distribution centers, locations and corporate offices.\nSpecifically, investment for each refresh project is tailored to each location's needs and unit economics. We have four general levels of investment and project scope tailored to what would benefit each location, with future investment expected to range from $150,000 for lightest-touch refreshes to $3 million for the relatively few but most-extensive refreshes. Over 50% of our existing locations are refresh project targets over the next seven to ten years and we expect investments in relation to these future refresh projects to remain consistent with our capital expenditures in connection with completed refresh projects.\nHistorical capital expenditures are summarized as follows:\nTable 160: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Fiscal Year-Ended\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (In millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> January 30,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> February 1,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> February 2,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Retail locations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 21.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 52.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 33.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Information technology\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 10.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 20.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 13.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 6.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total capital expenditures\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 36.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 78.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 48.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Landlord contributions\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (4.4\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (9.1\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (7.4\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total capital expenditures, net of landlord contributions\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 31.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 69.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 41.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTotal capital expenditures, net of landlord contributions decreased by $37.9 million in fiscal 2021 compared to the prior fiscal year. This decrease was related to specific actions taken to defer projects in an effort to preserve liquidity at the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. Also, due to the need to maintain sanitation and social distancing protocols in our locations throughout the pandemic, execution of capital projects has often not been feasible.\nNet cash (used for) provided by financing activities\nNet cash used for financing activities was $(288.4) million in fiscal 2021 compared with $86.3 million of net cash provided by financing activities in fiscal 2020. The change in net cash (used for) provided by financing activities was primarily the result of the repurchase of portions of the First Lien Facility and Second Lien Facility, as well as an increase in payments on the ABL Facility.\nOff-Balance Sheet Transactions\nOur liquidity is currently not dependent on the use of off-balance sheet transactions other than letters of credit which are typical in a retail environment.\nContractual Obligations and Commitments\nThe following table summarizes our future cash outflows resulting from contractual obligations and commitments as of January 30, 2021:\nTable 161: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Payments Due by Fiscal Year\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (In millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2023-2024\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2025-2026\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Thereafter\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Standby letters of credit\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 23.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 23.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Purchase commitments (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 20.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 8.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 10.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Operating leases\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,135.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 235.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 400.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 278.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 221.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Finance leases\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 13.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 5.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 7.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> ABL Facility (2)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 85.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 85.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> ABL Facility interest (2)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 5.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> First Lien Facility (3)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 635.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 635.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> First Lien Facility interest (3)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 109.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 41.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 67.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Second Lien Facility (4)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 72.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 72.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Second Lien Facility interest (4)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 25.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 7.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 15.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total contractual cash obligations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 2,126.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 324.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,138.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 442.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 221.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n (1) Purchase commitments include significant future inventory purchases as well as agreements for technology, in which minimum guaranteed payments are required. \n (2) We had $85.5 million in outstanding borrowings under our ABL Facility at January 30, 2021. Under our ABL Facility, we are required to pay a commitment fee of 0.25% per year on unutilized commitments. The amounts included in ABL Facility interest were based on these annual commitment fees. \n (3) The First Lien Facility, which matures October 21, 2023, is with a syndicate of lenders and is secured by substantially all of our assets excluding the ABL Facility collateral and has a second priority security interest in the ABL Facility collateral. The First Lien Facility provided for mandatory quarterly repayments of $2.3 million on the last business day of each January, April, July and October. As of the second quarter of fiscal 2021, the mandatory quarterly repayments are no longer required as a result of the Company's debt repurchases exceeding the total mandatory quarterly repayments due over the balance of the life of the loan. Interest payments are due either monthly or quarterly on approximately the 23rd day of the month depending on the underlying LIBOR and are subject to variable interest rates. The amounts included in the First Lien Facility interest were based on the interest rate effective as of January 30, 2021. \n (4) The Second Lien Facility, which matures May 21, 2024, is with a syndicate of lenders and is secured by a second priority security interest in all of our assets, excluding the ABL Facility collateral, and has a third priority security interest in the ABL Facility collateral. The Second Lien Facility does not require quarterly principal payments. Interest payments are due either monthly or quarterly on approximately the 23rd day of the month depending on the underlying LIBOR and are subject to variable interest rates. The amounts included in the Second Lien Facility interest were based on the interest rate effective as of January 30, 2021. \nSeasonality\nOur business exhibits seasonality, which is typical for most retail companies. Our net sales are stronger in the second half of the year than the first half of the year. Net income is highest during the months of September through December when sales volumes provide significant operating leverage. Working capital needed to finance our operations fluctuate during the year and reach their highest levels during the second and third fiscal quarters as we increase our inventory in preparation for our peak selling season. However, the COVID-19 pandemic may have an impact to consumer behaviors and customer traffic that result in changes in the seasonal fluctuations of our business. For example, our fiscal 2021 second, third and fourth quarter results were positively impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic due to the demand for select merchandise categories.\nSummarized below are key

</tr>\n</table>\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nWe strive to report our financial results in a clear and understandable manner. We follow GAAP in preparing our Consolidated Financial Statements. These principles require us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, expenses and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. We base our estimates on historical experience and on other assumptions that we believe to be relevant under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results could differ from these estimates under different assumptions and/or conditions. We continually evaluate the information used to make these estimates as our business and the economic environment change. The use of estimates is pervasive throughout our financial statements. The accounting policies that involve estimates or assumptions that are material due to levels of subjectivity and judgment necessary to account for highly uncertain matters or are susceptible to change and we consider most critical are as follows:\nInventory Valuation\nInventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value with cost determined on a weighted average basis. Inventory valuation methods require certain management estimates and judgments, the most significant of which involves estimates of net realizable value on product designated for clearance, which affects the ending inventory valuation at cost, as well as the cost of sales reported for the year.\nWe estimate our reserve for clearance product based on a number of factors, including, but not limited to, quantities of slow-moving or carryover seasonal merchandise on hand, historical recovery statistics and future merchandising plans. The accuracy of our estimates can be affected by many factors, some of which are beyond our control, including changes in economic conditions and consumer buying trends. The corresponding adjustment to cost of sales is recorded in the period the decision is made. We do not believe that the assumptions used in our estimate will change significantly based on prior experience.\nOur accrual for inventory shrink is estimated as a percent of sales. The percent used in the determination of the accrual is based on actual historical inventory shrink results of our locations. This estimated percent is applied to sales of our locations for the periods following each location's most recent physical inventory. In addition, we analyze our accrual using actual results as physical inventory counts are taken and reconciled to the general ledger. Substantially all of our location physical inventory counts are taken in the first three quarters of each year. A majority of locations that have been open one year or longer are physically inventoried once a year. See Note 1-Significant Accounting Policies to our audited financial statements-Inventories included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further details.\nImpairment of Long-Lived and Operating Lease Assets\nWe evaluate recoverability of long-lived and operating lease assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable (for example, when a location's performance falls below minimum company standards). In the fourth quarter of each fiscal year or earlier if indicators of impairment exist, we review the performance of individual locations. Underperforming locations are selected for further evaluation of the recoverability of the location's net asset values. If the evaluation, done on an undiscounted cash flow basis, indicates that a location's net asset value may not be recoverable, the potential impairment is measured as the excess of carrying value over the fair value of the impaired asset. We estimate fair value based on a projected discounted cash flow method using a discount rate that is considered to be commensurate with the risk inherent in our current business model. Additional factors are taken into consideration, such as local market conditions and operating environment. See Note 1-Significant Accounting Policies to our audited financial statements-Impairment of Long-Lived and Operating Lease Assets included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further details.\nGoodwill and Other Indefinite Lived Intangible Assets\nWe assess the carrying value of goodwill at the reporting unit level. A reporting unit is the operating segment, or a business unit one level below that operating segment, for which discrete financial information is prepared and regularly reviewed by segment management.\nAnnually, as of the first day of the fourth quarter, or more frequently if circumstances indicate impairment may exist, we assess qualitative factors to determine whether any circumstances exist which would indicate that it is more-likely-than-not that the fair values of the reporting units are below their respective carrying values. If such circumstances exist, a quantitative assessment is performed. The quantitative assessment compares the fair value of a reporting unit to its current carrying value. We determine the estimated fair value of a reporting unit based on valuation techniques including discounted cash flows as well as a market comparable method. If the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds the carrying value of the net assets assigned to that reporting unit, goodwill is not considered impaired.\nAnnually, as of the first day of the fourth quarter, or more frequently if circumstances indicate impairment may exist, we assess qualitative factors to determine whether any circumstances exist which would indicate that it is more-likely-than-not that the fair values of the indefinite-lived intangible assets not subject to amortization (JOANN Trade Name and joann.com Domain Name) are below their respective carrying values. If such circumstances exist, a quantitative assessment is performed. The quantitative assessment compares the fair value of an intangible asset to its current carrying value. We determine the estimated fair value of an intangible asset based upon the relief from royalty method which evaluates the appropriate royalty rate for the asset.\nSee Note 8-Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets to our Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further details.\nSelf-Insurance Reserves\nWe are self-insured for certain losses relating to general liability, workers' compensation, and employee medical benefit claims. The ultimate cost of our workers' compensation and general liability insurance accruals are recorded based on actuarial valuations and historical claims experience. Our employee medical insurance accruals are recorded based on its medical claims processed, as well as historical medical claims experience for claims incurred but not yet reported. We maintain stop-loss coverage to limit the exposure to certain insurance-related risks. Management believes that the various assumptions developed, and actuarial methods used to determine our self- insurance reserves are reasonable and provide meaningful data and information that is used to make the best estimate of our exposure to these risks. Differences in estimates and assumptions could result in an accrual requirement materially different from the calculated accrual. Historically, such differences have not been significant. A 10% change in our self-insured liabilities as of January 30, 2021 would have affected selling and administrative expenses, operating profit, and income before income taxes by approximately $3.0 million.\nIncome Taxes\nIncome taxes are estimated for federal and each state jurisdiction in which we operate. This approach involves assessing the current tax exposure together with temporary differences which result from differing treatment of items for tax and book purposes. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are established based on these assessments. Deferred tax assets are evaluated for recoverability based on future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences, future taxable income exclusive of reversing temporary differences and carryforwards, taxable income in carryback years and tax-planning strategies. To the extent that recovery is deemed unlikely, a valuation allowance is recorded. Our valuation allowance was $4.4 million and $30.7 million as of January 30, 2021 and February 1, 2020, respectively. In fiscal 2020, the valuation allowance primarily related to the deferred tax assets for interest expense and charitable contribution carryforwards. The valuation allowance decreased in fiscal 2021 because taxable income is sufficient in the current fiscal year to fully utilize charitable contribution and interest expense carryforwards. Many years of data have been incorporated into the determination of tax reserves and our estimates have historically proven to be reasonable.\nStock-Based Compensation\nThe fair value of stock-based awards to employees is recognized as compensation expense on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period of the awards. The fair value of the stock-based awards is determined using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. Determining the fair value of options at the grant date requires judgment, including estimating the expected life that stock options will be outstanding prior to exercise and the associated volatility. The absence of an active market for our common stock prior to our public offering has also required our board of directors to determine the fair value of our common stock for purposes of granting stock options. Following the listing of our common stock on Nasdaq, it is not necessary to determine the fair value of our common stock, as our shares are traded in the public market.\nThe risk-free interest rate is an estimated average interest rate based on U.S. Treasury zero-coupon notes with terms consistent with the expected term of the awards. Until our public offering, there was no observable market for our common stock. Therefore, stock price volatility was calculated using the historical stock price volatility of comparable companies over the expected life of the options granted. We have not recently declared or paid any cash dividends and had not planned to pay cash dividends at the date of grants. Consequently, we used an expected dividend yield of zero. Expected life represents the period that our stock-based awards are expected to be outstanding. The expected life assumptions are determined based on the vesting terms, exercise terms, and contractual lives of the options. We account for forfeiture of non-vested options as they occur. Changes in the assumptions can materially affect the estimate of fair value of stock-based compensation and consequently, the related amount recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income (Loss). See Note 10-Stock-Based Compensation to our Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further details.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nSee Note 1-Significant Accounting Policies included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for information regarding recently issued and adopted accounting pronouncements.", "item_7_text": "Item 7.

The Creative Products industry is a large and growing market, which according to a 2017 AFCI study is in excess of $40 billion. The industry is currently experiencing a significant acceleration for product demand in response to multiple themes that have been further solidified during the COVID-19 pandemic, such as heightened DIY customer behavior, amplified participation from both new and existing customers and increased digital engagement, of which we are a key beneficiary because we have positioned ourselves and our go-forward strategies to capitalize on increased demand for Creative Products. As a well-established and trusted brand for over 75 years, we believe we have a deep understanding of our customers, what inspires their creativity and what fuels their incredibly diverse projects. Since 2016, we have embarked on a strategy to transform JOANN, which has helped us pivot from a traditional retailer to a fully-integrated, digitally-connected provider of Creative Products.\nAs the nation's category leader in Sewing with approximately one-third market share, based on our internal research estimates of market share of the Creative Products industry that primarily consist of an annual survey of Creative Product consumers as of July 31, 2020, we believe we offer the broadest selection of products while being committed to providing the most inspiration, helpful service and education to our customers. While we continue to gain market share and solidify this leadership position in Sewing, which represented 48% of our total net sales in fiscal 2021, we have also been growing our share of and believe we have further significant share opportunity in the arts and crafts category. We are well-positioned in the marketplace and have multiple competitive advantages, including our broad assortment, established omni-channel platform, multi-faceted digital interface with customers and skilled and knowledgeable team members. We offer an extensive assortment, which at its peak, averages more than 95,000 SKUs in stores and over 245,000 SKUs online, across Creative Product categories. Over 50% of our in-store net sales cannot be directly comparison-shopped because of our strong and growing own-brand portfolio, including our copyrighted or proprietary fabric patterns and designs and factory direct relationships. We have expanded access to this broad assortment through e-commerce and digital capabilities that complement our physical network, drive customer engagement and deliver an exceptional customer experience while supporting consistently strong gross margins. Through our omni-channel platform, we serve our customers in a differentiated manner by offering several convenient fulfillment options, including BOPIS, curbside pick-up and ship-to-home offerings. Our omni-channel platform operates at a large scale, having generated approximately $511 million, $126 million and $103 million in net sales in fiscal 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Our data-driven digital capabilities further reinforce our relationship with our customers. Customers can interact with our brand whenever and however they want. Customers connect with us through our newly re-designed mobile-first website, joann.com, and our widely-used mobile application with more than 12 million downloads. As of the end of fiscal 2021, we had approximately 71 million addressable customers in our vast database, nearly 17 million customers in our email database and over four million customers in our very large SMS text database. These points of differentiation are reinforced by our knowledgeable, friendly and trusted team members, a significant number of whom are sewing and craft enthusiasts, who offer a service-oriented experience for our customers that we believe cannot be replicated by mass retailers or pure play online players.\nIn 2016, we accelerated our journey to transform JOANN by reinventing the in-store and digital customer experience. We recruited talent at every level of the company and across all key business areas to complement our existing expertise. This undertaking has resulted in significant enhancements to our value proposition, including reinvigorating our core merchandise assortment, refreshing our branding, developing a location refresh prototype and improving the customer experience. We improved our assortment by conducting a systematic review of all categories at a product-level and all layouts at a location-\nlevel in order to optimize sales and gross margin. We have also expanded our data-driven digital footprint, which includes our extensive digital marketing assets, CRM system, social media platforms and e-commerce capabilities. We better understand our customers through our centralized database that brings together how each customer interacts in our physical and digital properties and provides a holistic view of their behavior. We are able to utilize this data to drive engagement with our brand, create loyalty and inspire, educate and ensure we are increasing our share of customer spend through timely and relevant marketing. By using data and digital contact channels, including email and SMS digital display, and leveraging our mobile application, we are able to contact customers with personalized content and provide the convenience to shop wherever and however they choose. We believe that these core initiatives and transformational investments have driven our performance and increased customer engagement over the last several years and strategically position us to continue to create long-term value. This momentum was temporarily interrupted in fiscal 2020 by the unanticipated headwind of incremental U.S. tariffs on Chinese imports that we estimate, before mitigation, would have amounted to $75 million of additional annual costs, as these tariffs applied to a broad range our products. However, after working to partially offset their effects and having incorporated the balance of these tariffs into our cost base, we are driving strong operating profit growth across both our locations and e-commerce platform as well as achieving margin expansion.\nFactors Affecting Our Business\nOverall economic trends. The overall economic environment and related changes in consumer behavior have a significant impact on our business. Spending by customers on our products and services is primarily discretionary, and as a result generally positive economic conditions create increased discretionary household income that promotes higher levels of spending across our business. However, the creative activities we support tend to be lower cost than other leisure activities, which could protect us to a certain degree from economic downturns. Macroeconomic factors that can affect customer spending patterns, and thereby our results of operations, include employment rates, availability of consumer credit, interest rates, tax rates and inflation, and fuel and energy costs. Macroeconomic factors can also affect our input and labor costs, notably inflation, as our financial results and ability to invest in the business are directly impacted by increases or decreases in the cost of goods and services required in our operations and initiatives. In addition to inflation, our input and labor costs are impacted by mandated costs such as minimum wages and trade policies, most significantly tariffs and duties on our products imported from foreign countries. The implementation of incremental U.S. tariffs on Chinese imports in particular has had a significant impact on our cost of goods sold, product demand and sourcing strategies. Before mitigation, we estimate that incremental U.S. tariffs on Chinese imports in fiscal 2020 would have amounted to $75 million of additional annual costs, as these tariffs applied to a broad range of our products.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic. As described below, the COVID-19 pandemic has had and is expected to continue to have a substantial impact on our business.\nConsumer demand for our products and services. Our industry supports activities that are discretionary in nature and can be highly influenced by consumer trends. Our ability to achieve our desired results, including attracting new customers and growing share of spend with existing customers, depends on our ability to develop compelling product assortments and services delivered within a convenient and engaging shopping experience. Moreover, due to the nature of our business, we purchase much of our inventory well in advance of each selling season. If we misjudge consumer preferences and demand for certain products, we could be faced with excess inventories that would impact our net sales and profits.\nSize and loyalty of our customer database. Our ability to effectively market to our customers is a critical component of our business success. We tier our customers based on total sales volume and frequency of purchase. For fiscal 2021, 29% of our net sales were generated by our top three million customers. Our recent success is also being largely driven by new customers added to our database, as 15% of our net sales for fiscal 2021 were generated by new customers added to our database over that same time period.\nCompetition. The Creative Products industry includes specialty retailers and mass merchandisers that provide assortments in many of our categories albeit typically with more limited breadth, local shops that tend to feature select categories (e.g. quilting and yarn shops) and pure play e-commerce players. We compete with all of these providers for customer attention, shopping visits, exclusive vendor relationships, leadership talent and in some cases front line employees and retail locations. Our ability to be effective across all of those points of competition has a significant effect on our results of operations.\nEffective development and sourcing of products. Our business success requires that we provide relevant and innovative products to our customers at competitive prices. Development of those products is dependent on effective relationships with key suppliers and in many cases internal development of new products or application of current consumer trends to existing product lines. Our ability to develop, promote and apply our exclusive brands to new products is a critical component of\nbuilding competitive assortments that drive our sales. Our ability to effectively source products, including through factory direct relationships, allows us to offer assortments at competitive prices while maintaining profitable product margins.\nManagement of inventory and our supply chain. We offer an extensive assortment, which at its peak, averages more than 95,000 SKUs in stores and over 245,000 SKUs through our e-commerce platforms, across Creative Product categories. The high number of SKUs required to support our business as well as the need to introduce new products and manage seasonality create complexity in our operations. We also sometimes experience long lead times for manufacture and delivery of our products, particularly those that we source directly from foreign suppliers, which further increases inventory carrying costs. The ability to effectively forecast product demand, maintain a high number of vendor relationships and order volume, replenish and allocate product and manage distribution and logistics are all critical to our success. Issues with any of these processes could result in lost sales or excess inventories which would have a negative impact on our results of operations.\nInvestments in our locations, technology, infrastructure, team members and new business opportunities. We have made, and will continue to make, significant investments in our business and operations. We believe these investments have laid the foundation for our results of operations and continued profitable growth. Refreshing our locations, enhancing our omni-channel and other customer-facing and supporting technologies, strengthening our core business processes, adding talent while developing our current team and making investments in ventures that augment our current business are critical to sustaining a vibrant enterprise that will drive strong financial results.\nSeasonality in quarterly results. Historically, our net sales and operating profits have been materially higher in our third and fourth fiscal quarters, particularly in the months of September through December, coinciding with fall and holiday selling seasons. We incur significantly higher expenses and working capital needs in April through August in order to procure inventory to support higher levels of sales activity later in the year. Our ability to generate cash flow or otherwise finance increased costs in the earlier portion of our fiscal year is critical to achieving strong net sales and operating profit in our historically busier fall and holiday seasons.\nEffects of COVID-19 on Our Business\nWe continue to closely monitor the impact of the COVID-19 outbreak on all facets of our business. We have taken actions to protect the safety of our team members and customers and to manage the business through the resulting fluid and challenging environment.\nIn late 2019, an outbreak of COVID-19 emerged and by March 11, 2020 was declared a global pandemic by The World Health Organization. Federal, state, and local governments have since implemented various restrictions, including travel restrictions, border closings, restrictions on public gatherings, quarantining of people who may have been exposed to the virus, shelter-in-place restrictions and limitations on business operations. In response to government closure orders, we were forced to close hundreds of our locations. During the second half of March 2020 and the beginning of April 2020, approximately half of our locations were closed, either completely or to in-store traffic. However, we immediately began working diligently with local and national government officials in advocating that our business and the products we sell were essential in the fight against COVID-19, and therefore exempt from shelter-in-place and stay-at-home orders. Over the ensuing weeks, we began to re-open many of our locations across the country. Initially, many of these locations were re-opened for curbside pick-up only via our BOPIS ordering process. At the beginning of the second quarter of fiscal 2021, we had fewer than 30 locations fully closed and roughly 400 locations open for curbside pick-up only, and by mid-June 2020, all locations were fully operational and open to walk-in traffic. Throughout the entirety of the third and fourth quarters of fiscal 2021, all locations remained opened other than for temporary deep cleanings required to maintain sanitation protocols or for weather and other related hazards. Since that time, certain state and local governments have continued to impose retail closure orders and capacity restrictions, impacting some of our locations. During this time, our ability to fulfill e-commerce orders via both our BOPIS and ship-to-home programs without interruption has had a significant positive impact on our financial performance. We have also experienced an increase in sales in certain merchandise categories due to the effects of the pandemic, as consumers created personal protective equipment, or PPE, such as face masks, and engaged in more DIY projects due to additional time spent at home. This increase in activity has led to significant additions to our marketing database, which has grown by over 10 million customers in fiscal 2021. Our ability to directly market to these new customers through our robust and efficient digital channels has led to repeat purchases across a broad array of our merchandise assortments. We have also experienced declines in sales of a limited number of categories that are tied to activities that are restricted due to the pandemic such as special occasion fabrics used by customers that plan a wedding or that make their own Halloween costumes. In addition, we incurred additional supply chain expenses to ensure we were adequately stocked on key merchandise and to mitigate supply interruptions that the pandemic caused. Our COVID-19 related costs for fiscal 2021 were $65.0 million. Throughout the pandemic, we have worked closely with our suppliers to manage flow of inventory and prioritize our most urgently required merchandise, as in many cases our needs have varied from earlier expectations and our suppliers have often needed to react to their own challenges presented\nby COVID-19. While it is difficult to estimate the sales to date that have been attributable to PPE-making with precision, we have been able to note significant changes in normal sales trends in categories that support that effort. These categories include cotton fabric, certain sewing supplies such as elastic, and sewing machines. Those favorable impacts to our sales were partially offset by mandated store closures and reduced sales in categories such as special occasion fabrics and seasonal d\u00e9cor and entertaining, which have been negatively impacted by broad restrictions on customer gatherings and celebrations. We estimate the net result of those impacts amount to a one-time annualized benefit to our sales of 8% to 9% for fiscal 2021. However, we view the significant number of new customers and increased engagement by new and current customers as an encouraging signal for the future of our business. We also believe the rapid adoption by customers of our digital and omni-channel offerings is a highly scalable platform that we can leverage to increase sales and reduce costs.\nIn response to the pandemic, we have instituted modified or reduced hours, as well as reduced occupancy limits, for all of our locations. In certain jurisdictions, our occupancy is further limited by the relevant government authority. We have also implemented, and may need to take further steps to, make adjustments to staffing levels and location configurations to reflect not only applicable restrictions and guidelines but also potential levels of consumer engagement. We are prioritizing the health and safety of our team members and customers and, to that end, we have instituted the following guidelines within all locations:\n \u2022 requiring all team members in our locations to perform a health screening before each shift, which includes temperature checks, and instructing team members to stay home if they exhibit any COVID-19 symptoms; \n \u2022 putting up signs and other indicators to promote social distancing while shopping and standing in line; \n \u2022 implementing increased cleaning and sanitization practices throughout the location, with additional focus on high-traffic and high-touch areas such as carts, cutting counters and checkout counters; \n \u2022 wearing a face mask or face shield; and \n \u2022 conducting a pre-opening checklist in each location each day. \nOur steps to manage operation of our locations during the pandemic have added costs to our business, some of which are non-recurring in nature, including, but not limited to premium pay for our hourly employees as well as incremental labor hours and supplies to maintain sanitation and social distancing protocols. These precautions may change from time to time as local conditions and applicable health mandates change, and therefore, it is possible we may be required to temporarily close locations or limit our operations. See Risk Factors-Risks Relating to our Business-Our business is subject to continued uncertainty with respect to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.\u201d\nHow We Assess the Performance of Our Business\nIn assessing our performance, we consider a variety of performance and financial measures. The key accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ( GAAP\u201d) measures include net sales, cost of sales, selling, general and administrative expenses and operating profit. In addition, we also review other important non-GAAP metrics such as Adjusted EBITDA and other performance indicators such as total comparable sales.\nNet Sales\nNet sales are derived from direct retail sales to customers in our locations and online, net of merchandise returns, discounts and coupons, and excluding sales tax. Growth in net sales is impacted by total comparable sales, new location openings, location refreshes and closures.\nTotal Comparable Sales\nTotal comparable sales are an important measure throughout the retail industry. This measure allows us to evaluate how our location base and e-commerce business are performing by measuring the change in period-over-period net sales in locations that have been open for the applicable period. We define total comparable sales as net sales for locations that have been open for at least 13 months as well as net sales for locations that have not been remodeled, expanded or downsized in the last 13 months. In addition, total comparable sales include our e-commerce sales generated via joann.com (online sales for all products) and creativebug.com (online sales of digital videos for crafting projects). There may be variations in the way in which some of our competitors and other retailers calculate comparable sales. As a result, data in this Annual Report on Form 10-K regarding our total comparable sales may not be comparable to similar data made available by other retailers.\nGross Margin\nGross margin is calculated as net sales less cost of sales. Cost of sales consists primarily of the direct cost of merchandise sold at our locations and through our e-commerce platforms, along with several other costs including freight expense, vendor allowances and cash discounts, inventory shrink and clearance activity. We define gross margin rate as gross margin divided by net sales.\nOur calculations of gross margins may not be directly comparable to those of our competitors. Some retailers include all of the costs related to their distribution network in cost of sales, while we exclude the indirect portion from gross margin and include it within selling, general and administrative expenses, or SG&A expenses. We include distribution costs that are directly associated with the acquisition of our merchandise and delivery to our locations in cost of sales. These costs are primarily freight incurred when we receive merchandise shipments from the vendor to our distribution centers or directly to our locations and also when we ship merchandise from our distribution centers to our locations. Freight incurred to ship e-commerce orders to our customers is also included in our cost of sales. These freight costs as well as duties, including tariffs, related to import purchases and internal transfer costs are considered to be direct costs of our merchandise and, accordingly, are recognized as cost of sales when the related merchandise is sold.\nPurchasing, receiving, warehousing, fulfillment of e-commerce orders (excluding shipping costs) and other costs of our distribution network (including depreciation) and location occupancy costs are considered to be period costs not directly attributable to the value of merchandise and, accordingly, are expensed as incurred as SG&A expenses.\nSelling, General and Administrative Expenses\nSG&A expenses consist of various costs related to supporting and facilitating the sale of merchandise in our locations and via our e-commerce platforms. These costs include but are not limited to location, distribution center and administrative payroll, employee benefits, stock-based compensation, occupancy, facility and operating costs for our locations, distribution centers and corporate office, advertising expenses, payment card acceptance and interchange fees, location pre-opening and closing costs and other administrative expenses.\nResults of Operations\nThe following tables summarize key components of our results of operations for the periods indicated. The following discussion should be read in conjunction with our Consolidated Financial Statements and related notes included elsewhere in this Annual Report on form 10-K. Discussion of the year ended February 1, 2020 compared with the year ended February 2, 2019 is included in Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d in our Final Prospectus.\nStatement of Consolidated Income Data:\n\nOther Operational Data:\n\n (1) See Non-GAAP Financial Measures\u201d for a definition of Adjusted EBITDA and a reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to net income (loss). \nComparison of the 52 Weeks Ended January 30, 2021 and February 1, 2020\nNet Sales\nNet sales were $2,762.3 million for fiscal 2021, an increase of $521.1 million or 23.3% compared to fiscal 2020. Total comparable sales increased 23.5% for fiscal 2021 compared to a 3.6% total comparable sales decrease for the prior year. Our total comparable sales growth resulted from an 18% increase in average transaction value and a 4% increase in transactions in our retail locations along with increases in third party fulfilled e-commerce sales and freight revenue on e-commerce orders. Increases in average transaction value were primarily driven by higher average unit retail values as well as increases in the average number of items purchased per transaction. Omni-channel net sales grew by 305% in fiscal 2021 as compared to fiscal 2020 and represented 19% of total sales.\nGross Margin\nGross margin was $1,366.2 million for fiscal 2021, an increase of $260.9 million or 23.6% compared to fiscal 2020. The increase was primarily driven by an increase in net sales and further supported by an increase in our gross margin rate. Gross margin rate was 49.5% for fiscal 2021, an increase of 14 basis points compared to fiscal 2020. Improvements in product costs obtained through our strategic sourcing efforts and the reduced depth of our promotional offers were partially offset by incremental U.S. tariffs on Chinese imports, higher freight expense associated with the increased volume of e-commerce orders, and increases in clearance activity as well as increases in theft, loss and damage of merchandise inventory, which we refer to as inventory shrink.\nWe also experienced increases in costs related to the COVID-19 pandemic, including import costs to expedite delivery of critical merchandise and costs of donated product related to our community support efforts.\nSelling, General and Administrative Expenses\nSG&A expenses were $1,132.0 million for fiscal 2021, an increase of $154.6 million or 15.8% compared to fiscal 2020. This increase was primarily driven by several factors, including $50.9 million of incremental one-time expenses throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, which included maintaining protocols to ensure a safe environment for our customers and team members through intensified cleaning and stronger focus on capacity management along with additional labor costs associated with premium pay provided from April through January to all of our essential store and distribution center team members. In addition, we provided for increases in expected payments under our incentive compensation plans of $42.5 million which were based on our favorable financial performance during the year compared to our expectations. Finally, we experienced higher location labor of $40.0 million along with payment card interchange fees and other variable expenses of $10.0 million due to our higher total comparable sales in fiscal 2021 compared to fiscal 2020.\nAs a percentage of net sales, SG&A expenses for fiscal 2021 were 41.0%, a decrease of 262 basis points compared to fiscal 2020. This improvement was driven by our ability to leverage our net sales increase against expenses that have grown more slowly, even after absorbing incremental expenses to manage through the COVID-19 pandemic.\nDepreciation and Amortization\nDepreciation and amortization expense was $80.0 million in fiscal 2021, an increase of $2.5 million compared to fiscal 2020. This increase was driven primarily by investments in location refresh and technology projects in fiscal 2020.\nGoodwill and Trade Name Impairment\nThere were no goodwill or trade name impairment losses recorded in fiscal 2021 due to no indication of impairment. We did record impairment charges of $486.8 million in fiscal 2020, which were predominantly the result of negative total comparable sales and declining margins, driven primarily by the incremental U.S. tariffs on Chinese imports, along with a weaker than expected peak selling season. See Note 8-Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets to our Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further details.\nInterest Expense\nInterest expense for fiscal 2021 was $69.0 million, a decrease of $32.9 million compared to fiscal 2020. This decrease in interest expense was due to lower average borrowings and lower interest rates as a result of decreases in LIBOR rates. The average debt level in fiscal 2021 was $1,054.6 million compared to $1,256.7 million in fiscal 2020.\nWe had $793.7 million of debt outstanding (face value) as of January 30, 2021 versus $1,235.5 million as of February 1, 2020.\nDebt Related (Gain) Loss\nDuring fiscal 2021, we repurchased $351.5 million in face value of the term loans provided pursuant to our First Lien Facility and our Second Lien Facility, at an average of 54% of par, resulting in a $155.2 million gain, which is included in debt related (gain) loss within the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income (Loss) and the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. A write-off of the deferred charges and original issue discount, totaling $6.0 million, associated with the original debt issuance was recognized as an offset to the gain recognized. The term loan repurchases were executed, following a competitive market bidding process, through several open market purchases on arm's length terms and in compliance with the terms of the underlying credit agreements. See Note 2-Financing to our Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further details.\nIncome Taxes\nOur effective income tax rate for fiscal 2021 was 11.7% compared to (2.3)% on a pre-tax loss for fiscal 2020. The increase in the effective income tax rate in fiscal 2021, as compared to fiscal 2020, relates primarily to the reversal of the valuation allowance for the deferred tax asset relating to the interest expense carryover, an effective tax rate benefit for a net operating loss carried back to tax years with a Federal tax rate of 35% versus 21%, as well as the impact of the nondeductible goodwill impairment.\nNet Income (Loss)\nNet income was $212.3 million for fiscal 2021, an increase of $758.9 million compared to fiscal 2020. The increase was driven by the factors described above.\nAdjusted EBITDA\nAdjusted EBITDA increased 110.8% to $323.3 million or 11.7% of net sales for fiscal 2021 compared to $153.4 million or 6.8% of sales for fiscal 2020. Our growth in Adjusted EBITDA of $169.9 million and expansion of Adjusted EBITDA as a percentage of net sales of 487 basis points was driven primarily by growth in total comparable sales that exceeded our rate of growth in SG&A expenses, as well as improvements in our gross margin rate.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nWe present Adjusted EBITDA, which is not a recognized financial measure under GAAP, because we believe it assists investors and analysts in comparing our performance across reporting periods on a consistent basis by excluding items that we\ndo not believe are indicative of our core operating performance. Management believes Adjusted EBITDA is helpful in highlighting trends in our core operating performance compared to other measures, which can differ significantly depending on long-term strategic decisions regarding capital structure, the tax jurisdictions in which companies operate and capital investments. We also use Adjusted EBITDA in connection with establishing discretionary annual incentive compensation; to supplement GAAP measures of performance in the evaluation of the effectiveness of our business strategies; to make budgeting decisions; to compare our performance against that of other peer companies using similar measures; and because our Credit Facilities use measures similar to Adjusted EBITDA to measure our compliance with certain covenants.\nWe define Adjusted EBITDA as net income (loss) plus income tax provision (benefit), interest expense, net, debt related (gain) loss and depreciation and amortization, as further adjusted to eliminate the impact of certain non-cash items and other items that we do not consider indicative of our ongoing operating performance, including costs related to strategic initiatives, COVID-19 costs, technology development expense, stock-based compensation expense, loss on disposal and impairment of fixed and operating lease assets, goodwill and trade name impairment, sponsor management fees and other one-time costs. The further adjustments are itemized in the table below.\nAdjusted EBITDA has limitations as an analytical tool, and you should not consider it in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under GAAP. Some of these limitations are:\n \u2022 Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect our cash expenditures or future requirements for capital expenditures or contractual commitments; \n \u2022 Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect changes in our cash requirements for our working capital needs; \n \u2022 Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect the interest expense and the cash requirements necessary to service interest and principal payments on our debt; \n \u2022 Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect cash requirements for replacement of assets that are being depreciated and amortized; \n \u2022 Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect non-cash compensation, which is a key element of our overall long-term incentive compensation; \n \u2022 Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect the impact of certain cash charges or cash receipts resulting from matters we do not find indicative of our ongoing operations; and \n \u2022 other companies in our industry may calculate Adjusted EBITDA differently than we do, limiting its usefulness as a comparative measure. \nWe compensate for these limitations by relying primarily on our GAAP results and using Adjusted EBITDA only as supplemental information.\nThe following is a reconciliation of our net income (loss) to Adjusted EBITDA for the periods presented:\n\n (1) Debt related (gain) loss\u201d represents gains associated with debt repurchases below par and write off of unamortized fees and original issue discount associated with debt refinancings. \n (2) Depreciation and amortization\u201d represents depreciation, amortization of intangible assets, amortization of favorable and unfavorable lease rights, and amortization of content costs. \n (3) Strategic initiatives\u201d represents non-recurring costs, such as third-party consulting costs and one-time start-up costs, that are not part of our ongoing operations and are incurred to execute differentiated, project-based strategic initiatives, including costs (i) to design a new prototype and assortment optimization process for locations, (ii) related to our efforts to initially evaluate and implement opportunities to offset the significant costs incurred due to the new U.S. tariffs on merchandise produced in China, (iii) to start up a new technology product that would traditionally be incurred by our vendors, (iv) to evaluate our opportunity in new potential lines of business, (v) to analyze improved supply chain capabilities, (vi) related to one-time legal and accounting fees associated with our initial public offering and (vii) to establish our foreign sourcing office. \n (4) COVID-19 costs\u201d represents premium pay for location team members (including cleaning and location capacity management labor), incremental seasonal clearance associated with location closures, donations for our mask making initiative and additional location cleaning supplies. \n (5) Technology development expense\u201d represents one-time IT project management and implementation expenses, such as internal project management labor, third-party consulting fees and user fees incurred during the development period of a new software application, that are not part of our ongoing operations and are typically redundant during the initial implementation of software applications or other technology systems across different functional operations of our business before they are in productive use. \n (6) Based on our evaluation for impairment of the carrying amount of goodwill and trade name on our balance sheet. Impairment recorded was driven predominantly by the result of negative total comparable sales and declining margins, primarily resulting from the incremental U.S. tariffs on Chinese imports, along with a weaker than expected peak selling season. See Note 8-Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets to our Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further details. \n (7) Sponsor management fee\u201d represents management fees paid to our sponsor, LGP (or advisory affiliates thereof), in accordance with our management services agreement, which terminated upon the consummation our initial public offering. Following our offering, LGP does not provide managerial services to us in any form. \n (8) Other\u201d represents one-time severance, certain legal, executive leadership transition and business transition expenses. \nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nPrior to our initial public offering, we had three principal sources of liquidity: cash generated from operations, cash and cash equivalents on hand and available borrowings under our ABL Facility. We believe that our cash and cash equivalents on hand, cash from operations and availability under our ABL Facility will be sufficient to cover our working capital, capital expenditure and debt service requirement needs for the foreseeable future. Please refer to Note 2-Financing to our Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a description of the material terms of our Credit Facilities. As of January 30, 2021 and February 1, 2020, we were in compliance with all covenants under our Credit Facilities.\nOn March 12, 2021, in connection with our initial public offering, we issued and sold 5,468,750 shares of our common stock at a price to the public of $12.00 per share, resulting in net proceeds to us of approximately $57.8 million, after deducting the underwriting discount of approximately $4.3 million and offering expenses of approximately $3.5 million.\nWe define Credit Facility Adjusted EBITDA\u201d as Adjusted EBITDA (as defined above) plus location pre-opening and closing costs excluding loss on disposal and impairment of fixed assets, which is calculated consistently with our calculation of Adjusted EBITDA under our Credit Facilities. We reference Credit Facility Adjusted EBITDA because it is a measure that is calculated in accordance with our Credit Facilities and used to determine our compliance with certain ratios in our Credit Facilities, tested each quarter on the basis of the preceding four quarters. For example, we are permitted to prepay debt and make distributions on account of equity up to a certain amount (i) under our First Lien Facility if our ratio of consolidated net debt to Credit Facility Adjusted EBITDA for the prior four quarters as of the quarterly test is not greater than 4.90 to 1.0 and our ratio of consolidated senior secured net debt to Credit Facility Adjusted EBITDA for such period is not greater than 3.60 to 1.0 and (ii) under our Second Lien Facility if our ratio of consolidated net debt to Credit Facility Adjusted EBITDA for such period is not greater than 4.50 to 1.0. As of January 30, 2021, our ratio of consolidated net debt to Credit Facility Adjusted EBITDA was 3.3 to 1.0, and of consolidated senior secured net debt to Credit Facility Adjusted EBITDA was 2.1 to 1.0. Other provisions in our Credit Facilities utilize ratios including Credit Facility Adjusted EBITDA for calculating permitted limits for us to incur additional debt and make certain investments. Additionally, our ratio of consolidated senior secured net debt to Credit Facility Adjusted EBITDA is measured once per year following the completion of our annual Consolidated Financial Statements and determines what percentage of our excess cash flow (as defined in our First Lien Facility and our Second Lien Facility) we are required to apply for the repayment of principal on our First Lien Facility (or if paid off or terminated, our Second Lien Facility), ranging from 50% of excess cash flow for ratios in excess of 2.50x to 0% of excess cash flow for ratios\nof less than 2.00x. For fiscal 2021, no excess cash flow payment was required. Accordingly, we believe that Credit Facility Adjusted EBITDA is material to an investor's understanding of our financial condition and liquidity.\n\nOur capital requirements are primarily for capital expenditures in connection with new location openings, location remodels, investments in information technology, other infrastructure investments and working capital requirements for seasonal inventory build. These requirements fluctuate during the year and reach their highest levels during the second and third fiscal quarters as we increase our inventory in preparation for our peak selling season during the months of September through December and complete most of our capital spending projects.\nThe following table provides a summary of our cash provided by operating, investing and financing activities:\n\nComparison of the 52 Weeks Ended January 30, 2021 and February 1, 2020\nNet cash provided by (used for) operating activities\nNet cash provided by operating activities was $327.1 million in fiscal 2021 compared with $(33.9) million of net cash used for operating activities in fiscal 2020. The increase in net cash provided by operating activities was primarily driven by our positive total comparable sales results, the significant improvement in working capital efficiency and the deferral of certain cash payments either negotiated with our landlords or allowed under the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. The majority of deferred payments will be remitted over the course of fiscal 2022.\nNet cash used for investing activities\nCash used for investing activities consists primarily of capital expenditures, the majority of which are focused on strategic initiatives including: new location openings, location remodels and refreshes and information technology investments, particularly those supporting our omni-channel platforms and other customer facing systems. We also incur capital outlays for equipment and facility management in our distribution centers, locations and corporate offices.\nSpecifically, investment for each refresh project is tailored to each location's needs and unit economics. We have four general levels of investment and project scope tailored to what would benefit each location, with future investment expected to range from $150,000 for lightest-touch refreshes to $3 million for the relatively few but most-extensive refreshes. Over 50% of our existing locations are refresh project targets over the next seven to ten years and we expect investments in relation to these future refresh projects to remain consistent with our capital expenditures in connection with completed refresh projects.\nHistorical capital expenditures are summarized as follows:\n\nTotal capital expenditures, net of landlord contributions decreased by $37.9 million in fiscal 2021 compared to the prior fiscal year. This decrease was related to specific actions taken to defer projects in an effort to preserve liquidity at the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. Also, due to the need to maintain sanitation and social distancing protocols in our locations throughout the pandemic, execution of capital projects has often not been feasible.\nNet cash (used for) provided by financing activities\nNet cash used for financing activities was $(288.4) million in fiscal 2021 compared with $86.3 million of net cash provided by financing activities in fiscal 2020. The change in net cash (used for) provided by financing activities was primarily the result of the repurchase of portions of the First Lien Facility and Second Lien Facility, as well as an increase in payments on the ABL Facility.\nOff-Balance Sheet Transactions\nOur liquidity is currently not dependent on the use of off-balance sheet transactions other than letters of credit which are typical in a retail environment.\nContractual Obligations and Commitments\nThe following table summarizes our future cash outflows resulting from contractual obligations and commitments as of January 30, 2021:\n\n (1) Purchase commitments include significant future inventory purchases as well as agreements for technology, in which minimum guaranteed payments are required. \n (2) We had $85.5 million in outstanding borrowings under our ABL Facility at January 30, 2021. Under our ABL Facility, we are required to pay a commitment fee of 0.25% per year on unutilized commitments. The amounts included in ABL Facility interest were based on these annual commitment fees. \n (3) The First Lien Facility, which matures October 21, 2023, is with a syndicate of lenders and is secured by substantially all of our assets excluding the ABL Facility collateral and has a second priority security interest in the ABL Facility collateral. The First Lien Facility provided for mandatory quarterly repayments of $2.3 million on the last business day of each January, April, July and October. As of the second quarter of fiscal 2021, the mandatory quarterly repayments are no longer required as a result of the Company's debt repurchases exceeding the total mandatory quarterly repayments due over the balance of the life of the loan. Interest payments are due either monthly or quarterly on approximately the 23rd day of the month depending on the underlying LIBOR and are subject to variable interest rates. The amounts included in the First Lien Facility interest were based on the interest rate effective as of January 30, 2021. \n (4) The Second Lien Facility, which matures May 21, 2024, is with a syndicate of lenders and is secured by a second priority security interest in all of our assets, excluding the ABL Facility collateral, and has a third priority security interest in the ABL Facility collateral. The Second Lien Facility does not require quarterly principal payments. Interest payments are due either monthly or quarterly on approximately the 23rd day of the month depending on the underlying LIBOR and are subject to variable interest rates. The amounts included in the Second Lien Facility interest were based on the interest rate effective as of January 30, 2021. \nSeasonality\nOur business exhibits seasonality, which is typical for most retail companies. Our net sales are stronger in the second half of the year than the first half of the year. Net income is highest during the months of September through December when sales volumes provide significant operating leverage. Working capital needed to finance our operations fluctuate during the year and reach their highest levels during the second and third fiscal quarters as we increase our inventory in preparation for our peak selling season. However, the COVID-19 pandemic may have an impact to consumer behaviors and customer traffic that result in changes in the seasonal fluctuations of our business. For example, our fiscal 2021 second, third and fourth quarter results were positively impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic due to the demand for select merchandise categories.\nSummarized below are key line items by quarter from our Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income (Loss):\n\n\n\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nWe strive to report our financial results in a clear and understandable manner. We follow GAAP in preparing our Consolidated Financial Statements. These principles require us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, expenses and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. We base our estimates on historical experience and on other assumptions that we believe to be relevant under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results could differ from these estimates under different assumptions and/or conditions. We continually evaluate the information used to make these estimates as our business and the economic environment change. The use of estimates is pervasive throughout our financial statements. The accounting policies that involve estimates or assumptions that are material due to levels of subjectivity and judgment necessary to account for highly uncertain matters or are susceptible to change and we consider most critical are as follows:\nInventory Valuation\nInventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value with cost determined on a weighted average basis. Inventory valuation methods require certain management estimates and judgments, the most significant of which involves estimates of net realizable value on product designated for clearance, which affects the ending inventory valuation at cost, as well as the cost of sales reported for the year.\nWe estimate our reserve for clearance product based on a number of factors, including, but not limited to, quantities of slow-moving or carryover seasonal merchandise on hand, historical recovery statistics and future merchandising plans. The accuracy of our estimates can be affected by many factors, some of which are beyond our control, including changes in economic conditions and consumer buying trends. The corresponding adjustment to cost of sales is recorded in the period the decision is made. We do not believe that the assumptions used in our estimate will change significantly based on prior experience.\nOur accrual for inventory shrink is estimated as a percent of sales. The percent used in the determination of the accrual is based on actual historical inventory shrink results of our locations. This estimated percent is applied to sales of our locations for the periods following each location's most recent physical inventory. In addition, we analyze our accrual using actual results as physical inventory counts are taken and reconciled to the general ledger. Substantially all of our location physical inventory counts are taken in the first three quarters of each year. A majority of locations that have been open one year or longer are physically inventoried once a year. See Note 1-Significant Accounting Policies to our audited financial statements-Inventories included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further details.\nImpairment of Long-Lived and Operating Lease Assets\nWe evaluate recoverability of long-lived and operating lease assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable (for example, when a location's performance falls below minimum company standards). In the fourth quarter of each fiscal year or earlier if indicators of impairment exist, we review the performance of individual locations. Underperforming locations are selected for further evaluation of the recoverability of the location's net asset values. If the evaluation, done on an undiscounted cash flow basis, indicates that a location's net asset value may not be recoverable, the potential impairment is measured as the excess of carrying value over the fair value of the impaired asset. We estimate fair value based on a projected discounted cash flow method using a discount rate that is considered to be commensurate with the risk inherent in our current business model. Additional factors are taken into consideration, such as local market conditions and operating environment. See Note 1-Significant Accounting Policies to our audited financial statements-Impairment of Long-Lived and Operating Lease Assets included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further details.\nGoodwill and Other Indefinite Lived Intangible Assets\nWe assess the carrying value of goodwill at the reporting unit level. A reporting unit is the operating segment, or a business unit one level below that operating segment, for which discrete financial information is prepared and regularly reviewed by segment management.\nAnnually, as of the first day of the fourth quarter, or more frequently if circumstances indicate impairment may exist, we assess qualitative factors to determine whether any circumstances exist which would indicate that it is more-likely-than-not that the fair values of the reporting units are below their respective carrying values. If such circumstances exist, a quantitative assessment is performed. The quantitative assessment compares the fair value of a reporting unit to its current carrying value. We determine the estimated fair value of a reporting unit based on valuation techniques including discounted cash flows as well as a market comparable method. If the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds the carrying value of the net assets assigned to that reporting unit, goodwill is not considered impaired.\nAnnually, as of the first day of the fourth quarter, or more frequently if circumstances indicate impairment may exist, we assess qualitative factors to determine whether any circumstances exist which would indicate that it is more-likely-than-not that the fair values of the indefinite-lived intangible assets not subject to amortization (JOANN Trade Name and joann.com Domain Name) are below their respective carrying values. If such circumstances exist, a quantitative assessment is performed. The quantitative assessment compares the fair value of an intangible asset to its current carrying value. We determine the estimated fair value of an intangible asset based upon the relief from royalty method which evaluates the appropriate royalty rate for the asset.\nSee Note 8-Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets to our Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further details.\nSelf-Insurance Reserves\nWe are self-insured for certain losses relating to general liability, workers' compensation, and employee medical benefit claims. The ultimate cost of our workers' compensation and general liability insurance accruals are recorded based on actuarial valuations and historical claims experience. Our employee medical insurance accruals are recorded based on its medical claims processed, as well as historical medical claims experience for claims incurred but not yet reported. We maintain stop-loss coverage to limit the exposure to certain insurance-related risks. Management believes that the various assumptions developed, and actuarial methods used to determine our self- insurance reserves are reasonable and provide meaningful data and information that is used to make the best estimate of our exposure to these risks. Differences in estimates and assumptions could result in an accrual requirement materially different from the calculated accrual. Historically, such differences have not been significant. A 10% change in our self-insured liabilities as of January 30, 2021 would have affected selling and administrative expenses, operating profit, and income before income taxes by approximately $3.0 million.\nIncome Taxes\nIncome taxes are estimated for federal and each state jurisdiction in which we operate. This approach involves assessing the current tax exposure together with temporary differences which result from differing treatment of items for tax and book purposes. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are established based on these assessments. Deferred tax assets are evaluated for recoverability based on future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences, future taxable income exclusive of reversing temporary differences and carryforwards, taxable income in carryback years and tax-planning strategies. To the extent that recovery is deemed unlikely, a valuation allowance is recorded. Our valuation allowance was $4.4 million and $30.7 million as of January 30, 2021 and February 1, 2020, respectively. In fiscal 2020, the valuation allowance primarily related to the deferred tax assets for interest expense and charitable contribution carryforwards. The valuation allowance decreased in fiscal 2021 because taxable income is sufficient in the current fiscal year to fully utilize charitable contribution and interest expense carryforwards. Many years of data have been incorporated into the determination of tax reserves and our estimates have historically proven to be reasonable.\nStock-Based Compensation\nThe fair value of stock-based awards to employees is recognized as compensation expense on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period of the awards. The fair value of the stock-based awards is determined using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. Determining the fair value of options at the grant date requires judgment, including estimating the expected life that stock options will be outstanding prior to exercise and the associated volatility. The absence of an active market for our common stock prior to our public offering has also required our board of directors to determine the fair value of our common stock for purposes of granting stock options. Following the listing of our common stock on Nasdaq, it is not necessary to determine the fair value of our common stock, as our shares are traded in the public market.\nThe risk-free interest rate is an estimated average interest rate based on U.S. Treasury zero-coupon notes with terms consistent with the expected term of the awards. Until our public offering, there was no observable market for our common stock. Therefore, stock price volatility was calculated using the historical stock price volatility of comparable companies over the expected life of the options granted. We have not recently declared or paid any cash dividends and had not planned to pay cash dividends at the date of grants. Consequently, we used an expected dividend yield of zero. Expected life represents the period that our stock-based awards are expected to be outstanding. The expected life assumptions are determined based on the vesting terms, exercise terms, and contractual lives of the options. We account for forfeiture of non-vested options as they occur. Changes in the assumptions can materially affect the estimate of fair value of stock-based compensation and consequently, the related amount recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income (Loss). See Note 10-Stock-Based Compensation to our Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further details.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nSee Note

fabrics, crafts and other creative products. Net sales were $2.76 billion in fiscal 2021, up 23.3% from 2020. The increase was driven by a 23.5% increase in total comparable sales.\n\n- Gross margin increased 23.6% to $1.37 billion in 2021 compared to 2020, due to increased sales and a slight increase in gross margin rate to 49.5%. \n\n- SG&A expenses increased 15.8% to $1.13 billion in 2021, primarily due to $50.9 million in COVID-19 related costs and $42.5 million in higher incentive compensation costs. As a percentage of sales, SG&A decreased 262 basis points.\n\n- Net income was $212.3 million in 2021, up from a net loss of $546.6 million in 2020. The increase was driven by higher sales, lower interest expense, and a $155 million debt-related gain.\n\n- Adjusted EBITDA increased 110.8% to $323.3 million in 2021 compared to 2020, due to sales growth exceeding the growth in SG&A expenses and improvements in gross margin.\n\n- The business exhibits seasonality, with higher sales and profits in Q3 and Q4 due to the fall and holiday seasons. \n\n- Critical accounting policies and estimates discussed include inventory valuation, asset impairment, goodwill/intangibles, self-insurance reserves, income taxes, and stock-based compensation.\n\nIn summary, JOANN improved sales, margins and profits in 2021 compared to 2020, driven by increased demand for creative products during the pandemic.
