This discussion and analysis contains forward-looking statements that involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions. Certain risks, uncertainties and other factors, including but not limited to those set forth in Item 1A, entitled, \"Risk Factors\" and elsewhere in this report may cause actual results to differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements.\nExecutive Summary\nWe continue to expand our presence in the Philadelphia region through an aggressive growth strategy which we refer to as \"The Power of Red is Back.\" The goal of this expansion plan is to increase our store footprint while providing legendary customer service. During 2015 we welcomed thousands of new customers into our stores and won them over with exceptional service. The growth in asset, loan and deposit balances clearly demonstrates our ongoing success with this strategy. While we continue to make significant investments to build a new bank, we are very pleased with our ability to maintain consistent, profitable results from an income statement perspective.\nThe new stores opened in Glassboro, Marlton and Berlin, NJ during 2015 have performed exceptionally well. We ended the year with stores under construction in Washington Township, NJ and Wynnewood, PA and several more in various stages of development for future openings.\nThe highlights for the year ended December 31, 2015 are as follows:\nTable 30: <table> <tr> <td>\u00b7 </td> <td>Total assets increased by $225 million, or 19%, to $1.4 billion as of December 31, 2015 compared to $1.2 billion as of December 31, 2014. </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 31: <table> <tr> <td>\u00b7 </td> <td>Non-interest bearing demand deposits increased by 9% to $244 million as of December 31, 2015 compared to $224 million as of December 31, 2014. </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 32: <table> <tr> <td>\u00b7 </td> <td>Total deposits increased by $177 million, or 17%, to $1.2 billion as of December 31, 2015 compared to $1.1 billion as of December 31, 2014.

These measures include tangible book value per common share and average equity to average assets. Management uses these non-GAAP measures to present historical periods comparable to the current period presentation. In addition, management believes the use of these non-GAAP measures provides additional clarity when assessing the Company's financial results and use of equity. These disclosures should not be viewed as substitutes for results determined to be in accordance with U.S. GAAP, nor are they necessarily comparable to non-GAAP performance measures that may be presented by other entities.\nCritical Accounting Policies, Judgments and Estimates\nIn reviewing and understanding our financial information, you are encouraged to read and understand the significant accounting policies used in preparing the consolidated financial statements. These policies are described in Note 2 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. The accounting and financial reporting policies conform to accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America and to general practices within the banking industry. The preparation of the consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of income and expenses during the reporting period. Management evaluates these estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis including those related to the allowance for loan losses, carrying values of other real estate owned, other than temporary impairment of securities, fair value of financial instruments and deferred income taxes. Management bases its estimates on historical experience and various other factors and assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. These form the basis for making judgments on the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.\nWe have identified the policies related to the allowance for loan losses, other-than-temporary impairment of securities, other real estate owned, and deferred income taxes as being critical.\nAllowance for Loan Losses - Management's ongoing evaluation of the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses is based on our past loan loss experience, the volume and composition of our lending, adverse situations that may affect a borrower's ability to repay, the estimated value of any underlying collateral, current economic conditions and other factors affecting the known and inherent risk in the portfolio. The allowance for loan losses is increased by charges to income through the provision for loan losses and decreased by charge-offs (net of recoveries). The allowance is maintained at a level that management, based upon its evaluation, considers adequate to absorb losses inherent in the loan portfolio. This evaluation is inherently subjective as it requires material estimates including, among others, the amount and timing of expected future cash flows on impacted loans, exposure at default, value of collateral, and estimated losses on our commercial and residential loan portfolios. All of these estimates may be susceptible to significant change.\nThe allowance consists of specific allowances for impaired loans, a general allowance on the remainder of the portfolio, and an unallocated component to account for a level of imprecision in management's estimation process. Although management determines the amount of each element of the allowance separately, the allowance for loan losses is available for the entire loan portfolio.\nManagement establishes an allowance on certain impaired loans for the amount by which the discounted cash flows, observable market price, or fair value of collateral if the loan is collateral dependent, is lower than the carrying value of the loan. A loan is considered to be impaired when, based upon current information and events, it is probable that we will be unable to collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the loan. A delay or shortfall in amount of payments does not necessarily result in the loan being identified as impaired.\nManagement also establishes a general allowance on non-impaired loans to recognize the inherent losses associated with lending activities, but which, unlike specific allowances, have not been allocated to particular loans. This general valuation allowance is determined by segregating the loans by loan category and assigning allowance percentages based on our historical loss experience, delinquency trends, and management's evaluation of the collectability of the loan portfolio.\nManagement also evaluates classified loans, which are not impaired. We segregate these loans by category and assign qualitative factors to each loan based on inherent losses associated with each type of lending and consideration that these loans, in the aggregate, represent an above-average credit risk and that more of these loans will prove to be uncollectible compared to loans in the general portfolio. Classification of a loan within this category is based on identified weaknesses that increase the credit risk of the loan.\nThe allowance is adjusted for significant factors that, in management's judgment, affect the collectability of the portfolio as of the evaluation date. These significant factors may include changes in lending policies and procedures, changes in existing general economic and business conditions affecting its primary lending areas, credit quality trends, collateral value, loan volumes and concentrations, seasoning of the loan portfolio, loss experience in particular segments of the portfolio, duration of the current business cycle, and bank regulatory examination results. The applied loss factors are re-evaluated each reporting period to ensure their relevance in the current economic environment.\nWhile management uses the best information known to it in order to make loan loss allowance valuations, adjustments to the allowance may be necessary based on changes in economic and other conditions, changes in the composition of the loan portfolio, or changes in accounting guidance. In times of economic slowdown, either regional or national, the risk inherent in the loan portfolio could increase resulting in the need for additional provisions to the allowance for loan losses in future periods. An increase could also be necessitated by an increase in the size of the loan portfolio or in any of its components even though the credit quality of the overall portfolio may be improving. Historically, the estimates of the allowance for loan loss have provided adequate coverage against actual losses incurred. In addition, the Pennsylvania Department of Banking and Securities and the FDIC, as an integral part of their examination processes, periodically review the allowance for loan losses. The Pennsylvania Department of Banking and Securities or the FDIC may require the recognition of adjustment to the allowance for loan losses based on their judgment of information available to them at the time of their examinations. To the extent that actual outcomes differ from management's estimates, additional provisions to the allowance for loan losses may be required that would adversely impact earnings in future periods.\nOther-Than-Temporary Impairment of Securities - Securities are evaluated on at least a quarterly basis, and more frequently when market conditions warrant such an evaluation, to determine whether a decline in their value is other-than-temporary. To determine whether a loss in value is other-than-temporary, management utilizes criteria such as the reasons underlying the decline, the magnitude and duration of the decline and our intent and ability to retain its investment in the security for a period of time sufficient to allow for an anticipated recovery in the fair value. The term \"other-than-temporary\" is not intended to indicate that the decline is permanent, but indicates that the prospects for a near-term recovery of value is not necessarily favorable, or that there is a lack of evidence to support a realizable value equal to or greater than the carrying value of the investment. Once a decline in value is determined to be other-than-temporary, the value of the security is reduced and a corresponding charge to earnings is recognized.\nOther Real Estate Owned - Other real estate owned consists of assets acquired through, or in lieu of, loan foreclosure. They are held for sale and are initially recorded at fair value less cost to sell at the date of foreclosure, establishing a new cost basis. Subsequent to foreclosure, valuations are periodically performed by management and the assets are carried at the lower of carrying amount or fair value, less the cost to sell. Revenue and expenses from operations and changes in the valuation allowance are included in net expenses from other real estate owned.\nIncome Taxes - Management makes estimates and judgments to calculate various tax liabilities and determine the recoverability of various deferred tax assets, which arise from temporary differences between the tax and financial statement recognition of revenues and expenses. Management also estimates a reserve for deferred tax assets if, based on the available evidence, it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the recorded deferred tax assets will not be realized in future periods. These estimates and judgments are inherently subjective. Historically, management's estimates and judgments to calculate the deferred tax accounts have not required significant revision.\nIn evaluating our ability to recover deferred tax assets, management considers all available positive and negative evidence, including the past operating results and forecasts of future taxable income. In determining future taxable income, management makes assumptions for the amount of taxable income, the reversal of temporary differences and the implementation of feasible and prudent tax planning strategies. These assumptions require management to make judgments about the future taxable income and are consistent with the plans and estimates used to manage the business. Any reduction in estimated future taxable income may require management to record a valuation allowance against the deferred tax assets. An increase in the valuation allowance would result in additional income tax expense in the period and could have a significant impact on future earnings.\nResults of Operations\nFor the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2014\nWe reported net income of $2.4 million, or $0.06 per share, for the twelve months ended December 31, 2015 compared to net income of $2.4 million, or $0.07 per share, for the twelve months ended December 31, 2014.\nNet interest income for the twelve months ended December 31, 2015 increased $4.2 million to $40.1 million as compared to $35.8 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2014. Interest income increased $5.0 million, or 12.3%, due primarily to an increase in average loans receivable and investment securities balances. Interest expense increased $737,000 or 15.9%, primarily due to an increase in average deposit balances.\nWe recorded a loan loss provision in the amount of $500,000 for the twelve months ended December 31, 2015 compared to a provision of $900,000 during the twelve months ended December 31, 2014. The lower provision recorded for the twelve months ended December 31, 2015 was driven by a decrease in the reserve required for loans individually evaluated for impairment in 2015.\nNon-interest income increased $1.9 million to $9.9 million during the twelve months ended December 31, 2015 as compared to $8.0 million during the twelve months ended December 31, 2014 primarily driven by a $2.6 million insurance settlement recorded in 2015 which was related to a bond claim against a corporate insurance policy originally submitted in 2010.\nNon-interest expenses increased $6.5 million to $47.1 million during the twelve months ended December 31, 2015 as compared to $40.6 million during the twelve months ended December 31, 2014. The increase was primarily driven by higher salaries, employee benefits, occupancy and equipment expenses associated with the addition of new stores related to our expansion strategy which we refers to as \"The Power of Red is Back.\" In addition, we made a decision in 2015 to aggressively pursue a potential sale of our largest OREO asset resulting in a write-down of approximately $2.2 million.\nReturn on average assets and average equity from continuing operations were 0.19% and 2.14%, respectively, during the twelve months ended December 31, 2015 compared to 0.23% and 2.51%, respectively, for the twelve months ended December 31, 2014.\nAverage Balances and Net Interest Income\nHistorically, our earnings have depended primarily upon Republic's net interest income, which is the difference between interest earned on interest-earning assets and interest paid on interest-bearing liabilities. Net interest income is affected by changes in the mix of the volume and rates of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities. The following table provides an analysis of net interest income on an annualized basis, setting forth for the periods average assets, liabilities, and shareholders' equity, interest income earned on interest-earning assets and interest expense on interest-bearing liabilities, average yields earned on interest-earning assets and average rates on interest-bearing liabilities, and Republic's net interest margin (net interest income as a percentage of average total interest-earning assets). Averages are computed based on daily balances. Non-accrual loans are included in average loans receivable. Yields are adjusted for tax equivalency, using a rate of 35% in 2015, 2014, and 2013.\nAverage Balances and Net Interest Income\nTable 40: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> For the Year

calculated based on amortized cost.\n(2) Net interest income and net interest margin are presented on a tax equivalent basis. Net interest income has been increased over the financial statement amount by $606, $379, and $323 in 2015, 2014, and 2013, respectively, to adjust for tax equivalency. The tax equivalent net interest margin is calculated by dividing tax equivalent net interest income by average total interest earning assets.\nRate/Volume Analysis of Changes in Net Interest Income\nNet interest income may also be analyzed by segregating the volume and rate components of interest income and interest expense. The following table sets forth an analysis of volume and rate changes in net interest income for the periods indicated. For purposes of this table, changes in interest income and expense are allocated to volume and rate categories based upon the respective changes in average balances and average rates.\nTable 41:

on a fully tax-equivalent basis, for the twelve months of 2015 increased by $4.5 million, or 12.3%, over the same period in 2014. Interest income on interest-earning assets totaled $46.0 million for the twelve months of 2015, an increase of $5.2 million, compared to the same period in 2014. The increase in interest income earned was the result of an increase in the average balance of loans receivable and investment securities that helped to offset a 20 bp decrease in the yield on loans receivable. Total interest expense for the twelve months of 2015 increased $737,000, or 15.9%, to $5.4 million from $4.6 million over the same period in 2014. Interest expense on deposits increased by $730,000, or 20.6%, for the twelve months of 2015 versus the same period of 2014. Interest expense on other borrowings increased by $7,000 for the twelve months of 2015 compared to the same period in 2014.\nChanges in net interest income are frequently measured by two statistics: net interest rate spread and net interest margin. Net interest rate spread is the difference between the average rate earned on interest-earning assets and the average rate incurred on interest-bearing liabilities. Our net interest rate spread on a fully tax-equivalent basis was 3.16% during the twelve months of 2015 versus 3.41% during the twelve months of 2014. Net interest margin represents the difference between interest income, including net loan fees earned, and interest expense, reflected as a percentage of average interest-earning assets. For the twelve months of 2015 and 2014, the fully tax-equivalent net interest margin was 3.29% and 3.56%, respectively. The net interest margin for the year ending December 31, 2015 decreased primarily as a result of a decrease in the yield on loans receivable.\nProvision for Loan Losses\nWe recorded a provision for loan losses in the amount of $500,000 for the twelve months ended December 31, 2015 compared to a $900,000 provision for the twelve months ended December 31, 2014. The provision for loan losses is charged to operations in an amount necessary to bring the total allowance for loan losses to a level that management believes is adequate to absorb inherent losses in the loan portfolio.\nThe provision recorded for the twelve months ended December 31, 2015 as compared to the twelve months ended December 31, 2014 decreased due to an improvement in asset quality, which resulted in a reduction in the allowance for loan losses required for loans individually evaluated for impairment in 2015.\nNon-Interest Income\nTotal noninterest income for the twelve months of 2015 increased by $1.9 million, or 24.0%, from the same period in 2014. We recorded a $2.6 million insurance settlement in 2015 which was related to a claim against a corporate insurance policy originally submitted in 2010. Loan advisory and servicing fees increased by $774 thousand in 2015 due to higher servicing fee income on SBA loans. Service fees on deposit accounts increased by $496,000 in 2015 compared to 2014 due to the growth in the number of customer accounts and deposit balances. We recognized gains of $108,000 on the sale of investment securities during 2015 compared to gains of $458,000 on the sale of investment securities in 2014. Gains recognized on the sale of SBA loans were $3.1 million during the twelve months of 2015 compared to $4.7 million in the same period of 2014 primarily due to a decrease in the volume of loans originated and sold in 2015.\nNon-Interest Expenses\nIn 2015, noninterest expenses increased by $6.5 million, or 16.1%, compared to 2014. An explanation of changes in noninterest expenses for certain categories is presented in the following paragraphs.\nSalary expenses and employee benefits in 2015 were $22.5 million, an increase of $2.4 million, or 11.9%, compared to 2014 primarily driven by annual merit increases along with increased staffing levels related to our aggressive growth strategy of adding and relocating stores, which we refer to as \"The Power of Red is Back.\"\nOccupancy related expenses increased by $1.4 million, or 20.8%, in 2015 compared to 2014, also as a result of the growth and relocation strategy. Three new stores were opened during 2015 and two additional sites were under construction at year end.\nOther real estate owned expenses totaled $4.2 million during 2015, an increase of $2.4 million, when compared to 2014 primarily due to higher writedowns on foreclosed assets held in other real estate owned. A writedown of $2.2 million was recorded against the largest asset held in other real estate owned during 2015 as a result of our decision to aggressively pursue a potential sale of this asset.\nIn addition, minor increases in data processing, other operating expenses, regulatory assessments, insurance, other taxes, and advertising for the twelve months of 2015 versus the same period last year were offset by minor decreases in legal expenses and professional fees.\nOne key measure that management utilizes to monitor progress in controlling overhead expenses is the ratio of annualized net noninterest expenses to average assets. For purposes of this calculation, net noninterest expenses equal noninterest expenses less noninterest income and nonrecurring expense. For the twelve month period ended December 31, 2015, the ratio equaled 2.83% compared to 3.05% for the twelve month period ended December 31, 2014, respectively, reflecting higher average assets related to the Company's growth strategy.\nAnother productivity measure utilized by management is the operating efficiency ratio. This ratio expresses the relationship of noninterest expenses to net interest income plus noninterest income. The efficiency ratio equaled 94.2% for the twelve months of 2015, compared to 92.5% for the twelve months of 2014. The increase for the twelve months ended December 31, 2015 versus December 31, 2014 was due to an increase in total noninterest expenses.\nProvision (Benefit) for Income Taxes\nWe recorded a benefit for income taxes of $26,000 for the twelve months ended December 31, 2015, compared to a $46,000 benefit for the twelve months ended December 31, 2014. The $26,000 benefit recorded during the twelve months of 2015 was the net result of an estimated tax provision in the amount of $911,000 calculated on the net profit generated during the period using our normal estimated tax rate, offset by an adjustment to the deferred tax asset valuation allowance in the amount of $937,000. The effective tax rates for the twelve month periods ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 were 38% and 26%, respectively, excluding an adjustment to the deferred tax asset valuation allowance.\nWe evaluate the carrying amount of its deferred tax assets on a quarterly basis or more frequently, if necessary, in accordance with the guidance provided in Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Accounting Standards Codification Topic 740 (ASC 740), in particular, applying the criteria set forth therein to determine whether it is more likely than not (i.e. a likelihood of more than 50%) that some portion, or all, of the deferred tax asset will not be realized within its life cycle, based on the weight of available evidence. If management makes a determination based on the available evidence that it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized in future periods, a valuation allowance is calculated and recorded. These determinations are inherently subjective and dependent upon estimates and judgments concerning management's evaluation of both positive and negative evidence.\nIn conducting the deferred tax asset analysis, we believe it is important to consider the unique characteristics of an industry or business. In particular, characteristics such as business model, level of capital and reserves held by financial institutions and their ability to absorb potential losses are important distinctions to be considered for bank holding companies like the Company. In addition, it is also important to consider that net operating loss carryforwards (\"NOLs\") for federal income tax purposes can generally be carried back two years and carried forward for a period of twenty years. In order to realize our deferred tax assets, we must generate sufficient taxable income in such future years.\nIn assessing the need for a valuation allowance, we carefully weighed both positive and negative evidence currently available. Judgment is required when considering the relative impact of such evidence. The weight given to the potential effect of positive and negative evidence must be commensurate with the extent to which it can be objectively verified. A cumulative loss in recent years is a significant piece of negative evidence that is difficult to overcome.\nWhen calculating an estimate for a valuation allowance, we assessed the possible sources of taxable income available under tax law to realize a tax benefit for deductible temporary differences and carry forwards as defined in ASC 740. The Company did not use projections of future taxable income, exclusive of reversing temporary timing differences and carryforwards, as a factor in the analysis. The Company will exclude future taxable income as a factor until we can show consistent and sustainable profitability. Based on the analysis of available positive and negative evidence, we determined that a valuation allowance should be recorded as of December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014.\nThe Company did assess tax planning strategies as defined under ASC 740 to determine the amount of a valuation allowance. Strategies reviewed included the sale of investment securities and loans with fair values greater than book values, redeployment of cash and cash equivalents into higher yielding investment options, a switch from tax-exempt to taxable investments and loans, and the election of a decelerated depreciation method for tax purposes on future fixed asset purchases. We believe that these tax planning strategies are (a) prudent and feasible, (b) steps that we would not ordinarily take, but would take to prevent an operating loss or tax credit carryforward from expiring unused, and (c) would result in the realization of existing deferred tax assets. These tax planning strategies, if implemented, would result in taxable income in the first full reporting period after deployment and accelerate the recovery of deferred tax asset balances if faced with the inability to recover those assets or the risk of potential expiration. We believe that these are viable tax planning strategies and appropriately considered in the analysis at this time, but may not align with the strategic direction of the organization today and therefore, has no present intention to implement such strategies.\nThe net deferred tax asset balance before consideration of a valuation allowance was $20.2 million as of December 31, 2015 and $19.6 million as of December 31, 2014. After assessment of all available tax planning strategies, we determined that a partial valuation allowance in the amount of $13.7 million as of December 31, 2015 and $14.7 million as of December 31, 2014 should be recorded.\nThe deferred tax asset will continue to be analyzed on a quarterly basis for changes affecting realizability. When the determination is made to include projections of future taxable income as a factor in recovering the deferred tax asset, the valuation allowance will be reduced accordingly resulting in a corresponding increase in net income.\nNet Income and Net Income per Common Share\nNet income for the twelve month periods ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 was $2.4 million. For the twelve month period ended December 31, 2015, basic and fully-diluted net income per common share was $0.06 compared to basic and fully-diluted net income per common share of $0.07 for the twelve month period ended December 31, 2014.\nReturn on Average Assets and Average Equity\nReturn on average assets (ROA) measures our net income in relation to our total average assets. The ROA for the twelve month periods ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 was 0.19% and 0.23%, respectively. Return on average equity (ROE) indicates how effectively we can generate net income on the capital invested by our stockholders. ROE is calculated by dividing annualized net income by average stockholders' equity. The ROE for the twelve month period ended December 31, 2015 was 2.14%, compared to 2.51% for the twelve month period ended December 31, 2014.\nResults of Operations\nFor the year ended December 31, 2014 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2013\nWe reported net income of $2.4 million, or $0.07 per share, for the twelve months ended December 31, 2014 compared to a net loss of $3.5 million, or $(0.13) per share, for the twelve months ended December 31, 2013. Prior year net income was impacted by a loan loss provision in the amount of $3.6 million on a single loan and a one-time charge of $1.9 million related to a legal settlement.\nNet interest income for the twelve months ended December 31, 2014 increased $3.2 million to $35.8 million as compared to $32.6 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2013. Interest income increased $3.3 million, or 8.8%, due primarily to an increase in average loan balances. Interest expense increased $54,000 or 1.2%, primarily due to an increase in average deposit balances.\nWe recorded a loan loss provision in the amount of $900,000 for the twelve months ended December 31, 2014 compared to a provision of $4.9 million during the twelve months ended December 31, 2013. The lower provision recorded for the twelve months ended December 31, 2014 was driven by a loan loss provision in the amount of $3.6 million on one loan recorded in 2013 which did not recur in 2014.\nNon-interest income decreased $1.2 million to $8.0 million during the twelve months ended December 31, 2014 as compared to $9.2 million during the twelve months ended December 31, 2013 primarily due to a decrease of $621,000 in gains recognized on the sale of SBA loans during the twelve months ended December 31, 2014 as a result of fewer SBA loan originations during the current period. In addition, there was a decrease of $245,000 in gains on the sale of investment securities and a decrease of $238,000 in legal settlements compared to December 31, 2013.\nNon-interest expenses increased $139,000 to $40.6 million during the twelve months ended December 31, 2014 as compared to $40.4 million during the twelve months ended December 31, 2013. The increase during the twelve months ended December 31, 2014 was primarily due to an increase in salaries and benefits of $3.0 million driven primarily by annual merit increases along with increased staffing levels related to the Company's growth strategy of adding and relocating stores. Occupancy related expenses also increased by $889,000 as a result of the growth and relocation strategy. These increases were offset by a legal settlement of $1.9 million recorded in 2013, a decrease in other real estate owned expenses of $1.4 million, and a decrease of $588,000 in legal expenses.\nReturn on average assets and average equity from continuing operations were 0.23% and 2.51%, respectively, during the twelve months ended December 31, 2014 compared to (0.37)% and (5.07)%, respectively, for the twelve months ended December 31, 2013.\nNet Interest Income and Net Interest Margin\nNet interest income, on a fully tax-equivalent basis, for the twelve months of 2014 increased by $3.3 million, or 9.9%, over the same period in 2013. Interest income on interest-earning assets totaled $40.9 million for the twelve months of 2014, an increase of $3.3 million, compared to the same period in 2013. The increase in interest income earned was the result of an increase in the average balance of loans receivable and investment securities that helped to offset a 24 bp decrease in the yield on loans receivable. Total interest expense for the twelve months of 2014 increased $54,000, or 1.2%, from $4.6 million in 2013 to $4.6 million in 2014. Interest expense on deposits increased by $58,000, or 1.7%, for the twelve months of 2014 versus the same period of 2013. Interest expense on short-term borrowings decreased by $4,000 for the twelve months of 2014 compared to the same period in 2013.\nChanges in net interest income are frequently measured by two statistics: net interest rate spread and net interest margin. Net interest rate spread is the difference between the average rate earned on interest-earning assets and the average rate incurred on interest-bearing liabilities. Our net interest rate spread on a fully tax-equivalent basis was 3.41% during the twelve months of 2014 versus 3.54% during the twelve months of 2013. Net interest margin represents the difference between interest income, including net loan fees earned, and interest expense, reflected as a percentage of average interest-earning assets. For the twelve months of 2014 and 2013, the fully tax-equivalent net interest margin was 3.56% and 3.66%, respectively. The net interest margin for the year ending December 31, 2014 decreased primarily as a result of a decrease in the yield on loans receivable.\nProvision for Loan Losses\nWe recorded a provision for loan losses in the amount of $900,000 for the twelve months ended December 31, 2014 compared to a $4.9 million provision for the twelve months ended December 31, 2013. The provision for loan losses is charged to operations in an amount necessary to bring the total allowance for loan losses to a level that management believes is adequate to absorb inherent losses in the loan portfolio.\nThe higher provision recorded during 2013 was primarily driven by a single loan relationship which was originated in 2006 and determined to be impaired during the fourth quarter of 2013 due to delinquency in payments. The need for a provision in the amount of $3.6 million was the result of a significant reduction in the collateral value supporting the loan based upon a current appraisal.\nIn addition, the provision recorded for the twelve months ended December 31, 2014 as compared to the twelve months ended December 31, 2013 decreased due to a reduction in the allowance for loan losses related to non-impaired loans evaluated collectively for impairment. The decrease associated with loans collectively evaluated for impairment was driven by a reduction in the factor used in the calculation related to historical charge-offs which has declined as a result of lower charge-offs in recent years.\nNon-Interest Income\nTotal noninterest income for the first twelve months of 2014 decreased by $1.2 million, or 13.0%, from the same period in 2013. Gains recognized on the sale of SBA loans were $4.7 million during the twelve months of 2014 compared to $5.3 million in the same period of 2013. In addition, we also recognized gains of $458,000 on the sale of investment securities during 2014 compared to gains of $703,000 on the sale of investment securities in 2013. We recorded no legal settlements during the twelve month period ended December 31, 2014 compared to $238,000 in the twelve month period ended December 31, 2013.\nNon-Interest Expenses\nIn 2014, noninterest expenses increased by $139,000, or 0.3%, compared to 2013. A explanation of changes in noninterest expenses for certain categories is presented in the following paragraphs.\nSalary expenses and employee benefits in 2014 were $20.1 million, an increase of $3.0 million, or 17.7%, compared to 2013 primarily driven by annual merit increases along with increased staffing levels related to our growth strategy of adding and relocating stores.\nOccupancy related expenses increased by $889,000, or 15.5%, in 2014 compared to 2013, also as a result of the growth and relocation strategy.\nOther real estate owned expenses totaled $1.8 million during 2014, a decrease of $1.4 million, or 43.6%, when compared to 2013 primarily due to lower writedowns in 2014 on assets held in the other real estate owned category.\nAs previously mentioned, we settled a legal matter totaling $1.9 million in 2013. This one-time charge of $1.9 million in 2013 was related to litigation in which the Company was a defendant. In addition, we had a decrease of $588,000 in legal expenses. Other minor decreases in regulatory assessments, insurance, and other operating expenses were offset by increases in data processing, advertising, professional fees, and other taxes for the twelve months of 2014 versus the same period last year.\nOne key measure that management utilizes to monitor progress in controlling overhead expenses is the ratio of annualized net noninterest expenses to average assets. For purposes of this calculation, net noninterest expenses equal noninterest expenses less noninterest income and nonrecurring expense. For the twelve month period ended December 31, 2014, the ratio equaled 3.05% compared to 3.09% for the twelve month period ended December 31, 2013, respectively, reflecting higher average assets related to the Company's growth strategy of adding and relocating stores.\nAnother productivity measure utilized by management is the operating efficiency ratio. This ratio expresses the relationship of noninterest expenses to net interest income plus noninterest income. The efficiency ratio equaled 92.5% for the twelve months of 2014, compared to 96.6% for the twelve months of 2013. The decrease for the twelve months ended December 31, 2014 versus December 31, 2013 was due to a 4.8% increase in total revenues.\nProvision (Benefit) for Income Taxes\nWe recorded a benefit for income taxes of $46,000 for the twelve months ended December 31, 2014, compared to a $35,000 benefit for the twelve months ended December 31, 2013. The $46,000 benefit recorded during the twelve months of 2014 was the net result of an estimated tax provision in the amount of $633,000 calculated on the net profit generated during the period using our normal estimated tax rate, offset by an adjustment to the deferred tax asset valuation allowance in the amount of $679,000. The effective tax rates for the twelve month periods ended December 31, 2014 and 2013 were 26% and (42%), respectively, excluding an adjustment to the deferred tax asset valuation allowance.\nWe evaluate the carrying amount of its deferred tax assets on a quarterly basis or more frequently, if necessary, in accordance with the guidance provided in Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Accounting Standards Codification Topic 740 (ASC 740), in particular, applying the criteria set forth therein to determine whether it is more likely than not (i.e. a likelihood of more than 50%) that some portion, or all, of the deferred tax asset will not be realized within its life cycle, based on the weight of available evidence. If management makes a determination based on the available evidence that it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized in future periods, a valuation allowance is calculated and recorded. These determinations are inherently subjective and dependent upon estimates and judgments concerning management's evaluation of both positive and negative evidence.\nIn conducting the deferred tax asset analysis, we believe it is important to consider the unique characteristics of an industry or business. In particular, characteristics such as business model, level of capital and reserves held by financial institutions and their ability to absorb potential losses are important distinctions to be considered for bank holding companies like the Company. In addition, it is also important to consider that net operating loss carryforwards (\"NOLs\") for federal income tax purposes can generally be carried back two years and carried forward for a period of twenty years. In order to realize our deferred tax assets, we must generate sufficient taxable income in such future years.\nIn assessing the need for a valuation allowance, we carefully weighed both positive and negative evidence currently available. Judgment is required when considering the relative impact of such evidence. The weight given to the potential effect of positive and negative evidence must be commensurate with the extent to which it can be objectively verified. A cumulative loss in recent years is a significant piece of negative evidence that is difficult to overcome.\nWhen calculating an estimate for a valuation allowance, we assessed the possible sources of taxable income available under tax law to realize a tax benefit for deductible temporary differences and carry forwards as defined in ASC 740. As a result of cumulative losses in recent years and the slow, ongoing recovery in the current economic environment, we did not use projections of future taxable income as a factor. We will exclude future taxable income as a factor until we can show consistent and sustainable profitability. Based on the analysis of available positive and negative evidence, we determined that a valuation allowance should be recorded as of December 31, 2014 and December 31, 2013.\nWe did assess tax planning strategies as defined under ASC 740 to determine the amount of a valuation allowance. Strategies reviewed included the sale of investment securities and loans with fair values greater than book values, redeployment of cash and cash equivalents into higher yielding investment options, a switch from tax-exempt to taxable investments and loans, and the election of a decelerated depreciation method for tax purposes on future fixed asset purchases. We believe that these tax planning strategies are (a) prudent and feasible, (b) steps that we would not ordinarily take, but would take to prevent an operating loss or tax credit carryforward from expiring unused, and (c) would result in the realization of existing deferred tax assets. These tax planning strategies, if implemented, would result in taxable income in the first full reporting period after deployment and accelerate the recovery of deferred tax asset balances if faced with the inability to recover those assets or the risk of potential expiration. We believe that these are viable tax planning strategies and appropriately considered in the analysis at this time, but may not align with the strategic direction of the organization today and therefore, has no present intention to implement such strategies.\nThe net deferred tax asset balance before consideration of a valuation allowance was $19.6 million as of December 31, 2014 and $21.4 million as of December 31, 2013. After assessment of all available tax planning strategies, we determined that a partial valuation allowance in the amount of $14.7 million as of December 31, 2014 and $15.3 million as of December 31, 2013 should be recorded.\nThe deferred tax asset will continue to be analyzed on a quarterly basis for changes affecting realizability. When the determination is made to include projections of future taxable income as a factor in recovering the deferred tax asset, the valuation allowance will be reduced accordingly resulting in a corresponding increase in net income.\nNet Income and Net Income per Common Share\nNet income for the twelve month period ended December 31, 2014 was $2.4 million, an increase of $5.9 million, compared to a $3.5 million net loss recorded for the twelve month period ended December 31, 2013. The higher net income in 2014 was due to a $4.0 million decrease in the provision for loan losses, a $3.2 million increase in net interest income, partially offset by a $1.2 million decrease in noninterest income and a $139,000 increase in noninterest expenses.\nFor the twelve month period ended December 31, 2014, basic and fully-diluted net income per common share was $0.07 compared to basic and fully-diluted net loss per common share of $(0.13) for the twelve month period ended December 31, 2013.\nReturn on Average Assets and Average Equity\nReturn on average assets (ROA) measures our net income in relation to our total average assets. The ROA for the twelve month periods ended December 31, 2014 and 2013 was 0.23% and (0.37)%, respectively. Return on average equity (ROE) indicates how effectively we can generate net income on the capital invested by our stockholders. ROE is calculated by dividing annualized net income by average stockholders' equity. The ROE for the twelve month period ended December 31, 2014 was 2.51%, compared to (5.07)% for the twelve month period ended December 31, 2013.\nFinancial Condition\nDecember 31, 2015 compared to December 31, 2014\nTotal assets increased by $224.8 million to $1.4 billion at December 31, 2015, compared to $1.2 billion at December 31, 2014.\nCash and Cash Equivalents\nCash and due from banks and interest bearing deposits comprise this category, which consists of our most liquid assets. The aggregate amount in these two categories decreased by $101.7 million to $27.1 million at December 31, 2015, from $128.8 million at December 31, 2014. The decrease was primarily caused by an increase in investment securities purchases and outstanding loans receivable.\nLoans Held for Sale\nLoans held for sale are comprised of loans guaranteed by the U.S. Small Business Administration (\"SBA\") which we usually originate with the intention of selling in the future. Total SBA loans held for sale were $3.7 million at December 31, 2015 compared to $1.7 million at December 31, 2014. Loans held for sale, as a percentage of our total assets, were less than 1% at December 31, 2015.\nLoans Receivable\nThe loan portfolio represents our largest asset category and is our most significant source of interest income. Our lending strategy is focused on small and medium sized businesses and professionals that seek highly personalized banking services. The loan portfolio consists of secured and unsecured commercial loans including commercial real estate, construction loans, residential mortgages, home improvement loans, home equity loans and lines of credit, overdraft lines of credit, and others. Commercial loans typically range between $250,000 and $5,000,000 but customers may borrow significantly larger amounts up to our legal lending limit to a customer, which was approximately $20.6 million at December 31, 2015. Loans made to one individual customer, even if secured by different collateral, are aggregated for purposes of the lending limit. There were no loans in excess of the legal lending limit at December 31, 2015. A $13.7 million threshold, which amounts to approximately 10% of total regulatory capital, reflects an additional internal monitoring guideline. There were no such relationships in excess of $13.7 million at December 31, 2015.\nLoans increased $92.8 million, or 12%, to $874.8 million at December 31, 2015, versus $781.9 million at December 31, 2014. This growth was the result of an increase in loan demand in the owner occupied real estate, commercial and industrial, construction and development, and consumer categories driven by the successful execution of our relationship banking strategy which focuses on customer service.\nInvestment Securities\nInvestment securities considered available-for-sale are investments that may be sold in response to changing market and interest rate conditions, and for liquidity and other purposes. Our investment securities classified as available-for-sale consist primarily of U.S. Government agency collateralized mortgage obligations (CMO), agency mortgage-backed securities (MBS), municipal securities, corporate bonds, asset-backed securities (ABS), and pooled trust preferred securities (CDO). Available-for-sale securities totaled $284.8 million at December 31, 2015, compared to $185.4 million at December 31, 2014. The increase was primarily due to the purchase of available-for-sale securities totaling $146.7 million partially offset by sales and pay downs of securities totaling $42.9 million during 2015. At December 31, 2015, the portfolio had a net unrealized loss of $4.0 million compared to a net unrealized gain of $129,000 at December 31, 2014. The change in value of the investment portfolio was driven by an increase in market interest rates which drove a decrease in value of the bonds held in our portfolio during 2015.\nInvestment securities held-to-maturity are investments for which there is the intent and ability to hold the investment to maturity. These investments are carried at amortized cost. The held-to-maturity portfolio consists primarily of U.S. Government agency Small Business Investment Company bonds (SBIC), CMO's and MBS's. The fair value of securities held-to-maturity totaled $171.8 million and $68.3 million at December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014, respectively. The increase was due to the purchase of $121.4 million of held-to-maturity securities partially offset by pay downs of securities totaling $16.7 million during 2015.\nRestricted Stock\nRestricted stock, which represents a required investment in the capital stock of correspondent banks related to available credit facilities, is carried at cost as of December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014. As of those dates, restricted stock consisted of investments in the capital stock of the Federal Home Loan Bank of Pittsburgh (\"FHLB\") and Atlantic Community Bankers Bank (\"ACBB\").\nAt December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014, the investment in FHLB stock totaled $2.9 million and $1.0 million, respectively. The increase was due to a short-term borrowing from FHLB. At both December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014, ACBB stock totaled $143,000.\nOther Real Estate Owned\nThe balance of other real estate owned increased to $11.3 million at December 31, 2015 from $3.7 million at December 31, 2014, primarily due to transfers from loan receivable totaling $11.5 million, partially offset by writedowns in the amount of $3.1 million on existing foreclosed properties and sales totaling $792,000 during 2015. The increase in other real estate owned was primarily driven by a single asset in the amount of $7.7 million that transferred from loans receivable during 2015. A write-down of $2.2 million was recorded in the fourth quarter of 2015 as a result of our decision to aggressively market and pursue a sale of the largest non-performing asset on the balance sheet at year end.\nDeposits\nDeposits, which include non-interest and interest-bearing demand deposits, money market, savings and time deposits, are Republic's major source of funding. Deposits are generally solicited from the Company's market area through the offering of a variety of products to attract and retain customers, with a primary focus on multi-product relationships.\nTotal deposits increased by $177.1 million to $1.2 billion at December 31, 2014, from $1.1 billion at December 31, 2014. The increase was primarily the result of a $117.2 million increase in demand deposits and a $67.7 million increase in money market and savings deposits, which reflects the success of our retail-focused strategy of gathering low-cost core deposits. We will continue to focus our efforts on the growth of deposit balances through the successful execution of our relationship banking model which is based upon a high level of customer service and satisfaction. We are also in the midst of an aggressive expansion and relocation plan which we refer to as \"The Power of Red is Back.\" Over the last two years we have opened five new store locations and have several more in various stages of construction and development. This strategy has also allowed us to nearly eliminate our dependence upon the more volatile sources of funding found in brokered and public fund certificates of deposit.\nShort-term Borrowings\nAs of December 31, 2015, there were $47.0 million in short-term borrowings from FHLB compared to $0 at December 31, 2014. The increase in borrowings was the result of a temporary outflow of deposits at year end which returned in the early part of 2016.\nShareholders' Equity\nTotal shareholders' equity increased $564,000 to $113.4 million at December 31, 2015, compared to $112.8 million at December 31, 2014, primarily due to the recognition of net income of $2.4 million during 2015 and the issuance of stock based compensation in the amount of $600,000 offset by an increase in accumulated other comprehensive losses associated with unrealized losses in the investment securities portfolio resulting in a decrease of $2.5 million. The shift in market value of the securities portfolio resulted in accumulated other comprehensive losses of $3.2 million at December 31, 2015 compared to accumulated other comprehensive losses of $632,000 at December 31, 2014. This was primarily driven by an increase in market interest rates which drove a decrease in value of the bonds held in our portfolio during 2015.\nInvestment Securities Portfolio\nRepublic's investment securities portfolio is intended to provide liquidity and contribute to earnings while diversifying credit risk. We attempt to maximize earnings while minimizing our exposure to interest rate risk. The securities portfolio consists primarily of U.S. Government agency collateralized mortgage obligations (CMO), agency mortgage-backed securities (MBS), corporate bonds, municipal securities, asset-backed securities (ABS), pooled trust preferred securities (CDO), and U.S. Government agency Small Business Investment Company bonds (SBIC). Our ALCO committee monitors and reviews all security purchases.\nA summary of investment securities available-for-sale and investment securities held-to-maturity at December 31, 2015, 2014, and 2013 is as follows:\nTable 42: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>At December 31, </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (dollars in thousands)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Available for sale\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Collateralized mortgage obligations\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 180,795\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 98,626\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 127,242\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Agency mortgage-backed securities\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 10,073\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 13,271\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 15,669\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Municipal securities\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 22,814\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 15,784\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 9,737\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Corporate bonds\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 54,294\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 33,840\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 32,174\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Asset-backed securities\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 17,631\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 18,353\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 19,089\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Trust preferred securities\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 3,070\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 5,261\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 5,277\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other securities\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total amortized cost of securities\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 288,792\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 185,250\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 209,303\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total fair value of investment securities\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 284,795\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 185,379\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 204,891\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Held to maturity\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> U.S. Government agencies\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 17,067\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Collateralized mortgage obligations\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 146,458\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 67,845\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> -\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Agency mortgage-backed securities\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 7,732\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> -\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> -\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other securities\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 1,020\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total amortized cost of securities\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 172,277\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 67,866\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total fair value of investment securities\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 171,845\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 68,253\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe strong growth in deposit balances during 2015 and 2014 has resulted in a corresponding increase in interest earning assets. The total amortized cost of the investment securities portfolio has grown to $461.1 million at December 31, 2015 compared to $253.1 million at December 31, 2014 and $209.3 million at December 31, 2013. Investment securities represented 32% of total assets at December 31, 2015 and 21% of total assets at December 31, 2014. We evaluate our investment securities portfolio on a continual basis in light of the interest rate environment and changing market conditions and when appropriate, take necessary actions to improve and enhance our overall positioning. We consider the portfolio to be well structured and of high quality. At December 31, 2015, 83% of the portfolio consisted of U.S. government agency securities which were rated Aaa/AA by the major credit rating agencies.\nThe investment securities portfolio includes securities classified as both available for sale and held to maturity. During 2015 and 2014 we began to designate a portion of our securities portfolio as held to maturity based our intent and ability to hold those securities until they mature.\nThe fair value of investment securities is impacted by interest rates, credit spreads, market volatility and liquidity conditions. The fair value of investment securities generally decreases when interest rates rise and increases when interest rates fall. In addition, the fair value generally decreases when credit spreads widen and increases when credit spreads tighten. Net unrealized losses in the total investment securities portfolio increased to $4.4 million at December 31, 2015 compared to unrealized gains of $0.5 million at December 31, 2014. The comparable amounts for the securities classified as available for sale were unrealized losses of $4.0 million at December 31, 2015 and unrealized gains of $0.1 million at December 31, 2014.\nNo single issuer of securities (excluding government agencies) in the portfolio exceeded more than 10% of shareholders' equity at December 31, 2015 with the exception of corporate bonds issued by Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley. The Goldman Sachs bonds had a book value of $18.0 million and a market value of $17.9 million. The Morgan Stanley bonds had a book value of $15.0 million and a market value of $15.1 million at December 31, 2015. No single issuer of securities (excluding government agencies) in the portfolio exceeded more than 10% of shareholders' equity at December 31, 2014 with the exception of corporate bonds issued by Morgan Stanley. The Morgan Stanley bonds had a book value of $12.0 million and a market value of $12.2 million at December 31, 2014.\nAt December 31, 2015, the investment portfolio included thirty-eight municipal securities with a total market value of $23.3 million. These securities are reviewed quarterly for impairment. Research on each issuer is completed to assess the financial stability of the municipal entity. The largest geographic concentration was in Pennsylvania and New Jersey where thirty-one municipal securities had a market value of $18.8 million. As of December 31, 2015, management found no evidence of other than temporary impairment (\"OTTI\") on any of the municipal securities held in the investment securities portfolio.\nAt December 31, 2015, the portfolio included two asset-backed securities with a total market value of $17.0 million, the majority of which (97%) is guaranteed by the U.S. Dept. of Education, which were in an unrealized loss position. Management believes the unrealized losses on these securities were driven by market interest rates and not a result of any credit deterioration.\nAt December 31, 2015, the portfolio also included three pooled trust preferred securities (CDOs) with a market value of $1.9 million. The unrealized loss for the CDOs was due to the secondary market for such securities becoming inactive and is considered temporary.\nDuring 2015, the Company sold four CDO securities. Proceeds from the sale of the CDO securities totaled $2.0 million. Gross gains of $70,000 and gross losses of $288,000 were realized on these sales. The tax provision applicable to the net losses for the twelve months ended December 31, 2015 amounted to $78,000. Management had previously stated that it did not intend to sell the CDO securities prior to their maturity or the recovery of their cost bases, nor would it be forced to sell these securities prior to maturity or recovery of the cost bases. This statement was made over a period of several years where there was limited trading activity in the pooled trust preferred CDO market resulting in fair market value estimates well below the book values. During 2015, management received several inquiries regarding the availability of the CDO securities and noted an increased level of trading in this type of security. As a result of the increased activity and the level of bids received, management elected to sell the four CDOs resulting in a net loss of $218,000 during 2015 which was offset by gains on sales of agency mortgage- backed securities and corporate bonds. The Bank continues to demonstrate the ability and intent to hold the remaining CDOs until maturity or recovery of the cost bases, but will evaluate future opportunities to sell the remaining CDOs if they arise.\nDuring 2015, the Company also sold twenty-nine agency mortgage-backed securities and two corporate bonds. Proceeds of sales totaled $9.7 million. Gross gains of $326,000 were realized on these sales. The tax provision applicable to the gross gains amounted to $117,000.\nThe following table presents the maturity distribution and weighted average yield by holding type and year of maturity of our investment securities portfolio at December 31, 2015. Collateralized mortgage obligations and agency mortgage-backed securities have expected maturities that differ from contractual maturities because borrowers have the right to call or prepay and, therefore, these securities are classified separately with no specific maturity date.\nTable 43: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> December 31, 2015\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td>

financial instruments; however, there are inherent weaknesses in any estimation technique. Therefore, for substantially all financial instruments, the fair value estimates herein are not necessarily indicative of the amounts the Company could have realized in a sale transaction on the dates indicated. The estimated fair value amounts have been measured as of their respective year-ends and have not been re-evaluated or updated for purposes of these financial statements subsequent to those respective dates. As such, the estimated fair values of these financial instruments subsequent to the respective reporting dates may be different than the amounts reported at each year-end.\nThe Company follows the guidance issued under ASC 820, Fair Value Measurement, which defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value under GAAP, and identifies required disclosures on fair value measurements.\nASC 820 establishes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to valuation methods used to measure fair value. The hierarchy gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1 measurements) and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs (Level 3 measurements). The three levels of the fair value hierarchy under ASC 820 are as follows:\nLevel 1: Unadjusted quoted prices in active markets that are accessible at the measurement date for identical, unrestricted assets or liabilities.\nLevel 2: Quoted prices in markets that are not active, or inputs that are observable either directly or indirectly, for substantially the full term of the asset or liability.\nLevel 3: Prices or valuation techniques that require inputs that are both significant to the fair value measurement and unobservable (i.e., supported with little or no market activity).\nAn asset's or liability's level within the fair value hierarchy is based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement.\nThe fair value of securities available for sale (carried at fair value) and held to maturity (carried at amortized cost) are determined by obtaining quoted market prices on nationally recognized securities exchanges (Level 1), or matrix pricing (Level 2), which is a mathematical technique used widely in the industry to value debt securities without relying exclusively on quoted market prices for the specific securities but rather by relying on the securities' relationship to other benchmark quoted prices. For certain securities, which are not traded in active markets or are subject to transfer restrictions, valuations are adjusted to reflect illiquidity and/or non-transferability, and such adjustments are generally based on available market evidence (Level 3). In the absence of such evidence, management's best estimate is used. Management's best estimate consists of both internal and external support on certain Level 3 investments. Internal cash flow models using a present value formula that includes assumptions market participants would use along with indicative exit pricing obtained from broker/dealers (where available) were used to support fair values of certain Level 3 investments.\nThe types of instruments valued on matrix pricing in active markets include all of the U.S. government and agency securities, municipal obligations and corporate bonds. Such instruments are generally classified within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy. As required by ASC 820, we do not adjust the matrix pricing for such instruments.\nLevel 3 is for positions that are not traded in active markets or are subject to transfer restrictions, and may be adjusted to reflect illiquidity and/or non-transferability, with such adjustment generally based on available market evidence. In the absence of such evidence, management's best estimate is used. Subsequent to inception, management only changes Level 3 inputs and assumptions when corroborated by evidence such as transactions in similar instruments, completed or pending third-party transactions in the underlying investment or comparable entities, subsequent rounds of financing, recapitalizations and other transactions across the capital structure, offerings in the equity or debt markets, and changes in financial ratios or cash flows. The Level 3 investment securities currently held in the Company's portfolio are classified as available for sale and consist of various issues of trust preferred securities and a single corporate bond.\nThe trust preferred securities are pools of similar securities that are grouped into an asset structure commonly referred to as collateralized debt obligations (\"CDOs\") which consist of the debt instruments of various banks, diversified by the number of participants in the security as well as geographically. These securities are performing according to terms, however the secondary market for such securities had become inactive for several years, and were therefore classified as Level 3 securities. The fair value analysis does not reflect or represent the actual terms or prices at which any party could purchase the securities.\nThe following table presents a reconciliation of the securities available for sale measured at fair value on a recurring basis using significant unobservable inputs (Level 3) for the year ended December 31, 2015, 2014, and 2013:\nTable 44: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Year Ended\nDecember 31, 2015\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Year Ended\nDecember 31, 2014\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Year Ended\nDecember 31, 2013\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Level 3 Investments Only\n(dollars in thousands)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> Trust\nPreferred Securities\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Corporate\nBonds\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Trust\nPreferred Securities\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Corporate\nBonds\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Trust\nPreferred Securities\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Corporate\nBonds\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Balance, January 1,\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 3,193\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 3,005\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 2,850\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 3,006\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 3,187\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 3,007\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Security transferred to Level 3 measurement\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> -\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> -\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> -\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> -\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> -\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> -\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Unrealized gains (losses)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (171\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (1\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (1\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Paydowns\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (19\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> -\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (10\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> -\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (508\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> -\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Proceeds from sales\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (1,952\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> -\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> -\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> -\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> -\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> -\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Realized losses\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (218\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> -\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> -\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> -\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> -\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> -\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Impairment charges on Level 3\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (3\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> -\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (7\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> -\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> -\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> -\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Balance, December 31,\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,883\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 2,834\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 3,193\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 3,005\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 2,850\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 3,006\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nAn independent, third party pricing service is used to estimate the current fair market value of each CDO held in the investment securities portfolio. The calculations used to determine fair value are based on the attributes of the trust preferred securities, the financial condition of the issuers of the trust preferred securities, and market based assumptions. The INTEX CDO Deal Model Library was utilized to obtain information regarding the attributes of each security and its specific collateral as of December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014. Financial information on the issuers was also obtained from Bloomberg, the FDIC and SNL Financial. Both published and unpublished industry sources were utilized in estimating fair value. Such information includes loan prepayment speed assumptions, discount rates, default rates, and loss severity percentages. A detailed explanation of the assumptions used to estimate the fair market value of the CDOs can be found in Note 14 \"Fair Value Measurements and Fair Values of Financial Investments\" to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nThe fair market valuation for each CDO was determined based on discounted cash flow analyses. The cash flows are primarily dependent on the estimated speeds at which the trust preferred securities are expected to prepay, the estimated rates at which the trust preferred securities are expected to defer payments, the estimated rates at which the trust preferred securities are expected to default, and the severity of the losses on securities that do default.\nIncreases (decreases) in actual or expected issuer defaults tend to decrease (increase) the fair value of the Company's senior and mezzanine tranches of CDOs. The values of the Company's mezzanine tranches of CDOs are also affected by expected future interest rates. However, due to the structure of each security, timing of cash flows, and secondary effects on the financial performance of the underlying issuers, the effects of changes in future interest rates on the fair value of the Company's holdings are not quantifiably estimable.\nAlso included in Level 3 investment securities classified as available for sale is one corporate bond transferred from Level 2 in 2010 since the bond is not actively traded. Impairment would depend on the repayment ability of the underlying issuer, which is assessed through a detailed quarterly review of the issuer's financial statements. The issuer is a \"well capitalized\" financial institution as defined by federal banking regulations and has demonstrated the ability to raise additional capital, when necessary, through the public capital markets. The fair value of this corporate bond is estimated by obtaining a price of a comparable floating rate debt instrument through Bloomberg.\nLoan Portfolio\nOur loan portfolio consists of secured and unsecured commercial loans including commercial real estate loans, construction and land development loans, commercial and industrial loans, owner occupied real estate loans, consumer and other loans, and residential mortgages. Commercial loans are primarily secured term loans made to small to medium-sized businesses and professionals for working capital, asset acquisition and other purposes. Commercial loans are originated as either fixed or variable rate loans with typical terms of 1 to 5 years. Republic's commercial loans typically range between $250,000 and $5.0 million, but customers may borrow significantly larger amounts up to Republic's legal lending limit of approximately $20.6 million at December 31, 2015. Management has established an internal monitoring guideline for loan relationships in the amount of $13.7 million which approximates 10% of capital and reserves. Individual customers may have several loans often secured by different collateral. There were no such relationships in excess of the legal lending limit or the internal monitoring guideline of $13.7 million at December 31, 2015.\nThe majority of loans outstanding are with borrowers in our marketplace, Philadelphia and surrounding suburbs, including southern New Jersey. In addition, we have loans to customers whose assets and businesses are concentrated in real estate. Repayment of our loans is in part dependent upon general economic conditions affecting our market place and specific industries. We evaluate each customer's credit worthiness on a case-by-case basis. The amount of collateral obtained is based on management's credit evaluation of the customer. Collateral varies but primarily includes residential, commercial and income-producing properties.\nAt December 31, 2015, we had loan concentrations exceeding 10% of total loans for credits extended to lessors of nonresidential real estate in the aggregate amount of $206.3 million, which represented 23.6% of gross loans receivable and lessors of residential real estate in the aggregate amount of $120.0 million, which represented 13.7% of gross loans receivable. Loan concentrations are considered to exist when amounts are loaned to multiple numbers of borrowers engaged in similar activities that management believes would cause them to be similarly impacted by economic or other conditions. At December 31, 2015, we had no foreign loans outstanding.\nThe following table sets forth gross loans by major categories for the periods indicated:\nTable 45: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> At December 31,\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (dollars in thousands)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Commercial real estate\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 349,726\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 379,259\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 342,794\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 335,561\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 344,377\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Construction and land development\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 46,547\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 29,861\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 23,977\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 26,659\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 35,061\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Commercial and industrial\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 181,850\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 145,113\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 118,209\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 103,768\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 87,668\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Owner occupied real estate\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 246,398\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 188,025\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 160,229\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 126,242\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 102,777\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Consumer and other\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 48,126\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 39,713\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 31,981\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 23,449\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 16,683\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Residential mortgage\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 2,380\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 2,359\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 2,442\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 3,150\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total loans\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 875,027\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 782,379\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 679,549\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 618,121\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 589,716\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Deferred loan fees\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total loans, net of deferred loan fees\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 874,769\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 781,940\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 679,311\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 617,901\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 589,492\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTotal loans, net of deferred loan fees, increased $92.8 million, or 12%, to $874.8 million at December 31, 2015, versus $781.9 million at December 31, 2014. This growth was the result of an increase in loan demand in the owner occupied real estate, commercial and industrial, construction and development, and consumer categories driven by the successful execution of our relationship banking strategy which focuses on customer service. Our largest loan category, commercial real estate, decreased by $29.5 million from $379.3 million at December 31, 2014 to $349.7 million at December 31, 2015. Net transfers to other loan categories as a result of periodic quality control reviews amounted to $14.6 million in 2015. In addition, a total of $10.1 million was transferred to other real estate owned in 2015.\nLoan Maturity and Interest Rate Sensitivity\nThe amount of loans outstanding by category as of the dates indicated, which are due in: (i) one year or less, (ii) more than one year through five years, and (iii) over five years, is shown in the following table.

course of business, loans maturing within one year may be renewed, in whole or in part, as to principal amount, and at interest rates prevailing at the date of renewal. At December 31, 2015, 71.9% of total loans were fixed rate compared to 68.0% at December 31, 2014.\nCredit Quality\nRepublic's written lending policies require specific underwriting, loan documentation and credit analysis standards to be met prior to funding, with independent credit department approval for the majority of new loan balances. A committee consisting of senior management and certain members of the Board of Directors oversees the loan approval process to monitor that proper standards are maintained, while approving the majority of commercial loans.\nLoans, including impaired loans, are generally classified as non-accrual if they are past due as to maturity or payment of interest or principal for a period of more than 90 days, unless such loans are well-secured and in the process of collection. Loans that are on a current payment status or past due less than 90 days may also be classified as non-accrual if repayment of principal and/or interest in full is in doubt. Loans may be returned to accrual status when all principal and interest amounts contractually due are reasonably assured of repayment within an acceptable period of time, and there is a sustained period of repayment performance by the borrower, in accordance with the contractual terms.\nWhile a loan is classified as non-accrual, any collections of interest and principal are generally applied as a reduction to principal outstanding. When the future collectability of the recorded loan balance is expected, interest income may be recognized on a cash basis. For non-accrual loans, which have been partially charged off, recognition of interest on a cash basis is limited to that which would have been recognized on the recorded loan balance at the contractual interest rate. Cash interest receipts in excess of that amount are recorded as recoveries to the allowance for loan losses until prior charge-offs have been fully recovered.\nThe following summary shows information

At December 31, 2015, all identified problem loans included in the preceding table are internally classified and have been evaluated for a specific reserve allocation in the allowance for loan losses (see discussion on \"Allowance for Loan Losses\").\nNon-performing assets decreased by $1.2 million, or 5%, to $23.9 million at December 31, 2015, compared to $25.2 million at December 31, 2014. This decrease was primarily due to a combination of loan paydowns, OREO sales, loan charge-offs, and OREO writedowns totaling $9.4 million which were offset by transfers of $8.2 million from performing to non-performing assets during 2015.\nThe following summary shows the impact on interest income of non-accrual loans, subsequent to being placed on non-accrual for the periods indicated:\nTable 48: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> For the Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Interest income that would have been recorded had the loans been in accordance with their original terms\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 765,000\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 980,000\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 488,000\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 699,000\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 583,000\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nInterest income included in net income\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nAllowance for Loan Losses\nThe allowance for loan losses is a valuation allowance for probable losses inherent in the loan portfolio. The Company evaluates the need to establish an allowance against loan losses on a quarterly basis. When an increase in this allowance is necessary, a provision for loan losses is charged to earnings. The allowance for loan losses consists of three components. The first component is allocated to individually evaluated loans found to be impaired and is calculated in accordance with ASC 310 Receivables. The second component is allocated to all other loans that are not individually identified as impaired pursuant to ASC 310-10 (\"non-impaired loans\"). This component is calculated for all non-impaired loans on a collective basis in accordance with ASC 450 Contingencies. The third component is an unallocated allowance to account for a level of imprecision in management's estimation process.\nThe Company evaluates loans for impairment and potential charge-off on a quarterly basis. Management regularly monitors the condition of borrowers and assesses both internal and external factors in determining whether any loan relationships have deteriorated. Any loan rated as substandard or lower will have an individual collateral evaluation analysis prepared to determine if a deficiency exists. We first evaluate the primary repayment source. If the primary repayment source is determined to be insufficient and unlikely to repay the debt, we then look to the secondary repayment sources. Secondary sources are conservatively reviewed for liquidation values. Updated appraisals and financial data are obtained to substantiate current values. If the reviewed sources are deemed to be inadequate to cover the outstanding principal and any costs associated with the resolution of the troubled loan, an estimate of the deficient amount will be calculated and a specific allocation of loan loss reserve is recorded.\nFactors considered in the calculation of the allowance for non-impaired loans include several qualitative and quantitative factors such as historical loss experience, trends in delinquency and nonperforming loan balances, changes in risk composition and underwriting standards, experience and ability of management, and general economic conditions along with other external factors. Historical loss experience is analyzed by reviewing charge-offs over a three year period to determine loss rates consistent with the loan categories depicted in the allowance for loan loss table below.\nThe factors supporting the allowance for loan losses do not diminish the fact that the entire allowance for loan losses is available to absorb losses in the loan portfolio and related commitment portfolio, respectively. The Company's principal focus, therefore, is on the adequacy of the total allowance for loan losses. The allowance for loan losses is subject to review by banking regulators. The Company's primary bank regulators regularly conduct examinations of the allowance for loan losses and make assessments regarding the adequacy and the methodology employed in their

allowance for loan losses to a level that management believes is adequate to absorb inherent losses in the loan portfolio. The Company recorded a loan loss provision in the amount of $500,000 in 2015 compared to a $900,000 provision in 2014. Non-performing loans decreased by $8.8 million, or 41%, to $12.6 million at December 31, 2015, compared to $21.4 million at December 31, 2014. Impaired loans also decreased to $22.1 million at December 31, 2015 from $35.6 million at December 31, 2014. An increase in the allowance required for loans collectively evaluated for impairment driven by growth in the loan portfolio was offset by a reduction associated with an improvement in the factor used for historical loss experience during 2015.\nThe allowance for loan losses as a percentage of non-performing loans (coverage ratio) was 69.0% at December 31, 2015 as compared to 53.8% at December 31, 2014 and 117.7% at December 31, 2013. The decrease in the coverage ratio at December 31, 2015 when compared to December 31, 2014 was primarily the result of a decrease in non-performing loans during 2015. This decrease was primarily driven by our largest non-performing loan that transferred to OREO in the second quarter 2015. A reserve for this loan was recorded during the fourth quarter of 2013 when it was initially downgraded. Coverage is considered adequate by management as of December 31, 2015.\nManagement makes at least a quarterly determination as to an appropriate provision from earnings to maintain an allowance for loan losses that it determines is adequate to absorb inherent losses in the loan portfolio. The Board of Directors periodically reviews the status of all non-accrual and impaired loans and loans classified by the management team. The Board of Directors also considers specific loans, pools of similar loans, historical charge-off activity, economic conditions and other relevant factors in reviewing the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses. Any additions deemed necessary to the allowance for loan losses are charged to operating expenses.\nThe Company evaluates loans for impairment and potential charge-offs on a quarterly basis. Any loan rated as substandard or lower will have a collateral evaluation analysis completed in accordance with the guidance under generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) on impaired loans to determine if a deficiency exists. Our credit monitoring process assesses the ultimate collectability of an outstanding loan balance from all potential sources. When a loan is determined to be uncollectible it is charged-off against the allowance for loan losses. Unsecured commercial loans and all consumer loans are charged-off immediately upon reaching the 90-day delinquency mark unless they are well secured and in the process of collection. The timing on charge-offs of all other loan types is subjective and will be recognized when management determines that full repayment, either from the cash flow of the borrower, collateral sources, and/or guarantors, will not be sufficient and that repayment is unlikely. A full or partial charge-off is recognized equal to the amount of the estimated deficiency calculation.\nSerious delinquency is often the first indicator of a potential charge-off. Reductions in appraised collateral values and deteriorating financial condition of borrowers and guarantors are factors considered when evaluating potential charge-offs. The likelihood of possible recoveries or improvements in a borrower's financial condition is also assessed when considering a charge-off.\nPartial charge-offs of non-performing and impaired loans can significantly reduce the coverage ratio and other credit loss statistics due to the fact that the balance of the allowance for loan losses will be reduced while still carrying the remainder of a non-performing loan balance in the impaired loan category. The amount of non-performing loans for which there were partial charge-offs during the year amounted to $3.4 million at December 31, 2015 compared to $17.8 million at December 31, 2014. This decrease was primarily driven by our largest non-performing loan that transferred to OREO in the second quarter 2015.\nThe Company's charge-off policy is reviewed on an annual basis and updated as necessary. During the twelve months ended December 31, 2015, there have been no changes made to this policy.\nWe have an existing loan review program, which monitors the loan portfolio on an ongoing basis. A loan review officer who reviews both the loan portfolio and overall adequacy of the allowance for loan losses conducts this loan review on a quarterly basis and reports directly to the Board of Directors.\nEstimating the appropriate level of the allowance for loan losses at any given date is difficult, particularly in a continually changing economy. In management's opinion, the allowance for loan losses was appropriate at December 31, 2015. However, there can be no assurance that, if asset quality deteriorates in future periods, additions to the allowance for loan losses will not be required.\nManagement is unable to determine in which loan category future charge-offs and recoveries may occur. The following schedule sets forth the allocation of the allowance for loan losses among various categories. The allocation is based on management's evaluation of historical charge-off experience and adjusted for several qualitative factors. The entire allowance for loan losses is available to absorb loan losses in any loan category.\nThe allocation of the allowance for loan losses for the past five years is as follows:\nTable 50: <table>

</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe allowance for loan losses is an amount that represents management's estimate of known and inherent losses related to the loan portfolio and unfunded loan commitments. Because the allowance for loan losses is dependent, to a great extent, on the general economy and other conditions that may be beyond our control, the estimate of the allowance for loan losses could differ materially in the near term.\nThe allowance consists of specific, general and unallocated components. The specific component relates to impaired loans. For such loans, an allowance is established when the discounted cash flows, collateral value, or observable market price of the impaired loan is lower than the carrying value of that loan. The general component covers the remainder of the portfolio and is based on historical loss experience adjusted for several qualitative factors. An unallocated component is maintained to cover uncertainties that could affect management's estimate of probable losses. The unallocated component of the allowance reflects the margin of imprecision inherent in the underlying assumptions used in the methodologies for estimating specific and general losses in the portfolio. All identified losses are immediately charged off and therefore no portion of the allowance for loan losses is restricted to any individual loan or group of loans, and the entire allowance is available to absorb any and all loan losses.\nIn estimating the allowance for loan losses, management considers current economic conditions, past loss experience, diversification of the loan portfolio, delinquency statistics, results of internal loan reviews and regulatory examinations, borrowers' perceived financial and managerial strengths, the adequacy of underlying collateral, if collateral dependent, or present value of future cash flows, and other relevant and qualitative risk factors. These qualitative risk factors include:\nTable 51: <table> <tr> <td> 1.\n</td> <td> Lending policies and procedures, including underwriting standards and collection, charge-off and recovery practices.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 52: <table> <tr> <td> 2.\n</td> <td> National, regional and local economic and business conditions as well as the condition of various segments.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 53: <table> <tr> <td> 3.\n</td> <td> Nature and volume of the portfolio and terms of loans.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 54: <table> <tr> <td> 4.\n</td> <td> Experience, ability and depth of lending management and staff.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 55: <table> <tr> <td> 5.\n</td> <td> Volume and severity of past due, classified and nonaccrual loans as well as other loan modifications.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 56: <table> <tr> <td> 6.\n</td> <td> Quality of the Company's loan review system, and the degree of oversight by the Company's Board of Directors.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 57: <table> <tr> <td> 7.\n</td> <td> Existence and effect of any concentration of credit and changes in the level of such concentrations.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 58: <table> <tr> <td> 8.\n</td> <td> Effect of external factors, such as competition and legal and regulatory requirements.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nEach factor is assigned a value to reflect improving, stable or declining conditions based on management's best judgment using relevant information available at the time of the evaluation. Adjustments to the factors are supported through documentation of changes in conditions in a narrative accompanying the allowance for loan loss calculation.\nWe also provide specific reserves for impaired loans to the extent the estimated realizable value of the underlying collateral is less than the loan balance, when the collateral is the only source of repayment. Also, we estimate and recognize reserve allocations on loans classified as \"internally classified accruing loans\" based upon any factor that might impact loss estimates. Those factors include but are not limited to the impact of economic conditions on the borrower and management's potential alternative strategies for loan or collateral disposition. An unallocated allowance is established for losses that have not been identified through the formulaic and other specific components of the allowance as described above. Management has identified several factors that impact credit losses that are not considered in either the formula or the specific allowance segments. These factors consist of macro and micro economic conditions, industry and geographic loan concentrations, changes in the composition of the loan portfolio, changes in underwriting processes and trends in problem loan and loss recovery rates. The impact of the above is considered in light of management's conclusions as to the overall adequacy of underlying collateral and other factors.\nThe majority of our loan portfolio represents loans made for commercial purposes, while significant amounts of residential property may serve as collateral for such loans. We attempt to evaluate larger loans individually, on the basis of our loan review process, which scrutinizes loans on a selective basis and other available information. Even if all commercial purpose loans could be reviewed, information on potential problems might not be available. Our portfolio of loans made for purposes of financing residential mortgages and consumer loans are evaluated in groups. At December 31, 2015, loans made for commercial real estate, construction and land development, commercial and industrial, owner occupied real estate, consumer and other, and residential mortgage purposes, respectively, amounted to $349.7 million, $46.5 million, $181.9 million, $246.4 million, $48.1 million, and $2.4 million.\nA loan is considered impaired, in accordance with ASC 310, when based on current information and events, it is probable that the Company will be unable to collect all amounts due from the borrower in accordance with the contractual terms of the loan. Impaired loans include nonperforming commercial loans, but also include internally classified accruing loans. As of December 31, 2015, management identified a total of four troubled debt restructurings in the loan portfolio in the amount of $8.8 million. Three troubled debt restructurings in the amount of $9.6 million were identified as of December 31, 2014.\nThe following table presents the Company's impaired loans at December 31, 2015, 2014, and 2013:\nTable 59: <table> <tr> <td> (dollars in thousands)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>December 31, </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Impaired loans without a valuation allowance\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 15,497\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 16,742\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 10,790\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Impaired loans with a valuation allowance\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 6,632\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 18,902\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 21,743\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total impaired loans\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 22,129\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 35,644\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 32,533\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Valuation allowance related to impaired loans\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 2,238\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 5,130\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 5,610\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total nonaccrual loans\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 12,622\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 21,440\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 10,420\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total loans past-due ninety days or more and\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> still accruing\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> -\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> -\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> -\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe recorded investment in loans that are impaired in accordance with ASC 310 totaled $22.1 million, $35.6 million, and $32.5 million at December 31, 2015, 2014, and 2013, respectively. The amounts of related valuation allowances were $2.2 million, $5.1 million, and $5.6 million, respectively at those dates. For the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014, and 2013, the average recorded investment in impaired loans was approximately $29.5 million, $33.0 million, and $33.7 million, respectively. Republic earned $516,000, $614,000, and $1.2 million of interest income on impaired loans (internally classified accruing loans) in 2015, 2014, and 2013, respectively. There were no commitments to extend credit to any borrowers with impaired loans as of the end of the periods presented herein.\nTotal impaired loans decreased by $13.5 million, or 38%, during the year ended December 31, 2015. This decrease was primarily driven by our largest non-performing loan relationship that transferred to OREO in the second quarter 2015. The valuation allowance related to impaired loans decreased to $2.2 million at December 31, 2015 compared to $5.1 million at December 31, 2014. At December 31, 2015 and 2014, internally classified accruing loans totaled approximately $9.5 million and $14.2 million, respectively.\nThe following table presents the Company's 30 to 89 days past due loans at December 31, 2015, 2014, and 2013:\nTable 60: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>December 31, </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> 30 to 59 days past due\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 2,878\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,681\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 21,504\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> 60 to 89 days past due\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 9,315\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 14,062\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 6,987\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total loans 30 to 89 days past due\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 12,193\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 15,743\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 28,491\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe increase in loan balances 30 to 59 days past due was the result of delinquency in one lending relationship at December 31, 2015 in the amount of $1.1 million that moved from current status at December 31, 2014. The decrease in loan balances 60 to 89 days past due was the result of delinquency in one lending relationship at December 31, 2014 in the amount of $5.0 million that moved to non-accrual status in 2015. Management has engaged in active discussions with all delinquent relationships to address delinquencies and is confident that acceptable resolutions will be achieved in the near term.\nDeposits\nTotal deposits at December 31, 2015 were $1.2 billion, an increase of $177.1 million or 16.5% from total deposits of $1.1 billion at December 31, 2014. Total deposits by account type at December 31, 2015, 2014, and 2013 are as follows:\nTable 61: <table> <tr> <td> (dollars in thousands)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> At December 31,\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Demand deposits, non-interest bearing\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 243,695\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 224,245\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 157,806\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Demand deposits, interest bearing\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 381,499\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 283,768\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 230,221\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Money market & savings deposits\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 556,526\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 488,848\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 402,671\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Time deposits\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 67,578\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 75,369\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 78,836\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total deposits\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,249,298\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,072,230\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 869,534\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nIn general, Republic pays higher interest rates on time deposits compared to other deposit categories. Republic's various deposit liabilities may fluctuate from period-to-period, reflecting customer behavior and strategies to optimize net interest income. The increase in total deposits to $1.2 billion at December 31, 2015 from $1.1 billion at December 31, 2014 was primarily the result of a $117.2 million increase in demand deposits, a $67.7 million increase in money market and savings deposits, which reflects the success of our retail-focused strategy of gathering low-cost core deposits. This strategy has also allowed us to nearly eliminate our dependence on the more volatile source of funding in internet based certificates of deposit.\nThe average balances and weighted average rates of Republic's deposits for the last three years are as follows:\nTable 62: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> For the Years Ended December 31,\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n(dollars in thousands)\n</td> <td> Average\nBalance\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\nRate\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Average\nBalance\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\nRate\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Average\nBalance\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\nRate\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Demand deposits:\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Non-interest bearing\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 235,810\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 189,810\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 149,125\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Interest bearing\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 349,055\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 0.40\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 233,693\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 0.38\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 192,224\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 0.43\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Money market & savings deposits\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 508,846\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 0.43\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 439,484\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 0.44\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 417,652\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 0.43\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Time deposits\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 73,819\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 0.94\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 78,073\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 0.92\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 92,484\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 0.94\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total deposits\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,167,530\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 0.37\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 941,060\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 0.38\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 851,485\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 0.41\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe remaining maturity of certificates of deposit for $100,000 or more as of December 31, 2015 is as follows:\nTable 63: <table> <tr> <td>\n(dollars in thousands)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Maturity:\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> 3 months or less\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 12,005\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> 3 to 6 months\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 3,309\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> 6 to 12 months\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 10,675\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Over 12 months\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 8,722\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 34,711\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe following is a summary of the remaining maturity of time deposits, which includes certificates of deposits of $100,000 or more, as of December 31, 2015:\nTable 64: <table> <tr> <td>\n(dollars in thousands)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Maturity:\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 50,139\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 13,780\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 1,599\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 1,497\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Thereafter\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> -\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 67,578\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe are a party to financial instruments with off-balance-sheet risk in the normal course of business to meet the financing needs of our customers. These financial instruments include commitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit. These instruments involve to varying degrees, elements of credit and interest rate risk in excess of the amount recognized in the financial statements.\nCredit risk is defined as the possibility of sustaining a loss due to the failure of the other parties to a financial instrument to perform in accordance with the terms of the contract. The maximum exposure to credit loss under commitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit is represented by the contractual amount of these instruments. We use the same underwriting standards and policies in making credit commitments as we do for on-balance-sheet instruments.\nFinancial instruments whose contract amounts represent potential credit risk are commitments to extend credit of approximately $165.1 million and $138.4 million and standby letters of credit of approximately $5.2 million and $3.8 million at December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. Commitments often expire without being drawn upon. The $165.1 million of commitments to extend credit at December 31, 2015, substantially all were variable rate commitments.\nCommitments to extend credit are agreements to lend to a customer as long as there is no violation of any condition established in the contract. Commitments generally have fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses and many require the payment of a fee. Since many of the commitments are expected to expire without being drawn upon, the total commitment amounts do not necessarily represent future cash requirements. The Company evaluates each customer's creditworthiness on a case-by-case basis. The amount of collateral obtained upon extension of credit is based on management's credit evaluation of the customer. Collateral held varies but may include real estate, marketable securities, pledged deposits, equipment and accounts receivable.\nStandby letters of credit are conditional commitments issued that guarantee the performance of a customer to a third party. The credit risk and collateral policy involved in issuing letters of credit is essentially the same as that involved in extending loan commitments. The amount of collateral obtained is based on management's credit evaluation of the customer. Collateral held varies but may include real estate, marketable securities, pledged deposits, equipment and accounts receivable.\nContractual Obligations and Other Commitments\nThe following table sets forth contractual obligations and other commitments representing required and potential cash outflows as of December 31, 2015:\nTable 65: <table> <tr> <td>\n(dollars in thousands)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\nTotal\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Less than\nOne Year\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> One to\nThree Years\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Three to\nFive Years\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> After Five\nYears\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Minimum annual rentals or non-cancellable operating leases\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 22,643\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 2,848\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 5,439\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 5,365\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 8,991\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Remaining contractual maturities of time deposits\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 67,782\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 50,343\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 15,379\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 2,060\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> -\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Short-term borrowings\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 47,001\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 47,001\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> -\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> -\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> -\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Subordinated debt\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 22,496\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> -\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> -\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 22,476\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Director and Officer retirement plan obligations\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 1,339\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Loan commitments\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 165,115\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 77,506\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 27,886\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 10,991\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 48,732\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Standby letters of credit\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 5,244\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 4,126\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 1,093\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> -\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 331,620\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 182,428\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 48,953\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 19,697\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 80,542\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nAs of December 31, 2015, we had entered into non-cancelable lease agreements for our main office and operations center, twelve current Republic retail branch facilities, two loan offices, and one training center expiring on various dates through November 30, 2034, including renewal options. The leases are accounted for as operating leases. The minimum rental payments required under these leases are $22.6 million through the year 2034.\nWe have retirement plan agreements with certain directors and officers. At December 31, 2015, the accrued benefits under the plan were approximately $1.3 million, with a minimum age of 65 established to qualify for the payments.\nInterest Rate Risk Management\nWe attempt to manage our assets and liabilities in a manner that optimizes net interest income in a range of interest rate environments. Management uses an \"interest sensitivity gap\" (\"GAP\") analysis and simulation models to monitor behavior of its interest sensitive assets and liabilities. A GAP analysis is the difference between interest-sensitive assets and interest-sensitive liabilities. Adjustments to the mix of assets and liabilities are made periodically in an effort to provide steady growth in net interest income.\nManagement presently believes that the effect of any future reduction in interest rates, reflected in lower yielding assets, could be detrimental since we may not have the immediate ability to commensurately decrease rates on interest bearing liabilities, primarily time deposits, other borrowings and certain transaction accounts. An increase in interest rates could have a negative effect due to a possible lag in the re-pricing of core deposits not taken into account in the static GAP analysis. Interest rate risk management involves managing the extent to which interest-sensitive assets and interest-sensitive liabilities are matched. We attempt to optimize net interest income while managing period-to-period fluctuations therein. We typically define interest-sensitive assets and interest-sensitive liabilities as those that re-price within one year or less. Generally, we limit long-term fixed rate assets and liabilities in our efforts to manage interest rate risk.\nA positive GAP occurs when interest-sensitive assets exceed interest-sensitive liabilities re-pricing in the same time periods, and a negative GAP occurs when interest-sensitive liabilities exceed interest-sensitive assets re-pricing in the same time periods. A negative GAP ratio suggests that a financial institution may be better positioned to take advantage of declining interest rates rather than increasing interest rates, and a positive GAP ratio suggests the converse. Static GAP analysis describes interest rate sensitivity at a point in time. However, it alone does not accurately measure the magnitude of changes in net interest income as changes in interest rates do not impact all categories of assets and liabilities equally or simultaneously. Interest rate sensitivity analysis also requires assumptions about re-pricing certain categories of assets and liabilities. For purposes of interest rate sensitivity analysis, assets and liabilities are stated at their contractual maturity, estimated likely call date, or earliest re-pricing opportunity. Mortgage-backed securities and amortizing loans are scheduled based on their anticipated cash flow, including prepayments based on historical data and current market trends. Savings, money market and interest-bearing demand accounts do not have a stated maturity or re-pricing term and can be withdrawn or re-priced at any time. Management estimates the re-pricing characteristics of these accounts based upon decay rates and run off projections obtained in a deposit study performed by an independent third party, along with management's estimates of when rates would have to be increased to retain balances in response to competition. Such estimates are necessarily arbitrary and wholly judgmental. As a result of the run off projections, these deposits are not considered to re-price simultaneously and, accordingly, a portion of the deposits are moved into time brackets exceeding one year. However, management may choose not to re-price liabilities proportionally to changes in market interest rates, for competitive or other reasons.\nShortcomings, inherent in a simplified and static GAP analysis, may result in an institution with a negative GAP having interest rate behavior associated with an asset-sensitive balance sheet. For example, although certain assets and liabilities may have similar maturities or periods to re-pricing, they may react in different degrees to changes in market interest rates. Furthermore, re-pricing characteristics of certain assets and liabilities may vary substantially within a given time period. In the event of a change in interest rates, prepayments and other cash flows could also deviate significantly from those assumed in calculating GAP in the manner presented in the table on the following page.\nThe following tables present a summary of our GAP analysis at December 31, 2015. Amounts shown in the table include both estimated maturities and instruments scheduled to re-price, including prime based loans. For purposes of these tables, we have used assumptions based on industry data and historical experience to calculate the expected maturity of loans because, statistically, certain categories of loans are prepaid before their maturity date, even without regard to interest rate fluctuations. Additionally, certain prepayment assumptions were made with regard to investment securities based upon the expected prepayment of the underlying collateral of the mortgage-backed securities. The interest rate on a portion of the CDOs is variable and adjusts quarterly.\nTable 66: <table> <tr> <td> Interest Rate Sensitivity Gap\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> As of December 31,

</tr>\n</table>\n(1) Demand, savings and money market accounts are scheduled to reprice based upon decay rate and run off percentage estimates obtained through a deposit study performed by an independent third party, along with management's estimates of when rates would have to be increased to retain balances in response to competition. Such estimates are necessarily arbitrary and wholly judgmental.\nIn addition to the GAP analysis, we utilize income simulation modeling in measuring our interest rate risk and managing our interest rate sensitivity. Income simulation considers not only the impact of changing market interest rates on forecasted net interest income, but also other factors such as yield curve relationships, the volume and mix of assets and liabilities and general market conditions.\nNet Portfolio Value and Net Interest Income Analysis\nThe income simulation models management used to measure interest rate risk and manage interest rate sensitivity generates estimates of the change in net portfolio value (NPV) and net interest income (NII) over a range of interest rate scenarios. NPV is the present value of expected cash flows from assets, liabilities, and off-balance sheet contracts. The NPV ratio, under any interest rate scenario, is defined as the NPV in that scenario divided by the market value of assets in the same scenario. The following table sets forth our NPV as of December 31, 2015 and reflects the changes to NPV as a result of immediate and sustained changes in interest rates as indicated (dollars in thousands):\nTable 68: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Net Portfolio Value\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> NPV as a % of Portfolio\nValue of Assets\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Change in Interest Rates in Basis Points (Rate Shock)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> Amount\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\nChange\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> %\nChange\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> NPV\nRatio\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Change\n(in Basis Points)\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> +400\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 135,332\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 15,720\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 13.14\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 10.36\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> +300\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 135,111\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 15,499\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 12.96\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 10.11\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> +200\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 133,950\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 14,338\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 11.98\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 9.79\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> +100\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 128,635\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 9,023\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 7.54\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 9.20\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Static\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 119,612\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> -\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 0.00\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 8.40\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> -\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 106,898\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (12,714\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (10.63\n</td> <td> )%\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 7.41\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (99\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nIn addition to modeling changes in NPV, we also analyze potential changes to NII for a forecasted twelve-month period under rising and falling interest rate scenarios.

Modeling changes in NPV and NII require the making of certain assumptions, which may or may not reflect the manner in which actual yields and costs respond to changes in market interest rates. In this regard, the models presented assume that the composition of our interest sensitive assets and liabilities existing at the beginning of a period remains constant over the period being measured and also assumes that a particular change in interest rates is reflected uniformly across the yield curve regardless of the duration to maturity or re-pricing of specific assets and liabilities. Accordingly, although the NPV measurements and net interest income models provide an indication of interest rate risk exposure at a particular point in time, such measurements are not intended to and do not provide a precise forecast of the effect of changes in market interest rates on net interest income and will differ from actual results.\nManagement believes that the assumptions utilized in evaluating our estimated net interest income are reasonable. However, the interest rate sensitivity of our assets, liabilities and off-balance sheet financial instruments as well as the estimated effect of changes in interest rates on estimated net interest income could vary substantially if different assumptions are used or actual experience differs from the experience on which the assumptions were based. Periodically, we may and do make significant changes to underlying assumptions, which are wholly judgmental. Prepayments on residential mortgage loans and mortgage-backed securities have increased over historical levels in recent years due to the lower interest rate environment, and may result in reductions in margins.\nCapital Resources\nWe have sponsored three outstanding issues of corporation-obligated mandatorily redeemable capital securities of a subsidiary trust holding solely junior subordinated debentures of the Corporation more commonly known as trust preferred securities. The subsidiary trusts are not consolidated for financial reporting purposes. The purpose of the issuances of these securities was to increase capital. The trust preferred securities qualify as Tier 1 capital for regulatory purposes in amounts up to 25% of total Tier 1 capital.\nOn December 27, 2006, Republic Capital Trust II (Trust II) issued $6.0 million of trust preferred securities to investors and $0.2 million of common securities to us. Trust II purchased $6.2 million of our floating rate junior subordinated debentures due 2037, and we used the proceeds to call the securities of Republic Capital Trust I (Trust I). The debentures purchased by Trust II have a variable interest rate, adjustable quarterly, at 1.73% over the 3-month LIBOR. We may redeem the debentures on any interest payment date without a prepayment penalty.\nOn June 28, 2007, Republic Capital Trust III (Trust III), issued $5.0 million of trust preferred securities to one investor and $0.2 million common securities to us. Trust III purchased $5.2 million of our floating rate junior subordinated debentures due 2037, which have a variable interest rate, adjustable quarterly, at 1.55% over the 3 month LIBOR. We have the ability to redeem the debentures on any interest payment date without a prepayment penalty.\nOn June 10, 2008, Republic First Bancorp Capital Trust IV (Trust IV) issued $10.8 million of convertible trust preferred securities as part of our strategic capital plan. The securities were purchased by investors, including Vernon W. Hill, II, founder and chairman (retired) of Commerce Bancorp, and, since the investment, a consultant to the Company. The investor group also included a family trust of Harry D. Madonna, our chairman, president and chief executive officer, and Theodore J. Flocco, Jr., who has been elected by the shareholders to our Board of Directors and serves as the Chairman of our Audit Committee. Trust IV also issued $0.3 million of common securities to the Company. Trust IV purchased $11.1 million of our fixed rate junior subordinated convertible debentures due 2038, which pay interest at an annual rate of 8.0% and are redeemable on any interest payment date (a) at any time on or after June 13, 2013 if the closing price of our common stock for 20 trading days in the period of 30 consecutive trading days ending on the trading day prior to the mailing of the notice of redemption exceeds 120% of the then-applicable conversion price, or (b) on or after June 30, 2018, without a prepayment penalty. The trust preferred securities of Trust IV are currently convertible into approximately 1.7 million shares of our common stock, which is subject to customary adjustments.\nAdditionally, on April 22, 2014, the Company issued 11,842,106 shares of its common stock in a private placement for gross proceeds of $45.0 million.\nShareholders' equity as of December 31, 2015 totaled approximately $113.4 million compared to approximately $112.8 million as of December 31, 2014. The book value per share of our common stock increased to $3.00 as of December 31, 2015, based upon 37,837,003 shares outstanding, from $2.98 as of December 31, 2014, based upon 37,815,503 shares outstanding at December 31, 2014. Outstanding shares are adjusted for treasury stock and deferred compensation plan shares by the Company.\nRegulatory Capital Requirements\nThe Company is required to comply with certain \"risk-based\" capital adequacy guidelines issued by the FRB and the FDIC. The risk-based capital guidelines assign varying risk weights to the individual assets held by a bank. The guidelines also assign weights to the \"credit-equivalent\" amounts of certain off-balance sheet items, such as letters of credit and interest rate and currency swap contracts.\nIn July 2013, the federal bank regulatory agencies adopted revisions to the agencies' capital adequacy guidelines and prompt corrective action rules, which were designed to enhance such requirements and implement the revised standards of the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision, commonly referred to as Basel III. The final rules generally implement higher minimum capital requirements, add a new common equity tier 1 capital requirement, and establish criteria that instruments must meet to be considered common equity tier 1 capital, additional tier 1 capital or tier 2 capital. Effective as of January 1, 2015, the new minimum capital to risk-adjusted assets requirements are a common equity tier 1 capital ratio of 4.5% (6.5% to be considered \"well capitalized\") and a tier 1 capital ratio of 6.0%, increased from 4.0% (and increased from 6.0% to 8.0% to be considered \"well capitalized\"); the total capital ratio remains at 8.0% under the new rules (10.0% to be considered \"well capitalized\"). Under the new rules, in order to avoid limitations on capital distributions (including dividend payments and certain discretionary bonus payments to executive officers), a banking organization must hold a capital conservation buffer comprised of common equity tier 1 capital above its minimum risk-based capital requirements, which amount must be greater than 2.5% of total risk-weighted assets at January 1, 2019. The capital contribution buffer requirements phase in over a three-year period beginning January 1, 2016. Management has reviewed the new standards and evaluated all options and strategies to ensure compliance with the new standards. Both Republic and the Company met the \"well capitalized\" standards applicable to them as of December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014.\nThe risk-based capital ratios measure the adequacy of a bank's capital against the riskiness of its assets and off-balance sheet activities. Failure to maintain adequate capital is a basis for \"prompt corrective action\" or other regulatory enforcement action. In assessing a bank's capital adequacy, regulators also consider other factors such as interest rate risk exposure; liquidity, funding and market risks; quality and level or earnings; concentrations of credit, quality of loans and investments; risks of any nontraditional activities; effectiveness of bank policies; and management's overall ability to monitor and control risks.\nManagement believes that the Company and Republic met, as of December 31, 2015 and 2014, all capital adequacy requirements to which we are subject. In the current year, the FDIC categorized Republic as well capitalized under the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action provisions of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act. There are no calculations or events since that notification which management believes would have changed Republic's category.\nThe Company and Republic's ability to maintain the required levels of capital is substantially dependent upon the success of their capital and business plans, the impact of future economic events on Republic's loan customers and Republic's ability to manage its interest rate risk, growth and other operating expenses.\nThe following table presents our regulatory capital ratios at December 31, 2015 and 2014:\nTable 70: <table> <tr> <td> (dollars in thousands)\n</td>

meet its financial obligations. These obligations include the payment of deposits on demand or at their contractual maturity; the repayment of borrowings as they mature; the payment of lease obligations as they become due; the ability to fund new and existing loans and other funding commitments; and the ability to take advantage of new business opportunities. Liquidity needs can be met by either reducing assets or increasing liabilities. Our most liquid assets consist of cash, amounts due from banks and federal funds sold.\nRegulatory authorities require us to maintain certain liquidity ratios in order for funds to be available to satisfy commitments to borrowers and the demands of depositors. In response to these requirements, we have formed an asset/liability committee (ALCO), comprised of certain members of Republic's Board of Directors and senior management to monitor such ratios. The ALCO committee is responsible for managing the liquidity position and interest sensitivity. That committee's primary objective is to maximize net interest income while configuring Republic's interest-sensitive assets and liabilities to manage interest rate risk and provide adequate liquidity for projected needs. The ALCO committee meets on a quarterly basis or more frequently if deemed necessary.\nOur target and actual liquidity levels are determined by comparisons of the estimated repayment and marketability of interest-earning assets with projected future outflows of deposits and other liabilities. Our most liquid assets, comprised of cash and cash equivalents on the balance sheet, totaled $27.1 million at December 31, 2015, compared to $128.8 million at December 31, 2014. Loan maturities and repayments are another source of asset liquidity. At December 31, 2015, Republic estimated that more than $45.0 million of loans would mature or repay in the six-month period ending June 30, 2016. Additionally, a significant portion of our investment securities are available to satisfy liquidity requirements through sales on the open market or by pledging as collateral to access credit facilities. At December 31, 2015, we had outstanding commitments (including unused lines of credit and letters of credit) of $170.4 million. Certificates of deposit scheduled to mature in one year totaled $50.1 million at December 31, 2015. We anticipate that we will have sufficient funds available to meet all current commitments.\nDaily funding requirements have historically been satisfied by generating core deposits and certificates of deposit with competitive rates, buying federal funds or utilizing the credit facilities of the FHLB. We have established a line of credit with the FHLB of Pittsburgh. Our maximum borrowing capacity with the FHLB was $440.6 million at December 31, 2015. As of December 31, 2015 and 2014, we had outstanding borrowings with the FHLB of $47.0 and $0 respectively. As of December 31, 2015, FHLB had issued letters of credit, on Republic's behalf, totaling $75.1 million against our available credit line. We also established a contingency line of credit of $10.0 million with Atlantic Community Bankers Bank (\"ACBB\") to assist in managing our liquidity position. We had no amounts outstanding against the ACBB line of credit at December 31, 2015 and 2014.\nVariable Interest Entities\nThe Company follows the guidance under ASC 810, Consolidation, with regard to variable interest entities. ASC 810 clarifies the application of consolidation principles for certain legal entities in which voting rights are not effective in identifying the investor with the controlling financial interest. An entity is subject to consolidation under ASC 810 if the investors do not have sufficient equity at risk for the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support, are unable to direct the entity's activities, or are not exposed to the entity's losses or entitled to its residual returns (\"variable interest entities\"). Variable interest entities within the scope of ASC 810 will be required to be consolidated by their primary beneficiary. The primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity is determined to be the party that absorbs a majority of the entity's expected losses, receives a majority of its expected returns, or both.\nThe Company does not consolidate its subsidiary trusts. ASC 810 precludes consideration of the call option embedded in the preferred securities when determining if the Company has the right to a majority of the trusts' expected residual returns. The non-consolidation results in the investment in the common securities of the trusts to be included in other assets with a corresponding increase in outstanding debt of $676,000. In addition, the income received on the Company's investment in the common securities of the trusts is included in other income.\nEffects of Inflation\nThe majority of assets and liabilities of a financial institution are monetary in nature. Therefore, a financial institution differs greatly from most commercial and industrial companies that have significant investments in fixed assets or inventories. Management believes that the most significant impact of inflation on financial results is our need and ability to react to changes in interest rates. As discussed previously, management attempts to maintain an essentially balanced position between rate sensitive assets and liabilities over a one-year time horizon in order to protect net interest income from being affected by wide interest rate fluctuations.", "item_7_truncated": "Item 7: Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThe following discussion and analysis of the results of operations and financial condition should be read in conjunction with Item 6 \"Selected Financial Data\" and the consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto included in Item 8 of this report. This discussion and analysis contains forward-looking statements that involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions. Certain risks, uncertainties and other factors, including but not limited to those set forth in Item 1A, entitled, \"Risk Factors\" and elsewhere in this report may cause actual results to differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements.\nExecutive Summary\nWe continue to expand our presence in the Philadelphia region through an aggressive growth strategy which we refer to as \"The Power of Red is Back.\" The goal of this expansion plan is to increase our store footprint while providing legendary customer service. During 2015 we welcomed thousands of new customers into our stores and won them over with exceptional service. The growth in asset, loan and deposit balances clearly demonstrates our ongoing success with this strategy. While we continue to make significant investments to build a new bank, we are very pleased with our ability to maintain consistent, profitable results from an income statement perspective.\nThe new stores opened in Glassboro, Marlton and Berlin, NJ during 2015 have performed exceptionally well. We ended the year with stores under construction in Washington Township, NJ and Wynnewood, PA and several more in various stages of development for future openings.\nThe highlights for the year ended December 31, 2015 are as follows:\n \u00b7 Total assets increased by $225 million, or 19%, to $1.4 billion as of December 31, 2015 compared to $1.2 billion as of December 31, 2014. \n \u00b7 Non-interest bearing demand deposits increased by 9% to $244 million as of December 31, 2015 compared to $224 million as of December 31, 2014. \n \u00b7 Total deposits increased by $177 million, or 17%, to $1.2 billion as of December 31, 2015 compared to $1.1 billion as of December 31, 2014. The cost of funds on interest bearing deposits decreased to 0.46% for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to 0.47% for the year ended December 31, 2014. \n \u00b7 Total loans grew $93 million, or 12%, to $875 million as of December 31, 2015 compared to $782 million at December 31, 2014. \n \u00b7 SBA lending continued to be a focal point of the Company's lending strategy. More than $41 million in new SBA loans were originated during the year ended December 31, 2015. Our team is currently ranked as the #1 SBA lender in the tri-state market of New Jersey, Pennsylvania, and Delaware based on the dollar volume of loan originations. \n \u00b7 Asset quality improved as non-performing loans decreased to $12.6 million, or 1.44% of total loans at December 31, 2015 compared to $21.4 million, or 2.74% of total loans at December 31, 2014. Non-performing assets decreased to $23.9 million, or 1.66% of total assets at December 31, 2015 compared to $25.2 million, or 2.07% of total assets at December 31, 2014. \n \u00b7 The Company's Total Risk-Based Capital ratio was 13.19% and Tier I Leverage ratio was 9.65% at December 31, 2015. \n \u00b7 Book value per common share was $3.00 as of December 31, 2015. \n \u00b7 In 2015, we opened three new locations in Glassboro, Marlton and Berlin, NJ that feature our new and distinctive prototype building. There are also several additional sites in various stages of development for future store locations. \n \u00b7 Our Cherry Hill, NJ store, which opened in March 2014, has grown to more than $100 million in core deposits during 2015. \nNon-GAAP Based Financial Measures\nThe Company's selected financial data contains non-GAAP financial measures calculated using non-GAAP amounts. These measures include tangible book value per common share and average equity to average assets. Management uses these non-GAAP measures to present historical periods comparable to the current period presentation. In addition, management believes the use of these non-GAAP measures provides additional clarity when assessing the Company's financial results and use of equity. These disclosures should not be viewed as substitutes for results determined to be in accordance with U.S. GAAP, nor are they necessarily comparable to non-GAAP performance measures that may be presented by other entities.\nCritical Accounting Policies, Judgments and Estimates\nIn reviewing and understanding our financial information, you are encouraged to read and understand the significant accounting policies used in preparing the consolidated financial statements. These policies are described in Note 2 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. The accounting and financial reporting policies conform to accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America and to general practices within the banking industry. The preparation of the consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of income and expenses during the reporting period. Management evaluates these estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis including those related to the allowance for loan losses, carrying values of other real estate owned, other than temporary impairment of securities, fair value of financial instruments and deferred income taxes. Management bases its estimates on historical experience and various other factors and assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. These form the basis for making judgments on the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.\nWe have identified the policies related to the allowance for loan losses, other-than-temporary impairment of securities, other real estate owned, and deferred income taxes as being critical.\nAllowance for Loan Losses - Management's ongoing evaluation of the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses is based on our past loan loss experience, the volume and composition of our lending, adverse situations that may affect a borrower's ability to repay, the estimated value of any underlying collateral, current economic conditions and other factors affecting the known and inherent risk in the portfolio. The allowance for loan losses is increased by charges to income through the provision for loan losses and decreased by charge-offs (net of recoveries). The allowance is maintained at a level that management, based upon its evaluation, considers adequate to absorb losses inherent in the loan portfolio. This evaluation is inherently subjective as it requires material estimates including, among others, the amount and timing of expected future cash flows on impacted loans, exposure at default, value of collateral, and estimated losses on our commercial and residential loan portfolios. All of these estimates may be susceptible to significant change.\nThe allowance consists of specific allowances for impaired loans, a general allowance on the remainder of the portfolio, and an unallocated component to account for a level of imprecision in management's estimation process. Although management determines the amount of each element of the allowance separately, the allowance for loan losses is available for the entire loan portfolio.\nManagement establishes an allowance on certain impaired loans for the amount by which the discounted cash flows, observable market price, or fair value of collateral if the loan is collateral dependent, is lower than the carrying value of the loan. A loan is considered to be impaired when, based upon current information and events, it is probable that we will be unable to collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the loan. A delay or shortfall in amount of payments does not necessarily result in the loan being identified as impaired.\nManagement also establishes a general allowance on non-impaired loans to recognize the inherent losses associated with lending activities, but which, unlike specific allowances, have not been allocated to particular loans. This general valuation allowance is determined by segregating the loans by loan category and assigning allowance percentages based on our historical loss experience, delinquency trends, and management's evaluation of the collectability of the loan portfolio.\nManagement also evaluates classified loans, which are not impaired. We segregate these loans by category and assign qualitative factors to each loan based on inherent losses associated with each type of lending and consideration that these loans, in the aggregate, represent an above-average credit risk and that more of these loans will prove to be uncollectible compared to loans in the general portfolio. Classification of a loan within this category is based on identified weaknesses that increase the credit risk of the loan.\nThe allowance is adjusted for significant factors that, in management's judgment, affect the collectability of the portfolio as of the evaluation date. These significant factors may include changes in lending policies and procedures, changes in existing general economic and business conditions affecting its primary lending areas, credit quality trends, collateral value, loan volumes and concentrations, seasoning of the loan portfolio, loss experience in particular segments of the portfolio, duration of the current business cycle, and bank regulatory examination results. The applied loss factors are re-evaluated each reporting period to ensure their relevance in the current economic environment.\nWhile management uses the best information known to it in order to make loan loss allowance valuations, adjustments to the allowance may be necessary based on changes in economic and other conditions, changes in the composition of the loan portfolio, or changes in accounting guidance. In times of economic slowdown, either regional or national, the risk inherent in the loan portfolio could increase resulting in the need for additional provisions to the allowance for loan losses in future periods. An increase could also be necessitated by an increase in the size of the loan portfolio or in any of its components even though the credit quality of the overall portfolio may be improving. Historically, the estimates of the allowance for loan loss have provided adequate coverage against actual losses incurred. In addition, the Pennsylvania Department of Banking and Securities and the FDIC, as an integral part of their examination processes, periodically review the allowance for loan losses. The Pennsylvania Department of Banking and Securities or the FDIC may require the recognition of adjustment to the allowance for loan losses based on their judgment of information available to them at the time of their examinations. To the extent that actual outcomes differ from management's estimates, additional provisions to the allowance for loan losses may be required that would adversely impact earnings in future periods.\nOther-Than-Temporary Impairment of Securities - Securities are evaluated on at least a quarterly basis, and more frequently when market conditions warrant such an evaluation, to determine whether a decline in their value is other-than-temporary. To determine whether a loss in value is other-than-temporary, management utilizes criteria such as the reasons underlying the decline, the magnitude and duration of the decline and our intent and ability to retain its investment in the security for a period of time sufficient to allow for an anticipated recovery in the fair value. The term \"other-than-temporary\" is not intended to indicate that the decline is permanent, but indicates that the prospects for a near-term recovery of value is not necessarily favorable, or that there is a lack of evidence to support a realizable value equal to or greater than the carrying value of the investment. Once a decline in value is determined to be other-than-temporary, the value of the security is reduced and a corresponding charge to earnings is recognized.\nOther Real Estate Owned - Other real estate owned consists of assets acquired through, or in lieu of, loan foreclosure. They are held for sale and are initially recorded at fair value less cost to sell at the date of foreclosure, establishing a new cost basis. Subsequent to foreclosure, valuations are periodically performed by management and the assets are carried at the lower of carrying amount or fair value, less the cost to sell. Revenue and expenses from operations and changes in the valuation allowance are included in net expenses from other real estate owned.\nIncome Taxes - Management makes estimates and judgments to calculate various tax liabilities and determine the recoverability of various deferred tax assets, which arise from temporary differences between the tax and financial statement recognition of revenues and expenses. Management also estimates a reserve for deferred tax assets if, based on the available evidence, it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the recorded deferred tax assets will not be realized in future periods. These estimates and judgments are inherently subjective. Historically, management's estimates and judgments to calculate the deferred tax accounts have not required significant revision.\nIn evaluating our ability to recover deferred tax assets, management considers all available positive and negative evidence, including the past operating results and forecasts of future taxable income. In determining future taxable income, management makes assumptions for the amount of taxable income, the reversal of temporary differences and the implementation of feasible and prudent tax planning strategies. These assumptions require management to make judgments about the future taxable income and are consistent with the plans and estimates used to manage the business. Any reduction in estimated future taxable income may require management to record a valuation allowance against the deferred tax assets. An increase in the valuation allowance would result in additional income tax expense in the period and could have a significant impact on future earnings.\nResults of Operations\nFor the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2014\nWe reported net income of $2.4 million, or $0.06 per share, for the twelve months ended December 31, 2015 compared to net income of $2.4 million, or $0.07 per share, for the twelve months ended December 31, 2014.\nNet interest income for the twelve months ended December 31, 2015 increased $4.2 million to $40.1 million as compared to $35.8 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2014. Interest income increased $5.0 million, or 12.3%, due primarily to an increase in average loans receivable and investment securities balances. Interest expense increased $737,000 or 15.9%, primarily due to an increase in average deposit balances.\nWe recorded a loan loss provision in the amount of $500,000 for the twelve months ended December 31, 2015 compared to a provision of $900,000 during the twelve months ended December 31, 2014. The lower provision recorded for the twelve months ended December 31, 2015 was driven by a decrease in the reserve required for loans individually evaluated for impairment in 2015.\nNon-interest income increased $1.9 million to $9.9 million during the twelve months ended December 31, 2015 as compared to $8.0 million during the twelve months ended December 31, 2014 primarily driven by a $2.6 million insurance settlement recorded in 2015 which was related to a bond claim against a corporate insurance policy originally submitted in 2010.\nNon-interest expenses increased $6.5 million to $47.1 million during the twelve months ended December 31, 2015 as compared to $40.6 million during the twelve months ended December 31, 2014. The increase was primarily driven by higher salaries, employee benefits, occupancy and equipment expenses associated with the addition of new stores related to our expansion strategy which we refers to as \"The Power of Red is Back.\" In addition, we made a decision in 2015 to aggressively pursue a potential sale of our largest OREO asset resulting in a write-down of approximately $2.2 million.\nReturn on average assets and average equity from continuing operations were 0.19% and 2.14%, respectively, during the twelve months ended December 31, 2015 compared to 0.23% and 2.51%, respectively, for the twelve months ended December 31, 2014.\nAverage Balances and Net Interest Income\nHistorically, our earnings have depended primarily upon Republic's net interest income, which is the difference between interest earned on interest-earning assets and interest paid on interest-bearing liabilities. Net interest income is affected by changes in the mix of the volume and rates of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities. The following table provides an analysis of net interest income on an annualized basis, setting forth for the periods average assets, liabilities, and shareholders' equity, interest income earned on interest-earning assets and interest expense on interest-bearing liabilities, average yields earned on interest-earning assets and average rates on interest-bearing liabilities, and Republic's net interest margin (net interest income as a percentage of average total interest-earning assets). Averages are computed based on daily balances. Non-accrual loans are included in average loans receivable. Yields are adjusted for tax equivalency, using a rate of 35% in 2015, 2014, and 2013.\nAverage Balances and Net Interest Income\nTable 40: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> For the Year

calculated based on amortized cost.\n(2) Net interest income and net interest margin are presented on a tax equivalent basis. Net interest income has been increased over the financial statement amount by $606, $379, and $323 in 2015, 2014, and 2013, respectively, to adjust for tax equivalency. The tax equivalent net interest margin is calculated by dividing tax equivalent net interest income by average total interest earning assets.\nRate/Volume Analysis of Changes in Net Interest Income\nNet interest income may also be analyzed by segregating the volume and rate components of interest income and interest expense. The following table sets forth an analysis of volume and rate changes in net interest income for the periods indicated. For purposes of this table, changes in interest income and expense are allocated to volume and rate categories based upon the respective changes in average balances and average rates.\nTable 41:

on a fully tax-equivalent basis, for the twelve months of 2015 increased by $4.5 million, or 12.3%, over the same period in 2014. Interest income on interest-earning assets totaled $46.0 million for the twelve months of 2015, an increase of $5.2 million, compared to the same period in 2014. The increase in interest income earned was the result of an increase in the average balance of loans receivable and investment securities that helped to offset a 20 bp decrease in the yield on loans receivable. Total interest expense for the twelve months of 2015 increased $737,000, or 15.9%, to $5.4 million from $4.6 million over the same period in 2014. Interest expense on deposits increased by $730,000, or 20.6%, for the twelve months of 2015 versus the same period of 2014. Interest expense on other borrowings increased by $7,000 for the twelve months of 2015 compared to the same period in 2014.\nChanges in net interest income are frequently measured by two statistics: net interest rate spread and net interest margin. Net interest rate spread is the difference between the average rate earned on interest-earning assets and the average rate incurred on interest-bearing liabilities. Our net interest rate spread on a fully tax-equivalent basis was 3.16% during the twelve months of 2015 versus 3.41% during the twelve months of 2014. Net interest margin represents the difference between interest income, including net loan fees earned, and interest expense, reflected as a percentage of average interest-earning assets. For the twelve months of 2015 and 2014, the fully tax-equivalent net interest margin was 3.29% and 3.56%, respectively. The net interest margin for the year ending December 31, 2015 decreased primarily as a result of a decrease in the yield on loans receivable.\nProvision for Loan Losses\nWe recorded a provision for loan losses in the amount of $500,000 for the twelve months ended December 31, 2015 compared to a $900,000 provision for the twelve months ended December 31, 2014. The provision for loan losses is charged to operations in an amount necessary to bring the total allowance for loan losses to a level that management believes is adequate to absorb inherent losses in the loan portfolio.\nThe provision recorded for the twelve months ended December 31, 2015 as compared to the twelve months ended December 31, 2014 decreased due to an improvement in asset quality, which resulted in a reduction in the allowance for loan losses required for loans individually evaluated for impairment in 2015.\nNon-Interest Income\nTotal noninterest income for the twelve months of 2015 increased by $1.9 million, or 24.0%, from the same period in 2014. We recorded a $2.6 million insurance settlement in 2015 which was related to a claim against a corporate insurance policy originally submitted in 2010. Loan advisory and servicing fees increased by $774 thousand in 2015 due to higher servicing fee income on SBA loans. Service fees on deposit accounts increased by $496,000 in 2015 compared to 2014 due to the growth in the number of customer accounts and deposit balances. We recognized gains of $108,000 on the sale of investment securities during 2015 compared to gains of $458,000 on the sale of investment securities in 2014. Gains recognized on the sale of SBA loans were $3.1 million during the twelve months of 2015 compared to $4.7 million in the same period of 2014 primarily due to a decrease in the volume of loans originated and sold in 2015.\nNon-Interest Expenses\nIn 2015, noninterest expenses increased by $6.5 million, or 16.1%, compared to 2014. An explanation of changes in noninterest expenses for certain categories is presented in the following paragraphs.\nSalary expenses and employee benefits in 2015 were $22.5 million, an increase of $2.4 million, or 11.9%, compared to 2014 primarily driven by annual merit increases along with increased staffing levels related to our aggressive growth strategy of adding and relocating stores, which we refer to as \"The Power of Red is Back.\"\nOccupancy related expenses increased by $1.4 million, or 20.8%, in 2015 compared to 2014, also as a result of the growth and relocation strategy. Three new stores were opened during 2015 and two additional sites were under construction at year end.\nOther real estate owned expenses totaled $4.2 million during 2015, an increase of $2.4 million, when compared to 2014 primarily due to higher writedowns on foreclosed assets held in other real estate owned. A writedown of $2.2 million was recorded against the largest asset held in other real estate owned during 2015 as a result of our decision to aggressively pursue a potential sale of this asset.\nIn addition, minor increases in data processing, other operating expenses, regulatory assessments, insurance, other taxes, and advertising for the twelve months of 2015 versus the same period last year were offset by minor decreases in legal expenses and professional fees.\nOne key measure that management utilizes to monitor progress in controlling overhead expenses is the ratio of annualized net noninterest expenses to average assets. For purposes of this calculation, net noninterest expenses equal noninterest expenses less noninterest income and nonrecurring expense. For the twelve month period ended December 31, 2015, the ratio equaled 2.83% compared to 3.05% for the twelve month period ended December 31, 2014, respectively, reflecting higher average assets related to the Company's growth strategy.\nAnother productivity measure utilized by management is the operating efficiency ratio. This ratio expresses the relationship of noninterest expenses to net interest income plus noninterest income. The efficiency ratio equaled 94.2% for the twelve months of 2015, compared to 92.5% for the twelve months of 2014. The increase for the twelve months ended December 31, 2015 versus December 31, 2014 was due to an increase in total noninterest expenses.\nProvision (Benefit) for Income Taxes\nWe recorded a benefit for income taxes of $26,000 for the twelve months ended December 31, 2015, compared to a $46,000 benefit for the twelve months ended December 31, 2014. The $26,000 benefit recorded during the twelve months of 2015 was the net result of an estimated tax provision in the amount of $911,000 calculated on the net profit generated during the period using our normal estimated tax rate, offset by an adjustment to the deferred tax asset valuation allowance in the amount of $937,000. The effective tax rates for the twelve month periods ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 were 38% and 26%, respectively, excluding an adjustment to the deferred tax asset valuation allowance.\nWe evaluate the carrying amount of its deferred tax assets on a quarterly basis or more frequently, if necessary, in accordance with the guidance provided in Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Accounting Standards Codification Topic 740 (ASC 740), in particular, applying the criteria set forth therein to determine whether it is more likely than not (i.e. a likelihood of more than 50%) that some portion, or all, of the deferred tax asset will not be realized within its life cycle, based on the weight of available evidence. If management makes a determination based on the available evidence that it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized in future periods, a valuation allowance is calculated and recorded. These determinations are inherently subjective and dependent upon estimates and judgments concerning management's evaluation of both positive and negative evidence.\nIn conducting the deferred tax asset analysis, we believe it is important to consider the unique characteristics of an industry or business. In particular, characteristics such as business model, level of capital and reserves held by financial institutions and their ability to absorb potential losses are important distinctions to be considered for bank holding companies like the Company. In addition, it is also important to consider that net operating loss carryforwards (\"NOLs\") for federal income tax purposes can generally be carried back two years and carried forward for a period of twenty years. In order to realize our deferred tax assets, we must generate sufficient taxable income in such future years.\nIn assessing the need for a valuation allowance, we carefully weighed both positive and negative evidence currently available. Judgment is required when considering the relative impact of such evidence. The weight given to the potential effect of positive and negative evidence must be commensurate with the extent to which it can be objectively verified. A cumulative loss in recent years is a significant piece of negative evidence that is difficult to overcome.\nWhen calculating an estimate for a valuation allowance, we assessed the possible sources of taxable income available under tax law to realize a tax benefit for deductible temporary differences and carry forwards as defined in ASC 740. The Company did not use projections of future taxable income, exclusive of reversing temporary timing differences and carryforwards, as a factor in the analysis. The Company will exclude future taxable income as a factor until we can show consistent and sustainable profitability. Based on the analysis of available positive and negative evidence, we determined that a valuation allowance should be recorded as of December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014.\nThe Company did assess tax planning strategies as defined under ASC 740 to determine the amount of a valuation allowance. Strategies reviewed included the sale of investment securities and loans with fair values greater than book values, redeployment of cash and cash equivalents into higher yielding investment options, a switch from tax-exempt to taxable investments and loans, and the election of a decelerated depreciation method for tax purposes on future fixed asset purchases. We believe that these tax planning strategies are (a) prudent and feasible, (b) steps that we would not ordinarily take, but would take to prevent an operating loss or tax credit carryforward from expiring unused, and (c) would result in the realization of existing deferred tax assets. These tax planning strategies, if implemented, would result in taxable income in the first full reporting period after deployment and accelerate the recovery of deferred tax asset balances if faced with the inability to recover those assets or the risk of potential expiration. We believe that these are viable tax planning strategies and appropriately considered in the analysis at this time, but may not align with the strategic direction of the organization today and therefore, has no present intention to implement such strategies.\nThe net deferred tax asset balance before consideration of a valuation allowance was $20.2 million as of December 31, 2015 and $19.6 million as of December 31, 2014. After assessment of all available tax planning strategies, we determined that a partial valuation allowance in the amount of $13.7 million as of December 31, 2015 and $14.7 million as of December 31, 2014 should be recorded.\nThe deferred tax asset will continue to be analyzed on a quarterly basis for changes affecting realizability. When the determination is made to include projections of future taxable income as a factor in recovering the deferred tax asset, the valuation allowance will be reduced accordingly resulting in a corresponding increase in net income.\nNet Income and Net Income per Common Share\nNet income for the twelve month periods ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 was $2.4 million. For the twelve month period ended December 31, 2015, basic and fully-diluted net income per common share was $0.06 compared to basic and fully-diluted net income per common share of $0.07 for the twelve month period ended December 31, 2014.\nReturn on Average Assets and Average Equity\nReturn on average assets (ROA) measures our net income in relation to our total average assets. The ROA for the twelve month periods ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 was 0.19% and 0.23%, respectively. Return on average equity (ROE) indicates how effectively we can generate net income on the capital invested by our stockholders. ROE is calculated by dividing annualized net income by average stockholders' equity. The ROE for the twelve month period ended December 31, 2015 was 2.14%, compared to 2.51% for the twelve month period ended December 31, 2014.\nResults of Operations\nFor the year ended December 31, 2014 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2013\nWe reported net income of $2.4 million, or $0.07 per share, for the twelve months ended December 31, 2014 compared to a net loss of $3.5 million, or $(0.13) per share, for the twelve months ended December 31, 2013. Prior year net income was impacted by a loan loss provision in the amount of $3.6 million on a single loan and a one-time charge of $1.9 million related to a legal settlement.\nNet interest income for the twelve months ended December 31, 2014 increased $3.2 million to $35.8 million as compared to $32.6 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2013. Interest income increased $3.3 million, or 8.8%, due primarily to an increase in average loan balances. Interest expense increased $54,000 or 1.2%, primarily due to an increase in average deposit balances.\nWe recorded a loan loss provision in the amount of $900,000 for the twelve months ended December 31, 2014 compared to a provision of $4.9 million during the twelve months ended December 31, 2013. The lower provision recorded for the twelve months ended December 31, 2014 was driven by a loan loss provision in the amount of $3.6 million on one loan recorded in 2013 which did not recur in 2014.\nNon-interest income decreased $1.2 million to $8.0 million during the twelve months ended December 31, 2014 as compared to $9.2 million during the twelve months ended December 31, 2013 primarily due to a decrease of $621,000 in gains recognized on the sale of SBA loans during the twelve months ended December 31, 2014 as a result of fewer SBA loan originations during the current period. In addition, there was a decrease of $245,000 in gains on the sale of investment securities and a decrease of $238,000 in legal settlements compared to December 31, 2013.\nNon-interest expenses increased $139,000 to $40.6 million during the twelve months ended December 31, 2014 as compared to $40.4 million during the twelve months ended December 31, 2013. The increase during the twelve months ended December 31, 2014 was primarily due to an increase in salaries and benefits of $3.0 million driven primarily by annual merit increases along with increased staffing levels related to the Company's growth strategy of adding and relocating stores. Occupancy related expenses also increased by $889,000 as a result of the growth and relocation strategy. These increases were offset by a legal settlement of $1.9 million recorded in 2013, a decrease in other real estate owned expenses of $1.4 million, and a decrease of $588,000 in legal expenses.\nReturn on average assets and average equity from continuing operations were 0.23% and 2.51%, respectively, during the twelve months ended December 31, 2014 compared to (0.37)% and (5.07)%, respectively, for the twelve months ended December 31, 2013.\nNet Interest Income and Net Interest Margin\nNet interest income, on a fully tax-equivalent basis, for the twelve months of 2014 increased by $3.3 million, or 9.9%, over the same period in 2013. Interest income on interest-earning assets totaled $40.9 million for the twelve months of 2014, an increase of $3.3 million, compared to the same period in 2013. The increase in interest income earned was the result of an increase in the average balance of loans receivable and investment securities that helped to offset a 24 bp decrease in the yield on loans receivable. Total interest expense for the twelve months of 2014 increased $54,000, or 1.2%, from $4.6 million in 2013 to $4.6 million in 2014. Interest expense on deposits increased by $58,000, or 1.7%, for the twelve months of 2014 versus the same period of 2013. Interest expense on short-term borrowings decreased by $4,000 for the twelve months of 2014 compared to the same period in 2013.\nChanges in net interest income are frequently measured by two statistics: net interest rate spread and net interest margin. Net interest rate spread is the difference between the average rate earned on interest-earning assets and the average rate incurred on interest-bearing liabilities. Our net interest rate spread on a fully tax-equivalent basis was 3.41% during the twelve months of 2014 versus 3.54% during the twelve months of 2013. Net interest margin represents the difference between interest income, including net loan fees earned, and interest expense, reflected as a percentage of average interest-earning assets. For the twelve months of 2014 and 2013, the fully tax-equivalent net interest margin was 3.56% and 3.66%, respectively. The net interest margin for the year ending December 31, 2014 decreased primarily as a result of a decrease in the yield on loans receivable.\nProvision for Loan Losses\nWe recorded a provision for loan losses in the amount of $900,000 for the twelve months ended December 31, 2014 compared to a $4.9 million provision for the twelve months ended December 31, 2013. The provision for loan losses is charged to operations in an amount necessary to bring the total allowance for loan losses to a level that management believes is adequate to absorb inherent losses in the loan portfolio.\nThe higher provision recorded during 2013 was primarily driven by a single loan relationship which was originated in 2006 and determined to be impaired during the fourth quarter of 2013 due to delinquency in payments. The need for a provision in the amount of $3.6 million was the result of a significant reduction in the collateral value supporting the loan based upon a current appraisal.\nIn addition, the provision recorded for the twelve months ended December 31, 2014 as compared to the twelve months ended December 31, 2013 decreased due to a reduction in the allowance for loan losses related to non-impaired loans evaluated collectively for impairment. The decrease associated with loans collectively evaluated for impairment was driven by a reduction in the factor used in the calculation related to historical charge-offs which has declined as a result of lower charge-offs in recent years.\nNon-Interest Income\nTotal noninterest income for the first twelve months of 2014 decreased by $1.2 million, or 13.0%, from the same period in 2013. Gains recognized on the sale of SBA loans were $4.7 million during the twelve months of 2014 compared to $5.3 million in the same period of 2013. In addition, we also recognized gains of $458,000 on the sale of investment securities during 2014 compared to gains of $703,000 on the sale of investment securities in 2013. We recorded no legal settlements during the twelve month period ended December 31, 2014 compared to $238,000 in the twelve month period ended December 31, 2013.\nNon-Interest Expenses\nIn 2014, noninterest expenses increased by $139,000, or 0.3%, compared to 2013. A explanation of changes in noninterest expenses for certain categories is presented in the following paragraphs.\nSalary expenses and employee benefits in 2014 were $20.1 million, an increase of $3.0 million, or 17.7%, compared to 2013 primarily driven by annual merit increases along with increased staffing levels related to our growth strategy of adding and relocating stores.\nOccupancy related expenses increased by $889,000, or 15.5%, in 2014 compared to 2013, also as a result of the growth and relocation strategy.\nOther real estate owned expenses totaled $1.8 million during 2014, a decrease of $1.4 million, or 43.6%, when compared to 2013 primarily due to lower writedowns in 2014 on assets held in the other real estate owned category.\nAs previously mentioned, we settled a legal matter totaling $1.9 million in 2013. This one-time charge of $1.9 million in 2013 was related to litigation in which the Company was a defendant. In addition, we had a decrease of $588,000 in legal expenses. Other minor decreases in regulatory assessments, insurance, and other operating expenses were offset by increases in data processing, advertising, professional fees, and other taxes for the twelve months of 2014 versus the same period last year.\nOne key measure that management utilizes to monitor progress in controlling overhead expenses is the ratio of annualized net noninterest expenses to average assets. For purposes of this calculation, net noninterest expenses equal noninterest expenses less noninterest income and nonrecurring expense. For the twelve month period ended December 31, 2014, the ratio equaled 3.05% compared to 3.09% for the twelve month period ended December 31, 2013, respectively, reflecting higher average assets related to the Company's growth strategy of adding and relocating stores.\nAnother productivity measure utilized by management is the operating efficiency ratio. This ratio expresses the relationship of noninterest expenses to net interest income plus noninterest income. The efficiency ratio equaled 92.5% for the twelve months of 2014, compared to 96.6% for the twelve months of 2013. The decrease for the twelve months ended December 31, 2014 versus December 31, 2013 was due to a 4.8% increase in total revenues.\nProvision (Benefit) for Income Taxes\nWe recorded a benefit for income taxes of $46,000 for the twelve months ended December 31, 2014, compared to a $35,000 benefit for the twelve months ended December 31, 2013. The $46,000 benefit recorded during the twelve months of 2014 was the net result of an estimated tax provision in the amount of $633,000 calculated on the net profit generated during the period using our normal estimated tax rate, offset by an adjustment to the deferred tax asset valuation allowance in the amount of $679,000. The effective tax rates for the twelve month periods ended December 31, 2014 and 2013 were 26% and (42%), respectively, excluding an adjustment to the deferred tax asset valuation allowance.\nWe evaluate the carrying amount of its deferred tax assets on a quarterly basis or more frequently, if necessary, in accordance with the guidance provided in Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Accounting Standards Codification Topic 740 (ASC 740), in particular, applying the criteria set forth therein to determine whether it is more likely than not (i.e. a likelihood of more than 50%) that some portion, or all, of the deferred tax asset will not be realized within its life cycle, based on the weight of available evidence. If management makes a determination based on the available evidence that it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized in future periods, a valuation allowance is calculated and recorded. These determinations are inherently subjective and dependent upon estimates and judgments concerning management's evaluation of both positive and negative evidence.\nIn conducting the deferred tax asset analysis, we believe it is important to consider the unique characteristics of an industry or business. In particular, characteristics such as business model, level of capital and reserves held by financial institutions and their ability to absorb potential losses are important distinctions to be considered for bank holding companies like the Company. In addition, it is also important to consider that net operating loss carryforwards (\"NOLs\") for federal income tax purposes can generally be carried back two years and carried forward for a period of twenty years. In order to realize our deferred tax assets, we must generate sufficient taxable income in such future years.\nIn assessing the need for a valuation allowance, we carefully weighed both positive and negative evidence currently available. Judgment is required when considering the relative impact of such evidence. The weight given to the potential effect of positive and negative evidence must be commensurate with the extent to which it can be objectively verified. A cumulative loss in recent years is a significant piece of negative evidence that is difficult to overcome.\nWhen calculating an estimate for a valuation allowance, we assessed the possible sources of taxable income available under tax law to realize a tax benefit for deductible temporary differences and carry forwards as defined in ASC 740. As a result of cumulative losses in recent years and the slow, ongoing recovery in the current economic environment, we did not use projections of future taxable income as a factor. We will exclude future taxable income as a factor until we can show consistent and sustainable profitability. Based on the analysis of available positive and negative evidence, we determined that a valuation allowance should be recorded as of December 31, 2014 and December 31, 2013.\nWe did assess tax planning strategies as defined under ASC 740 to determine the amount of a valuation allowance. Strategies reviewed included the sale of investment securities and loans with fair values greater than book values, redeployment of cash and cash equivalents into higher yielding investment options, a switch from tax-exempt to taxable investments and loans, and the election of a decelerated depreciation method for tax purposes on future fixed asset purchases. We believe that these tax planning strategies are (a) prudent and feasible, (b) steps that we would not ordinarily take, but would take to prevent an operating loss or tax credit carryforward from expiring unused, and (c) would result in the realization of existing deferred tax assets. These tax planning strategies, if implemented, would result in taxable income in the first full reporting period after deployment and accelerate the recovery of deferred tax asset balances if faced with the inability to recover those assets or the risk of potential expiration. We believe that these are viable tax planning strategies and appropriately considered in the analysis at this time, but may not align with the strategic direction of the organization today and therefore, has no present intention to implement such strategies.\nThe net deferred tax asset balance before consideration of a valuation allowance was $19.6 million as of December 31, 2014 and $21.4 million as of December 31, 2013. After assessment of all available tax planning strategies, we determined that a partial valuation allowance in the amount of $14.7 million as of December 31, 2014 and $15.3 million as of December 31, 2013 should be recorded.\nThe deferred tax asset will continue to be analyzed on a quarterly basis for changes affecting realizability. When the determination is made to include projections of future taxable income as a factor in recovering the deferred tax asset, the valuation allowance will be reduced accordingly resulting in a corresponding increase in net income.\nNet Income and Net Income per Common Share\nNet income for the twelve month period ended December 31, 2014 was $2.4 million, an increase of $5.9 million, compared to a $3.5 million net loss recorded for the twelve month period ended December 31, 2013. The higher net income in 2014 was due to a $4.0 million decrease in the provision for loan losses, a $3.2 million increase in net interest income, partially offset by a $1.2 million decrease in noninterest income and a $139,000 increase in noninterest expenses.\nFor the twelve month period ended December 31, 2014, basic and fully-diluted net income per common share was $0.07 compared to basic and fully-diluted net loss per common share of $(0.13) for the twelve month period ended December 31, 2013.\nReturn on Average Assets and Average Equity\nReturn on average assets (ROA) measures our net income in relation to our total average assets. The ROA for the twelve month periods ended December 31, 2014 and 2013 was 0.23% and (0.37)%, respectively. Return on average equity (ROE) indicates how effectively we can generate net income on the capital invested by our stockholders. ROE is calculated by dividing annualized net income by average stockholders' equity. The ROE for the twelve month period ended December 31, 2014 was 2.51%, compared to (5.07)% for the twelve month period ended December 31, 2013.\nFinancial Condition\nDecember 31, 2015 compared to December 31, 2014\nTotal assets increased by $224.8 million to $1.4 billion at December 31, 2015, compared to $1.2 billion at December 31, 2014.\nCash and Cash Equivalents\nCash and due from banks and interest bearing deposits comprise this category, which consists of our most liquid assets. The aggregate amount in these two categories decreased by $101.7 million to $27.1 million at December 31, 2015, from $128.8 million at December 31, 2014. The decrease was primarily caused by an increase in investment securities purchases and outstanding loans receivable.\nLoans Held for Sale\nLoans held for sale are comprised of loans guaranteed by the U.S. Small Business Administration (\"SBA\") which we usually originate with the intention of selling in the future. Total SBA loans held for sale were $3.7 million at December 31, 2015 compared to $1.7 million at December 31, 2014. Loans held for sale, as a percentage of our total assets, were less than 1% at December 31, 2015.\nLoans Receivable\nThe loan portfolio represents our largest asset category and is our most significant source of interest income. Our lending strategy is focused on small and medium sized businesses and professionals that seek highly personalized banking services. The loan portfolio consists of secured and unsecured commercial loans including commercial real estate, construction loans, residential mortgages, home improvement loans, home equity loans and lines of credit, overdraft lines of credit, and others. Commercial loans typically range between $250,000 and $5,000,000 but customers may borrow significantly larger amounts up to our legal lending limit to a customer, which was approximately $20.6 million at December 31, 2015. Loans made to one individual customer, even if secured by different collateral, are aggregated for purposes of the lending limit. There were no loans in excess of the legal lending limit at December 31, 2015. A $13.7 million threshold, which amounts to approximately 10% of total regulatory capital, reflects an additional internal monitoring guideline. There were no such relationships in excess of $13.7 million at December 31, 2015.\nLoans increased $92.8 million, or 12%, to $874.8 million at December 31, 2015, versus $781.9 million at December 31, 2014. This growth was the result of an increase in loan demand in the owner occupied real estate, commercial and industrial, construction and development, and consumer categories driven by the successful execution of our relationship banking strategy which focuses on customer service.\nInvestment Securities\nInvestment securities considered available-for-sale are investments that may be sold in response to changing market and interest rate conditions, and for liquidity and other purposes. Our investment securities classified as available-for-sale consist primarily of U.S. Government agency collateralized mortgage obligations (CMO), agency mortgage-backed securities (MBS), municipal securities, corporate bonds, asset-backed securities (ABS), and pooled trust preferred securities (CDO). Available-for-sale securities totaled $284.8 million at December 31, 2015, compared to $185.4 million at December 31, 2014. The increase was primarily due to the purchase of available-for-sale securities totaling $146.7 million partially offset by sales and pay downs of securities totaling $42.9 million during 2015. At December 31, 2015, the portfolio had a net unrealized loss of $4.0 million compared to a net unrealized gain of $129,000 at December 31, 2014. The change in value of the investment portfolio was driven by an increase in market interest rates which drove a decrease in value of the bonds held in our portfolio during 2015.\nInvestment securities held-to-maturity are investments for which there is the intent and ability to hold the investment to maturity. These investments are carried at amortized cost. The held-to-maturity portfolio consists primarily of U.S. Government agency Small Business Investment Company bonds (SBIC), CMO's and MBS's. The fair value of securities held-to-maturity totaled $171.8 million and $68.3 million at December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014, respectively. The increase was due to the purchase of $121.4 million of held-to-maturity securities partially offset by pay downs of securities totaling $16.7 million during 2015.\nRestricted Stock\nRestricted stock, which represents a required investment in the capital stock of correspondent banks related to available credit facilities, is carried at cost as of December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014. As of those dates, restricted stock consisted of investments in the capital stock of the Federal Home Loan Bank of Pittsburgh (\"FHLB\") and Atlantic Community Bankers Bank (\"ACBB\").\nAt December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014, the investment in FHLB stock totaled $2.9 million and $1.0 million, respectively. The increase was due to a short-term borrowing from FHLB. At both December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014, ACBB stock totaled $143,000.\nOther Real Estate Owned\nThe balance of other real estate owned increased to $11.3 million at December 31, 2015 from $3.7 million at December 31, 2014, primarily due to transfers from loan receivable totaling $11.5 million, partially offset by writedowns in the amount of $3.1 million on existing foreclosed properties and sales totaling $792,000 during 2015. The increase in other real estate owned was primarily driven by a single asset in the amount of $7.7 million that transferred from loans receivable during 2015. A write-down of $2.2 million was recorded in the fourth quarter of 2015 as a result of our decision to aggressively market and pursue a sale of the largest non-performing asset on the balance sheet at year end.\nDeposits\nDeposits, which include non-interest and interest-bearing demand deposits, money market, savings and time deposits, are Republic's major source of funding. Deposits are generally solicited from the Company's market area through the offering of a variety of products to attract and retain customers, with a primary focus on multi-product relationships.\nTotal deposits increased by $177.1 million to $1.2 billion at December 31, 2014, from $1.1 billion at December 31, 2014. The increase was primarily the result of a $117.2 million increase in demand deposits and a $67.7 million increase in money market and savings deposits, which reflects the success of our retail-focused strategy of gathering low-cost core deposits. We will continue to focus our efforts on the growth of deposit balances through the successful execution of our relationship banking model which is based upon a high level of customer service and satisfaction. We are also in the midst of an aggressive expansion and relocation plan which we refer to as \"The Power of Red is Back.\" Over the last two years we have opened five new store locations and have several more in various stages of construction and development. This strategy has also allowed us to nearly eliminate our dependence upon the more volatile sources of funding found in brokered and public fund certificates of deposit.\nShort-term Borrowings\nAs of December 31, 2015, there were $47.0 million in short-term borrowings from FHLB compared to $0 at December 31, 2014. The increase in borrowings was the result of a temporary outflow of deposits at year end which returned in the early part of 2016.\nShareholders' Equity\nTotal shareholders' equity increased $564,000 to $113.4 million at December 31, 2015, compared to $112.8 million at December 31, 2014, primarily due to the recognition of net income of $2.4 million during 2015 and the issuance of stock based compensation in the amount of $600,000 offset by an increase in accumulated other comprehensive losses associated with unrealized losses in the investment securities portfolio resulting in a decrease of $2.5 million. The shift in market value of the securities portfolio resulted in accumulated other comprehensive losses of $3.2 million at December 31, 2015 compared to accumulated other comprehensive losses of $632,000 at December 31, 2014. This was primarily driven by an increase in market interest rates which drove a decrease in value of the bonds held in our portfolio during 2015.\nInvestment Securities Portfolio\nRepublic's investment securities portfolio is intended to provide liquidity and contribute to earnings while diversifying credit risk. We attempt to maximize earnings while minimizing our exposure to interest rate risk. The securities portfolio consists primarily of U.S. Government agency collateralized mortgage obligations (CMO), agency mortgage-backed securities (MBS), corporate bonds, municipal securities, asset-backed securities (ABS), pooled trust preferred securities (CDO), and U.S. Government agency Small Business Investment Company bonds (SBIC). Our ALCO committee monitors and reviews all security purchases.\nA summary of investment securities available-for-sale and investment securities held-to-maturity at December 31, 2015, 2014, and 2013 is as follows:\nTable 42: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>At December 31, </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (dollars in thousands)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Available for sale\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Collateralized mortgage obligations\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 180,795\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 98,626\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 127,242\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Agency mortgage-backed securities\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 10,073\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 13,271\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 15,669\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Municipal securities\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 22,814\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 15,784\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 9,737\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Corporate bonds\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 54,294\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 33,840\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 32,174\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Asset-backed securities\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 17,631\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 18,353\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 19,089\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Trust preferred securities\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 3,070\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 5,261\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 5,277\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other securities\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total amortized cost of securities\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 288,792\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 185,250\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 209,303\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total fair value of investment securities\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 284,795\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 185,379\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 204,891\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Held to maturity\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> U.S. Government agencies\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 17,067\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Collateralized mortgage obligations\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 146,458\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 67,845\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> -\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Agency mortgage-backed securities\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 7,732\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> -\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> -\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other securities\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 1,020\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total amortized cost of securities\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 172,277\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 67,866\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total fair value of investment securities\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 171,845\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 68,253\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe strong growth in deposit balances during 2015 and 2014 has resulted in a corresponding increase in interest earning assets. The total amortized cost of the investment securities portfolio has grown to $461.1 million at December 31, 2015 compared to $253.1 million at December 31, 2014 and $209.3 million at December 31, 2013. Investment securities represented 32% of total assets at December 31, 2015 and 21% of total assets at December 31, 2014. We evaluate our investment securities portfolio on a continual basis in light of the interest rate environment and changing market conditions and when appropriate, take necessary actions to improve and enhance our overall positioning. We consider the portfolio to be well structured and of high quality. At December 31, 2015, 83% of the portfolio consisted of U.S. government agency securities which were rated Aaa/AA by the major credit rating agencies.\nThe investment securities portfolio includes securities classified as both available for sale and held to maturity. During 2015 and 2014 we began to designate a portion of our securities portfolio as held to maturity based our intent and ability to hold those securities until they mature.\nThe fair value of investment securities is impacted by interest rates, credit spreads, market volatility and liquidity conditions. The fair value of investment securities generally decreases when interest rates rise and increases when interest rates fall. In addition, the fair value generally decreases when credit spreads widen and increases when credit spreads tighten. Net unrealized losses in the total investment securities portfolio increased to $4.4 million at December 31, 2015 compared to unrealized gains of $0.5 million at December 31, 2014. The comparable amounts for the securities classified as available for sale were unrealized losses of $4.0 million at December 31, 2015 and unrealized gains of $0.1 million at December 31, 2014.\nNo single issuer of securities (excluding government agencies) in the portfolio exceeded more than 10% of shareholders' equity at December 31, 2015 with the exception of corporate bonds issued by Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley. The Goldman Sachs bonds had a book value of $18.0 million and a market value of $17.9 million. The Morgan Stanley bonds had a book value of $15.0 million and a market value of $15.1 million at December 31, 2015. No single issuer of securities (excluding government agencies) in the portfolio exceeded more than 10% of shareholders' equity at December 31, 2014 with the exception of corporate bonds issued by Morgan Stanley. The Morgan Stanley bonds had a book value of $12.0 million and a market value of $12.2 million at December 31, 2014.\nAt December 31, 2015, the investment portfolio included thirty-eight municipal securities with a total market value of $23.3 million. These securities are reviewed quarterly for impairment. Research on each issuer is completed to assess the financial stability of the municipal entity. The largest geographic concentration was in Pennsylvania and New Jersey where thirty-one municipal securities had a market value of $18.8 million. As of December 31, 2015, management found no evidence of other than temporary impairment (\"OTTI\") on any of the municipal securities held in the investment securities portfolio.\nAt December 31, 2015, the portfolio included two asset-backed securities with a total market value of $17.0 million, the majority of which (97%) is guaranteed by the U.S. Dept. of Education, which were in an unrealized loss position. Management believes the unrealized losses on these securities were driven by market interest rates and not a result of any credit deterioration.\nAt December 31, 2015, the portfolio also included three pooled trust preferred securities (CDOs) with a market value of $1.9 million. The unrealized loss for the CDOs was due to the secondary market for such securities becoming inactive and is considered temporary.\nDuring 2015, the Company sold four CDO securities. Proceeds from the sale of the CDO securities totaled $2.0 million. Gross gains of $70,000 and gross losses of $288,000 were realized on these sales. The tax provision applicable to the net losses for the twelve months ended December 31, 2015 amounted to $78,000. Management had previously stated that it did not intend to sell the CDO securities prior to their maturity or the recovery of their cost bases, nor would it be forced to sell these securities prior to maturity or recovery of the cost bases. This statement was made over a period of several years where there was limited trading activity in the pooled trust preferred CDO market resulting in fair market value estimates well below the book values. During 2015, management received several inquiries regarding the availability of the CDO securities and noted an increased level of trading in this type of security. As a result of the increased activity and the level of bids received, management elected to sell the four CDOs resulting in a net loss of $218,000 during 2015 which was offset by gains on sales of agency mortgage- backed securities and corporate bonds. The Bank continues to demonstrate the ability and intent to hold the remaining CDOs until maturity or recovery of the cost bases, but will evaluate future opportunities to sell the remaining CDOs if they arise.\nDuring 2015, the Company also sold twenty-nine agency mortgage-backed securities and two corporate bonds. Proceeds of sales totaled $9.7 million. Gross gains of $326,000 were realized on these sales. The tax provision applicable to the gross gains amounted to $117,000.\nThe following table presents the maturity distribution and weighted average yield by holding type and year of maturity of our investment securities portfolio at December 31, 2015. Collateralized mortgage obligations and agency mortgage-backed securities have expected maturities that differ from contractual maturities because borrowers have the right to call or prepay and, therefore, these securities are classified separately with no specific maturity date.\nTable 43: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> December 31, 2015\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td>

financial instruments; however, there are inherent weaknesses in any estimation technique. Therefore, for substantially all financial instruments, the fair value estimates herein are not necessarily indicative of the amounts the Company could have realized in a sale transaction on the dates indicated. The estimated fair value amounts have been measured as of their respective year-ends and have not been re-evaluated or updated for purposes of these financial statements subsequent to those respective dates. As such, the estimated fair values of these financial instruments subsequent to the respective reporting dates may be different than the amounts reported at each year-end.\nThe Company follows the guidance issued under ASC 820, Fair Value Measurement, which defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value under GAAP, and identifies required disclosures on fair value measurements.\nASC 820 establishes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to valuation methods used to measure fair value. The hierarchy gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1 measurements) and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs (Level 3 measurements). The three levels of the fair value hierarchy under ASC 820 are as follows:\nLevel 1: Unadjusted quoted prices in active markets that are accessible at the measurement date for identical, unrestricted assets or liabilities.\nLevel 2: Quoted prices in markets that are not active, or inputs that are observable either directly or indirectly, for substantially the full term of the asset or liability.\nLevel 3: Prices or valuation techniques that require inputs that are both significant to the fair value measurement and unobservable (i.e., supported with little or no market activity).\nAn asset's or liability's level within the fair value hierarchy is based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement.\nThe fair value of securities available for sale (carried at fair value) and held to maturity (carried at amortized cost) are determined by obtaining quoted market prices on nationally recognized securities exchanges (Level 1), or matrix pricing (Level 2), which is a mathematical technique used widely in the industry to value debt securities without relying exclusively on quoted market prices for the specific securities but rather by relying on the securities' relationship to other benchmark quoted prices. For certain securities, which are not traded in active markets or are subject to transfer restrictions, valuations are adjusted to reflect illiquidity and/or non-transferability, and such adjustments are generally based on available market evidence (Level 3). In the absence of such evidence, management's best estimate is used. Management's best estimate consists of both internal and external support on certain Level 3 investments. Internal cash flow models using a present value formula that includes assumptions market participants would use along with indicative exit pricing obtained from broker/dealers (where available) were used to support fair values of certain Level 3 investments.\nThe types of instruments valued on matrix pricing in active markets include all of the U.S. government and agency securities, municipal obligations and corporate bonds. Such instruments are generally classified within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy. As required by ASC 820, we do not adjust the matrix pricing for such instruments.\nLevel 3 is for positions that are not traded in active markets or are subject to transfer restrictions, and may be adjusted to reflect illiquidity and/or non-transferability, with such adjustment generally based on available market evidence. In the absence of such evidence, management's best estimate is used. Subsequent to inception, management only changes Level 3 inputs and assumptions when corroborated by evidence such as transactions in similar instruments, completed or pending third-party transactions in the underlying investment or comparable entities, subsequent rounds of financing, recapitalizations and other transactions across the capital structure, offerings in the equity or debt markets, and changes in financial ratios or cash flows. The Level 3 investment securities currently held in the Company's portfolio are classified as available for sale and consist of various issues of trust preferred securities and a single corporate bond.\nThe trust preferred securities are pools of similar securities that are grouped into an asset structure commonly referred to as collateralized debt obligations (\"CDOs\") which consist of the debt instruments of various banks, diversified by the number of participants in the security as well as geographically. These securities are performing according to terms, however the secondary market for such securities had become inactive for several years, and were therefore classified as Level 3 securities. The fair value analysis does not reflect or represent the actual terms or prices at which any party could purchase the securities.\nThe following table presents a reconciliation of the securities available for sale measured at fair value on a recurring basis using significant unobservable inputs (Level 3) for the year ended December 31, 2015, 2014, and 2013:\nTable 44: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Year Ended\nDecember 31, 2015\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Year Ended\nDecember 31, 2014\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Year Ended\nDecember 31, 2013\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Level 3 Investments Only\n(dollars in thousands)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> Trust\nPreferred Securities\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Corporate\nBonds\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Trust\nPreferred Securities\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Corporate\nBonds\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Trust\nPreferred Securities\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Corporate\nBonds\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Balance, January 1,\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 3,193\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 3,005\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 2,850\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 3,006\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 3,187\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 3,007\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Security transferred to Level 3 measurement\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> -\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> -\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> -\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> -\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> -\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> -\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Unrealized gains (losses)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (171\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (1\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (1\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Paydowns\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (19\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> -\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (10\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> -\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (508\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> -\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Proceeds from sales\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (1,952\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> -\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> -\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> -\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> -\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> -\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Realized losses\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (218\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> -\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> -\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> -\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> -\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> -\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Impairment charges on Level 3\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (3\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> -\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (7\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> -\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> -\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> -\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Balance, December 31,\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,883\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 2,834\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 3,193\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 3,005\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 2,850\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 3,006\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nAn independent, third party pricing service is used to estimate the current fair market value of each CDO held in the investment securities portfolio. The calculations used to determine fair value are based on the attributes of the trust preferred securities, the financial condition of the issuers of the trust preferred securities, and market based assumptions. The INTEX CDO Deal Model Library was utilized to obtain information regarding the attributes of each security and its specific collateral as of December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014. Financial information on the issuers was also obtained from Bloomberg, the FDIC and SNL Financial. Both published and unpublished industry sources were utilized in estimating fair value. Such information includes loan prepayment speed assumptions, discount rates, default rates, and loss severity percentages. A detailed explanation of the assumptions used to estimate the fair market value of the CDOs can be found in Note 14 \"Fair Value Measurements and Fair Values of Financial Investments\" to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nThe fair market valuation for each CDO was determined based on discounted cash flow analyses. The cash flows are primarily dependent on the estimated speeds at which the trust preferred securities are expected to prepay, the estimated rates at which the trust preferred securities are expected to defer payments, the estimated rates at which the trust preferred securities are expected to default, and the severity of the losses on securities that do default.\nIncreases (decreases) in actual or expected issuer defaults tend to decrease (increase) the fair value of the Company's senior and mezzanine tranches of CDOs. The values of the Company's mezzanine tranches of CDOs are also affected by expected future interest rates. However, due to the structure of each security, timing of cash flows, and secondary effects on the financial performance of the underlying issuers, the effects of changes in future interest rates on the fair value of the Company's holdings are not quantifiably estimable.\nAlso included in Level 3 investment securities classified as available for sale is one corporate bond transferred from Level 2 in 2010 since the bond is not actively traded. Impairment would depend on the repayment ability of the underlying issuer, which is assessed through a detailed quarterly review of the issuer's financial statements. The issuer is a \"well capitalized\" financial institution as defined by federal banking regulations and has demonstrated the ability to raise additional capital, when necessary, through the public capital markets. The fair value of this corporate bond is estimated by obtaining a price of a comparable floating rate debt instrument through Bloomberg.\nLoan Portfolio\nOur loan portfolio consists of secured and unsecured commercial loans including commercial real estate loans, construction and land development loans, commercial and industrial loans, owner occupied real estate loans, consumer and other loans, and residential mortgages. Commercial loans are primarily secured term loans made to small to medium-sized businesses and professionals for working capital, asset acquisition and other purposes. Commercial loans are originated as either fixed or variable rate loans with typical terms of 1 to 5 years. Republic's commercial loans typically range between $250,000 and $5.0 million, but customers may borrow significantly larger amounts up to Republic's legal lending limit of approximately $20.6 million at December 31, 2015. Management has established an internal monitoring guideline for loan relationships in the amount of $13.7 million which approximates 10% of capital and reserves. Individual customers may have several loans often secured by different collateral. There were no such relationships in excess of the legal lending limit or the internal monitoring guideline of $13.7 million at December 31, 2015.\nThe majority of loans outstanding are with borrowers in our marketplace, Philadelphia and surrounding suburbs, including southern New Jersey. In addition, we have loans to customers whose assets and businesses are concentrated in real estate. Repayment of our loans is in part dependent upon general economic conditions affecting our market place and specific industries. We evaluate each customer's credit worthiness on a case-by-case basis. The amount of collateral obtained is based on management's credit evaluation of the customer. Collateral varies but primarily includes residential, commercial and income-producing properties.\nAt December 31, 2015, we had loan concentrations exceeding 10% of total loans for credits extended to lessors of nonresidential real estate in the aggregate amount of $206.3 million, which represented 23.6% of gross loans receivable and lessors of residential real estate in the aggregate amount of $120.0 million, which represented 13.7% of gross loans receivable. Loan concentrations are considered to exist when amounts are loaned to multiple numbers of borrowers engaged in similar activities that management believes would cause them to be similarly impacted by economic or other conditions. At December 31, 2015, we had no foreign loans outstanding.\nThe following table sets forth gross loans by major categories for the periods indicated:\nTable 45: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> At December 31,\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (dollars in thousands)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Commercial real estate\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 349,726\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 379,259\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 342,794\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 335,561\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 344,377\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Construction and land development\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 46,547\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 29,861\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 23,977\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 26,659\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 35,061\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Commercial and industrial\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 181,850\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 145,113\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 118,209\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 103,768\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 87,668\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Owner occupied real estate\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 246,398\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 188,025\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 160,229\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 126,242\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 102,777\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Consumer and other\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 48,126\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 39,713\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 31,981\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 23,449\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 16,683\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Residential mortgage\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 2,380\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 2,359\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 2,442\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 3,150\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total loans\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 875,027\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 782,379\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 679,549\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 618,121\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 589,716\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Deferred loan fees\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total loans, net of deferred loan fees\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 874,769\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 781,940\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 679,311\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 617,901\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 589,492\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTotal loans, net of deferred loan fees, increased $92.8 million, or 12%, to $874.8 million at December 31, 2015, versus $781.9 million at December 31, 2014. This growth was the result of an increase in loan demand in the owner occupied real estate, commercial and industrial, construction and development, and consumer categories driven by the successful execution of our relationship banking strategy which focuses on customer service. Our largest loan category, commercial real estate, decreased by $29.5 million from $379.3 million at December 31, 2014 to $349.7 million at December 31, 2015. Net transfers to other loan categories as a result of periodic quality control reviews amounted to $14.6 million in 2015. In addition, a total of $10.1 million was transferred to other real estate owned in 2015.\nLoan Maturity and Interest Rate Sensitivity\nThe amount of loans outstanding by category as of the dates indicated, which are due in: (i) one year or less, (ii) more than one year through five years, and (iii) over five years, is shown in the following table.

course of business, loans maturing within one year may be renewed, in whole or in part, as to principal amount, and at interest rates prevailing at the date of renewal. At December 31, 2015, 71.9% of total loans were fixed rate compared to 68.0% at December 31, 2014.\nCredit Quality\nRepublic's written lending policies require specific underwriting, loan documentation and credit analysis standards to be met prior to funding, with independent credit department approval for the majority of new loan balances. A committee consisting of senior management and certain members of the Board of Directors oversees the loan approval process to monitor that proper standards are maintained, while approving the majority of commercial loans.\nLoans, including impaired loans, are generally classified as non-accrual if they are past due as to maturity or payment of interest or principal for a period of more than 90 days, unless such loans are well-secured and in the process of collection. Loans that are on a current payment status or past due less than 90 days may also be classified as non-accrual if repayment of principal and/or interest in full is in doubt. Loans may be returned to accrual status when all principal and interest amounts contractually due are reasonably assured of repayment within an acceptable period of time, and there is a sustained period of repayment performance by the borrower, in accordance with the contractual terms.\nWhile a loan is classified as non-accrual, any collections of interest and principal are generally applied as a reduction to principal outstanding. When the future collectability of the recorded loan balance is expected, interest income may be recognized on a cash basis. For non-accrual loans, which have been partially charged off, recognition of interest on a cash basis is limited to that which would have been recognized on the recorded loan balance at the contractual interest rate. Cash interest receipts in excess of that amount are recorded as recoveries to the allowance for loan losses until prior charge-offs have been fully recovered.\nThe following summary shows information

At December 31, 2015, all identified problem loans included in the preceding table are internally classified and have been evaluated for a specific reserve allocation in the allowance for loan losses (see discussion on \"Allowance for Loan Losses\").\nNon-performing assets decreased by $1.2 million, or 5%, to $23.9 million at December 31, 2015, compared to $25.2 million at December 31, 2014. This decrease was primarily due to a combination of loan paydowns, OREO sales, loan charge-offs, and OREO writedowns totaling $9.4 million which were offset by transfers of $8.2 million from performing to non-performing assets during 2015.\nThe following summary shows the impact on interest income of non-accrual loans, subsequent to being placed on non-accrual for the periods indicated:\nTable 48: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> For the Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Interest income that would have been recorded had the loans been in accordance with their original terms\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 765,000\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 980,000\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 488,000\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 699,000\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 583,000\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nInterest income included in net income\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nAllowance for Loan Losses\nThe allowance for loan losses is a valuation allowance for probable losses inherent in the loan portfolio. The Company evaluates the need to establish an allowance against loan losses on a quarterly basis. When an increase in this allowance is necessary, a provision for loan losses is charged to earnings. The allowance for loan losses consists of three components. The first component is allocated to individually evaluated loans found to be impaired and is calculated in accordance with ASC 310 Receivables. The second component is allocated to all other loans that are not individually identified as impaired pursuant to ASC 310-10 (\"non-impaired loans\"). This component is calculated for all non-impaired loans on a collective basis in accordance with ASC 450 Contingencies. The third component is an unallocated allowance to account for a level of imprecision in management's estimation process.\nThe Company evaluates loans for impairment and potential charge-off on a quarterly basis. Management regularly monitors the condition of borrowers and assesses both internal and external factors in determining whether any loan relationships have deteriorated. Any loan rated as substandard or lower will have an individual collateral evaluation analysis prepared to determine if a deficiency exists. We first evaluate the primary repayment source. If the primary repayment source is determined to be insufficient and unlikely to repay the debt, we then look to the secondary repayment sources. Secondary sources are conservatively reviewed for liquidation values. Updated appraisals and financial data are obtained to substantiate current values. If the reviewed sources are deemed to be inadequate to cover the outstanding principal and any costs associated with the resolution of the troubled loan, an estimate of the deficient amount will be calculated and a specific allocation of loan loss reserve is recorded.\nFactors considered in the calculation of the allowance for non-impaired loans include several qualitative and quantitative factors such as historical loss experience, trends in delinquency and nonperforming loan balances, changes in risk composition and underwriting standards, experience and ability of management, and general economic conditions along with other external factors. Historical loss experience is analyzed by reviewing charge-offs over a three year period to determine loss rates consistent with the loan categories depicted in the allowance for loan loss table below.\nThe factors supporting the allowance for loan losses do not diminish the fact that the entire allowance for loan losses is available to absorb losses in the loan portfolio and related commitment portfolio, respectively. The Company's principal focus, therefore, is on the adequacy of the total allowance for loan losses. The allowance for loan losses is subject to review by banking regulators. The Company's primary bank regulators regularly conduct examinations of the allowance for loan losses and make assessments regarding the adequacy and the methodology employed in their

allowance for loan losses to a level that management believes is adequate to absorb inherent losses in the loan portfolio. The Company recorded a loan loss provision in the amount of $500,000 in 2015 compared to a $900,000 provision in 2014. Non-performing loans decreased by $8.8 million, or 41%, to $12.6 million at December 31, 2015, compared to $21.4 million at December 31, 2014. Impaired loans also decreased to $22.1 million at December 31, 2015 from $35.6 million at December 31, 2014. An increase in the allowance required for loans collectively evaluated for impairment driven by growth in the loan portfolio was offset by a reduction associated with an improvement in the factor used for historical loss experience during 2015.\nThe allowance for loan losses as a percentage of non-performing loans (coverage ratio) was 69.0% at December 31, 2015 as compared to 53.8% at December 31, 2014 and 117.7% at December 31, 2013. The decrease in the coverage ratio at December 31, 2015 when compared to December 31, 2014 was primarily the result of a decrease in non-performing loans during 2015. This decrease was primarily driven by our largest non-performing loan that transferred to OREO in the second quarter 2015. A reserve for this loan was recorded during the fourth quarter of 2013 when it was initially downgraded. Coverage is considered adequate by management as of December 31, 2015.\nManagement makes at least a quarterly determination as to an appropriate provision from earnings to maintain an allowance for loan losses that it determines is adequate to absorb inherent losses in the loan portfolio. The Board of Directors periodically reviews the status of all non-accrual and impaired loans and loans classified by the management team. The Board of Directors also considers specific loans, pools of similar loans, historical charge-off activity, economic conditions and other relevant factors in reviewing the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses. Any additions deemed necessary to the allowance for loan losses are charged to operating expenses.\nThe Company evaluates loans for impairment and potential charge-offs on a quarterly basis. Any loan rated as substandard or lower will have a collateral evaluation analysis completed in accordance with the guidance under generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) on impaired loans to determine if a deficiency exists. Our credit monitoring process assesses the ultimate collectability of an outstanding loan balance from all potential sources. When a loan is determined to be uncollectible it is charged-off against the allowance for loan losses. Unsecured commercial loans and all consumer loans are charged-off immediately upon reaching the 90-day delinquency mark unless they are well secured and in the process of collection. The timing on charge-offs of all other loan types is subjective and will be recognized when management determines that full repayment, either from the cash flow of the borrower, collateral sources, and/or guarantors, will not be sufficient and that repayment is unlikely. A full or partial charge-off is recognized equal to the amount of the estimated deficiency calculation.\nSerious delinquency is often the first indicator of a potential charge-off. Reductions in appraised collateral values and deteriorating financial condition of borrowers and guarantors are factors considered when evaluating potential charge-offs. The likelihood of possible recoveries or improvements in a borrower's financial condition is also assessed when considering a charge-off.\nPartial charge-offs of non-performing and impaired loans can significantly reduce the coverage ratio and other credit loss statistics due to the fact that the balance of the allowance for loan losses will be reduced while still carrying the remainder of a non-performing loan balance in the impaired loan category. The amount of non-performing loans for which there were partial charge-offs during the year amounted to $3.4 million at December 31, 2015 compared to $17.8 million at December 31, 2014. This decrease was primarily driven by our largest non-performing loan that transferred to OREO in the second quarter 2015.\nThe Company's charge-off policy is reviewed on an annual basis and updated as necessary. During the twelve months ended December 31, 2015, there have been no changes made to this policy.\nWe have an existing loan review program, which monitors the loan portfolio on an ongoing basis. A loan review officer who reviews both the loan portfolio and overall adequacy of the allowance for loan losses conducts this loan review on a quarterly basis and reports directly to the Board of Directors.\nEstimating the appropriate level of the allowance for loan losses at any given date is difficult, particularly in a continually changing economy. In management's opinion, the allowance for loan losses was appropriate at December 31, 2015. However, there can be no assurance that, if asset quality deteriorates in future periods, additions to the allowance for loan losses will not be required.\nManagement is unable to determine in which loan category future charge-offs and recoveries may occur. The following schedule sets forth the allocation of the allowance for loan losses among various categories. The allocation is based on management's evaluation of historical charge-off experience and adjusted for several qualitative factors. The entire allowance for loan losses is available to absorb loan losses in any loan category.\nThe allocation of the allowance for loan losses for the past five years is as follows:\nTable 50: <table>

unfunded loan commitments. Because the allowance for loan losses is dependent, to a great extent, on the general economy and other conditions that may be beyond our control, the estimate of the allowance for loan losses could differ materially in the near term.\nThe allowance consists of specific, general and unallocated components. The specific component relates to impaired loans. For such loans, an allowance is established when the discounted cash flows, collateral value, or observable market price of the impaired loan is lower than the carrying value of that loan. The general component covers the remainder of the portfolio and is based on historical loss experience adjusted for several qualitative factors. An unallocated component is maintained to cover uncertainties that could affect management's estimate of probable losses. The unallocated component of the allowance reflects the margin of imprecision inherent in the underlying assumptions used in the methodologies for estimating specific and general losses in the portfolio. All identified losses are immediately charged off and therefore no portion of the allowance for loan losses is restricted to any individual loan or group of loans, and the entire allowance is available to absorb any and all loan losses.\nIn estimating the allowance for loan losses, management considers current economic conditions, past loss experience, diversification of the loan portfolio, delinquency statistics, results of internal loan reviews and regulatory examinations, borrowers' perceived financial and managerial strengths, the adequacy of underlying collateral, if collateral dependent, or present value of future cash flows, and other relevant and qualitative risk factors. These qualitative risk factors include:\n 1. Lending policies and procedures, including underwriting standards and collection, charge-off and recovery practices. \n 2. National, regional and local economic and business conditions as well as the condition of various segments. \n 3. Nature and volume of the portfolio and terms of loans. \n 4. Experience, ability and depth of lending management and staff. \n 5. Volume and severity of past due, classified and nonaccrual loans as well as other loan modifications. \n 6. Quality of the Company's loan review system, and the degree of oversight by the Company's Board of Directors. \n 7. Existence and effect of any concentration of credit and changes in the level of such concentrations. \n 8. Effect of external factors, such as competition and legal and regulatory requirements. \nEach factor is assigned a value to reflect improving, stable or declining conditions based on management's best judgment using relevant information available at the time of the evaluation. Adjustments to the factors are supported through documentation of changes in conditions in a narrative accompanying the allowance for loan loss calculation.\nWe also provide specific reserves for impaired loans to the extent the estimated realizable value of the underlying collateral is less than the loan balance, when the collateral is the only source of repayment. Also, we estimate and recognize reserve allocations on loans classified as \"internally classified accruing loans\" based upon any factor that might impact loss estimates. Those factors include but are not limited to the impact of economic conditions on the borrower and management's potential alternative strategies for loan or collateral disposition. An unallocated allowance is established for losses that have not been identified through the formulaic and other specific components of the allowance as described above. Management has identified several factors that impact credit losses that are not considered in either the formula or the specific allowance segments. These factors consist of macro and micro economic conditions, industry and geographic loan concentrations, changes in the composition of the loan portfolio, changes in underwriting processes and trends in problem loan and loss recovery rates. The impact of the above is considered in light of management's conclusions as to the overall adequacy of underlying collateral and other factors.\nThe majority of our loan portfolio represents loans made for commercial purposes, while significant amounts of residential property may serve as collateral for such loans. We attempt to evaluate larger loans individually, on the basis of our loan review process, which scrutinizes loans on a selective basis and other available information. Even if all commercial purpose loans could be reviewed, information on potential problems might not be available. Our portfolio of loans made for purposes of financing residential mortgages and consumer loans are evaluated in groups. At December 31, 2015, loans made for commercial real estate, construction and land development, commercial and industrial, owner occupied real estate, consumer and other, and residential mortgage purposes, respectively, amounted to $349.7 million, $46.5 million, $181.9 million, $246.4 million, $48.1 million, and $2.4 million.\nA loan is considered impaired, in accordance with ASC 310, when based on current information and events, it is probable that the Company will be unable to collect all amounts due from the borrower in accordance with the contractual terms of the loan. Impaired loans include nonperforming commercial loans, but also include internally classified accruing loans. As of December 31, 2015, management identified a total of four troubled debt restructurings in the loan portfolio in the amount of $8.8 million. Three troubled debt restructurings in the amount of $9.6 million were identified as of December 31, 2014.\nThe following table presents the Company's impaired loans at December 31, 2015, 2014, and 2013:\nTable 59: <table> <tr> <td> (dollars in thousands)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>December 31, </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Impaired loans without a valuation allowance\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 15,497\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 16,742\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 10,790\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Impaired loans with a valuation allowance\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 6,632\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 18,902\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 21,743\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total impaired loans\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 22,129\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 35,644\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 32,533\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Valuation allowance related to impaired loans\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 2,238\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 5,130\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 5,610\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total nonaccrual loans\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 12,622\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 21,440\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 10,420\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total loans past-due ninety days or more and\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> still accruing\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> -\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> -\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> -\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe recorded investment in loans that are impaired in accordance with ASC 310 totaled $22.1 million, $35.6 million, and $32.5 million at December 31, 2015, 2014, and 2013, respectively. The amounts of related valuation allowances were $2.2 million, $5.1 million, and $5.6 million, respectively at those dates. For the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014, and 2013, the average recorded investment in impaired loans was approximately $29.5 million, $33.0 million, and $33.7 million, respectively. Republic earned $516,000, $614,000, and $1.2 million of interest income on impaired loans (internally classified accruing loans) in 2015, 2014, and 2013, respectively. There were no commitments to extend credit to any borrowers with impaired loans as of the end of the periods presented herein.\nTotal impaired loans decreased by $13.5 million, or 38%, during the year ended December 31, 2015. This decrease was primarily driven by our largest non-performing loan relationship that transferred to OREO in the second quarter 2015. The valuation allowance related to impaired loans decreased to $2.2 million at December 31, 2015 compared to $5.1 million at December 31, 2014. At December 31, 2015 and 2014, internally classified accruing loans totaled approximately $9.5 million and $14.2 million, respectively.\nThe following table presents the Company's 30 to 89 days past due loans at December 31, 2015, 2014, and 2013:\nTable 60: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>December 31, </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> 30 to 59 days past due\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 2,878\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,681\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 21,504\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> 60 to 89 days past due\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 9,315\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 14,062\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 6,987\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total loans 30 to 89 days past due\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 12,193\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 15,743\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 28,491\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe increase in loan balances 30 to 59 days past due was the result of delinquency in one lending relationship at December 31, 2015 in the amount of $1.1 million that moved from current status at December 31, 2014. The decrease in loan balances 60 to 89 days past due was the result of delinquency in one lending relationship at December 31, 2014 in the amount of $5.0 million that moved to non-accrual status in 2015. Management has engaged in active discussions with all delinquent relationships to address delinquencies and is confident that acceptable resolutions will be achieved in the near term.\nDeposits\nTotal deposits at December 31, 2015 were $1.2 billion, an increase of $177.1 million or 16.5% from total deposits of $1.1 billion at December 31, 2014. Total deposits by account type at December 31, 2015, 2014, and 2013 are as follows:\nTable 61: <table> <tr> <td> (dollars in thousands)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> At December 31,\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Demand deposits, non-interest bearing\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 243,695\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 224,245\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 157,806\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Demand deposits, interest bearing\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 381,499\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 283,768\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 230,221\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Money market & savings deposits\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 556,526\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 488,848\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 402,671\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Time deposits\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 67,578\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 75,369\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 78,836\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total deposits\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,249,298\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,072,230\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 869,534\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nIn general, Republic pays higher interest rates on time deposits compared to other deposit categories. Republic's various deposit liabilities may fluctuate from period-to-period, reflecting customer behavior and strategies to optimize net interest income. The increase in total deposits to $1.2 billion at December 31, 2015 from $1.1 billion at December 31, 2014 was primarily the result of a $117.2 million increase in demand deposits, a $67.7 million increase in money market and savings deposits, which reflects the success of our retail-focused strategy of gathering low-cost core deposits. This strategy has also allowed us to nearly eliminate our dependence on the more volatile source of funding in internet based certificates of deposit.\nThe average balances and weighted average rates of Republic's deposits for the last three years are as follows:\nTable 62: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> For the Years Ended December 31,\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n(dollars in thousands)\n</td> <td> Average\nBalance\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\nRate\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Average\nBalance\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\nRate\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Average\nBalance\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\nRate\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Demand deposits:\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Non-interest bearing\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 235,810\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 189,810\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 149,125\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Interest bearing\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 349,055\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 0.40\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 233,693\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 0.38\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 192,224\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 0.43\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Money market & savings deposits\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 508,846\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 0.43\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 439,484\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 0.44\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 417,652\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 0.43\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Time deposits\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 73,819\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 0.94\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 78,073\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 0.92\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 92,484\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 0.94\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total deposits\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,167,530\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 0.37\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 941,060\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 0.38\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 851,485\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 0.41\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe remaining maturity of certificates of deposit for $100,000 or more as of December 31, 2015 is as follows:\nTable 63: <table> <tr> <td>\n(dollars in thousands)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Maturity:\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> 3 months or less\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 12,005\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> 3 to 6 months\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 3,309\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> 6 to 12 months\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 10,675\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Over 12 months\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 8,722\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 34,711\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe following is a summary of the remaining maturity of time deposits, which includes certificates of deposits of $100,000 or more, as of December 31, 2015:\nTable 64: <table> <tr> <td>\n(dollars in thousands)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Maturity:\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 50,139\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 13,780\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 1,599\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 1,497\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Thereafter\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> -\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 67,578\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe are a party to financial instruments with off-balance-sheet risk in the normal course of business to meet the financing needs of our customers. These financial instruments include commitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit. These instruments involve to varying degrees, elements of credit and interest rate risk in excess of the amount recognized in the financial statements.\nCredit risk is defined as the possibility of sustaining a loss due to the failure of the other parties to a financial instrument to perform in accordance with the terms of the contract. The maximum exposure to credit loss under commitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit is represented by the contractual amount of these instruments. We use the same underwriting standards and policies in making credit commitments as we do for on-balance-sheet instruments.\nFinancial instruments whose contract amounts represent potential credit risk are commitments to extend credit of approximately $165.1 million and $138.4 million and standby letters of credit of approximately $5.2 million and $3.8 million at December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. Commitments often expire without being drawn upon. The $165.1 million of commitments to extend credit at December 31, 2015, substantially all were variable rate commitments.\nCommitments to extend credit are agreements to lend to a customer as long as there is no violation of any condition established in the contract. Commitments generally have fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses and many require the payment of a fee. Since many of the commitments are expected to expire without being drawn upon, the total commitment amounts do not necessarily represent future cash requirements. The Company evaluates each customer's creditworthiness on a case-by-case basis. The amount of collateral obtained upon extension of credit is based on management's credit evaluation of the customer. Collateral held varies but may include real estate, marketable securities, pledged deposits, equipment and accounts receivable.\nStandby letters of credit are conditional commitments issued that guarantee the performance of a customer to a third party. The credit risk and collateral policy involved in issuing letters of credit is essentially the same as that involved in extending loan commitments. The amount of collateral obtained is based on management's credit evaluation of the customer. Collateral held varies but may include real estate, marketable securities, pledged deposits, equipment and accounts receivable.\nContractual Obligations and Other Commitments\nThe following table sets forth contractual obligations and other commitments representing required and potential cash outflows as of December 31, 2015:\nTable 65: <table> <tr> <td>\n(dollars in thousands)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\nTotal\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Less than\nOne Year\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> One to\nThree Years\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Three to\nFive Years\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> After Five\nYears\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Minimum annual rentals or non-cancellable operating leases\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 22,643\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 2,848\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 5,439\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 5,365\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 8,991\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Remaining contractual maturities of time deposits\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 67,782\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 50,343\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 15,379\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 2,060\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> -\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Short-term borrowings\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 47,001\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 47,001\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> -\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> -\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> -\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Subordinated debt\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 22,496\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> -\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> -\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 22,476\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Director and Officer retirement plan obligations\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 1,339\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Loan commitments\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 165,115\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 77,506\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 27,886\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 10,991\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 48,732\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Standby letters of credit\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 5,244\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 4,126\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 1,093\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> -\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 331,620\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 182,428\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 48,953\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 19,697\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 80,542\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nAs of December 31, 2015, we had entered into non-cancelable lease agreements for our main office and operations center, twelve current Republic retail branch facilities, two loan offices, and one training center expiring on various dates through November 30, 2034, including renewal options. The leases are accounted for as operating leases. The minimum rental payments required under these leases are $22.6 million through the year 2034.\nWe have retirement plan agreements with certain directors and officers. At December 31, 2015, the accrued benefits under the plan were approximately $1.3 million, with a minimum age of 65 established to qualify for the payments.\nInterest Rate Risk Management\nWe attempt to manage our assets and liabilities in a manner that optimizes net interest income in a range of interest rate environments. Management uses an \"interest sensitivity gap\" (\"GAP\") analysis and simulation models to monitor behavior of its interest sensitive assets and liabilities. A GAP analysis is the difference between interest-sensitive assets and interest-sensitive liabilities. Adjustments to the mix of assets and liabilities are made periodically in an effort to provide steady growth in net interest income.\nManagement presently believes that the effect of any future reduction in interest rates, reflected in lower yielding assets, could be detrimental since we may not have the immediate ability to commensurately decrease rates on interest bearing liabilities, primarily time deposits, other borrowings and certain transaction accounts. An increase in interest rates could have a negative effect due to a possible lag in the re-pricing of core deposits not taken into account in the static GAP analysis. Interest rate risk management involves managing the extent to which interest-sensitive assets and interest-sensitive liabilities are matched. We attempt to optimize net interest income while managing period-to-period fluctuations therein. We typically define interest-sensitive assets and interest-sensitive liabilities as those that re-price within one year or less. Generally, we limit long-term fixed rate assets and liabilities in our efforts to manage interest rate risk.\nA positive GAP occurs when interest-sensitive assets exceed interest-sensitive liabilities re-pricing in the same time periods, and a negative GAP occurs when interest-sensitive liabilities exceed interest-sensitive assets re-pricing in the same time periods. A negative GAP ratio suggests that a financial institution may be better positioned to take advantage of declining interest rates rather than increasing interest rates, and a positive GAP ratio suggests the converse. Static GAP analysis describes interest rate sensitivity at a point in time. However, it alone does not accurately measure the magnitude of changes in net interest income as changes in interest rates do not impact all categories of assets and liabilities equally or simultaneously. Interest rate sensitivity analysis also requires assumptions about re-pricing certain categories of assets and liabilities. For purposes of interest rate sensitivity analysis, assets and liabilities are stated at their contractual maturity, estimated likely call date, or earliest re-pricing opportunity. Mortgage-backed securities and amortizing loans are scheduled based on their anticipated cash flow, including prepayments based on historical data and current market trends. Savings, money market and interest-bearing demand accounts do not have a stated maturity or re-pricing term and can be withdrawn or re-priced at any time. Management estimates the re-pricing characteristics of these accounts based upon decay rates and run off projections obtained in a deposit study performed by an independent third party, along with management's estimates of when rates would have to be increased to retain balances in response to competition. Such estimates are necessarily arbitrary and wholly judgmental. As a result of the run off projections, these deposits are not considered to re-price simultaneously and, accordingly, a portion of the deposits are moved into time brackets exceeding one year. However, management may choose not to re-price liabilities proportionally to changes in market interest rates, for competitive or other reasons.\nShortcomings, inherent in a simplified and static GAP analysis, may result in an institution with a negative GAP having interest rate behavior associated with an asset-sensitive balance sheet. For example, although certain assets and liabilities may have similar maturities or periods to re-pricing, they may react in different degrees to changes in market interest rates. Furthermore, re-pricing characteristics of certain assets and liabilities may vary substantially within a given time period. In the event of a change in interest rates, prepayments and other cash flows could also deviate significantly from those assumed in calculating GAP in the manner presented in the table on the following page.\nThe following tables present a summary of our GAP analysis at December 31, 2015. Amounts shown in the table include both estimated maturities and instruments scheduled to re-price, including prime based loans. For purposes of these tables, we have used assumptions based on industry data and historical experience to calculate the expected maturity of loans because, statistically, certain categories of loans are prepaid before their maturity date, even without regard to interest rate fluctuations. Additionally, certain prepayment assumptions were made with regard to investment securities based upon the expected prepayment of the underlying collateral of the mortgage-backed securities. The interest rate on a portion of the CDOs is variable and adjusts quarterly.\nTable 66: <table> <tr> <td> Interest Rate Sensitivity Gap\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> As of December 31,

</tr>\n</table>\n(1) Demand, savings and money market accounts are scheduled to reprice based upon decay rate and run off percentage estimates obtained through a deposit study performed by an independent third party, along with management's estimates of when rates would have to be increased to retain balances in response to competition. Such estimates are necessarily arbitrary and wholly judgmental.\nIn addition to the GAP analysis, we utilize income simulation modeling in measuring our interest rate risk and managing our interest rate sensitivity. Income simulation considers not only the impact of changing market interest rates on forecasted net interest income, but also other factors such as yield curve relationships, the volume and mix of assets and liabilities and general market conditions.\nNet Portfolio Value and Net Interest Income Analysis\nThe income simulation models management used to measure interest rate risk and manage interest rate sensitivity generates estimates of the change in net portfolio value (NPV) and net interest income (NII) over a range of interest rate scenarios. NPV is the present value of expected cash flows from assets, liabilities, and off-balance sheet contracts. The NPV ratio, under any interest rate scenario, is defined as the NPV in that scenario divided by the market value of assets in the same scenario. The following table sets forth our NPV as of December 31, 2015 and reflects the changes to NPV as a result of immediate and sustained changes in interest rates as indicated (dollars in thousands):\nTable 68: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Net Portfolio Value\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> NPV as a % of Portfolio\nValue of Assets\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Change in Interest Rates in Basis Points (Rate Shock)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> Amount\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\nChange\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> %\nChange\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> NPV\nRatio\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Change\n(in Basis Points)\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> +400\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 135,332\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 15,720\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 13.14\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 10.36\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> +300\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 135,111\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 15,499\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 12.96\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 10.11\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> +200\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 133,950\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 14,338\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 11.98\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 9.79\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> +100\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 128,635\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 9,023\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 7.54\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 9.20\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Static\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 119,612\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> -\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 0.00\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 8.40\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> -\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 106,898\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (12,714\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (10.63\n</td> <td> )%\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 7.41\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (99\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nIn addition to modeling changes in NPV, we also analyze potential changes to NII for a forecasted twelve-month period under rising and falling interest rate scenarios.

Modeling changes in NPV and NII require the making of certain assumptions, which may or may not reflect the manner in which actual yields and costs respond to changes in market interest rates. In this regard, the models presented assume that the composition of our interest sensitive assets and liabilities existing at the beginning of a period remains constant over the period being measured and also assumes that a particular change in interest rates is reflected uniformly across the yield curve regardless of the duration to maturity or re-pricing of specific assets and liabilities. Accordingly, although the NPV measurements and net interest income models provide an indication of interest rate risk exposure at a particular point in time, such measurements are not intended to and do not provide a precise forecast of the effect of changes in market interest rates on net interest income and will differ from actual results.\nManagement believes that the assumptions utilized in evaluating our estimated net interest income are reasonable. However, the interest rate sensitivity of our assets, liabilities and off-balance sheet financial instruments as well as the estimated effect of changes in interest rates on estimated net interest income could vary substantially if different assumptions are used or actual experience differs from the experience on which the assumptions were based. Periodically, we may and do make significant changes to underlying assumptions, which are wholly judgmental. Prepayments on residential mortgage loans and mortgage-backed securities have increased over historical levels in recent years due to the lower interest rate environment, and may result in reductions in margins.\nCapital Resources\nWe have sponsored three outstanding issues of corporation-obligated mandatorily redeemable capital securities of a subsidiary trust holding solely junior subordinated debentures of the Corporation more commonly known as trust preferred securities. The subsidiary trusts are not consolidated for financial reporting purposes. The purpose of the issuances of these securities was to increase capital. The trust preferred securities qualify as Tier 1 capital for regulatory purposes in amounts up to 25% of total Tier 1 capital.\nOn December 27, 2006, Republic Capital Trust II (Trust II) issued $6.0 million of trust preferred securities to investors and $0.2 million of common securities to us. Trust II purchased $6.2 million of our floating rate junior subordinated debentures due 2037, and we used the proceeds to call the securities of Republic Capital Trust I (Trust I). The debentures purchased by Trust II have a variable interest rate, adjustable quarterly, at 1.73% over the 3-month LIBOR. We may redeem the debentures on any interest payment date without a prepayment penalty.\nOn June 28, 2007, Republic Capital Trust III (Trust III), issued $5.0 million of trust preferred securities to one investor and $0.2 million common securities to us. Trust III purchased $5.2 million of our floating rate junior subordinated debentures due 2037, which have a variable interest rate, adjustable quarterly, at 1.55% over the 3 month LIBOR. We have the ability to redeem the debentures on any interest payment date without a prepayment penalty.\nOn June 10, 2008, Republic First Bancorp Capital Trust IV (Trust IV) issued $10.8 million of convertible trust preferred securities as part of our strategic capital plan. The securities were purchased by investors, including Vernon W. Hill, II, founder and chairman (retired) of Commerce Bancorp, and, since the investment, a consultant to the Company. The investor group also included a family trust of Harry D. Madonna, our chairman, president and chief executive officer, and Theodore J. Flocco, Jr., who has been elected by the shareholders to our Board of Directors and serves as the Chairman of our Audit Committee. Trust IV also issued $0.3 million of common securities to the Company. Trust IV purchased $11.1 million of our fixed rate junior subordinated convertible debentures due 2038, which pay interest at an annual rate of 8.0% and are redeemable on any interest payment date (a) at any time on or after June 13, 2013 if the closing price of our common stock for 20 trading days in the period of 30 consecutive trading days ending on the trading day prior to the mailing of the notice of redemption exceeds 120% of the then-applicable conversion price, or (b) on or after June 30, 2018, without a prepayment penalty. The trust preferred securities of Trust IV are currently convertible into approximately 1.7 million shares of our common stock, which is subject to customary adjustments.\nAdditionally, on April 22, 2014, the Company issued 11,842,106 shares of its common stock in a private placement for gross proceeds of $45.0 million.\nShareholders' equity as of December 31, 2015 totaled approximately $113.4 million compared to approximately $112.8 million as of December 31, 2014. The book value per share of our common stock increased to $3.00 as of December 31, 2015, based upon 37,837,003 shares outstanding, from $2.98 as of December 31, 2014, based upon 37,815,503 shares outstanding at December 31, 2014. Outstanding shares are adjusted for treasury stock and deferred compensation plan shares by the Company.\nRegulatory Capital Requirements\nThe Company is required to comply with certain \"risk-based\" capital adequacy guidelines issued by the FRB and the FDIC. The risk-based capital guidelines assign varying risk weights to the individual assets held by a bank. The guidelines also assign weights to the \"credit-equivalent\" amounts of certain off-balance sheet items, such as letters of credit and interest rate and currency swap contracts.\nIn July 2013, the federal bank regulatory agencies adopted revisions to the agencies' capital adequacy guidelines and prompt corrective action rules, which were designed to enhance such requirements and implement the revised standards of the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision, commonly referred to as Basel III. The final rules generally implement higher minimum capital requirements, add a new common equity tier 1 capital requirement, and establish criteria that instruments must meet to be considered common equity tier 1 capital, additional tier 1 capital or tier 2 capital. Effective as of January 1, 2015, the new minimum capital to risk-adjusted assets requirements are a common equity tier 1 capital ratio of 4.5% (6.5% to be considered \"well capitalized\") and a tier 1 capital ratio of 6.0%, increased from 4.0% (and increased from 6.0% to 8.0% to be considered \"well capitalized\"); the total capital ratio remains at 8.0% under the new rules (10.0% to be considered \"well capitalized\"). Under the new rules, in order to avoid limitations on capital distributions (including dividend payments and certain discretionary bonus payments to executive officers), a banking organization must hold a capital conservation buffer comprised of common equity tier 1 capital above its minimum risk-based capital requirements, which amount must be greater than 2.5% of total risk-weighted assets at January 1, 2019. The capital contribution buffer requirements phase in over a three-year period beginning January 1, 2016. Management has reviewed the new standards and evaluated all options and strategies to ensure compliance with the new standards. Both Republic and the Company met the \"well capitalized\" standards applicable to them as of December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014.\nThe risk-based capital ratios measure the adequacy of a bank's capital against the riskiness of its assets and off-balance sheet activities. Failure to maintain adequate capital is a basis for \"prompt corrective action\" or other regulatory enforcement action. In assessing a bank's capital adequacy, regulators also consider other factors such as interest rate risk exposure; liquidity, funding and market risks; quality and level or earnings; concentrations of credit, quality of loans and investments; risks of any nontraditional activities; effectiveness of bank policies; and management's overall ability to monitor and control risks.\nManagement believes that the Company and Republic met, as of December 31, 2015 and 2014, all capital adequacy requirements to which we are subject. In the current year, the FDIC categorized Republic as well capitalized under the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action provisions of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act. There are no calculations or events since that notification which management believes would have changed Republic's category.\nThe Company and Republic's ability to maintain the required levels of capital is substantially dependent upon the success of their capital and business plans, the impact of future economic events on Republic's loan customers and Republic's ability to manage its interest rate risk, growth and other operating expenses.\nThe following table presents our regulatory capital ratios at December 31, 2015 and 2014:\nTable 70: <table> <tr> <td> (dollars in thousands)\n</td>

meet its financial obligations. These obligations include the payment of deposits on demand or at their contractual maturity; the repayment of borrowings as they mature; the payment of lease obligations as they become due; the ability to fund new and existing loans and other funding commitments; and the ability to take advantage of new business opportunities. Liquidity needs can be met by either reducing assets or increasing liabilities. Our most liquid assets consist of cash, amounts due from banks and federal funds sold.\nRegulatory authorities require us to maintain certain liquidity ratios in order for funds to be available to satisfy commitments to borrowers and the demands of depositors. In response to these requirements, we have formed an asset/liability committee (ALCO), comprised of certain members of Republic's Board of Directors and senior management to monitor such ratios. The ALCO committee is responsible for managing the liquidity position and interest sensitivity. That committee's primary objective is to maximize net interest income while configuring Republic's interest-sensitive assets and liabilities to manage interest rate risk and provide adequate liquidity for projected needs. The ALCO committee meets on a quarterly basis or more frequently if deemed necessary.\nOur target and actual liquidity levels are determined by comparisons of the estimated repayment and marketability of interest-earning assets with projected future outflows of deposits and other liabilities. Our most liquid assets, comprised of cash and cash equivalents on the balance sheet, totaled $27.1 million at December 31, 2015, compared to $128.8 million at December 31, 2014. Loan maturities and repayments are another source of asset liquidity. At December 31, 2015, Republic estimated that more than $45.0 million of loans would mature or repay in the six-month period ending June 30, 2016. Additionally, a significant portion of our investment securities are available to satisfy liquidity requirements through sales on the open market or by pledging as collateral to access credit facilities. At December 31, 2015, we had outstanding commitments (including unused lines of credit and letters of credit) of $170.4 million. Certificates of deposit scheduled to mature in one year totaled $50.1 million at December 31, 2015. We anticipate that we will have sufficient funds available to meet all current commitments.\nDaily funding requirements have historically been satisfied by generating core deposits and certificates of deposit with competitive rates, buying federal funds or utilizing the credit facilities of the FHLB. We have established a line of credit with the FHLB of Pittsburgh. Our maximum borrowing capacity with the FHLB was $440.6 million at December 31, 2015. As of December 31, 2015 and 2014, we had outstanding borrowings with the FHLB of $47.0 and $0 respectively. As of December 31, 2015, FHLB had issued letters of credit, on Republic's behalf, totaling $75.1 million against our available credit line. We also established a contingency line of credit of $10.0 million with Atlantic Community Bankers Bank (\"ACBB\") to assist in managing our liquidity position. We had no amounts outstanding against the ACBB line of credit at December 31, 2015 and 2014.\nVariable Interest Entities\nThe Company follows the guidance under ASC 810, Consolidation, with regard to variable interest entities. ASC 810 clarifies the application of consolidation principles for certain legal entities in which voting rights are not effective in identifying the investor with the controlling financial interest. An entity is subject to consolidation under ASC 810 if the investors do not have sufficient equity at risk for the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support, are unable to direct the entity's activities, or are not exposed to the entity's losses or entitled to its residual returns (\"variable interest entities\"). Variable interest entities within the scope of ASC 810 will be required to be consolidated by their primary beneficiary. The primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity is determined to be the party that absorbs a majority of the entity's expected losses, receives a majority of its expected returns, or both.\nThe Company does not consolidate its subsidiary trusts. ASC 810 precludes consideration of the call option embedded in the preferred securities when determining if the Company has the right to a majority of the trusts' expected residual returns. The non-consolidation results in the investment in the common securities of the trusts to be included in other assets with a corresponding increase in outstanding debt of $676,000. In addition, the income received on the Company's investment in the common securities of the trusts is included in other income.\nEffects of Inflation\nThe majority of assets and liabilities of a financial institution are monetary in nature. Therefore, a financial institution differs greatly from most commercial and industrial companies that have significant investments in fixed assets or inventories. Management believes that the most significant impact of inflation on financial results is our need and ability to react to changes in interest rates. As discussed previously, management attempts to maintain an essentially balanced position between rate sensitive assets and liabilities over a one-year time horizon in order to protect net interest income from being affected by wide interest rate fluctuations.", "item_7_text": "Item 7: Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThe following discussion and analysis of the results of operations and financial condition should be read in conjunction with Item 6 \"Selected Financial Data\" and the consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto included in Item 8 of this report. This discussion and analysis contains forward-looking statements that involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions. Certain risks, uncertainties and other factors, including but not limited to those set forth in Item 1A, entitled, \"Risk Factors\" and elsewhere in this report may cause actual results to differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements.\nExecutive Summary\nWe continue to expand our presence in the Philadelphia region through an aggressive growth strategy which we refer to as \"The Power of Red is Back.\" The goal of this expansion plan is to increase our store footprint while providing legendary customer service. During 2015 we welcomed thousands of new customers into our stores and won them over with exceptional service. The growth in asset, loan and deposit balances clearly demonstrates our ongoing success with this strategy. While we continue to make significant investments to build a new bank, we are very pleased with our ability to maintain consistent, profitable results from an income statement perspective.\nThe new stores opened in Glassboro, Marlton and Berlin, NJ during 2015 have performed exceptionally well. We ended the year with stores under construction in Washington Township, NJ and Wynnewood, PA and several more in various stages of development for future openings.\nThe highlights for the year ended December 31, 2015 are as follows:\n \u00b7 Total assets increased by $225 million, or 19%, to $1.4 billion as of December 31, 2015 compared to $1.2 billion as of December 31, 2014. \n \u00b7 Non-interest bearing demand deposits increased by 9% to $244 million as of December 31, 2015 compared to $224 million as of December 31, 2014. \n \u00b7 Total deposits increased by $177 million, or 17%, to $1.2 billion as of December 31, 2015 compared to $1.1 billion as of December 31, 2014. The cost of funds on interest bearing deposits decreased to 0.46% for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to 0.47% for the year ended December 31, 2014. \n \u00b7 Total loans grew $93 million, or 12%, to $875 million as of December 31, 2015 compared to $782 million at December 31, 2014. \n \u00b7 SBA lending continued to be a focal point of the Company's lending strategy. More than $41 million in new SBA loans were originated during the year ended December 31, 2015. Our team is currently ranked as the #1 SBA lender in the tri-state market of New Jersey, Pennsylvania, and Delaware based on the dollar volume of loan originations. \n \u00b7 Asset quality improved as non-performing loans decreased to $12.6 million, or 1.44% of total loans at December 31, 2015 compared to $21.4 million, or 2.74% of total loans at December 31, 2014. Non-performing assets decreased to $23.9 million, or 1.66% of total assets at December 31, 2015 compared to $25.2 million, or 2.07% of total assets at December 31, 2014. \n \u00b7 The Company's Total Risk-Based Capital ratio was 13.19% and Tier I Leverage ratio was 9.65% at December 31, 2015. \n \u00b7 Book value per common share was $3.00 as of December 31, 2015. \n \u00b7 In 2015, we opened three new locations in Glassboro, Marlton and Berlin, NJ that feature our new and distinctive prototype building. There are also several additional sites in various stages of development for future store locations. \n \u00b7 Our Cherry Hill, NJ store, which opened in March 2014, has grown to more than $100 million in core deposits during 2015. \nNon-GAAP Based Financial Measures\nThe Company's selected financial data contains non-GAAP financial measures calculated using non-GAAP amounts. These measures include tangible book value per common share and average equity to average assets. Management uses these non-GAAP measures to present historical periods comparable to the current period presentation. In addition, management believes the use of these non-GAAP measures provides additional clarity when assessing the Company's financial results and use of equity. These disclosures should not be viewed as substitutes for results determined to be in accordance with U.S. GAAP, nor are they necessarily comparable to non-GAAP performance measures that may be presented by other entities.\nCritical Accounting Policies, Judgments and Estimates\nIn reviewing and understanding our financial information, you are encouraged to read and understand the significant accounting policies used in preparing the consolidated financial statements. These policies are described in Note 2 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. The accounting and financial reporting policies conform to accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America and to general practices within the banking industry. The preparation of the consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of income and expenses during the reporting period. Management evaluates these estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis including those related to the allowance for loan losses, carrying values of other real estate owned, other than temporary impairment of securities, fair value of financial instruments and deferred income taxes. Management bases its estimates on historical experience and various other factors and assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. These form the basis for making judgments on the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.\nWe have identified the policies related to the allowance for loan losses, other-than-temporary impairment of securities, other real estate owned, and deferred income taxes as being critical.\nAllowance for Loan Losses - Management's ongoing evaluation of the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses is based on our past loan loss experience, the volume and composition of our lending, adverse situations that may affect a borrower's ability to repay, the estimated value of any underlying collateral, current economic conditions and other factors affecting the known and inherent risk in the portfolio. The allowance for loan losses is increased by charges to income through the provision for loan losses and decreased by charge-offs (net of recoveries). The allowance is maintained at a level that management, based upon its evaluation, considers adequate to absorb losses inherent in the loan portfolio. This evaluation is inherently subjective as it requires material estimates including, among others, the amount and timing of expected future cash flows on impacted loans, exposure at default, value of collateral, and estimated losses on our commercial and residential loan portfolios. All of these estimates may be susceptible to significant change.\nThe allowance consists of specific allowances for impaired loans, a general allowance on the remainder of the portfolio, and an unallocated component to account for a level of imprecision in management's estimation process. Although management determines the amount of each element of the allowance separately, the allowance for loan losses is available for the entire loan portfolio.\nManagement establishes an allowance on certain impaired loans for the amount by which the discounted cash flows, observable market price, or fair value of collateral if the loan is collateral dependent, is lower than the carrying value of the loan. A loan is considered to be impaired when, based upon current information and events, it is probable that we will be unable to collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the loan. A delay or shortfall in amount of payments does not necessarily result in the loan being identified as impaired.\nManagement also establishes a general allowance on non-impaired loans to recognize the inherent losses associated with lending activities, but which, unlike specific allowances, have not been allocated to particular loans. This general valuation allowance is determined by segregating the loans by loan category and assigning allowance percentages based on our historical loss experience, delinquency trends, and management's evaluation of the collectability of the loan portfolio.\nManagement also evaluates classified loans, which are not impaired. We segregate these loans by category and assign qualitative factors to each loan based on inherent losses associated with each type of lending and consideration that these loans, in the aggregate, represent an above-average credit risk and that more of these loans will prove to be uncollectible compared to loans in the general portfolio. Classification of a loan within this category is based on identified weaknesses that increase the credit risk of the loan.\nThe allowance is adjusted for significant factors that, in management's judgment, affect the collectability of the portfolio as of the evaluation date. These significant factors may include changes in lending policies and procedures, changes in existing general economic and business conditions affecting its primary lending areas, credit quality trends, collateral value, loan volumes and concentrations, seasoning of the loan portfolio, loss experience in particular segments of the portfolio, duration of the current business cycle, and bank regulatory examination results. The applied loss factors are re-evaluated each reporting period to ensure their relevance in the current economic environment.\nWhile management uses the best information known to it in order to make loan loss allowance valuations, adjustments to the allowance may be necessary based on changes in economic and other conditions, changes in the composition of the loan portfolio, or changes in accounting guidance. In times of economic slowdown, either regional or national, the risk inherent in the loan portfolio could increase resulting in the need for additional provisions to the allowance for loan losses in future periods. An increase could also be necessitated by an increase in the size of the loan portfolio or in any of its components even though the credit quality of the overall portfolio may be improving. Historically, the estimates of the allowance for loan loss have provided adequate coverage against actual losses incurred. In addition, the Pennsylvania Department of Banking and Securities and the FDIC, as an integral part of their examination processes, periodically review the allowance for loan losses. The Pennsylvania Department of Banking and Securities or the FDIC may require the recognition of adjustment to the allowance for loan losses based on their judgment of information available to them at the time of their examinations. To the extent that actual outcomes differ from management's estimates, additional provisions to the allowance for loan losses may be required that would adversely impact earnings in future periods.\nOther-Than-Temporary Impairment of Securities - Securities are evaluated on at least a quarterly basis, and more frequently when market conditions warrant such an evaluation, to determine whether a decline in their value is other-than-temporary. To determine whether a loss in value is other-than-temporary, management utilizes criteria such as the reasons underlying the decline, the magnitude and duration of the decline and our intent and ability to retain its investment in the security for a period of time sufficient to allow for an anticipated recovery in the fair value. The term \"other-than-temporary\" is not intended to indicate that the decline is permanent, but indicates that the prospects for a near-term recovery of value is not necessarily favorable, or that there is a lack of evidence to support a realizable value equal to or greater than the carrying value of the investment. Once a decline in value is determined to be other-than-temporary, the value of the security is reduced and a corresponding charge to earnings is recognized.\nOther Real Estate Owned - Other real estate owned consists of assets acquired through, or in lieu of, loan foreclosure. They are held for sale and are initially recorded at fair value less cost to sell at the date of foreclosure, establishing a new cost basis. Subsequent to foreclosure, valuations are periodically performed by management and the assets are carried at the lower of carrying amount or fair value, less the cost to sell. Revenue and expenses from operations and changes in the valuation allowance are included in net expenses from other real estate owned.\nIncome Taxes - Management makes estimates and judgments to calculate various tax liabilities and determine the recoverability of various deferred tax assets, which arise from temporary differences between the tax and financial statement recognition of revenues and expenses. Management also estimates a reserve for deferred tax assets if, based on the available evidence, it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the recorded deferred tax assets will not be realized in future periods. These estimates and judgments are inherently subjective. Historically, management's estimates and judgments to calculate the deferred tax accounts have not required significant revision.\nIn evaluating our ability to recover deferred tax assets, management considers all available positive and negative evidence, including the past operating results and forecasts of future taxable income. In determining future taxable income, management makes assumptions for the amount of taxable income, the reversal of temporary differences and the implementation of feasible and prudent tax planning strategies. These assumptions require management to make judgments about the future taxable income and are consistent with the plans and estimates used to manage the business. Any reduction in estimated future taxable income may require management to record a valuation allowance against the deferred tax assets. An increase in the valuation allowance would result in additional income tax expense in the period and could have a significant impact on future earnings.\nResults of Operations\nFor the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2014\nWe reported net income of $2.4 million, or $0.06 per share, for the twelve months ended December 31, 2015 compared to net income of $2.4 million, or $0.07 per share, for the twelve months ended December 31, 2014.\nNet interest income for the twelve months ended December 31, 2015 increased $4.2 million to $40.1 million as compared to $35.8 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2014. Interest income increased $5.0 million, or 12.3%, due primarily to an increase in average loans receivable and investment securities balances. Interest expense increased $737,000 or 15.9%, primarily due to an increase in average deposit balances.\nWe recorded a loan loss provision in the amount of $500,000 for the twelve months ended December 31, 2015 compared to a provision of $900,000 during the twelve months ended December 31, 2014. The lower provision recorded for the twelve months ended December 31, 2015 was driven by a decrease in the reserve required for loans individually evaluated for impairment in 2015.\nNon-interest income increased $1.9 million to $9.9 million during the twelve months ended December 31, 2015 as compared to $8.0 million during the twelve months ended December 31, 2014 primarily driven by a $2.6 million insurance settlement recorded in 2015 which was related to a bond claim against a corporate insurance policy originally submitted in 2010.\nNon-interest expenses increased $6.5 million to $47.1 million during the twelve months ended December 31, 2015 as compared to $40.6 million during the twelve months ended December 31, 2014. The increase was primarily driven by higher salaries, employee benefits, occupancy and equipment expenses associated with the addition of new stores related to our expansion strategy which we refers to as \"The Power of Red is Back.\" In addition, we made a decision in 2015 to aggressively pursue a potential sale of our largest OREO asset resulting in a write-down of approximately $2.2 million.\nReturn on average assets and average equity from continuing operations were 0.19% and 2.14%, respectively, during the twelve months ended December 31, 2015 compared to 0.23% and 2.51%, respectively, for the twelve months ended December 31, 2014.\nAverage Balances and Net Interest Income\nHistorically, our earnings have depended primarily upon Republic's net interest income, which is the difference between interest earned on interest-earning assets and interest paid on interest-bearing liabilities. Net interest income is affected by changes in the mix of the volume and rates of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities. The following table provides an analysis of net interest income on an annualized basis, setting forth for the periods average assets, liabilities, and shareholders' equity, interest income earned on interest-earning assets and interest expense on interest-bearing liabilities, average yields earned on interest-earning assets and average rates on interest-bearing liabilities, and Republic's net interest margin (net interest income as a percentage of average total interest-earning assets). Averages are computed based on daily balances. Non-accrual loans are included in average loans receivable. Yields are adjusted for tax equivalency, using a rate of 35% in 2015, 2014, and 2013.\nAverage Balances and Net Interest Income\n\n(1) Yields on investments are calculated based on amortized cost.\n(2) Net interest income and net interest margin are presented on a tax equivalent basis. Net interest income has been increased over the financial statement amount by $606, $379, and $323 in 2015, 2014, and 2013, respectively, to adjust for tax equivalency. The tax equivalent net interest margin is calculated by dividing tax equivalent net interest income by average total interest earning assets.\nRate/Volume Analysis of Changes in Net Interest Income\nNet interest income may also be analyzed by segregating the volume and rate components of interest income and interest expense. The following table sets forth an analysis of volume and rate changes in net interest income for the periods indicated. For purposes of this table, changes in interest income and expense are allocated to volume and rate categories based upon the respective changes in average balances and average rates.\n\nNet Interest Income and Net Interest Margin\nNet interest income, on a fully tax-equivalent basis, for the twelve months of 2015 increased by $4.5 million, or 12.3%, over the same period in 2014. Interest income on interest-earning assets totaled $46.0 million for the twelve months of 2015, an increase of $5.2 million, compared to the same period in 2014. The increase in interest income earned was the result of an increase in the average balance of loans receivable and investment securities that helped to offset a 20 bp decrease in the yield on loans receivable. Total interest expense for the twelve months of 2015 increased $737,000, or 15.9%, to $5.4 million from $4.6 million over the same period in 2014. Interest expense on deposits increased by $730,000, or 20.6%, for the twelve months of 2015 versus the same period of 2014. Interest expense on other borrowings increased by $7,000 for the twelve months of 2015 compared to the same period in 2014.\nChanges in net interest income are frequently measured by two statistics: net interest rate spread and net interest margin. Net interest rate spread is the difference between the average rate earned on interest-earning assets and the average rate incurred on interest-bearing liabilities. Our net interest rate spread on a fully tax-equivalent basis was 3.16% during the twelve months of 2015 versus 3.41% during the twelve months of 2014. Net interest margin represents the difference between interest income, including net loan fees earned, and interest expense, reflected as a percentage of average interest-earning assets. For the twelve months of 2015 and 2014, the fully tax-equivalent net interest margin was 3.29% and 3.56%, respectively. The net interest margin for the year ending December 31, 2015 decreased primarily as a result of a decrease in the yield on loans receivable.\nProvision for Loan Losses\nWe recorded a provision for loan losses in the amount of $500,000 for the twelve months ended December 31, 2015 compared to a $900,000 provision for the twelve months ended December 31, 2014. The provision for loan losses is charged to operations in an amount necessary to bring the total allowance for loan losses to a level that management believes is adequate to absorb inherent losses in the loan portfolio.\nThe provision recorded for the twelve months ended December 31, 2015 as compared to the twelve months ended December 31, 2014 decreased due to an improvement in asset quality, which resulted in a reduction in the allowance for loan losses required for loans individually evaluated for impairment in 2015.\nNon-Interest Income\nTotal noninterest income for the twelve months of 2015 increased by $1.9 million, or 24.0%, from the same period in 2014. We recorded a $2.6 million insurance settlement in 2015 which was related to a claim against a corporate insurance policy originally submitted in 2010. Loan advisory and servicing fees increased by $774 thousand in 2015 due to higher servicing fee income on SBA loans. Service fees on deposit accounts increased by $496,000 in 2015 compared to 2014 due to the growth in the number of customer accounts and deposit balances. We recognized gains of $108,000 on the sale of investment securities during 2015 compared to gains of $458,000 on the sale of investment securities in 2014. Gains recognized on the sale of SBA loans were $3.1 million during the twelve months of 2015 compared to $4.7 million in the same period of 2014 primarily due to a decrease in the volume of loans originated and sold in 2015.\nNon-Interest Expenses\nIn 2015, noninterest expenses increased by $6.5 million, or 16.1%, compared to 2014. An explanation of changes in noninterest expenses for certain categories is presented in the following paragraphs.\nSalary expenses and employee benefits in 2015 were $22.5 million, an increase of $2.4 million, or 11.9%, compared to 2014 primarily driven by annual merit increases along with increased staffing levels related to our aggressive growth strategy of adding and relocating stores, which we refer to as \"The Power of Red is Back.\"\nOccupancy related expenses increased by $1.4 million, or 20.8%, in 2015 compared to 2014, also as a result of the growth and relocation strategy. Three new stores were opened during 2015 and two additional sites were under construction at year end.\nOther real estate owned expenses totaled $4.2 million during 2015, an increase of $2.4 million, when compared to 2014 primarily due to higher writedowns on foreclosed assets held in other real estate owned. A writedown of $2.2 million was recorded against the largest asset held in other real estate owned during 2015 as a result of our decision to aggressively pursue a potential sale of this asset.\nIn addition, minor increases in data processing, other operating expenses, regulatory assessments, insurance, other taxes, and advertising for the twelve months of 2015 versus the same period last year were offset by minor decreases in legal expenses and professional fees.\nOne key measure that management utilizes to monitor progress in controlling overhead expenses is the ratio of annualized net noninterest expenses to average assets. For purposes of this calculation, net noninterest expenses equal noninterest expenses less noninterest income and nonrecurring expense. For the twelve month period ended December 31, 2015, the ratio equaled 2.83% compared to 3.05% for the twelve month period ended December 31, 2014, respectively, reflecting higher average assets related to the Company's growth strategy.\nAnother productivity measure utilized by management is the operating efficiency ratio. This ratio expresses the relationship of noninterest expenses to net interest income plus noninterest income. The efficiency ratio equaled 94.2% for the twelve months of 2015, compared to 92.5% for the twelve months of 2014. The increase for the twelve months ended December 31, 2015 versus December 31, 2014 was due to an increase in total noninterest expenses.\nProvision (Benefit) for Income Taxes\nWe recorded a benefit for income taxes of $26,000 for the twelve months ended December 31, 2015, compared to a $46,000 benefit for the twelve months ended December 31, 2014. The $26,000 benefit recorded during the twelve months of 2015 was the net result of an estimated tax provision in the amount of $911,000 calculated on the net profit generated during the period using our normal estimated tax rate, offset by an adjustment to the deferred tax asset valuation allowance in the amount of $937,000. The effective tax rates for the twelve month periods ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 were 38% and 26%, respectively, excluding an adjustment to the deferred tax asset valuation allowance.\nWe evaluate the carrying amount of its deferred tax assets on a quarterly basis or more frequently, if necessary, in accordance with the guidance provided in Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Accounting Standards Codification Topic 740 (ASC 740), in particular, applying the criteria set forth therein to determine whether it is more likely than not (i.e. a likelihood of more than 50%) that some portion, or all, of the deferred tax asset will not be realized within its life cycle, based on the weight of available evidence. If management makes a determination based on the available evidence that it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized in future periods, a valuation allowance is calculated and recorded. These determinations are inherently subjective and dependent upon estimates and judgments concerning management's evaluation of both positive and negative evidence.\nIn conducting the deferred tax asset analysis, we believe it is important to consider the unique characteristics of an industry or business. In particular, characteristics such as business model, level of capital and reserves held by financial institutions and their ability to absorb potential losses are important distinctions to be considered for bank holding companies like the Company. In addition, it is also important to consider that net operating loss carryforwards (\"NOLs\") for federal income tax purposes can generally be carried back two years and carried forward for a period of twenty years. In order to realize our deferred tax assets, we must generate sufficient taxable income in such future years.\nIn assessing the need for a valuation allowance, we carefully weighed both positive and negative evidence currently available. Judgment is required when considering the relative impact of such evidence. The weight given to the potential effect of positive and negative evidence must be commensurate with the extent to which it can be objectively verified. A cumulative loss in recent years is a significant piece of negative evidence that is difficult to overcome.\nWhen calculating an estimate for a valuation allowance, we assessed the possible sources of taxable income available under tax law to realize a tax benefit for deductible temporary differences and carry forwards as defined in ASC 740. The Company did not use projections of future taxable income, exclusive of reversing temporary timing differences and carryforwards, as a factor in the analysis. The Company will exclude future taxable income as a factor until we can show consistent and sustainable profitability. Based on the analysis of available positive and negative evidence, we determined that a valuation allowance should be recorded as of December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014.\nThe Company did assess tax planning strategies as defined under ASC 740 to determine the amount of a valuation allowance. Strategies reviewed included the sale of investment securities and loans with fair values greater than book values, redeployment of cash and cash equivalents into higher yielding investment options, a switch from tax-exempt to taxable investments and loans, and the election of a decelerated depreciation method for tax purposes on future fixed asset purchases. We believe that these tax planning strategies are (a) prudent and feasible, (b) steps that we would not ordinarily take, but would take to prevent an operating loss or tax credit carryforward from expiring unused, and (c) would result in the realization of existing deferred tax assets. These tax planning strategies, if implemented, would result in taxable income in the first full reporting period after deployment and accelerate the recovery of deferred tax asset balances if faced with the inability to recover those assets or the risk of potential expiration. We believe that these are viable tax planning strategies and appropriately considered in the analysis at this time, but may not align with the strategic direction of the organization today and therefore, has no present intention to implement such strategies.\nThe net deferred tax asset balance before consideration of a valuation allowance was $20.2 million as of December 31, 2015 and $19.6 million as of December 31, 2014. After assessment of all available tax planning strategies, we determined that a partial valuation allowance in the amount of $13.7 million as of December 31, 2015 and $14.7 million as of December 31, 2014 should be recorded.\nThe deferred tax asset will continue to be analyzed on a quarterly basis for changes affecting realizability. When the determination is made to include projections of future taxable income as a factor in recovering the deferred tax asset, the valuation allowance will be reduced accordingly resulting in a corresponding increase in net income.\nNet Income and Net Income per Common Share\nNet income for the twelve month periods ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 was $2.4 million. For the twelve month period ended December 31, 2015, basic and fully-diluted net income per common share was $0.06 compared to basic and fully-diluted net income per common share of $0.07 for the twelve month period ended December 31, 2014.\nReturn on Average Assets and Average Equity\nReturn on average assets (ROA) measures our net income in relation to our total average assets. The ROA for the twelve month periods ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 was 0.19% and 0.23%, respectively. Return on average equity (ROE) indicates how effectively we can generate net income on the capital invested by our stockholders. ROE is calculated by dividing annualized net income by average stockholders' equity. The ROE for the twelve month period ended December 31, 2015 was 2.14%, compared to 2.51% for the twelve month period ended December 31, 2014.\nResults of Operations\nFor the year ended December 31, 2014 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2013\nWe reported net income of $2.4 million, or $0.07 per share, for the twelve months ended December 31, 2014 compared to a net loss of $3.5 million, or $(0.13) per share, for the twelve months ended December 31, 2013. Prior year net income was impacted by a loan loss provision in the amount of $3.6 million on a single loan and a one-time charge of $1.9 million related to a legal settlement.\nNet interest income for the twelve months ended December 31, 2014 increased $3.2 million to $35.8 million as compared to $32.6 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2013. Interest income increased $3.3 million, or 8.8%, due primarily to an increase in average loan balances. Interest expense increased $54,000 or 1.2%, primarily due to an increase in average deposit balances.\nWe recorded a loan loss provision in the amount of $900,000 for the twelve months ended December 31, 2014 compared to a provision of $4.9 million during the twelve months ended December 31, 2013. The lower provision recorded for the twelve months ended December 31, 2014 was driven by a loan loss provision in the amount of $3.6 million on one loan recorded in 2013 which did not recur in 2014.\nNon-interest income decreased $1.2 million to $8.0 million during the twelve months ended December 31, 2014 as compared to $9.2 million during the twelve months ended December 31, 2013 primarily due to a decrease of $621,000 in gains recognized on the sale of SBA loans during the twelve months ended December 31, 2014 as a result of fewer SBA loan originations during the current period. In addition, there was a decrease of $245,000 in gains on the sale of investment securities and a decrease of $238,000 in legal settlements compared to December 31, 2013.\nNon-interest expenses increased $139,000 to $40.6 million during the twelve months ended December 31, 2014 as compared to $40.4 million during the twelve months ended December 31, 2013. The increase during the twelve months ended December 31, 2014 was primarily due to an increase in salaries and benefits of $3.0 million driven primarily by annual merit increases along with increased staffing levels related to the Company's growth strategy of adding and relocating stores. Occupancy related expenses also increased by $889,000 as a result of the growth and relocation strategy. These increases were offset by a legal settlement of $1.9 million recorded in 2013, a decrease in other real estate owned expenses of $1.4 million, and a decrease of $588,000 in legal expenses.\nReturn on average assets and average equity from continuing operations were 0.23% and 2.51%, respectively, during the twelve months ended December 31, 2014 compared to (0.37)% and (5.07)%, respectively, for the twelve months ended December 31, 2013.\nNet Interest Income and Net Interest Margin\nNet interest income, on a fully tax-equivalent basis, for the twelve months of 2014 increased by $3.3 million, or 9.9%, over the same period in 2013. Interest income on interest-earning assets totaled $40.9 million for the twelve months of 2014, an increase of $3.3 million, compared to the same period in 2013. The increase in interest income earned was the result of an increase in the average balance of loans receivable and investment securities that helped to offset a 24 bp decrease in the yield on loans receivable. Total interest expense for the twelve months of 2014 increased $54,000, or 1.2%, from $4.6 million in 2013 to $4.6 million in 2014. Interest expense on deposits increased by $58,000, or 1.7%, for the twelve months of 2014 versus the same period of 2013. Interest expense on short-term borrowings decreased by $4,000 for the twelve months of 2014 compared to the same period in 2013.\nChanges in net interest income are frequently measured by two statistics: net interest rate spread and net interest margin. Net interest rate spread is the difference between the average rate earned on interest-earning assets and the average rate incurred on interest-bearing liabilities. Our net interest rate spread on a fully tax-equivalent basis was 3.41% during the twelve months of 2014 versus 3.54% during the twelve months of 2013. Net interest margin represents the difference between interest income, including net loan fees earned, and interest expense, reflected as a percentage of average interest-earning assets. For the twelve months of 2014 and 2013, the fully tax-equivalent net interest margin was 3.56% and 3.66%, respectively. The net interest margin for the year ending December 31, 2014 decreased primarily as a result of a decrease in the yield on loans receivable.\nProvision for Loan Losses\nWe recorded a provision for loan losses in the amount of $900,000 for the twelve months ended December 31, 2014 compared to a $4.9 million provision for the twelve months ended December 31, 2013. The provision for loan losses is charged to operations in an amount necessary to bring the total allowance for loan losses to a level that management believes is adequate to absorb inherent losses in the loan portfolio.\nThe higher provision recorded during 2013 was primarily driven by a single loan relationship which was originated in 2006 and determined to be impaired during the fourth quarter of 2013 due to delinquency in payments. The need for a provision in the amount of $3.6 million was the result of a significant reduction in the collateral value supporting the loan based upon a current appraisal.\nIn addition, the provision recorded for the twelve months ended December 31, 2014 as compared to the twelve months ended December 31, 2013 decreased due to a reduction in the allowance for loan losses related to non-impaired loans evaluated collectively for impairment. The decrease associated with loans collectively evaluated for impairment was driven by a reduction in the factor used in the calculation related to historical charge-offs which has declined as a result of lower charge-offs in recent years.\nNon-Interest Income\nTotal noninterest income for the first twelve months of 2014 decreased by $1.2 million, or 13.0%, from the same period in 2013. Gains recognized on the sale of SBA loans were $4.7 million during the twelve months of 2014 compared to $5.3 million in the same period of 2013. In addition, we also recognized gains of $458,000 on the sale of investment securities during 2014 compared to gains of $703,000 on the sale of investment securities in 2013. We recorded no legal settlements during the twelve month period ended December 31, 2014 compared to $238,000 in the twelve month period ended December 31, 2013.\nNon-Interest Expenses\nIn 2014, noninterest expenses increased by $139,000, or 0.3%, compared to 2013. A explanation of changes in noninterest expenses for certain categories is presented in the following paragraphs.\nSalary expenses and employee benefits in 2014 were $20.1 million, an increase of $3.0 million, or 17.7%, compared to 2013 primarily driven by annual merit increases along with increased staffing levels related to our growth strategy of adding and relocating stores.\nOccupancy related expenses increased by $889,000, or 15.5%, in 2014 compared to 2013, also as a result of the growth and relocation strategy.\nOther real estate owned expenses totaled $1.8 million during 2014, a decrease of $1.4 million, or 43.6%, when compared to 2013 primarily due to lower writedowns in 2014 on assets held in the other real estate owned category.\nAs previously mentioned, we settled a legal matter totaling $1.9 million in 2013. This one-time charge of $1.9 million in 2013 was related to litigation in which the Company was a defendant. In addition, we had a decrease of $588,000 in legal expenses. Other minor decreases in regulatory assessments, insurance, and other operating expenses were offset by increases in data processing, advertising, professional fees, and other taxes for the twelve months of 2014 versus the same period last year.\nOne key measure that management utilizes to monitor progress in controlling overhead expenses is the ratio of annualized net noninterest expenses to average assets. For purposes of this calculation, net noninterest expenses equal noninterest expenses less noninterest income and nonrecurring expense. For the twelve month period ended December 31, 2014, the ratio equaled 3.05% compared to 3.09% for the twelve month period ended December 31, 2013, respectively, reflecting higher average assets related to the Company's growth strategy of adding and relocating stores.\nAnother productivity measure utilized by management is the operating efficiency ratio. This ratio expresses the relationship of noninterest expenses to net interest income plus noninterest income. The efficiency ratio equaled 92.5% for the twelve months of 2014, compared to 96.6% for the twelve months of 2013. The decrease for the twelve months ended December 31, 2014 versus December 31, 2013 was due to a 4.8% increase in total revenues.\nProvision (Benefit) for Income Taxes\nWe recorded a benefit for income taxes of $46,000 for the twelve months ended December 31, 2014, compared to a $35,000 benefit for the twelve months ended December 31, 2013. The $46,000 benefit recorded during the twelve months of 2014 was the net result of an estimated tax provision in the amount of $633,000 calculated on the net profit generated during the period using our normal estimated tax rate, offset by an adjustment to the deferred tax asset valuation allowance in the amount of $679,000. The effective tax rates for the twelve month periods ended December 31, 2014 and 2013 were 26% and (42%), respectively, excluding an adjustment to the deferred tax asset valuation allowance.\nWe evaluate the carrying amount of its deferred tax assets on a quarterly basis or more frequently, if necessary, in accordance with the guidance provided in Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Accounting Standards Codification Topic 740 (ASC 740), in particular, applying the criteria set forth therein to determine whether it is more likely than not (i.e. a likelihood of more than 50%) that some portion, or all, of the deferred tax asset will not be realized within its life cycle, based on the weight of available evidence. If management makes a determination based on the available evidence that it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized in future periods, a valuation allowance is calculated and recorded. These determinations are inherently subjective and dependent upon estimates and judgments concerning management's evaluation of both positive and negative evidence.\nIn conducting the deferred tax asset analysis, we believe it is important to consider the unique characteristics of an industry or business. In particular, characteristics such as business model, level of capital and reserves held by financial institutions and their ability to absorb potential losses are important distinctions to be considered for bank holding companies like the Company. In addition, it is also important to consider that net operating loss carryforwards (\"NOLs\") for federal income tax purposes can generally be carried back two years and carried forward for a period of twenty years. In order to realize our deferred tax assets, we must generate sufficient taxable income in such future years.\nIn assessing the need for a valuation allowance, we carefully weighed both positive and negative evidence currently available. Judgment is required when considering the relative impact of such evidence. The weight given to the potential effect of positive and negative evidence must be commensurate with the extent to which it can be objectively verified. A cumulative loss in recent years is a significant piece of negative evidence that is difficult to overcome.\nWhen calculating an estimate for a valuation allowance, we assessed the possible sources of taxable income available under tax law to realize a tax benefit for deductible temporary differences and carry forwards as defined in ASC 740. As a result of cumulative losses in recent years and the slow, ongoing recovery in the current economic environment, we did not use projections of future taxable income as a factor. We will exclude future taxable income as a factor until we can show consistent and sustainable profitability. Based on the analysis of available positive and negative evidence, we determined that a valuation allowance should be recorded as of December 31, 2014 and December 31, 2013.\nWe did assess tax planning strategies as defined under ASC 740 to determine the amount of a valuation allowance. Strategies reviewed included the sale of investment securities and loans with fair values greater than book values, redeployment of cash and cash equivalents into higher yielding investment options, a switch from tax-exempt to taxable investments and loans, and the election of a decelerated depreciation method for tax purposes on future fixed asset purchases. We believe that these tax planning strategies are (a) prudent and feasible, (b) steps that we would not ordinarily take, but would take to prevent an operating loss or tax credit carryforward from expiring unused, and (c) would result in the realization of existing deferred tax assets. These tax planning strategies, if implemented, would result in taxable income in the first full reporting period after deployment and accelerate the recovery of deferred tax asset balances if faced with the inability to recover those assets or the risk of potential expiration. We believe that these are viable tax planning strategies and appropriately considered in the analysis at this time, but may not align with the strategic direction of the organization today and therefore, has no present intention to implement such strategies.\nThe net deferred tax asset balance before consideration of a valuation allowance was $19.6 million as of December 31, 2014 and $21.4 million as of December 31, 2013. After assessment of all available tax planning strategies, we determined that a partial valuation allowance in the amount of $14.7 million as of December 31, 2014 and $15.3 million as of December 31, 2013 should be recorded.\nThe deferred tax asset will continue to be analyzed on a quarterly basis for changes affecting realizability. When the determination is made to include projections of future taxable income as a factor in recovering the deferred tax asset, the valuation allowance will be reduced accordingly resulting in a corresponding increase in net income.\nNet Income and Net Income per Common Share\nNet income for the twelve month period ended December 31, 2014 was $2.4 million, an increase of $5.9 million, compared to a $3.5 million net loss recorded for the twelve month period ended December 31, 2013. The higher net income in 2014 was due to a $4.0 million decrease in the provision for loan losses, a $3.2 million increase in net interest income, partially offset by a $1.2 million decrease in noninterest income and a $139,000 increase in noninterest expenses.\nFor the twelve month period ended December 31, 2014, basic and fully-diluted net income per common share was $0.07 compared to basic and fully-diluted net loss per common share of $(0.13) for the twelve month period ended December 31, 2013.\nReturn on Average Assets and Average Equity\nReturn on average assets (ROA) measures our net income in relation to our total average assets. The ROA for the twelve month periods ended December 31, 2014 and 2013 was 0.23% and (0.37)%, respectively. Return on average equity (ROE) indicates how effectively we can generate net income on the capital invested by our stockholders. ROE is calculated by dividing annualized net income by average stockholders' equity. The ROE for the twelve month period ended December 31, 2014 was 2.51%, compared to (5.07)% for the twelve month period ended December 31, 2013.\nFinancial Condition\nDecember 31, 2015 compared to December 31, 2014\nTotal assets increased by $224.8 million to $1.4 billion at December 31, 2015, compared to $1.2 billion at December 31, 2014.\nCash and Cash Equivalents\nCash and due from banks and interest bearing deposits comprise this category, which consists of our most liquid assets. The aggregate amount in these two categories decreased by $101.7 million to $27.1 million at December 31, 2015, from $128.8 million at December 31, 2014. The decrease was primarily caused by an increase in investment securities purchases and outstanding loans receivable.\nLoans Held for Sale\nLoans held for sale are comprised of loans guaranteed by the U.S. Small Business Administration (\"SBA\") which we usually originate with the intention of selling in the future. Total SBA loans held for sale were $3.7 million at December 31, 2015 compared to $1.7 million at December 31, 2014. Loans held for sale, as a percentage of our total assets, were less than 1% at December 31, 2015.\nLoans Receivable\nThe loan portfolio represents our largest asset category and is our most significant source of interest income. Our lending strategy is focused on small and medium sized businesses and professionals that seek highly personalized banking services. The loan portfolio consists of secured and unsecured commercial loans including commercial real estate, construction loans, residential mortgages, home improvement loans, home equity loans and lines of credit, overdraft lines of credit, and others. Commercial loans typically range between $250,000 and $5,000,000 but customers may borrow significantly larger amounts up to our legal lending limit to a customer, which was approximately $20.6 million at December 31, 2015. Loans made to one individual customer, even if secured by different collateral, are aggregated for purposes of the lending limit. There were no loans in excess of the legal lending limit at December 31, 2015. A $13.7 million threshold, which amounts to approximately 10% of total regulatory capital, reflects an additional internal monitoring guideline. There were no such relationships in excess of $13.7 million at December 31, 2015.\nLoans increased $92.8 million, or 12%, to $874.8 million at December 31, 2015, versus $781.9 million at December 31, 2014. This growth was the result of an increase in loan demand in the owner occupied real estate, commercial and industrial, construction and development, and consumer categories driven by the successful execution of our relationship banking strategy which focuses on customer service.\nInvestment Securities\nInvestment securities considered available-for-sale are investments that may be sold in response to changing market and interest rate conditions, and for liquidity and other purposes. Our investment securities classified as available-for-sale consist primarily of U.S. Government agency collateralized mortgage obligations (CMO), agency mortgage-backed securities (MBS), municipal securities, corporate bonds, asset-backed securities (ABS), and pooled trust preferred securities (CDO). Available-for-sale securities totaled $284.8 million at December 31, 2015, compared to $185.4 million at December 31, 2014. The increase was primarily due to the purchase of available-for-sale securities totaling $146.7 million partially offset by sales and pay downs of securities totaling $42.9 million during 2015. At December 31, 2015, the portfolio had a net unrealized loss of $4.0 million compared to a net unrealized gain of $129,000 at December 31, 2014. The change in value of the investment portfolio was driven by an increase in market interest rates which drove a decrease in value of the bonds held in our portfolio during 2015.\nInvestment securities held-to-maturity are investments for which there is the intent and ability to hold the investment to maturity. These investments are carried at amortized cost. The held-to-maturity portfolio consists primarily of U.S. Government agency Small Business Investment Company bonds (SBIC), CMO's and MBS's. The fair value of securities held-to-maturity totaled $171.8 million and $68.3 million at December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014, respectively. The increase was due to the purchase of $121.4 million of held-to-maturity securities partially offset by pay downs of securities totaling $16.7 million during 2015.\nRestricted Stock\nRestricted stock, which represents a required investment in the capital stock of correspondent banks related to available credit facilities, is carried at cost as of December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014. As of those dates, restricted stock consisted of investments in the capital stock of the Federal Home Loan Bank of Pittsburgh (\"FHLB\") and Atlantic Community Bankers Bank (\"ACBB\").\nAt December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014, the investment in FHLB stock totaled $2.9 million and $1.0 million, respectively. The increase was due to a short-term borrowing from FHLB. At both December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014, ACBB stock totaled $143,000.\nOther Real Estate Owned\nThe balance of other real estate owned increased to $11.3 million at December 31, 2015 from $3.7 million at December 31, 2014, primarily due to transfers from loan receivable totaling $11.5 million, partially offset by writedowns in the amount of $3.1 million on existing foreclosed properties and sales totaling $792,000 during 2015. The increase in other real estate owned was primarily driven by a single asset in the amount of $7.7 million that transferred from loans receivable during 2015. A write-down of $2.2 million was recorded in the fourth quarter of 2015 as a result of our decision to aggressively market and pursue a sale of the largest non-performing asset on the balance sheet at year end.\nDeposits\nDeposits, which include non-interest and interest-bearing demand deposits, money market, savings and time deposits, are Republic's major source of funding. Deposits are generally solicited from the Company's market area through the offering of a variety of products to attract and retain customers, with a primary focus on multi-product relationships.\nTotal deposits increased by $177.1 million to $1.2 billion at December 31, 2014, from $1.1 billion at December 31, 2014. The increase was primarily the result of a $117.2 million increase in demand deposits and a $67.7 million increase in money market and savings deposits, which reflects the success of our retail-focused strategy of gathering low-cost core deposits. We will continue to focus our efforts on the growth of deposit balances through the successful execution of our relationship banking model which is based upon a high level of customer service and satisfaction. We are also in the midst of an aggressive expansion and relocation plan which we refer to as \"The Power of Red is Back.\" Over the last two years we have opened five new store locations and have several more in various stages of construction and development. This strategy has also allowed us to nearly eliminate our dependence upon the more volatile sources of funding found in brokered and public fund certificates of deposit.\nShort-term Borrowings\nAs of December 31, 2015, there were $47.0 million in short-term borrowings from FHLB compared to $0 at December 31, 2014. The increase in borrowings was the result of a temporary outflow of deposits at year end which returned in the early part of 2016.\nShareholders' Equity\nTotal shareholders' equity increased $564,000 to $113.4 million at December 31, 2015, compared to $112.8 million at December 31, 2014, primarily due to the recognition of net income of $2.4 million during 2015 and the issuance of stock based compensation in the amount of $600,000 offset by an increase in accumulated other comprehensive losses associated with unrealized losses in the investment securities portfolio resulting in a decrease of $2.5 million. The shift in market value of the securities portfolio resulted in accumulated other comprehensive losses of $3.2 million at December 31, 2015 compared to accumulated other comprehensive losses of $632,000 at December 31, 2014. This was primarily driven by an increase in market interest rates which drove a decrease in value of the bonds held in our portfolio during 2015.\nInvestment Securities Portfolio\nRepublic's investment securities portfolio is intended to provide liquidity and contribute to earnings while diversifying credit risk. We attempt to maximize earnings while minimizing our exposure to interest rate risk. The securities portfolio consists primarily of U.S. Government agency collateralized mortgage obligations (CMO), agency mortgage-backed securities (MBS), corporate bonds, municipal securities, asset-backed securities (ABS), pooled trust preferred securities (CDO), and U.S. Government agency Small Business Investment Company bonds (SBIC). Our ALCO committee monitors and reviews all security purchases.\nA summary of investment securities available-for-sale and investment securities held-to-maturity at December 31, 2015, 2014, and 2013 is as follows:\n\nThe strong growth in deposit balances during 2015 and 2014 has resulted in a corresponding increase in interest earning assets. The total amortized cost of the investment securities portfolio has grown to $461.1 million at December 31, 2015 compared to $253.1 million at December 31, 2014 and $209.3 million at December 31, 2013. Investment securities represented 32% of total assets at December 31, 2015 and 21% of total assets at December 31, 2014. We evaluate our investment securities portfolio on a continual basis in light of the interest rate environment and changing market conditions and when appropriate, take necessary actions to improve and enhance our overall positioning. We consider the portfolio to be well structured and of high quality. At December 31, 2015, 83% of the portfolio consisted of U.S. government agency securities which were rated Aaa/AA by the major credit rating agencies.\nThe investment securities portfolio includes securities classified as both available for sale and held to maturity. During 2015 and 2014 we began to designate a portion of our securities portfolio as held to maturity based our intent and ability to hold those securities until they mature.\nThe fair value of investment securities is impacted by interest rates, credit spreads, market volatility and liquidity conditions. The fair value of investment securities generally decreases when interest rates rise and increases when interest rates fall. In addition, the fair value generally decreases when credit spreads widen and increases when credit spreads tighten. Net unrealized losses in the total investment securities portfolio increased to $4.4 million at December 31, 2015 compared to unrealized gains of $0.5 million at December 31, 2014. The comparable amounts for the securities classified as available for sale were unrealized losses of $4.0 million at December 31, 2015 and unrealized gains of $0.1 million at December 31, 2014.\nNo single issuer of securities (excluding government agencies) in the portfolio exceeded more than 10% of shareholders' equity at December 31, 2015 with the exception of corporate bonds issued by Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley. The Goldman Sachs bonds had a book value of $18.0 million and a market value of $17.9 million. The Morgan Stanley bonds had a book value of $15.0 million and a market value of $15.1 million at December 31, 2015. No single issuer of securities (excluding government agencies) in the portfolio exceeded more than 10% of shareholders' equity at December 31, 2014 with the exception of corporate bonds issued by Morgan Stanley. The Morgan Stanley bonds had a book value of $12.0 million and a market value of $12.2 million at December 31, 2014.\nAt December 31, 2015, the investment portfolio included thirty-eight municipal securities with a total market value of $23.3 million. These securities are reviewed quarterly for impairment. Research on each issuer is completed to assess the financial stability of the municipal entity. The largest geographic concentration was in Pennsylvania and New Jersey where thirty-one municipal securities had a market value of $18.8 million. As of December 31, 2015, management found no evidence of other than temporary impairment (\"OTTI\") on any of the municipal securities held in the investment securities portfolio.\nAt December 31, 2015, the portfolio included two asset-backed securities with a total market value of $17.0 million, the majority of which (97%) is guaranteed by the U.S. Dept. of Education, which were in an unrealized loss position. Management believes the unrealized losses on these securities were driven by market interest rates and not a result of any credit deterioration.\nAt December 31, 2015, the portfolio also included three pooled trust preferred securities (CDOs) with a market value of $1.9 million. The unrealized loss for the CDOs was due to the secondary market for such securities becoming inactive and is considered temporary.\nDuring 2015, the Company sold four CDO securities. Proceeds from the sale of the CDO securities totaled $2.0 million. Gross gains of $70,000 and gross losses of $288,000 were realized on these sales. The tax provision applicable to the net losses for the twelve months ended December 31, 2015 amounted to $78,000. Management had previously stated that it did not intend to sell the CDO securities prior to their maturity or the recovery of their cost bases, nor would it be forced to sell these securities prior to maturity or recovery of the cost bases. This statement was made over a period of several years where there was limited trading activity in the pooled trust preferred CDO market resulting in fair market value estimates well below the book values. During 2015, management received several inquiries regarding the availability of the CDO securities and noted an increased level of trading in this type of security. As a result of the increased activity and the level of bids received, management elected to sell the four CDOs resulting in a net loss of $218,000 during 2015 which was offset by gains on sales of agency mortgage- backed securities and corporate bonds. The Bank continues to demonstrate the ability and intent to hold the remaining CDOs until maturity or recovery of the cost bases, but will evaluate future opportunities to sell the remaining CDOs if they arise.\nDuring 2015, the Company also sold twenty-nine agency mortgage-backed securities and two corporate bonds. Proceeds of sales totaled $9.7 million. Gross gains of $326,000 were realized on these sales. The tax provision applicable to the gross gains amounted to $117,000.\nThe following table presents the maturity distribution and weighted average yield by holding type and year of maturity of our investment securities portfolio at December 31, 2015. Collateralized mortgage obligations and agency mortgage-backed securities have expected maturities that differ from contractual maturities because borrowers have the right to call or prepay and, therefore, these securities are classified separately with no specific maturity date.\n\nFair Value of Financial Instruments\nManagement uses its best judgment in estimating the fair value of the Company's financial instruments; however, there are inherent weaknesses in any estimation technique. Therefore, for substantially all financial instruments, the fair value estimates herein are not necessarily indicative of the amounts the Company could have realized in a sale transaction on the dates indicated. The estimated fair value amounts have been measured as of their respective year-ends and have not been re-evaluated or updated for purposes of these financial statements subsequent to those respective dates. As such, the estimated fair values of these financial instruments subsequent to the respective reporting dates may be different than the amounts reported at each year-end.\nThe Company follows the guidance issued under ASC 820, Fair Value Measurement, which defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value under GAAP, and identifies required disclosures on fair value measurements.\nASC 820 establishes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to valuation methods used to measure fair value. The hierarchy gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1 measurements) and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs (Level 3 measurements). The three levels of the fair value hierarchy under ASC 820 are as follows:\nLevel 1: Unadjusted quoted prices in active markets that are accessible at the measurement date for identical, unrestricted assets or liabilities.\nLevel 2: Quoted prices in markets that are not active, or inputs that are observable either directly or indirectly, for substantially the full term of the asset or liability.\nLevel 3: Prices or valuation techniques that require inputs that are both significant to the fair value measurement and unobservable (i.e., supported with little or no market activity).\nAn asset's or liability's level within the fair value hierarchy is based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement.\nThe fair value of securities available for sale (carried at fair value) and held to maturity (carried at amortized cost) are determined by obtaining quoted market prices on nationally recognized securities exchanges (Level 1), or matrix pricing (Level 2), which is a mathematical technique used widely in the industry to value debt securities without relying exclusively on quoted market prices for the specific securities but rather by relying on the securities' relationship to other benchmark quoted prices. For certain securities, which are not traded in active markets or are subject to transfer restrictions, valuations are adjusted to reflect illiquidity and/or non-transferability, and such adjustments are generally based on available market evidence (Level 3). In the absence of such evidence, management's best estimate is used. Management's best estimate consists of both internal and external support on certain Level 3 investments. Internal cash flow models using a present value formula that includes assumptions market participants would use along with indicative exit pricing obtained from broker/dealers (where available) were used to support fair values of certain Level 3 investments.\nThe types of instruments valued on matrix pricing in active markets include all of the U.S. government and agency securities, municipal obligations and corporate bonds. Such instruments are generally classified within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy. As required by ASC 820, we do not adjust the matrix pricing for such instruments.\nLevel 3 is for positions that are not traded in active markets or are subject to transfer restrictions, and may be adjusted to reflect illiquidity and/or non-transferability, with such adjustment generally based on available market evidence. In the absence of such evidence, management's best estimate is used. Subsequent to inception, management only changes Level 3 inputs and assumptions when corroborated by evidence such as transactions in similar instruments, completed or pending third-party transactions in the underlying investment or comparable entities, subsequent rounds of financing, recapitalizations and other transactions across the capital structure, offerings in the equity or debt markets, and changes in financial ratios or cash flows. The Level 3 investment securities currently held in the Company's portfolio are classified as available for sale and consist of various issues of trust preferred securities and a single corporate bond.\nThe trust preferred securities are pools of similar securities that are grouped into an asset structure commonly referred to as collateralized debt obligations (\"CDOs\") which consist of the debt instruments of various banks, diversified by the number of participants in the security as well as geographically. These securities are performing according to terms, however the secondary market for such securities had become inactive for several years, and were therefore classified as Level 3 securities. The fair value analysis does not reflect or represent the actual terms or prices at which any party could purchase the securities.\nThe following table presents a reconciliation of the securities available for sale measured at fair value on a recurring basis using significant unobservable inputs (Level 3) for the year ended December 31, 2015, 2014, and 2013:\n\nAn independent, third party pricing service is used to estimate the current fair market value of each CDO held in the investment securities portfolio. The calculations used to determine fair value are based on the attributes of the trust preferred securities, the financial condition of the issuers of the trust preferred securities, and market based assumptions. The INTEX CDO Deal Model Library was utilized to obtain information regarding the attributes of each security and its specific collateral as of December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014. Financial information on the issuers was also obtained from Bloomberg, the FDIC and SNL Financial. Both published and unpublished industry sources were utilized in estimating fair value. Such information includes loan prepayment speed assumptions, discount rates, default rates, and loss severity percentages. A detailed explanation of the assumptions used to estimate the fair market value of the CDOs can be found in Note 14 \"Fair Value Measurements and Fair Values of Financial Investments\" to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nThe fair market valuation for each CDO was determined based on discounted cash flow analyses. The cash flows are primarily dependent on the estimated speeds at which the trust preferred securities are expected to prepay, the estimated rates at which the trust preferred securities are expected to defer payments, the estimated rates at which the trust preferred securities are expected to default, and the severity of the losses on securities that do default.\nIncreases (decreases) in actual or expected issuer defaults tend to decrease (increase) the fair value of the Company's senior and mezzanine tranches of CDOs. The values of the Company's mezzanine tranches of CDOs are also affected by expected future interest rates. However, due to the structure of each security, timing of cash flows, and secondary effects on the financial performance of the underlying issuers, the effects of changes in future interest rates on the fair value of the Company's holdings are not quantifiably estimable.\nAlso included in Level 3 investment securities classified as available for sale is one corporate bond transferred from Level 2 in 2010 since the bond is not actively traded. Impairment would depend on the repayment ability of the underlying issuer, which is assessed through a detailed quarterly review of the issuer's financial statements. The issuer is a \"well capitalized\" financial institution as defined by federal banking regulations and has demonstrated the ability to raise additional capital, when necessary, through the public capital markets. The fair value of this corporate bond is estimated by obtaining a price of a comparable floating rate debt instrument through Bloomberg.\nLoan Portfolio\nOur loan portfolio consists of secured and unsecured commercial loans including commercial real estate loans, construction and land development loans, commercial and industrial loans, owner occupied real estate loans, consumer and other loans, and residential mortgages. Commercial loans are primarily secured term loans made to small to medium-sized businesses and professionals for working capital, asset acquisition and other purposes. Commercial loans are originated as either fixed or variable rate loans with typical terms of 1 to 5 years. Republic's commercial loans typically range between $250,000 and $5.0 million, but customers may borrow significantly larger amounts up to Republic's legal lending limit of approximately $20.6 million at December 31, 2015. Management has established an internal monitoring guideline for loan relationships in the amount of $13.7 million which approximates 10% of capital and reserves. Individual customers may have several loans often secured by different collateral. There were no such relationships in excess of the legal lending limit or the internal monitoring guideline of $13.7 million at December 31, 2015.\nThe majority of loans outstanding are with borrowers in our marketplace, Philadelphia and surrounding suburbs, including southern New Jersey. In addition, we have loans to customers whose assets and businesses are concentrated in real estate. Repayment of our loans is in part dependent upon general economic conditions affecting our market place and specific industries. We evaluate each customer's credit worthiness on a case-by-case basis. The amount of collateral obtained is based on management's credit evaluation of the customer. Collateral varies but primarily includes residential, commercial and income-producing properties.\nAt December 31, 2015, we had loan concentrations exceeding 10% of total loans for credits extended to lessors of nonresidential real estate in the aggregate amount of $206.3 million, which represented 23.6% of gross loans receivable and lessors of residential real estate in the aggregate amount of $120.0 million, which represented 13.7% of gross loans receivable. Loan concentrations are considered to exist when amounts are loaned to multiple numbers of borrowers engaged in similar activities that management believes would cause them to be similarly impacted by economic or other conditions. At December 31, 2015, we had no foreign loans outstanding.\nThe following table sets forth gross loans by major categories for the periods indicated:\n\nTotal loans, net of deferred loan fees, increased $92.8 million, or 12%, to $874.8 million at December 31, 2015, versus $781.9 million at December 31, 2014. This growth was the result of an increase in loan demand in the owner occupied real estate, commercial and industrial, construction and development, and consumer categories driven by the successful execution of our relationship banking strategy which focuses on customer service. Our largest loan category, commercial real estate, decreased by $29.5 million from $379.3 million at December 31, 2014 to $349.7 million at December 31, 2015. Net transfers to other loan categories as a result of periodic quality control reviews amounted to $14.6 million in 2015. In addition, a total of $10.1 million was transferred to other real estate owned in 2015.\nLoan Maturity and Interest Rate Sensitivity\nThe amount of loans outstanding by category as of the dates indicated, which are due in: (i) one year or less, (ii) more than one year through five years, and (iii) over five years, is shown in the following table. Loan balances are also categorized according to their sensitivity to changes in interest rates.\n\nIn the ordinary course of business, loans maturing within one year may be renewed, in whole or in part, as to principal amount, and at interest rates prevailing at the date of renewal. At December 31, 2015, 71.9% of total loans were fixed rate compared to 68.0% at December 31, 2014.\nCredit Quality\nRepublic's written lending policies require specific underwriting, loan documentation and credit analysis standards to be met prior to funding, with independent credit department approval for the majority of new loan balances. A committee consisting of senior management and certain members of the Board of Directors oversees the loan approval process to monitor that proper standards are maintained, while approving the majority of commercial loans.\nLoans, including impaired loans, are generally classified as non-accrual if they are past due as to maturity or payment of interest or principal for a period of more than 90 days, unless such loans are well-secured and in the process of collection. Loans that are on a current payment status or past due less than 90 days may also be classified as non-accrual if repayment of principal and/or interest in full is in doubt. Loans may be returned to accrual status when all principal and interest amounts contractually due are reasonably assured of repayment within an acceptable period of time, and there is a sustained period of repayment performance by the borrower, in accordance with the contractual terms.\nWhile a loan is classified as non-accrual, any collections of interest and principal are generally applied as a reduction to principal outstanding. When the future collectability of the recorded loan balance is expected, interest income may be recognized on a cash basis. For non-accrual loans, which have been partially charged off, recognition of interest on a cash basis is limited to that which would have been recognized on the recorded loan balance at the contractual interest rate. Cash interest receipts in excess of that amount are recorded as recoveries to the allowance for loan losses until prior charge-offs have been fully recovered.\nThe following summary shows information concerning loan delinquency and non-performing assets at the dates indicated:\n\n(1) Non-performing loans are comprised of (i) loans that are on non-accrual basis and (ii) accruing loans that are 90 days or more past due. Non-performing assets are composed of non-performing loans and other real estate owned.\nProblem loans can consist of loans that are performing, but for which potential credit problems of the borrowers have caused management to have serious doubts as to the ability of such borrowers to continue to comply with present repayment terms. At December 31, 2015, all identified problem loans included in the preceding table are internally classified and have been evaluated for a specific reserve allocation in the allowance for loan losses (see discussion on \"Allowance for Loan Losses\").\nNon-performing assets decreased by $1.2 million, or 5%, to $23.9 million at December 31, 2015, compared to $25.2 million at December 31, 2014. This decrease was primarily due to a combination of loan paydowns, OREO sales, loan charge-offs, and OREO writedowns totaling $9.4 million which were offset by transfers of $8.2 million from performing to non-performing assets during 2015.\nThe following summary shows the impact on interest income of non-accrual loans, subsequent to being placed on non-accrual for the periods indicated:\n\nAllowance for Loan Losses\nThe allowance for loan losses is a valuation allowance for probable losses inherent in the loan portfolio. The Company evaluates the need to establish an allowance against loan losses on a quarterly basis. When an increase in this allowance is necessary, a provision for loan losses is charged to earnings. The allowance for loan losses consists of three components. The first component is allocated to individually evaluated loans found to be impaired and is calculated in accordance with ASC 310 Receivables. The second component is allocated to all other loans that are not individually identified as impaired pursuant to ASC 310-10 (\"non-impaired loans\"). This component is calculated for all non-impaired loans on a collective basis in accordance with ASC 450 Contingencies. The third component is an unallocated allowance to account for a level of imprecision in management's estimation process.\nThe Company evaluates loans for impairment and potential charge-off on a quarterly basis. Management regularly monitors the condition of borrowers and assesses both internal and external factors in determining whether any loan relationships have deteriorated. Any loan rated as substandard or lower will have an individual collateral evaluation analysis prepared to determine if a deficiency exists. We first evaluate the primary repayment source. If the primary repayment source is determined to be insufficient and unlikely to repay the debt, we then look to the secondary repayment sources. Secondary sources are conservatively reviewed for liquidation values. Updated appraisals and financial data are obtained to substantiate current values. If the reviewed sources are deemed to be inadequate to cover the outstanding principal and any costs associated with the resolution of the troubled loan, an estimate of the deficient amount will be calculated and a specific allocation of loan loss reserve is recorded.\nFactors considered in the calculation of the allowance for non-impaired loans include several qualitative and quantitative factors such as historical loss experience, trends in delinquency and nonperforming loan balances, changes in risk composition and underwriting standards, experience and ability of management, and general economic conditions along with other external factors. Historical loss experience is analyzed by reviewing charge-offs over a three year period to determine loss rates consistent with the loan categories depicted in the allowance for loan loss table below.\nThe factors supporting the allowance for loan losses do not diminish the fact that the entire allowance for loan losses is available to absorb losses in the loan portfolio and related commitment portfolio, respectively. The Company's principal focus, therefore, is on the adequacy of the total allowance for loan losses. The allowance for loan losses is subject to review by banking regulators. The Company's primary bank regulators regularly conduct examinations of the allowance for loan losses and make assessments regarding the adequacy and the methodology employed in their determination.\nA detailed analysis of our allowance for loan losses for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014, 2013, 2012 and 2011 is as follows:\n\n(1) Includes non-accruing loans.\nThe provision for loan losses is charged to operations in an amount necessary to bring the total allowance for loan losses to a level that management believes is adequate to absorb inherent losses in the loan portfolio. The Company recorded a loan loss provision in the amount of $500,000 in 2015 compared to a $900,000 provision in 2014. Non-performing loans decreased by $8.8 million, or 41%, to $12.6 million at December 31, 2015, compared to $21.4 million at December 31, 2014. Impaired loans also decreased to $22.1 million at December 31, 2015 from $35.6 million at December 31, 2014. An increase in the allowance required for loans collectively evaluated for impairment driven by growth in the loan portfolio was offset by a reduction associated with an improvement in the factor used for historical loss experience during 2015.\nThe allowance for loan losses as a percentage of non-performing loans (coverage ratio) was 69.0% at December 31, 2015 as compared to 53.8% at December 31, 2014 and 117.7% at December 31, 2013. The decrease in the coverage ratio at December 31, 2015 when compared to December 31, 2014 was primarily the result of a decrease in non-performing loans during 2015. This decrease was primarily driven by our largest non-performing loan that transferred to OREO in the second quarter 2015. A reserve for this loan was recorded during the fourth quarter of 2013 when it was initially downgraded. Coverage is considered adequate by management as of December 31, 2015.\nManagement makes at least a quarterly determination as to an appropriate provision from earnings to maintain an allowance for loan losses that it determines is adequate to absorb inherent losses in the loan portfolio. The Board of Directors periodically reviews the status of all non-accrual and impaired loans and loans classified by the management team. The Board of Directors also considers specific loans, pools of similar loans, historical charge-off activity, economic conditions and other relevant factors in reviewing the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses. Any additions deemed necessary to the allowance for loan losses are charged to operating expenses.\nThe Company evaluates loans for impairment and potential charge-offs on a quarterly basis. Any loan rated as substandard or lower will have a collateral evaluation analysis completed in accordance with the guidance under generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) on impaired loans to determine if a deficiency exists. Our credit monitoring process assesses the ultimate collectability of an outstanding loan balance from all potential sources. When a loan is determined to be uncollectible it is charged-off against the allowance for loan losses. Unsecured commercial loans and all consumer loans are charged-off immediately upon reaching the 90-day delinquency mark unless they are well secured and in the process of collection. The timing on charge-offs of all other loan types is subjective and will be recognized when management determines that full repayment, either from the cash flow of the borrower, collateral sources, and/or guarantors, will not be sufficient and that repayment is unlikely. A full or partial charge-off is recognized equal to the amount of the estimated deficiency calculation.\nSerious delinquency is often the first indicator of a potential charge-off. Reductions in appraised collateral values and deteriorating financial condition of borrowers and guarantors are factors considered when evaluating potential charge-offs. The likelihood of possible recoveries or improvements in a borrower's financial condition is also assessed when considering a charge-off.\nPartial charge-offs of non-performing and impaired loans can significantly reduce the coverage ratio and other credit loss statistics due to the fact that the balance of the allowance for loan losses will be reduced while still carrying the remainder of a non-performing loan balance in the impaired loan category. The amount of non-performing loans for which there were partial charge-offs during the year amounted to $3.4 million at December 31, 2015 compared to $17.8 million at December 31, 2014. This decrease was primarily driven by our largest non-performing loan that transferred to OREO in the second quarter 2015.\nThe Company's charge-off policy is reviewed on an annual basis and updated as necessary. During the twelve months ended December 31, 2015, there have been no changes made to this policy.\nWe have an existing loan review program, which monitors the loan portfolio on an ongoing basis. A loan review officer who reviews both the loan portfolio and overall adequacy of the allowance for loan losses conducts this loan review on a quarterly basis and reports directly to the Board of Directors.\nEstimating the appropriate level of the allowance for loan losses at any given date is difficult, particularly in a continually changing economy. In management's opinion, the allowance for loan losses was appropriate at December 31, 2015. However, there can be no assurance that, if asset quality deteriorates in future periods, additions to the allowance for loan losses will not be required.\nManagement is unable to determine in which loan category future charge-offs and recoveries may occur. The following schedule sets forth the allocation of the allowance for loan losses among various categories. The allocation is based on management's evaluation of historical charge-off experience and adjusted for several qualitative factors. The entire allowance for loan losses is available to absorb loan losses in any loan category.\nThe allocation of the allowance for loan losses for the past five years is as follows:\n\nThe allowance for loan losses is an amount that represents management's estimate of known and inherent losses related to the loan portfolio and unfunded loan commitments. Because the allowance for loan losses is dependent, to a great extent, on the general economy and other conditions that may be beyond our control, the estimate of the allowance for loan losses could differ materially in the near term.\nThe allowance consists of specific, general and unallocated components. The specific component relates to impaired loans. For such loans, an allowance is established when the discounted cash flows, collateral value, or observable market price of the impaired loan is lower than the carrying value of that loan. The general component covers the remainder of the portfolio and is based on historical loss experience adjusted for several qualitative factors. An unallocated component is maintained to cover uncertainties that could affect management's estimate of probable losses. The unallocated component of the allowance reflects the margin of imprecision inherent in the underlying assumptions used in the methodologies for estimating specific and general losses in the portfolio. All identified losses are immediately charged off and therefore no portion of the allowance for loan losses is restricted to any individual loan or group of loans, and the entire allowance is available to absorb any and all loan losses.\nIn estimating the allowance for loan losses, management considers current economic conditions, past loss experience, diversification of the loan portfolio, delinquency statistics, results of internal loan reviews and regulatory examinations, borrowers' perceived financial and managerial strengths, the adequacy of underlying collateral, if collateral dependent, or present value of future cash flows, and other relevant and qualitative risk factors. These qualitative risk factors include:\n 1. Lending policies and procedures, including underwriting standards and collection, charge-off and recovery practices. \n 2. National, regional and local economic and business conditions as well as the condition of various segments. \n 3. Nature and volume of the portfolio and terms of loans. \n 4. Experience, ability and depth of lending management and staff. \n 5. Volume and severity of past due, classified and nonaccrual loans as well as other loan modifications. \n 6. Quality of the Company's loan review system, and the degree of oversight by the Company's Board of Directors. \n 7. Existence and effect of any concentration of credit and changes in the level of such concentrations. \n 8. Effect of external factors, such as competition and legal and regulatory requirements. \nEach factor is assigned a value to reflect improving, stable or declining conditions based on management's best judgment using relevant information available at the time of the evaluation. Adjustments to the factors are supported through documentation of changes in conditions in a narrative accompanying the allowance for loan loss calculation.\nWe also provide specific reserves for impaired loans to the extent the estimated realizable value of the underlying collateral is less than the loan balance, when the collateral is the only source of repayment. Also, we estimate and recognize reserve allocations on loans classified as \"internally classified accruing loans\" based upon any factor that might impact loss estimates. Those factors include but are not limited to the impact of economic conditions on the borrower and management's potential alternative strategies for loan or collateral disposition. An unallocated allowance is established for losses that have not been identified through the formulaic and other specific components of the allowance as described above. Management has identified several factors that impact credit losses that are not considered in either the formula or the specific allowance segments. These factors consist of macro and micro economic conditions, industry and geographic loan concentrations, changes in the composition of the loan portfolio, changes in underwriting processes and trends in problem loan and loss recovery rates. The impact of the above is considered in light of management's conclusions as to the overall adequacy of underlying collateral and other factors.\nThe majority of our loan portfolio represents loans made for commercial purposes, while significant amounts of residential property may serve as collateral for such loans. We attempt to evaluate larger loans individually, on the basis of our loan review process, which scrutinizes loans on a selective basis and other available information. Even if all commercial purpose loans could be reviewed, information on potential problems might not be available. Our portfolio of loans made for purposes of financing residential mortgages and consumer loans are evaluated in groups. At December 31, 2015, loans made for commercial real estate, construction and land development, commercial and industrial, owner occupied real estate, consumer and other, and residential mortgage purposes, respectively, amounted to $349.7 million, $46.5 million, $181.9 million, $246.4 million, $48.1 million, and $2.4 million.\nA loan is considered impaired, in accordance with ASC 310, when based on current information and events, it is probable that the Company will be unable to collect all amounts due from the borrower in accordance with the contractual terms of the loan. Impaired loans include nonperforming commercial loans, but also include internally classified accruing loans. As of December 31, 2015, management identified a total of four troubled debt restructurings in the loan portfolio in the amount of $8.8 million. Three troubled debt restructurings in the amount of $9.6 million were identified as of December 31, 2014.\nThe following table presents the Company's impaired loans at December 31, 2015, 2014, and 2013:\n\nThe recorded investment in loans that are impaired in accordance with ASC 310 totaled $22.1 million, $35.6 million, and $32.5 million at December 31, 2015, 2014, and 2013, respectively. The amounts of related valuation allowances were $2.2 million, $5.1 million, and $5.6 million, respectively at those dates. For the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014, and 2013, the average recorded investment in impaired loans was approximately $29.5 million, $33.0 million, and $33.7 million, respectively. Republic earned $516,000, $614,000, and $1.2 million of interest income on impaired loans (internally classified accruing loans) in 2015, 2014, and 2013, respectively. There were no commitments to extend credit to any borrowers with impaired loans as of the end of the periods presented herein.\nTotal impaired loans decreased by $13.5 million, or 38%, during the year ended December 31, 2015. This decrease was primarily driven by our largest non-performing loan relationship that transferred to OREO in the second quarter 2015. The valuation allowance related to impaired loans decreased to $2.2 million at December 31, 2015 compared to $5.1 million at December 31, 2014. At December 31, 2015 and 2014, internally classified accruing loans totaled approximately $9.5 million and $14.2 million, respectively.\nThe following table presents the Company's 30 to 89 days past due loans at December 31, 2015, 2014, and 2013:\n\nThe increase in loan balances 30 to 59 days past due was the result of delinquency in one lending relationship at December 31, 2015 in the amount of $1.1 million that moved from current status at December 31, 2014. The decrease in loan balances 60 to 89 days past due was the result of delinquency in one lending relationship at December 31, 2014 in the amount of $5.0 million that moved to non-accrual status in 2015. Management has engaged in active discussions with all delinquent relationships to address delinquencies and is confident that acceptable resolutions will be achieved in the near term.\nDeposits\nTotal deposits at December 31, 2015 were $1.2 billion, an increase of $177.1 million or 16.5% from total deposits of $1.1 billion at December 31, 2014. Total deposits by account type at December 31, 2015, 2014, and 2013 are as follows:\n\nIn general, Republic pays higher interest rates on time deposits compared to other deposit categories. Republic's various deposit liabilities may fluctuate from period-to-period, reflecting customer behavior and strategies to optimize net interest income. The increase in total deposits to $1.2 billion at December 31, 2015 from $1.1 billion at December 31, 2014 was primarily the result of a $117.2 million increase in demand deposits, a $67.7 million increase in money market and savings deposits, which reflects the success of our retail-focused strategy of gathering low-cost core deposits. This strategy has also allowed us to nearly eliminate our dependence on the more volatile source of funding in internet based certificates of deposit.\nThe average balances and weighted average rates of Republic's deposits for the last three years are as follows:\n\nThe remaining maturity of certificates of deposit for $100,000 or more as of December 31, 2015 is as follows:\n\nThe following is a summary of the remaining maturity of time deposits, which includes certificates of deposits of $100,000 or more, as of December 31, 2015:\n\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe are a party to financial instruments with off-balance-sheet risk in the normal course of business to meet the financing needs of our customers. These financial instruments include commitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit. These instruments involve to varying degrees, elements of credit and interest rate risk in excess of the amount recognized in the financial statements.\nCredit risk is defined as the possibility of sustaining a loss due to the failure of the other parties to a financial instrument to perform in accordance with the terms of the contract. The maximum exposure to credit loss under commitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit is represented by the contractual amount of these instruments. We use the same underwriting standards and policies in making credit commitments as we do for on-balance-sheet instruments.\nFinancial instruments whose contract amounts represent potential credit risk are commitments to extend credit of approximately $165.1 million and $138.4 million and standby letters of credit of approximately $5.2 million and $3.8 million at December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. Commitments often expire without being drawn upon. The $165.1 million of commitments to extend credit at December 31, 2015, substantially all were variable rate commitments.\nCommitments to extend credit are agreements to lend to a customer as long as there is no violation of any condition established in the contract. Commitments generally have fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses and many require the payment of a fee. Since many of the commitments are expected to expire without being drawn upon, the total commitment amounts do not necessarily represent future cash requirements. The Company evaluates each customer's creditworthiness on a case-by-case basis. The amount of collateral obtained upon extension of credit is based on management's credit evaluation of the customer. Collateral held varies but may include real estate, marketable securities, pledged deposits, equipment and accounts receivable.\nStandby letters of credit are conditional commitments issued that guarantee the performance of a customer to a third party. The credit risk and collateral policy involved in issuing letters of credit is essentially the same as that involved in extending loan commitments. The amount of collateral obtained is based on management's credit evaluation of the customer. Collateral held varies but may include real estate, marketable securities, pledged deposits, equipment and accounts receivable.\nContractual Obligations and Other Commitments\nThe following table sets forth contractual obligations and other commitments representing required and potential cash outflows as of December 31, 2015:\n\nAs of December 31, 2015, we had entered into non-cancelable lease agreements for our main office and operations center, twelve current Republic retail branch facilities, two loan offices, and one training center expiring on various dates through November 30, 2034, including renewal options. The leases are accounted for as operating leases. The minimum rental payments required under these leases are $22.6 million through the year 2034.\nWe have retirement plan agreements with certain directors and officers. At December 31, 2015, the accrued benefits under the plan were approximately $1.3 million, with a minimum age of 65 established to qualify for the payments.\nInterest Rate Risk Management\nWe attempt to manage our assets and liabilities in a manner that optimizes net interest income in a range of interest rate environments. Management uses an \"interest sensitivity gap\" (\"GAP\") analysis and simulation models to monitor behavior of its interest sensitive assets and liabilities. A GAP analysis is the difference between interest-sensitive assets and interest-sensitive liabilities. Adjustments to the mix of assets and liabilities are made periodically in an effort to provide steady growth in net interest income.\nManagement presently believes that the effect of any future reduction in interest rates, reflected in lower yielding assets, could be detrimental since we may not have the immediate ability to commensurately decrease rates on interest bearing liabilities, primarily time deposits, other borrowings and certain transaction accounts. An increase in interest rates could have a negative effect due to a possible lag in the re-pricing of core deposits not taken into account in the static GAP analysis. Interest rate risk management involves managing the extent to which interest-sensitive assets and interest-sensitive liabilities are matched. We attempt to optimize net interest income while managing period-to-period fluctuations therein. We typically define interest-sensitive assets and interest-sensitive liabilities as those that re-price within one year or less. Generally, we limit long-term fixed rate assets and liabilities in our efforts to manage interest rate risk.\nA positive GAP occurs when interest-sensitive assets exceed interest-sensitive liabilities re-pricing in the same time periods, and a negative GAP occurs when interest-sensitive liabilities exceed interest-sensitive assets re-pricing in the same time periods. A negative GAP ratio suggests that a financial institution may be better positioned to take advantage of declining interest rates rather than increasing interest rates, and a positive GAP ratio suggests the converse. Static GAP analysis describes interest rate sensitivity at a point in time. However, it alone does not accurately measure the magnitude of changes in net interest income as changes in interest rates do not impact all categories of assets and liabilities equally or simultaneously. Interest rate sensitivity analysis also requires assumptions about re-pricing certain categories of assets and liabilities. For purposes of interest rate sensitivity analysis, assets and liabilities are stated at their contractual maturity, estimated likely call date, or earliest re-pricing opportunity. Mortgage-backed securities and amortizing loans are scheduled based on their anticipated cash flow, including prepayments based on historical data and current market trends. Savings, money market and interest-bearing demand accounts do not have a stated maturity or re-pricing term and can be withdrawn or re-priced at any time. Management estimates the re-pricing characteristics of these accounts based upon decay rates and run off projections obtained in a deposit study performed by an independent third party, along with management's estimates of when rates would have to be increased to retain balances in response to competition. Such estimates are necessarily arbitrary and wholly judgmental. As a result of the run off projections, these deposits are not considered to re-price simultaneously and, accordingly, a portion of the deposits are moved into time brackets exceeding one year. However, management may choose not to re-price liabilities proportionally to changes in market interest rates, for competitive or other reasons.\nShortcomings, inherent in a simplified and static GAP analysis, may result in an institution with a negative GAP having interest rate behavior associated with an asset-sensitive balance sheet. For example, although certain assets and liabilities may have similar maturities or periods to re-pricing, they may react in different degrees to changes in market interest rates. Furthermore, re-pricing characteristics of certain assets and liabilities may vary substantially within a given time period. In the event of a change in interest rates, prepayments and other cash flows could also deviate significantly from those assumed in calculating GAP in the manner presented in the table on the following page.\nThe following tables present a summary of our GAP analysis at December 31, 2015. Amounts shown in the table include both estimated maturities and instruments scheduled to re-price, including prime based loans. For purposes of these tables, we have used assumptions based on industry data and historical experience to calculate the expected maturity of loans because, statistically, certain categories of loans are prepaid before their maturity date, even without regard to interest rate fluctuations. Additionally, certain prepayment assumptions were made with regard to investment securities based upon the expected prepayment of the underlying collateral of the mortgage-backed securities. The interest rate on a portion of the CDOs is variable and adjusts quarterly.\n\n\n(1) Demand, savings and money market accounts are scheduled to reprice based upon decay rate and run off percentage estimates obtained through a deposit study performed by an independent third party, along with management's estimates of when rates would have to be increased to retain balances in response to competition. Such estimates are necessarily arbitrary and wholly judgmental.\nIn addition to the GAP analysis, we utilize income simulation modeling in measuring our interest rate risk and managing our interest rate sensitivity. Income simulation considers not only the impact of changing market interest rates on forecasted net interest income, but also other factors such as yield curve relationships, the volume and mix of assets and liabilities and general market conditions.\nNet Portfolio Value and Net Interest Income Analysis\nThe income simulation models management used to measure interest rate risk and manage interest rate sensitivity generates estimates of the change in net portfolio value (NPV) and net interest income (NII) over a range of interest rate scenarios. NPV is the present value of expected cash flows from assets, liabilities, and off-balance sheet contracts. The NPV ratio, under any interest rate scenario, is defined as the NPV in that scenario divided by the market value of assets in the same scenario. The following table sets forth our NPV as of December 31, 2015 and reflects the changes to NPV as a result of immediate and sustained changes in interest rates as indicated (dollars in thousands):\n\nIn addition to modeling changes in NPV, we also analyze potential changes to NII for a forecasted twelve-month period under rising and falling interest rate scenarios. The following table shows the NII model as of December 31, 2015 (dollars in thousands):\n\n(1)The net interest income results were calculated assuming a rate ramp, achieving the rate change over a 12-month period, not an immediate and sustained rate shock.\nAs is the case with the GAP table, certain shortcomings are inherent in the methodology used in the above interest rate risk measurements. Modeling changes in NPV and NII require the making of certain assumptions, which may or may not reflect the manner in which actual yields and costs respond to changes in market interest rates. In this regard, the models presented assume that the composition of our interest sensitive assets and liabilities existing at the beginning of a period remains constant over the period being measured and also assumes that a particular change in interest rates is reflected uniformly across the yield curve regardless of the duration to maturity or re-pricing of specific assets and liabilities. Accordingly, although the NPV measurements and net interest income models provide an indication of interest rate risk exposure at a particular point in time, such measurements are not intended to and do not provide a precise forecast of the effect of changes in market interest rates on net interest income and will differ from actual results.\nManagement believes that the assumptions utilized in evaluating our estimated net interest income are reasonable. However, the interest rate sensitivity of our assets, liabilities and off-balance sheet financial instruments as well as the estimated effect of changes in interest rates on estimated net interest income could vary substantially if different assumptions are used or actual experience differs from the experience on which the assumptions were based. Periodically, we may and do make significant changes to underlying assumptions, which are wholly judgmental. Prepayments on residential mortgage loans and mortgage-backed securities have increased over historical levels in recent years due to the lower interest rate environment, and may result in reductions in margins.\nCapital Resources\nWe have sponsored three outstanding issues of corporation-obligated mandatorily redeemable capital securities of a subsidiary trust holding solely junior subordinated debentures of the Corporation more commonly known as trust preferred securities. The subsidiary trusts are not consolidated for financial reporting purposes. The purpose of the issuances of these securities was to increase capital. The trust preferred securities qualify as Tier 1 capital for regulatory purposes in amounts up to 25% of total Tier 1 capital.\nOn December 27, 2006, Republic Capital Trust II (Trust II) issued $6.0 million of trust preferred securities to investors and $0.2 million of common securities to us. Trust II purchased $6.2 million of our floating rate junior subordinated debentures due 2037, and we used the proceeds to call the securities of Republic Capital Trust I (Trust I). The debentures purchased by Trust II have a variable interest rate, adjustable quarterly, at 1.73% over the 3-month LIBOR. We may redeem the debentures on any interest payment date without a prepayment penalty.\nOn June 28, 2007, Republic Capital Trust III (Trust III), issued $5.0 million of trust preferred securities to one investor and $0.2 million common securities to us. Trust III purchased $5.2 million of our floating rate junior subordinated debentures due 2037, which have a variable interest rate, adjustable quarterly, at 1.55% over the 3 month LIBOR. We have the ability to redeem the debentures on any interest payment date without a prepayment penalty.\nOn June 10, 2008, Republic First Bancorp Capital Trust IV (Trust IV) issued $10.8 million of convertible trust preferred securities as part of our strategic capital plan. The securities were purchased by investors, including Vernon W. Hill, II, founder and chairman (retired) of Commerce Bancorp, and, since the investment, a consultant to the Company. The investor group also included a family trust of Harry D. Madonna, our chairman, president and chief executive officer, and Theodore J. Flocco, Jr., who has been elected by the shareholders to our Board of Directors and serves as the Chairman of our Audit Committee. Trust IV also issued $0.3 million of common securities to the Company. Trust IV purchased $11.1 million of our fixed rate junior subordinated convertible debentures due 2038, which pay interest at an annual rate of 8.0% and are redeemable on any interest payment date (a) at any time on or after June 13, 2013 if the closing price of our common stock for 20 trading days in the period of 30 consecutive trading days ending on the trading day prior to the mailing of the notice of redemption exceeds 120% of the then-applicable conversion price, or (b) on or after June 30, 2018, without a prepayment penalty. The trust preferred securities of Trust IV are currently convertible into approximately 1.7 million shares of our common stock, which is subject to customary adjustments.\nAdditionally, on April 22, 2014, the Company issued 11,842,106 shares of its common stock in a private placement for gross proceeds of $45.0 million.\nShareholders' equity as of December 31, 2015 totaled approximately $113.4 million compared to approximately $112.8 million as of December 31, 2014. The book value per share of our common stock increased to $3.00 as of December 31, 2015, based upon 37,837,003 shares outstanding, from $2.98 as of December 31, 2014, based upon 37,815,503 shares outstanding at December 31, 2014. Outstanding shares are adjusted for treasury stock and deferred compensation plan shares by the Company.\nRegulatory Capital Requirements\nThe Company is required to comply with certain \"risk-based\" capital adequacy guidelines issued by the FRB and the FDIC. The risk-based capital guidelines assign varying risk weights to the individual assets held by a bank. The guidelines also assign weights to the \"credit-equivalent\" amounts of certain off-balance sheet items, such as letters of credit and interest rate and currency swap contracts.\nIn July 2013, the federal bank regulatory agencies adopted revisions to the agencies' capital adequacy guidelines and prompt corrective action rules, which were designed to enhance such requirements and implement the revised standards of the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision, commonly referred to as Basel III. The final rules generally implement higher minimum capital requirements, add a new common equity tier 1 capital requirement, and establish criteria that instruments must meet to be considered common equity tier 1 capital, additional tier 1 capital or tier 2 capital. Effective as of January 1, 2015, the new minimum capital to risk-adjusted assets requirements are a common equity tier 1 capital ratio of 4.5% (6.5% to be considered \"well capitalized\") and a tier 1 capital ratio of 6.0%, increased from 4.0% (and increased from 6.0% to 8.0% to be considered \"well capitalized\"); the total capital ratio remains at 8.0% under the new rules (10.0% to be considered \"well capitalized\"). Under the new rules, in order to avoid limitations on capital distributions (including dividend payments and certain discretionary bonus payments to executive officers), a banking organization must hold a capital conservation buffer comprised of common equity tier 1 capital above its minimum risk-based capital requirements, which amount must be greater than 2.5% of total risk-weighted assets at January 1, 2019. The capital contribution buffer requirements phase in over a three-year period beginning January 1, 2016. Management has reviewed the new standards and evaluated all options and strategies to ensure compliance with the new standards. Both Republic and the Company met the \"well capitalized\" standards applicable to them as of December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014.\nThe risk-based capital ratios measure the adequacy of a bank's capital against the riskiness of its assets and off-balance sheet activities. Failure to maintain adequate capital is a basis for \"prompt corrective action\" or other regulatory enforcement action. In assessing a bank's capital adequacy, regulators also consider other factors such as interest rate risk exposure; liquidity, funding and market risks; quality and level or earnings; concentrations of credit, quality of loans and investments; risks of any nontraditional activities; effectiveness of bank policies; and management's overall ability to monitor and control risks.\nManagement believes that the Company and Republic met, as of December 31, 2015 and 2014, all capital adequacy requirements to which we are subject. In the current year, the FDIC categorized Republic as well capitalized under the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action provisions of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act. There are no calculations or events since that notification which management believes would have changed Republic's category.\nThe Company and Republic's ability to maintain the required levels of capital is substantially dependent upon the success of their capital and business plans, the impact of future economic events on Republic's loan customers and Republic's ability to manage its interest rate risk, growth and other operating expenses.\nThe following table presents our regulatory capital ratios at December 31, 2015 and 2014:\n\nLiquidity\nA financial institution must maintain and manage liquidity to ensure it has the ability to meet its financial obligations. These obligations include the payment of deposits on demand or at their contractual maturity; the repayment of borrowings as they mature; the payment of lease obligations as they become due; the ability to fund new and existing loans and other funding commitments; and the ability to take advantage of new business opportunities. Liquidity needs can be met by either reducing assets or increasing liabilities. Our most liquid assets consist of cash, amounts due from banks and federal funds sold.\nRegulatory authorities require us to maintain certain liquidity ratios in order for funds to be available to satisfy commitments to borrowers and the demands of depositors. In response to these requirements, we have formed an asset/liability committee (ALCO), comprised of certain members of Republic's Board of Directors and senior management to monitor such ratios. The ALCO committee is responsible for managing the liquidity position and interest sensitivity. That committee's primary objective is to maximize net interest income while configuring Republic's interest-sensitive assets and liabilities to manage interest rate risk and provide adequate liquidity for projected needs. The ALCO committee meets on a quarterly basis or more frequently if deemed necessary.\nOur target and actual liquidity levels are determined by comparisons of the estimated repayment and marketability of interest-earning assets with projected future outflows of deposits and other liabilities. Our most liquid assets, comprised of cash and cash equivalents on the balance sheet, totaled $27.1 million at December 31, 2015, compared to $128.8 million at December 31, 2014. Loan maturities and repayments are another source of asset liquidity. At December 31, 2015, Republic estimated that more than $45.0 million of loans would mature or repay in the six-month period ending June 30, 2016. Additionally, a significant portion of our investment securities are available to satisfy liquidity requirements through sales on the open market or by pledging as collateral to access credit facilities. At December 31, 2015, we had outstanding commitments (including unused lines of credit and letters of credit) of $170.4 million. Certificates of deposit scheduled to mature in one year totaled $50.1 million at December 31, 2015. We anticipate that we will have sufficient funds available to meet all current commitments.\nDaily funding requirements have historically been satisfied by generating core deposits and certificates of deposit with competitive rates, buying federal funds or utilizing the credit facilities of the FHLB. We have established a line of credit with the FHLB of Pittsburgh. Our maximum borrowing capacity with the FHLB was $440.6 million at December 31, 2015. As of December 31, 2015 and 2014, we had outstanding borrowings with the FHLB of $47.0 and $0 respectively. As of December 31, 2015, FHLB had issued letters of credit, on Republic's behalf, totaling $75.1 million against our available credit line. We also established a contingency line of credit of $10.0 million with Atlantic Community Bankers Bank (\"ACBB\") to assist in managing our liquidity position. We had no amounts outstanding against the ACBB line of credit at December 31, 2015 and 2014.\nVariable Interest Entities\nThe Company follows the guidance under ASC 810, Consolidation, with regard to variable interest entities. ASC 810 clarifies the application of consolidation principles for certain legal entities in which voting rights are not effective in identifying the investor with the controlling financial interest. An entity is subject to consolidation under ASC 810 if the investors do not have sufficient equity at risk for the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support, are unable to direct the entity's activities, or are not exposed to the entity's losses or entitled to its residual returns (\"variable interest entities\"). Variable interest entities within the scope of ASC 810 will be required to be consolidated by their primary beneficiary. The primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity is determined to be the party that absorbs a majority of the entity's expected losses, receives a majority of its expected returns, or both.\nThe Company does not consolidate its subsidiary trusts. ASC 810 precludes consideration of the call option embedded in the preferred securities when determining if the Company has the right to a majority of the trusts' expected residual returns. The non-consolidation results in the investment in the common securities of the trusts to be included in other assets with a corresponding increase in outstanding debt of $676,000. In addition, the income received on the Company's investment in the common securities of the trusts is included in other income.\nEffects of Inflation\nThe majority of assets and liabilities of a financial institution are monetary in nature. Therefore, a financial institution differs greatly from most commercial and industrial companies that have significant investments in fixed assets or inventories. Management believes that the most significant impact of inflation on financial results is our need and ability to react to changes in interest rates. As discussed previously, management attempts to maintain an essentially balanced position between rate sensitive assets and liabilities over a one-year time horizon in order to protect net interest income from being affected by wide interest rate fluctuations.", "item_7_tables": "Table 40: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> For the Year Ended\nDecember 31, 2015\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td>

2015 compared to 2014, due to growth in interest-earning assets.\n\n- Non-interest income increased by $1.9 million, or 24%, in 2015 compared to 2014, primarily due to a $2.6 million insurance settlement. \n\n- Non-interest expenses increased by $6.5 million, or 16%, in 2015 compared to 2014, mainly due to expenses associated with the company's expansion strategy.\n\n- Asset quality improved as non-performing loans decreased 41% and non-performing assets decreased 5% in 2015.\n\n- Total deposits grew by $177 million, or 17%, in 2015 compared to 2014, reflecting the success of the
