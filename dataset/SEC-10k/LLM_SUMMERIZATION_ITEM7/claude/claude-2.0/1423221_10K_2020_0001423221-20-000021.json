Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nThe following discussion and analysis contains forward-looking statements based on our current assumptions, expectations, estimates and projections about our business and the homebuilding industry, and therefore, it should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes thereto, as well as the \"Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\" discussed elsewhere within this Annual Report on Form 10-K. For a listing of potential risks and uncertainties which impact our business and industry, see \"Item 1A. Risk Factors.\" Actual results could differ from our expectations due to several factors which include, but are not limited to: the impact of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, market price and demand for our products, economic and competitive conditions, capital expenditures, new technology, regulatory changes and other uncertainties. Unless otherwise required by law, we undertake no obligation to publicly update any forward-looking statements, even if new information becomes available or other events occur in the future.\nOur Business\nWe manufacture components for original equipment manufacturers in the building products industry. These components can be categorized as window and door (fenestration) components and kitchen and bath cabinet components. Examples of fenestration components include (1) energy-efficient flexible insulating glass spacers, (2) extruded vinyl profiles, (3) window and door screens, and (4) precision-formed metal and wood products. In addition, we provide certain other non-fenestration components and products, which include solar panel sealants, trim moldings, vinyl decking, fencing, water retention barriers, and conservatory roof components. We use low-cost production processes and engineering expertise to provide our customers with specialized products for their specific window, door, and cabinet applications. We believe these capabilities provide us with unique competitive advantages. We serve a primary customer base in North America and the U.K., and also serve customers in international markets through our operating plants in the U.K. and Germany, as well as through sales and marketing efforts in other countries.\nWe continue to invest in organic growth initiatives and we intend to continue evaluating business acquisitions that allow us to expand our existing fenestration and cabinet component footprint, enhance our product offerings, provide new complementary technology, enhance our leadership position within the markets we serve, and expand into new markets or service lines. We have disposed of non-core businesses in the past, and continue to evaluate our business portfolio to ensure that we are investing in markets where we believe there is potential future growth.\nWe currently have three reportable business segments: (1) North American Fenestration segment ( NA Fenestration\u201d), comprising three operating segments, manufacturing vinyl profiles, IG spacers, screens and other fenestration components; (2) European Fenestration segment ( EU Fenestration\u201d), comprising our U.K.-based vinyl extrusion business, manufacturing vinyl profiles and conservatories, and the European insulating glass business manufacturing IG spacers; and (3) North American Cabinet Components segment ( NA Cabinet Components\u201d), comprising our North American cabinet door and components business and two wood-manufacturing plants. We maintain a grouping called Unallocated Corporate & Other, which includes transaction expenses, stock-based compensation, long-term incentive awards based on the performance of our common stock and other factors, certain severance and legal costs not deemed to be allocable to all segments, depreciation of corporate assets, interest expense, other, net, income taxes and inter-segment eliminations, and executive incentive compensation and medical expense fluctuations relative to planned costs as determined during the annual planning process. Other corporate general and administrative costs have been allocated to the reportable business segments, based upon a relative measure of profitability in order to more accurately reflect each reportable business segment's administrative costs. We allocate corporate expenses to businesses acquired mid-year from the date of acquisition. The accounting policies of our operating segments are the same as those used to prepare our accompanying consolidated financial statements. Corporate general and administrative expenses allocated during the years ended October 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018 were $21.7 million, $18.3 million and $18.7 million, respectively.\nNotable Items\nCOVID-19 Impacts\nOn March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization,(WHO), declared the outbreak of COVID-19 to be a global pandemic and recommended containment and mitigation measures. Our first priority with regard to the COVID-19 pandemic is to do everything we can to ensure the safety, health and welfare of our employees, customers, suppliers and other partners. With the implementation of health and safety practices at our facilities, we are continuing to supply the industry during this uncertain time, recognizing the essential role the construction industry plays in providing housing and necessary infrastructure.\nAs federal, state and local governments react to the public health crisis, significant uncertainties have been created in the economy. The COVID-19 pandemic and its related effects continue to have a significant adverse effect on many sectors of the economy and we may be further impacted.\nAs part of our response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we have taken the following measures:\n\u2022We are continuing to provide our products to support critical infrastructure needs while following national, state, and local guidelines required to continue operations during the existence of the pandemic and related local declarations of emergency. All manufacturing facilities in the United States and Germany remained operational for the duration of the pandemic while both U.K. plants shut down in late March 2020 and became operational again during May 2020. However, local or regional hotspots of the pandemic could result in other locations being temporarily idled due to the need to deep clean areas where an employee who has tested positive for COVID-19 worked.\n\u2022While we currently expect any negative impact on sales to be temporary and minimal, the duration of the COVID-19 pandemic, the actions to contain the pandemic and treat its impacts, and the effects on our operations are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted at this time.\n\u2022We reassessed and adjusted our operational needs, including reducing our 2020 capital expenditure plans by approximately 25% to 30%.\n\u2022We have taken precautionary measures intended to help minimize the risk of the virus to our employees, including temporarily requiring some employees to work remotely.\n\u2022We continue to monitor the rapidly evolving situation and guidance from international and domestic authorities, including federal, state and local public health authorities and may take additional actions based on their recommendations. In these circumstances, there may be developments outside our control requiring us to adjust our operating plan.\nTax Cuts and Job Act\nOn December 22, 2017, President Trump signed into law the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the Act) that included sweeping tax reform which affected U.S. corporations, including a reduction of the statutory federal corporate tax rate from 35% to 21%. We made an initial assessment of the Act and recorded a discrete benefit of $6.5 million, which included a charge of $1.2 million for a one-time mandatory transition tax on deemed repatriation of previously tax-deferred and unremitted foreign earnings during the fiscal year ended October 31, 2018. We completed the accounting for the income tax effects of the Act and recorded a charge of $0.4 million for the re-measurement of the one-time mandatory transition tax during the year ended October 31, 2019. The Act also imposed additional tax law changes that became effective during fiscal 2019, which include new requirements for a global intangible low-taxed income provision (GILTI) and a deduction for foreign-derived intangible income (FDII), which resulted in a net charge of $1.2 million during the year ended October 31, 2019.\nMarket Overview and Outlook\nWe believe the primary drivers of our operating results continue to be North American residential remodeling and replacement (R&R) and new home construction activity. We believe that housing starts and window shipments are indicators of activity levels in the homebuilding and window industries, and we use this data, as published by or derived from third-party sources, to evaluate the market. We have historically evaluated the market using data from the National Association of Homebuilders (NAHB) with regard to housing starts, and published reports by Ducker Worldwide, LLC (Ducker), a consulting and research firm, with regard to window shipments in the U.S. We obtain market data from Catalina research, a consulting and research firm, for insight into the U.S. residential wood cabinet demand.\nIn November 2020, the NAHB forecasted calendar-year housing starts (excluding manufactured units) to be 1.4 million in 2020, 1.3 million in 2021, and 1.4 million in 2022. The November 2020 Ducker forecast indicated that window shipments in the R&R market are expected to decrease approximately 1% for calendar year 2020 and increase 2% and 3% in 2021 and 2022, respectively. Derived from reports published by Ducker, the overall decrease in window shipments for the trailing twelve months ended September 30, 2020 was 0.3%. During this period, new construction activities increased 1.1% and R&R decreased 1.4%. In November 2020, Catalina Research estimated that residential semi-custom cabinet demand in the U.S. will decline approximately 6% in 2020, however, 2021 is estimated to grow 3.7%. In line with market forecasts, we expect that some sales originally planned for the year ended October 31, 2020 may be realized during the years ended October 31, 2021 and 2022.\nOur U.K. vinyl business (commonly referred to as \"Liniar\") is largely focused on the sale of vinyl house systems under the trade name Liniar\u201d to smaller window manufacturers in the U.K. Liniar is one of the larger providers of vinyl extruded products in the U.K. in terms of volume shipped. Currently, the U.K. is experiencing a shortage in affordable housing, with rising demand due in part to a growing immigrant population. Liniar's current primary customers are smaller window fabricators, as opposed to the larger OEMs that comprise a large portion of the North American market. These manufacturers seek the quality and technology of the specific products identified by the Liniar trade name. In addition, Liniar services non-fenestration markets including the manufacture of roofing for conservatories, vinyl decking and vinyl water retention barriers\nused for landscaping. We believe there are growth opportunities within these markets in the U.K. and potential synergies which may enable us to sell complementary products.\nNA Cabinet Components manufactures kitchen and bathroom cabinet doors and components, amongst other products, using a variety of woods from traditional hardwoods to engineered wood products. Currently, most of the revenue in the NA Cabinet Components is earned in the U.S., so domestic housing starts and R&R activity constitute the primary drivers of this business as well. The cabinet door market is stratified as follows: stock (low-cost, low-variations), semi-custom (more customized, just-in-time manufacturing, higher price point) and custom (precise customer specifications, just-in-time manufacturing, high-end price point). NA Cabinet Component's primary market is semi-custom.\nOur business is seasonal, particularly our fenestration business, as inclement weather during the winter months tends to slow down construction, particularly as related to outside of the house\u201d construction. To some extent, we believe our kitchen and bathroom cabinet door business lessens the impact of seasonality on our operating results, as the cabinet business is inside of the house\u201d and less susceptible to weather.\nWe are impacted by regulation of energy standards. Although the U.S. government has been less aggressively pursuing higher energy efficiency standards in recent years, other countries have implemented higher energy efficiency standards which should bode well for our fenestration-related business in these markets, particularly our warm-edge spacer products.\nSeveral commodities in our business are subject to pricing fluctuations, including polyvinyl resin (PVC), titanium dioxide (TiO2), petroleum products, aluminum and wood. For the majority of our customers and critical suppliers, we have price adjusters in place which effectively share the base pass-through price changes for our primary commodities with our customers commensurate with the market at large. Our long-term exposure to these price fluctuations is somewhat mitigated due to the contractual component of the adjuster program. However, these adjusters are not in place with all customers and for all commodities, and there is a level of exposure to such volatility due to the lag associated with the timing of price updates in accordance with our customer agreements, particularly with regard to hardwoods. In addition, some of these commodities, such as silicone, are in high demand, particularly in Europe, which can affect the cost of the raw materials, a portion of which we may not be able to fully recover. Thus far we have not experienced any supply or logistics disruptions as lower demand has not required us to source the same level of supply.\nOn June 23, 2016, citizens of the U.K. voted to exit the European Union (E.U.) (referred to as Brexit). In October 2019, the U.K. and E.U. ratified a withdrawal agreement, and subsequently the U.K. left the E.U. on January 31, 2020. A transition period is in place until December 31, 2020 while the U.K. and E.U. negotiate additional arrangements. The current E.U. rules for trade, travel, and business for the U.K. will lapse on December 31, 2020 with any new rules taking effect January 1, 2021.\nGiven the lack of comparable precedent, it is difficult for us to predict the future impacts on our U.K. based operations, which accounted for approximately 15% of our total sales for the year ended October 31, 2020. Due to the fact that we manufacture and sell a majority of our U.K. products within the U.K., there is minimal risk to our ability to physically deliver goods and complete sales. As such, we believe we are well positioned within the U.K. to respond to potential changes to underlying demand as a result of the final Brexit outcome. The primary risk mitigation focus for our U.K. operations centers on the availability and pricing of raw materials. While we source the majority of our raw materials from within the U.K., many of the primary upstream raw materials our vendors use are being sourced from outside of the U.K., which could expose us to cross-border issues and raw material price impacts. We will mitigate this potential impact of Brexit on the import of goods to the U.K. by strategically managing our inventory levels and logistical channels.\nIn February 2020, the U.K. announced its intention to introduce border controls and our U.K. businesses have positioned themselves well to cope with additional demands and tariffs that this will bring in order to comply and facilitate the flow of goods in and out of the U.K. We are still clarifying what the impact of associated tariffs could be.\nThe global economy remains uncertain due to currency devaluations, political unrest, terror threats, global pandemics such as COVID-19, and even the political landscape in the U.S. These and other macro-economic factors have impacted the global financial markets, which may have contributed to significant changes in foreign currencies. We continue to monitor our exposure to changes in exchange rates.\nComparison of the fiscal years ended October 31, 2020 and 2019\nThis table sets forth our consolidated results of operations for the twelve-month periods ended October 31, 2020 and 2019.\nTable 16: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>For the Years Ended October 31, </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 vs. 2019 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Amounts </td> <td> </td> <td>% of Sales </td> <td> </td> <td>Amounts </td> <td> </td> <td>% of Sales </td> <td> </td> <td>$ Change </td> <td> </td> <td>Variance % </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>(Dollars in millions) </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net sales </td> <td>$ </td> <td>851.6 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>100% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>893.8 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>100% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(42.2) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(5)% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cost of sales (excluding depreciation and amortization) </td> <td>658.8 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>77% </td> <td> </td> <td>694.4 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>78% </td> <td> </td> <td>(35.6) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Selling, general and administrative </td> <td>89.7 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>11% </td> <td> </td> <td>101.2 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>11% </td> <td> </td> <td>(11.5) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>11% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Restructuring charges </td> <td>0.6 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>-% </td> <td> </td> <td>0.4 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>-% </td> <td> </td> <td>0.2 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(50)% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Depreciation and amortization </td> <td>47.2 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6% </td> <td> </td> <td>49.6 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6% </td> <td> </td> <td>(2.4) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Asset impairment charges </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>-% </td> <td> </td> <td>74.6 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>8% </td> <td> </td> <td>(74.6) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>100% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating income (loss) </td> <td>55.3 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6% </td> <td> </td> <td>(26.4) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(3)% </td> <td> </td> <td>81.7 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>309% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest expense </td> <td>(5.2) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(1)% </td> <td> </td> <td>(9.6) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(1)% </td> <td> </td> <td>4.4 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>46% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other, net </td> <td>0.2 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>-% </td> <td> </td> <td>0.1 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>-% </td> <td> </td> <td>0.1 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>100% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Income tax expense </td> <td>(11.8) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(1)% </td> <td> </td> <td>(10.8) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(1)% </td> <td> </td> <td>(1.0) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(9)% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net income (loss) </td> <td>$ </td> <td>38.5 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(46.7) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(5)% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>85.2 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>182% </td> </tr>\n</table>\nOur year-over-year results by reportable segment follow.

Net sales decreased $20.4 million, or 4%, for the twelve months ended October 31, 2020 compared to the same period in 2019, which was primarily driven by a decrease in volumes of $22.9 million, which includes the impacts of COVID-19. The decrease in volume was partially offset by increases in prices and surcharges of $2.5 million.\nCost of Sales. Cost of sales decreased $14.4 million, or 4%, for the twelve months ended October 31, 2020 compared to the same period in 2019. Cost of sales decreased due to lower volumes during the period, including a corresponding decrease in selling expenses as a result of the impacts of COVID-19 as mentioned above.\nSelling, General and Administrative. Our selling, general and administrative expenses decreased by $2.6 million, or 5%, for the twelve months ended October 31, 2020 compared to the same period in 2019. This decrease was due primarily to lower general expenses due to COVID-19 restrictions and lower compensation and benefits year-over-year.\nRestructuring Charges. Restructuring charges incurred during the twelve months ended October 31, 2020 and 2019 relate to facility lease expense for a vinyl extrusion plant in the U.S. which was closed in January 2017 that has not been sublet or otherwise exited as of October 31, 2020.\nEU Fenestration\nTable 18: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>For the Years Ended October 31, </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>$ Change </td> <td> </td> <td>Variance % </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>(Dollars in millions) </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net sales </td> <td>$ </td> <td>161.1 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>164.9 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(3.8) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(2)% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cost of sales (excluding depreciation and amortization) </td> <td>108.8 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>114.1 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(5.3) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Selling, general and administrative </td> <td>22.7 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>23.0 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(0.3) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Depreciation and amortization </td> <td>9.5 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>8.8 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.7 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(8)% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating income </td> <td>$ </td> <td>20.1 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>19.0 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1.1 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating income margin </td> <td>12 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>12 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nNet Sales. Net sales decreased $3.8 million, or 2%, when comparing the twelve months ended October 31, 2020 compared to the same period in 2019. A decrease in volumes of $5.5 million year-over-year, which includes of the impacts of COVID-19 was partially offset by $1.1 million of base price increases and $0.6 million of favorable foreign currency rate changes.\nCost of Sales. The cost of sales decreased $5.3 million for the twelve months ended October 31, 2020 compared to the same period in 2019. Cost of sales decreased due to lower volumes during the period, including a corresponding decrease in selling expenses as a result of the impacts of COVID-19 as mentioned above.\nSelling, General and Administrative. Our selling, general and administrative expense decreased $0.3 million for the twelve months ended October 31, 2020 compared to the same period in 2019. The decrease is due to savings incurred from reduced marketing and other general expenses as a result of COVID-19 restrictions, reimbursements for labor costs in the U.K. from government aid for COVID-19 furloughs, and lower incentive compensation.\nNA Cabinet Components\nTable 19: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>For the Years Ended October 31, </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>$ Change </td> <td> </td> <td>Variance % </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>(Dollars in millions) </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net sales </td> <td>$ </td> <td>210.1 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>229.6 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(19.5) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(8)% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cost of sales (excluding depreciation and amortization) </td> <td>179.8 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>197.2 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(17.4) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>9% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Selling, general and administrative </td> <td>18.7 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>18.8 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(0.1) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Restructuring charges </td> <td>0.3 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.3 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(100)% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Depreciation and amortization </td> <td>13.7 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>13.2 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.5 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(4)% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Asset impairment charge </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>74.6 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(74.6) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>100% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating loss </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(2.4) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(74.2) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>71.8 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>97% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating loss margin </td> <td>(1) </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>(32) </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nNet Sales. Net sales decreased $19.5 million for the twelve months ended October 31, 2020 compared to the same period in 2019. Approximately $14.0 million of the decrease in sales was due to lower volume related to customer strategic shifts and the impacts of COVID-19. Sales declined an additional $5.5 million due to lower price impacts.\nCost of Sales. The cost of sales decreased $17.4 million for the twelve months ended October 31, 2020 compared to the same period in 2019 as a result of lower volume, including a corresponding decrease in selling expenses as a result of the impacts of COVID-19 as mentioned above.\nSelling, General and Administrative. Our selling, general and administrative expense remained relatively flat for the twelve months ended October 31, 2020 compared to the same period in 2019.\nRestructuring Charges. Restructuring charges of $0.3 million in the twelve months ended October 31, 2020 related to severance, equipment moving and other charges incurred for a plant closure.\nAsset Impairment Charge. Asset impairment charges incurred during the twelve months ended October 31, 2019 related to goodwill impairment charges. There were no corresponding asset impairment charges incurred during the twelve months ended October 31, 2020. For further information, see Note 6, \"Goodwill and Intangible Assets,\" of the accompanying financial statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nUnallocated Corporate & Other\nTable 20: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>For the Years Ended October 31, </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>$ Change </td> <td> </td> <td>Variance % </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>(Dollars in millions) </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net sales </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(3.0) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(4.5) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1.5 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>33% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cost of sales (excluding depreciation and amortization) </td> <td>(1.6) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(3.1) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1.5 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(48)% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Selling, general and administrative </td> <td>0.5 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>9.0 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(8.5) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>94% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Depreciation and amortization </td> <td>0.4 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.6 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(0.2) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>33% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating loss </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(2.3) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(11.0) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>8.7 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>79% </td> </tr>\n</table>\nNet Sales. Net sales for Unallocated Corporate & Other represents the elimination of inter-segment sales for the twelve months ended October 31, 2020 and 2019.\nCost of Sales. Cost of sales for Corporate & Other consists of the elimination of inter-segment sales, profit in inventory, and other costs.\nSelling, General and Administrative. Our selling, general and administrative expenses decreased $8.5 million, for the twelve months ended October 31, 2020 compared to the same period in 2019. This decrease is attributable to $4.4 million of lower medical expenses, $2.0 million of lower compensation expense primarily related to the valuations of our stock based compensation awards, lower transaction costs of $1.4 million and lower severance costs related to executive severance and headcount reduction.\nChanges Related to Non-Operating Items:\nInterest Expense. Interest expense decreased $4.4 million for the twelve months ended October 31, 2020 compared to the same period in 2019 primarily due to lower interest rates and lower overall debt outstanding. The weighted average interest rate for borrowings outstanding for the twelve months ended October 31, 2020 was 2.45% compared with 4.07% for the twelve months ended October 31, 2019.\nOther, net. Other, net increased $0.1 million for the twelve months ended October 31, 2020 compared to the same period in 2019. Improvements in the impacts of foreign currency transactions were partially offset by a decrease in pension benefits year-over-year.\nIncome Taxes. We recorded income tax expense of $11.8 million on pre-tax income of $50.3 million for the twelve months ended October 31, 2020, an effective rate of 23.5%, and income tax expense of $10.8 million on pre-tax loss of $36.0 million for the twelve months ended October 31, 2019, an effective rate of 30.0%. The effective rate for the twelve months ended October 31, 2020 was impacted by the true-up of our accruals and related deferred taxes from prior year filings and settled audits. The effective rate for the twelve months ended October 31, 2019 was primarily impacted by the $74.6 million asset impairment charge in the NA Cabinet Components segment which did not generate a tax benefit, and a net charge of $1.2 million related to GILTI and FDII.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nOverview\nHistorically, our principal sources of funds have been cash on hand, cash flow from operations, and borrowings under our credit facilities. As of October 31, 2020, we had $51.6 million of cash and cash equivalents, $103.0 million outstanding under our credit facilities, $4.8 million of outstanding letters of credit and $15.3 million outstanding under finance leases. We had $217.2 million available for use under a revolving credit facility at October 31, 2020.\nOn July 29, 2016, we entered into a $450.0 million credit agreement comprising a $150.0 million Term Loan A and a $300.0 million revolving credit facility (collectively, the 2016 Credit Agreement\u201d), under which we borrowed $150.0 million and $150.0 million, respectively. The proceeds from the 2016 Credit Agreement, along with additional funding of $16.4 million of cash on hand, were used to repay outstanding borrowings under our prior credit facilities of $309.2 million, to pay a 1% prepayment call premium, to settle outstanding interest accrued, and to pay loan fees which totaled $2.8 million. In addition, we expensed $8.1 million to write-off unamortized deferred financing fees and $5.5 million of unamortized original issuer's discount associated with our prior credit facilities. The 2016 Credit Agreement was to mature in 2021 (5-year term) and required interest payments calculated, at our election and depending upon our Consolidated Leverage Ratio, at either a Base Rate plus an applicable margin (0.50% to 1.25%) or the LIBOR Rate plus an applicable margin (1.50% to 2.25%). We included deferred financing fees of $2.8 million as a contra-liability account, and were amortizing this balance straight-line over the term of the facility.\nOn October 18, 2018, we amended and restated the 2016 Credit Agreement by entering into a $325.0 million revolving credit facility (the 2018 Credit Facility\u201d), under which we borrowed $205.0 million. The proceeds from the 2018 Credit Facility, along with additional funding of $10.0 million of cash on hand, were used to repay outstanding borrowings under the 2016 Credit Agreement of $213.5 million, to settle outstanding interest accrued under the prior facility, and to pay loan fees which totaled $1.0 million. In addition, we expensed $1.1 million to write-off unamortized deferred financing fees associated with the 2016 Credit Agreement. The 2018 Credit Facility matures in 2023 (5-year term) and requires interest payments calculated, at our election and depending upon our Consolidated Leverage Ratio, at either a Base Rate plus an applicable margin (0.25% to 1.00%) or the LIBOR Rate plus an applicable margin (1.25% to 2.00%). We included deferred financing fees of $1.5 million as a contra-liability account, and are amortizing this balance straight-line over the term of the facility.\nThe weighted average interest rate of borrowings outstanding for the twelve-month periods ended October 31, 2020 and 2019 was 2.45% and 4.07%, respectively. We were in compliance with our debt covenants as of October 31, 2020. For additional details of the Credit Agreement, see \"Item 1A. Risk Factors,\" included elsewhere within this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nWe expect to repatriate excess cash moving forward and use the funds to retire debt or meet current working capital needs. Funds from operations may be impacted by softer demand and liquidity concerns of our customers as a result of COVID-19. In the U.K., we insure against a portion of our credit losses. In light of the COVID-19 pandemic, the Company has implemented a range of actions aimed at reducing costs and preserving liquidity. We believe our business model, our current cash reserves and the recent steps we have taken to strengthen our balance sheet leave us well-positioned to manage our business as a going concern and remain in compliance with our debt covenants through the COVID-19 crisis as it continues to unfold.\nAnalysis of Cash Flow\nThe following table summarizes our cash flow results for the years ended October 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018:\nTable 21: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Year Ended October 31, </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>2018 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>(In millions) </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cash flows provided by operating activities </td> <td>$ </td> <td>100.8 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>96.4 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>104.6 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cash flows used for investing activities </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(25.2) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(23.6) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(26.1) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cash flows used for financing activities </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(55.1) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(71.3) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(65.8) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nOur year-over-year cash flow analysis follows. Our cash flow analysis for the fiscal years ended October 31, 2019 and 2018 for the prior year comparative periods can be found in the annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended October 31, 2019.\nOperating Activities\nOperating cash flow for the year ended October 31, 2020 increased $4.4 million while cash flow for the year ending October 31, 2019 decreased by $8.2 million. Our ability to continue operations and deliver orders as an essential service provider mitigated some of the effects of COVID-19. Our efforts to maintain operating levels in accordance with demand allowed us to remain efficient with our working capital and use inventory effectively. To date, slower paying customers as a result of COVID-19 have not significantly impacted our liquidity, but this could become a concern in the future.\nInvesting Activities\nCash used for investing activities for the year ended October 31, 2020 increased $1.7 million compared to the year ended October 31, 2019 due to an increase of $0.8 million in our investment in capital expenditures and a decline in proceeds from the disposition of capital assets of $0.8 million.\nAt October 31, 2020, we had firm purchase commitments of approximately $2.2 million for the purchase or construction of capital assets. We plan to fund these capital expenditures through cash from operations or borrowings under our revolving credit facility.\nFinancing Activities\nIn 2020, cash used for financing activities was $55.1 million and related primarily to net debt repayments of $40.5 million, payment of dividends of $10.5 million, and share repurchases of $7.2 million. In 2019, cash used for financing activities was $71.3 million and related primarily to net debt repayments of $54.0 million, payment of dividends of $10.6 million, and share repurchases of $9.6 million.\nLiquidity Requirements\nOur strategy for deploying cash is to invest in organic growth opportunities, develop our infrastructure, and explore strategic acquisitions. Other uses of cash include paying cash dividends to our shareholders and repurchasing our own stock. We maintain cash balances in foreign countries which totaled $16.8 million and $9.8 million as of October 31, 2020 and 2019. During the years ended October 31, 2020 and 2019, we repatriated $31.9 million and $24.2 million, respectively, of foreign earnings from our international divisions.\nWe believe that we have sufficient funds and adequate financial resources available to meet our anticipated liquidity needs. We expect to use our cash flow from operations to fund operations for the next twelve months and the foreseeable future. We believe these funds should be adequate to provide for our working capital requirements, capital expenditures, and dividends, while continuing to meet our debt service requirements.\nSenior Credit Facility\nWe maintain our $325.0 million 2018 Credit Facility, which contains a revolving credit facility, with Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as Agent, Swingline Lender and Issuing Lender, and Bank of America, N.A. serving as Syndication Agent. The 2018 Credit Facility has a five-year term, maturing on October 18, 2023, and requires interest payments calculated, at our election and depending upon our Consolidated Leverage Ratio, at either a Base Rate plus an applicable margin or the LIBOR Rate plus an applicable margin. At the time of the initial borrowing, the applicable rate was LIBOR + 1.50%. In addition, we are subject to commitment fees for the unused portion of the 2018 Credit Facility. The applicable margin and commitment fees range from 0.45% to 2.30%, depending upon the type of loan and consolidated leverage ratio. The Credit Facility contains appropriate provisions to substitute LIBOR with a replacement rate upon transition away from LIBOR. These provisions include a temporary conversion of applicable interest for all borrowings outstanding to be calculated as base rate loans until such time that the replacement rate is agreed upon.\nThe 2018 Credit Facility provides for revolving credit commitments for a minimum principal amount of $10.0 million, up to an aggregate amount of $150.0 million, subject to the lender's discretion to elect or decline the incremental increase. We can also borrow up to the lesser of $15.0 million or the revolving credit commitment, as defined, under a Swingline feature of the 2018 Credit Facility.\nThe 2018 Credit Facility contains a: (1) Consolidated Interest Coverage Ratio requirement whereby we must not permit the Consolidated Interest Coverage Ratio, as defined, to be less than 2.25 to 1.00, and (2) Consolidated Leverage Ratio requirement, whereby we must not permit the Consolidated Leverage Ratio, as defined, to be greater than 3.25 to 1.00.\nIn addition to maintaining these financial covenants, the 2018 Credit Facility also limits our ability to enter into certain business transactions, such as to incur indebtedness or liens, to acquire businesses or dispose of material assets, make restricted payments, pay dividends (limited to $20.0 million per year) and to conduct other transactions as further defined in the 2018 Credit Facility. Some of these limitations, however, do not take effect so long as total leverage is less than or equal to 2.75 to 1.00 and available liquidity exceeds $25 million. Substantially all of our domestic assets, with the exception of real property, are pledged as collateral for the 2018 Credit Facility.\nIssuer Purchases of Equity Securities\nOn August 30, 2018, our Board of Directors approved a stock repurchase program that authorized the repurchase of up to $60.0 million worth of shares of our common stock. Repurchases under the new program will be made in open market transactions or privately negotiated transactions, subject to market conditions, applicable legal requirements and other relevant factors. The program does not have an expiration date or a limit on the number of shares that may be purchased. During the years ended October 31, 2020 and 2019, we purchased 450,000 shares and 583,398 shares, respectively, at a cost of $7.2 million and $9.6 million, respectively, under this program.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nThe preparation of our financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (U.S. GAAP) requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. Estimates and assumptions about future events and their effects cannot be perceived with certainty. Estimates may change as new events occur, as more experience is acquired, as additional information becomes available and as our operating environment changes. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, and that we believe provide a basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily available through open market quotes. We must use our judgment with regard to uncertainties in order to make these estimates. Actual results could differ from these estimates.\nWe believe the following are the most critical accounting policies used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements as well as the significant judgments and uncertainties affecting the application of these policies. We consider an estimate to be critical if it is subjective and if changes in the estimate using different assumptions would result in a material impact to our financial position or results of operations.\nWhile there have been no changes in the application of principles, methods, and assumptions used to determine our significant estimates, we may be required to revise certain accounting estimates and judgments related to the economic and business impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, such as, but not limited to, those related to the valuation of goodwill, intangibles, long-lived assets, accounts receivable, and inventory, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations.\nRevenue from Contracts with Customers\nRevenue recognition\nWe recognize revenue that reflects the consideration we expect to receive for product sales upon transfer to customers. Revenue for product sales is recognized when control of the promised products is transferred to our customers, and we expect to be entitled to consideration in exchange for transferring those products. We account for a contract when a customer provides us with a firm purchase order that identifies the products to be provided, the payment terms for those services, and when collectability of the consideration due is probable.\nPerformance obligations\nA performance obligation is a promise to provide the customer with a good or service. Our performance obligations include product sales, with each product included in a customer contract being recognized as a separate performance obligation. For contracts with multiple performance obligations, the standalone selling price of each product is generally readily observable.\nRevenue from product sales is recognized at a point in time when the product is transferred to the customer, in accordance with the shipping terms, which is generally upon shipment. We estimate a provision for sales returns and warranty allowances to account for product returns related to general returns and product nonconformance.\nPricing and sales incentives\nPricing is established at or prior to the time of sale with our customers and we record sales at the agreed-upon net selling price, reflective of current and prospective discounts.\nPractical expedients and exemptions\nWe generally expense incremental costs of obtaining a contract when incurred because the amortization period would be less than one year. Additionally, we do not disclose the value of unsatisfied performance obligations for contracts with an original expected length of one year or less.\nShipping and handling costs\nWe have elected to account for shipping and handling services as fulfillment services in accordance with ASC Topic 606 guidance; accordingly, freight revenue will be combined with the product deliverable rather than being accounted for as a distinct performance obligation within the terms of the agreement. Shipping and handling costs incurred by us for the delivery of goods to customers are considered a cost to fulfill the contract and are included in cost of sales in the accompanying consolidated statements of income (loss).\nContract assets and liabilities\nDeferred revenue, which is not significant, is recorded when we have remaining unsatisfied performance obligations for which we have received consideration.\nDisaggregation of revenue\nWe produce a wide variety of products that are used in the fenestration industry, including window spacer systems; extruded vinyl products; metal fabricated products; and astragals, thresholds and screens. In addition, we produce certain non-fenestration products, including kitchen and bath cabinet doors and components, flooring and trim moldings, solar edge tape, plastic decking, fencing, water retention barriers, conservatory roof components, and other products.\nAllowance for Doubtful Accounts\nWe record trade accounts receivable at billed amounts, less an allowance for doubtful accounts. This allowance is established to estimate the risk of loss associated with our trade receivables which may arise due to the inability of our customers to pay or due to changes in circumstances. The allowance is maintained at a level that we consider appropriate based on factors that affect collectability, including: (a) historical trends of write-offs, recoveries and credit losses; (b) the credit quality of our customers; and (c) projected economic and market conditions. Different assumptions or changes in economic circumstances could result in changes to the allowance. Our historical bad debt expense has been less than 0.1% of sales for the years ended October 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018. If bad debt expense increased by 1% of net sales, the impact on operating results would have been a decrease in net income of $6.4 million for the year ended October 31, 2020, an increase in net loss of $6.8 million for the year ended October 31, 2019 and a decrease in net income of $9.2 million for the year ended October 31, 2018.\nBusiness Combinations - Contingencies\nWe apply the acquisition method of accounting for business combinations in accordance with U.S. GAAP, which requires us to make use of estimates and judgments to allocate the purchase price paid for acquisitions to the fair value of the net assets and liabilities acquired. We use established valuation techniques and engage reputable valuation specialists to assist us with these valuations. However, there is a risk that we may not identify all pre-acquisition contingencies or that our estimates may not reflect the actual results when realized. We use a reasonable measurement period to record any adjustment related to the opening balance sheet (generally, less than one year). After the measurement period, changes to the opening balance sheet can result in the recognition of income or expense as period costs. To the extent these items stem from contingencies that existed at the balance sheet date, but are contingent upon the realization of future events, the cost is charged to expense at the time the future event becomes known. If our purchase accounting estimates are not correct, or if we do not recognize contingent assets or liabilities accurately, we may incur losses.\nImpairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets\nProperty, Plant and Equipment and Intangible Assets with Defined Lives\nWe make judgments and estimates in conjunction with the carrying value of our long-term assets, including property, plant and equipment, and identifiable intangibles. These judgments may include the basis for capitalization, depreciation and amortization methods and the useful lives of the underlying assets. In accordance with U.S. GAAP, we review the carrying values of these assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. We determine that the carrying amount is not recoverable if it exceeds the sum of the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the asset. If the carrying value exceeds the sum of the undiscounted cash flows and after considering alternate uses for the asset, an impairment charge would be recorded in the period in which such review is performed. We measure the impairment loss as the amount by which the carrying amount of the long-lived asset exceeds its fair value. Fair value is determined by reference to quoted market prices in active markets, if available, or by calculating the discounted cash flows associated with the use and eventual disposition of the asset. Therefore, if there are indicators of impairment, we are required to make long-term forecasts of our future revenues and costs related to the assets subject to review. Forecasts require assumptions about demand for our products and future market conditions. Although there may be no indicators of impairment in the current period, unanticipated changes to assumptions or circumstances in future periods could result in an impairment charge in the period of the change. No impairment charges were incurred with regard to our property, plant and equipment for the years ended October 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018.\nWe monitor relevant circumstances, including industry trends, general economic conditions, and the potential impact that such circumstances might have on the valuation of our identifiable intangibles. Events and changes in circumstances that may cause a triggering event and necessitate such a review include, but are not limited to: a decrease in sales for certain customers, improvements or changes in technology, and/or a decision to phase-out a trademark or trade name. Such events could negatively impact the carrying value of our identifiable intangibles. It is possible that changes in such circumstances or in the numerous variables associated with the judgments, assumptions, and estimates made by us in assessing the appropriate valuation of our identifiable intangibles could require us to further write down a portion of our identifiable intangibles and record related non-cash impairment charges in the future. We apply a variety of techniques to establish the carrying value of our intangible assets, including the relief from royalty and excess current year earnings methods.\nGoodwill\nWe use the acquisition method to account for business combinations and, to the extent that the purchase price exceeds the fair value of the net assets acquired, we record goodwill. In accordance with U.S. GAAP, we are required to evaluate our goodwill at least annually. We perform our annual goodwill assessment as of August 31, or more frequently if indicators of impairment exist. Qualitative factors that indicate impairment could include, but are not limited to, (i) macroeconomic conditions, (ii) industry and market considerations, (iii) cost factors, (iv) overall financial performance of the reporting unit, and (v) other relevant entity-specific events. The first step in our annual goodwill assessment is to perform the optional qualitative assessment allowed by ASC Topic 350 Intangibles - Goodwill and Other\u201d (ASC 350). In our qualitative assessment, we evaluate relevant events or circumstances to determine whether it is more likely than not (i.e., greater than 50%) that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. If we determine that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, ASC 350 requires us to compare the fair value of such reporting unit to its carrying value including goodwill. To determine the fair value of our reporting units, we use multiple valuation techniques including a discounted cash flow analysis, using the applicable weighted average cost of capital, in combination with a market approach that uses market multiples and a selection of guideline public companies. This test requires us to make assumptions about the future growth of our business and the market in general, as well as other variables such as the level of investment in capital expenditure, growth in working capital requirements and the terminal or residual value of our reporting units beyond the periods of estimated annual cash flows. We use a third-party valuation firm to assist us with this analysis. If the fair value of each reporting unit exceeds its carrying value, no action is required. Otherwise, an impairment loss is recorded to the extent that the carrying amount of the reporting unit including goodwill exceeds the fair value of that reporting unit. We believe the estimates and assumptions used in our impairment assessment are reasonable based on available market information, but variations in any of the assumptions could result in materially different calculations of fair value and determinations of whether or not an impairment is indicated during current or future periods.\nAs a result of quantitative assessments performed during the year ended October 31, 2019, we recorded impairment charges totaling $74.6 million during the year ended October 31, 2019, reducing the goodwill balance applicable to the reporting unit included in our NA Cabinet Components operating segment from $113.7 million to $39.1 million.\nFor the year ended October 31, 2020, the World Health Organization's declaration of COVID-19 as a global pandemic also created significant changes in market conditions that were indicators of triggering events which necessitated an evaluation of certain long-term assets, including goodwill, for potential impairment. We performed quantitative assessments based upon undiscounted cash flows we expected to realize associated with these assets over the remaining useful lives of the primary operating assets to the net book value of the long-term assets, including goodwill, and determined that these assets, including goodwill, were not impaired.\nAt our annual testing date, August 31, 2020, we had five reporting units with goodwill balances: two reporting units included in our NA Fenestration operating segment, two reporting units included in our EU Fenestration operating segment, and one reporting unit included in our NA Cabinet Components operating segment. We performed a qualitative assessment of the two reporting units in the NA Fenestration segment and one of the reporting units in the EU Fenestration segment. This review included an analysis of historical goodwill test results, operating results relative to forecast, projected results over the next five years, and other measures and concluded that there were no indicators of potential impairment associated with these reporting units. Therefore, no additional testing was deemed necessary for the reporting units in the NA Fenestration segment and the EU Fenestration segment that were assessed qualitatively. We also updated the quantitative assessments for the reportable unit in the NA Cabinet Compnents segment and the second reportable unit in the EU Fenestration segment. We determined the fair value of these reportable units exceeded the carrying value by 5% and 36%, respectively, and concluded that no impairment was necessary.\nRestructuring\nWe account for restructuring costs in accordance with U.S. GAAP, whereby we accrue for one-time severance benefits pursuant to an approved plan of restructuring at the communication date, when affected employees have been notified of the potential severance and sufficient information has been provided for the employee to calculate severance benefits, in the event the employee is involuntarily terminated. In addition, we accrue costs associated with the termination of contractual commitments including operating leases at the time the lease is terminated pursuant to the lease provisions or in accordance with another agreement with the landlord. Otherwise, we continue to recognize operating lease expense through the cease-use date. After the cease-use date, we determine if our operating lease payments are at market. We assume sublet of the facility at the market rate. To the extent our lease obligations exceed the fair value rentals, we discount to arrive at the present value and record a liability. If the facility is not sublet, we expense the amount of the lease in the current period until sublet. For other costs directly related to the restructuring effort, such as equipment moving costs, we expense in the period incurred.\nLeases\nEffective November 1, 2019, we adopted Accounting Standards Codification Topic 842, \"Leases\" (ASC Topic 842), which requires leases to be recognized on the balance sheet. We recognize a right-of-use (ROU) asset and lease liability for each operating and finance lease with a contractual term greater than 12 months at the time of lease inception. We include ROU assets and lease liabilities for leases that exist within other contracts. Leases with an original term of 12 months or less are not recognized on the balance sheet, and the rent expense related to those short-term leases is recognized over the lease term. We do not account for lease and non-lease (e.g. common area maintenance) components of contracts separately for any underlying asset class.\nWe lease certain manufacturing plants, warehouses, office space, vehicles and equipment under finance and operating leases. Lease commencement occurs on the date we take possession or control of the property or equipment. Original terms for our real estate-related leases are generally between five and twenty years. Original terms for equipment-related leases, primarily manufacturing equipment and vehicles, are generally between one and ten years. Some of our leases also include rental escalation clauses. Renewal options are included in the determination of lease payments when management determines the options are reasonably certain of exercise, considering financial performance, strategic importance and/or invested capital.\nIf readily determinable, the rate implicit in the lease is used to discount lease payments to present value; however, substantially all of our leases do not provide a readily determinable implicit rate. When the implicit rate is not determinable, our estimated incremental borrowing rate is utilized, determined on a collateralized basis, to discount lease payments based on information available at lease commencement.\nTotal lease costs recorded include fixed operating lease costs and variable lease costs. Most of our real estate leases require we pay certain expenses, such as common area maintenance costs, of which the fixed portion is included in operating lease costs. We recognize operating lease costs on a straight-line basis over the lease term. In addition to the above costs, variable lease costs are recognized when probable and are not included in determining the present value of our lease liability.\nThe ROU asset is measured at the initial amount of the lease liability adjusted for lease payments made at or before the lease commencement date and initial direct costs. For operating leases, ROU assets are reduced over the lease term by the recognized straight-line lease expense less the amount of accretion of the lease liability determined using the effective interest method. For finance leases, ROU assets are amortized on a straight-line basis over the shorter of the useful life of the leased asset or the lease term. Interest expense on each finance lease liability is recognized utilizing the effective interest method. ROU assets are tested for impairment in the same manner as long-lived assets. Additionally, we monitor for events or changes in circumstances that may require a reassessment of one of our leases and determine if a remeasurement is required.\nIncome Taxes\nWe operate in various jurisdictions and therefore our income tax expense relates to income taxes in the U.S., U.K., Canada, and Germany, as well as local and state income taxes. We recognize the effect of a change in tax rates in the period of the change. We record the estimated future tax effects of temporary differences between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and the amounts reported in our consolidated balance sheets, as well as net operating losses and tax credit carry forward. We evaluate the carrying value of our net deferred tax assets and determine if our business will generate sufficient future taxable income to realize the net deferred tax assets. We perform this review for recoverability on a jurisdictional basis, whereby we consider both positive and negative evidence related to the likelihood of realization of the deferred tax assets. The weight given to the positive and negative evidence is commensurate with the extent to which the evidence can be objectively verified. We evaluate recoverability based on an estimate of future taxable income using the long-term forecasts we use to evaluate long-lived assets, goodwill and intangible assets for impairment, taking into consideration the future reversal of existing taxable temporary differences and reviewing our current financial operations. In the event that our estimates and assumptions indicate we will not generate sufficient future taxable income to realize our deferred tax assets, we will record a valuation allowance, to the extent indicated, to reduce our deferred tax assets to their realizable value.\nAnnually, we evaluate our tax positions to determine if there have been any changes in uncertain tax positions or if there has been a lapse in the statute of limitations with regard to such positions. Our liability for uncertain tax positions at October 31, 2020 and 2019 totaled $0.5 million and $0.6 million, respectively, and related to certain state tax items regarding the interpretation of tax laws and regulations.\nWe believe we will have sufficient taxable income in the future to fully utilize our unreserved deferred tax assets recorded as of October 31, 2020. There is a risk that our estimates related to the future use of loss carry forwards and our ability to realize our deferred tax assets may not come to fruition, and that the results could materially impact our financial position and results of operations. We have recorded the benefit associated with the patent box\u201d deduction in the U.K. with regard to our operations at Liniar. We believe that it is more likely than not that our deduction with regard to this position would be sustained upon examination. Our deferred tax assets at October 31, 2020 and 2019 totaled $20.1 million and $21.0 million, respectively, against which we had recorded a valuation allowance of $1.5 million and $1.6 million, respectively.\nInsurance\nWe manage our costs of workers' compensation, group medical, property, casualty and other liability exposures through a combination of self-insurance retentions and insurance coverage with third-party carriers. Liabilities associated with our portion of this exposure are not discounted. We estimate our exposure by considering various factors which may include: (1) historical claims experience, (2) severity factors, (3) estimated claims incurred but not reported and (4) loss development factors, which are used to estimate how claims will develop over time until settled or closed. While we consider a number of factors in preparing our estimate of risk exposure, we must use our judgment to determine the amounts to accrue in our financial statements. Actual claims can differ significantly from estimated liabilities if future claims experience differs from historical experience, and if we determine that our assumptions used for analysis or our development factors are flawed. We do not recognize insurance recoveries until any contingencies relating to the claim have been resolved.\nInventory\nWe record inventory at the lower of cost or net realizable value. Inventories are valued using the first-in first-out (FIFO) method. Fixed costs related to excess manufacturing capacity have been expensed in the period, and therefore, are not capitalized into inventory. Inventory quantities are regularly reviewed and provisions for excess or obsolete inventory are recorded primarily based on our forecast of future demand and market conditions. Significant unanticipated changes to our forecasts or changes in the net realizable value of our inventory would require a change in the provision for excess or obsolete inventory. For the years ended October 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, our inventory reserves are approximately 10%, 5%, and 6% of gross inventory, respectively. Assuming an increase in obsolescence equal to 1% of gross inventory, net income would have decreased by $0.5 million for the year ended October 31, 2020, net loss would have increased by $0.5 million for the year ended October 31, 2019, and net income would have been reduced by $1.0 million for the year ended October 31, 2018.\nRetirement Plans\nWe sponsor a defined benefit pension plan and an unfunded postretirement plan that provides health care and life insurance benefits for a limited pool of eligible retirees and dependents. On January 1, 2020, we enacted changes to our pension plan whereby the benefits for all participants were frozen and thereafter those participants will receive increased benefits in the company sponsored defined contribution plan in lieu of participation in a defined benefit plan. The measurement of liabilities related to these plans is based on our assumptions related to future events, including expected return on plan assets and healthcare cost trend rates. The discount rate reflects the rate at which benefits could be effectively settled on the measurement date. We determine our discount rate using a RATE: Link Model whereby target yields are developed from bonds across a range of maturity points, and a curve is fitted to those targets. Spot rates (zero coupon bond yields) are developed from the curve and used to discount benefit payments associated with each future year. This model assumes spot rates will remain level beyond the 30-year point. We determine the present value of plan benefits by applying the discount rates to projected benefit cash flows. Actual pension plan asset investment performance, as well as other economic experience such as discount rate and demographic experience, will either reduce or increase unamortized pension losses at the end of any fiscal year, which ultimately affects future pension costs.\nAs of October 31, 2020, our projected benefit obligation (PBO) and accumulated benefit obligation (ABO) each exceeded the fair value of the plan assets by $10.7 million. As a comparison, our PBO and ABO exceeded the fair value of plan assets by $13.1 million and $12.1 million, respectively, as of October 31, 2019. During fiscal 2020, we contributed $3.7 million to the pension plan to meet minimum contribution requirements. Expected contributions are dependent on many variables, including the variability of the market value of the assets as compared to the obligation and other market or regulatory conditions. In addition, we take into consideration our business investment opportunities and our cash requirements. Accordingly, actual funding may differ greatly from current estimates. As of October 31, 2020, a 1% decrease in the discount rate would result in an increase in the PBO of $5.8 million.\nUnder U.S. GAAP, we are not required to immediately recognize the effects of a deviation between actual and assumed experience under our pension plan, or to revise our estimate as a result. This approach allows the favorable and unfavorable effects that fall within an acceptable range to be netted and disclosed as an unrecognized gain or loss. As of October 31, 2020 and 2019, a net actuarial loss of $9.9 million and $6.7 million, respectively, was included in our accumulated other comprehensive (loss) income. There were no net prior service costs or transition obligations for the years ended October 31, 2020 and 2019. The effect on fiscal years after 2020 will depend on the actual experience of the plans.\nMortality assumptions used to determine the obligations for our pension plans are based on the Pri-2012 base mortality table with MP-2018 mortality improvement scale.\nStock-Based Compensation\nWe have issued stock-based compensation in the form of stock options to directors, employees and officers, and non-vested restricted stock awards to certain key employees and officers. We apply the provisions of ASC Topic 718 Compensation - Stock Compensation\u201d (ASC 718) to determine the fair value of stock option awards on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes valuation model. We recognize the fair value as compensation expense on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period of the award based on awards ultimately expected to vest. Stock options granted to directors vest immediately while the stock options granted to our employees and officers typically vest ratably over a three-year period with service and continued employment as the vesting conditions. For new option grants to retirement-eligible employees, we recognize expense and vest immediately upon grant, consistent with the retirement vesting acceleration provisions of these grants. For employees near retirement age, we amortize such grants over the period from the grant date to the retirement-eligibility date if such period is shorter than the standard vesting schedule. For grants of non-vested restricted stock, we calculate the compensation expense at the grant date as the number of shares granted multiplied by the closing stock price of our common stock on the date of grant. This expense is recognized ratably over the vesting period. Our non-vested restricted stock grants to officers and employees cliff vest over a three-year period with service and continued employment as the only vesting criteria. Our fair value determination of stock-based payment awards on the date of grant using an option-pricing model is affected by our stock price as well as assumptions regarding a number of highly complex and subjective variables. These variables include, but are not limited to, our expected stock price volatility over the term of the awards, actual and projected employee stock option exercise behavior over the expected term, our dividend rate, risk-free rate and expectation with regards to forfeitures. Option-pricing models were developed for use in estimating the value of traded options that have no vesting or hedging restrictions and are fully transferable. Because our employee stock options have certain characteristics that are significantly different from traded options, and because changes in the subjective assumptions can materially affect the estimated value, the valuation models may not provide an accurate measure of the fair value of our employee stock options. Accordingly, that value may not be indicative of the fair value observed in a willing buyer/willing seller market transaction.\nWe have granted other awards which are linked to the performance of our common stock, but will settle in cash rather than the issuance of shares of our common stock. The value of these awards fluctuates with changes in our stock price, with the resulting gains or losses reflected in the period of the change. We have recorded current and non-current liabilities related to these awards reflected in our consolidated balance sheets at October 31, 2020 and 2019, included elsewhere within this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nIn addition, we have granted performance share awards which settle in cash and shares upon vesting. The award granted during the year ended October 31, 2018 has vesting criteria based on a market condition (relative total shareholder return) and an internal performance condition (earnings per share growth). The awards granted during the years ended October 31, 2020 and 2019 use return on net assets as the vesting condition and settle in cash. We use a Monte Carlo simulation model to value the market condition and our stock price on the date of grant to value the internal performance condition. We bifurcate the liability and equity portion of the awards (amounts expected to settle in cash and shares, respectively) and recognize expense ratably over the vesting period of three years. We estimate that the performance measures will be met and shares will vest at target until the year of settlement (third year of cliff vesting). As of October 31, 2020, we do not expect any performance share awards to vest.\nWe also awarded performance restricted stock units to key employees and officers in December 2019, 2018, and 2017. These awards cliff vest upon a three-year service period with the absolute total shareholder return of our common stock over this three-year term as the vesting criteria. The number of performance restricted stock units earned is variable depending on the metric achieved, and the settlement method is 100% in our common stock, with accrued dividends paid in cash at the time of vesting, assuming the shares had been outstanding throughout the performance period. To value the performance restricted stock units, we use a Monte Carlo simulation model to arrive at a grant-date fair value. This amount will be adjusted for forfeitures and expensed over the three-year term of the award with a credit to additional paid-in-capital. Similar to performance shares, the performance restricted stock units are not considered outstanding shares, do not have voting rights, and are excluded from diluted weighted-average shares used to calculate earnings per share until the performance criteria is probable to result in the issuance of contingent shares. As of October 31, 2020, we have deemed 32,322 shares related to the December 2017 grants of performance restricted stock units as probable to vest.\nContractual Obligations and Commercial Commitments\nOur contractual obligations and commercial commitments include unconditional purchase obligations which consist of commitments to buy miscellaneous parts, inventory, and expenditures related to capital projects in progress. In addition, during fiscal 2021, we expect to contribute approximately $0.5 million to our pension plan to meet our minimum contribution requirements. Pension contributions beyond 2021 cannot be determined since the amount of any contribution is heavily dependent on the future economic environment and investment returns on pension plan assets. Obligations are based on current and projected obligations of the plans, performance of the plan assets, if applicable, and the timing and amount of funding contributions. At October 31, 2020, we have recorded a long-term liability for deferred pension and postretirement benefits totaling $10.9 million. We believe the effect of the plans on liquidity is not significant to our overall financial condition.\nOur supplemental benefit plan and deferred compensation plan liabilities fluctuate based on changes in the market value of certain equity securities, including our common stock. As of October 31, 2020, our liability under the supplemental benefit plan and the deferred compensation plan was approximately $2.6 million and $3.3 million, respectively.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements, as such term is defined in the rules promulgated by the SEC, that we believe would be material to investors and for which it is reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources.\nEffects of Inflation\nWe have experienced the impact of inflation on our cost of raw materials, labor, freight and overhead. Although we use contractual price indexing along with periodic base price increases to minimize the effect of inflation on our results, we have not been able to fully recover all of the inflationary cost increases. We believe inflation has not had a significant effect on our earnings or financial position over the previous three fiscal years. We cannot provide assurance, however, that our results of operations and financial position will not be materially impacted by inflation in the future.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nIn June 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2016-13, Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326). This amendment replaces the incurred loss impairment methodology in current U.S. GAAP and requires that financial assets be measured on an amortized cost basis and presented at the net amount expected to be collected. This new methodology reflects expected credit losses (rather than probable credit losses) and requires consideration of a broader range of supportable information when determining these estimated credit losses, including relevant experience, current conditions and supportable forecasts to determine collectability. In addition, the amendment provides guidance with regard to the use of an allowance for credit losses for purchased financial assets and available-for-sale debt securities. This amendment becomes effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019, including interim periods within that fiscal year. We expect to adopt this amendment during fiscal 2021, with no material impact on our consolidated financial statements.\nIn August 2018, the FASB issued ASU No. 2018-14, Compensation - Retirement Benefits - Defined Benefit Plans - General (Subtopic 715-20). This amendment modifies the disclosure requirements for employers that sponsor defined benefit pensions or other postretirement plans. Specifically, the amendment removes disclosures which were no longer considered cost beneficial, clarifies certain disclosure requirements, and adds disclosures identified as relevant. This amendment becomes effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2020, including interim periods within that fiscal year. We expect to adopt this amendment during fiscal 2022 with no material impact on our consolidated financial statements.", "item_7_truncated": "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nThe following discussion and analysis contains forward-looking statements based on our current assumptions, expectations, estimates and projections about our business and the homebuilding industry, and therefore, it should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes thereto, as well as the \"Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\" discussed elsewhere within this Annual Report on Form 10-K. For a listing of potential risks and uncertainties which impact our business and industry, see \"Item 1A. Risk Factors.\" Actual results could differ from our expectations due to several factors which include, but are not limited to: the impact of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, market price and demand for our products, economic and competitive conditions, capital expenditures, new technology, regulatory changes and other uncertainties. Unless otherwise required by law, we undertake no obligation to publicly update any forward-looking statements, even if new information becomes available or other events occur in the future.\nOur Business\nWe manufacture components for original equipment manufacturers in the building products industry. These components can be categorized as window and door (fenestration) components and kitchen and bath cabinet components. Examples of fenestration components include (1) energy-efficient flexible insulating glass spacers, (2) extruded vinyl profiles, (3) window and door screens, and (4) precision-formed metal and wood products. In addition, we provide certain other non-fenestration components and products, which include solar panel sealants, trim moldings, vinyl decking, fencing, water retention barriers, and conservatory roof components. We use low-cost production processes and engineering expertise to provide our customers with specialized products for their specific window, door, and cabinet applications. We believe these capabilities provide us with unique competitive advantages. We serve a primary customer base in North America and the U.K., and also serve customers in international markets through our operating plants in the U.K. and Germany, as well as through sales and marketing efforts in other countries.\nWe continue to invest in organic growth initiatives and we intend to continue evaluating business acquisitions that allow us to expand our existing fenestration and cabinet component footprint, enhance our product offerings, provide new complementary technology, enhance our leadership position within the markets we serve, and expand into new markets or service lines. We have disposed of non-core businesses in the past, and continue to evaluate our business portfolio to ensure that we are investing in markets where we believe there is potential future growth.\nWe currently have three reportable business segments: (1) North American Fenestration segment ( NA Fenestration\u201d), comprising three operating segments, manufacturing vinyl profiles, IG spacers, screens and other fenestration components; (2) European Fenestration segment ( EU Fenestration\u201d), comprising our U.K.-based vinyl extrusion business, manufacturing vinyl profiles and conservatories, and the European insulating glass business manufacturing IG spacers; and (3) North American Cabinet Components segment ( NA Cabinet Components\u201d), comprising our North American cabinet door and components business and two wood-manufacturing plants. We maintain a grouping called Unallocated Corporate & Other, which includes transaction expenses, stock-based compensation, long-term incentive awards based on the performance of our common stock and other factors, certain severance and legal costs not deemed to be allocable to all segments, depreciation of corporate assets, interest expense, other, net, income taxes and inter-segment eliminations, and executive incentive compensation and medical expense fluctuations relative to planned costs as determined during the annual planning process. Other corporate general and administrative costs have been allocated to the reportable business segments, based upon a relative measure of profitability in order to more accurately reflect each reportable business segment's administrative costs. We allocate corporate expenses to businesses acquired mid-year from the date of acquisition. The accounting policies of our operating segments are the same as those used to prepare our accompanying consolidated financial statements. Corporate general and administrative expenses allocated during the years ended October 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018 were $21.7 million, $18.3 million and $18.7 million, respectively.\nNotable Items\nCOVID-19 Impacts\nOn March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization,(WHO), declared the outbreak of COVID-19 to be a global pandemic and recommended containment and mitigation measures. Our first priority with regard to the COVID-19 pandemic is to do everything we can to ensure the safety, health and welfare of our employees, customers, suppliers and other partners. With the implementation of health and safety practices at our facilities, we are continuing to supply the industry during this uncertain time, recognizing the essential role the construction industry plays in providing housing and necessary infrastructure.\nAs federal, state and local governments react to the public health crisis, significant uncertainties have been created in the economy. The COVID-19 pandemic and its related effects continue to have a significant adverse effect on many sectors of the economy and we may be further impacted.\nAs part of our response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we have taken the following measures:\n\u2022We are continuing to provide our products to support critical infrastructure needs while following national, state, and local guidelines required to continue operations during the existence of the pandemic and related local declarations of emergency. All manufacturing facilities in the United States and Germany remained operational for the duration of the pandemic while both U.K. plants shut down in late March 2020 and became operational again during May 2020. However, local or regional hotspots of the pandemic could result in other locations being temporarily idled due to the need to deep clean areas where an employee who has tested positive for COVID-19 worked.\n\u2022While we currently expect any negative impact on sales to be temporary and minimal, the duration of the COVID-19 pandemic, the actions to contain the pandemic and treat its impacts, and the effects on our operations are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted at this time.\n\u2022We reassessed and adjusted our operational needs, including reducing our 2020 capital expenditure plans by approximately 25% to 30%.\n\u2022We have taken precautionary measures intended to help minimize the risk of the virus to our employees, including temporarily requiring some employees to work remotely.\n\u2022We continue to monitor the rapidly evolving situation and guidance from international and domestic authorities, including federal, state and local public health authorities and may take additional actions based on their recommendations. In these circumstances, there may be developments outside our control requiring us to adjust our operating plan.\nTax Cuts and Job Act\nOn December 22, 2017, President Trump signed into law the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the Act) that included sweeping tax reform which affected U.S. corporations, including a reduction of the statutory federal corporate tax rate from 35% to 21%. We made an initial assessment of the Act and recorded a discrete benefit of $6.5 million, which included a charge of $1.2 million for a one-time mandatory transition tax on deemed repatriation of previously tax-deferred and unremitted foreign earnings during the fiscal year ended October 31, 2018. We completed the accounting for the income tax effects of the Act and recorded a charge of $0.4 million for the re-measurement of the one-time mandatory transition tax during the year ended October 31, 2019. The Act also imposed additional tax law changes that became effective during fiscal 2019, which include new requirements for a global intangible low-taxed income provision (GILTI) and a deduction for foreign-derived intangible income (FDII), which resulted in a net charge of $1.2 million during the year ended October 31, 2019.\nMarket Overview and Outlook\nWe believe the primary drivers of our operating results continue to be North American residential remodeling and replacement (R&R) and new home construction activity. We believe that housing starts and window shipments are indicators of activity levels in the homebuilding and window industries, and we use this data, as published by or derived from third-party sources, to evaluate the market. We have historically evaluated the market using data from the National Association of Homebuilders (NAHB) with regard to housing starts, and published reports by Ducker Worldwide, LLC (Ducker), a consulting and research firm, with regard to window shipments in the U.S. We obtain market data from Catalina research, a consulting and research firm, for insight into the U.S. residential wood cabinet demand.\nIn November 2020, the NAHB forecasted calendar-year housing starts (excluding manufactured units) to be 1.4 million in 2020, 1.3 million in 2021, and 1.4 million in 2022. The November 2020 Ducker forecast indicated that window shipments in the R&R market are expected to decrease approximately 1% for calendar year 2020 and increase 2% and 3% in 2021 and 2022, respectively. Derived from reports published by Ducker, the overall decrease in window shipments for the trailing twelve months ended September 30, 2020 was 0.3%. During this period, new construction activities increased 1.1% and R&R decreased 1.4%. In November 2020, Catalina Research estimated that residential semi-custom cabinet demand in the U.S. will decline approximately 6% in 2020, however, 2021 is estimated to grow 3.7%. In line with market forecasts, we expect that some sales originally planned for the year ended October 31, 2020 may be realized during the years ended October 31, 2021 and 2022.\nOur U.K. vinyl business (commonly referred to as \"Liniar\") is largely focused on the sale of vinyl house systems under the trade name Liniar\u201d to smaller window manufacturers in the U.K. Liniar is one of the larger providers of vinyl extruded products in the U.K. in terms of volume shipped. Currently, the U.K. is experiencing a shortage in affordable housing, with rising demand due in part to a growing immigrant population. Liniar's current primary customers are smaller window fabricators, as opposed to the larger OEMs that comprise a large portion of the North American market. These manufacturers seek the quality and technology of the specific products identified by the Liniar trade name. In addition, Liniar services non-fenestration markets including the manufacture of roofing for conservatories, vinyl decking and vinyl water retention barriers\nused for landscaping. We believe there are growth opportunities within these markets in the U.K. and potential synergies which may enable us to sell complementary products.\nNA Cabinet Components manufactures kitchen and bathroom cabinet doors and components, amongst other products, using a variety of woods from traditional hardwoods to engineered wood products. Currently, most of the revenue in the NA Cabinet Components is earned in the U.S., so domestic housing starts and R&R activity constitute the primary drivers of this business as well. The cabinet door market is stratified as follows: stock (low-cost, low-variations), semi-custom (more customized, just-in-time manufacturing, higher price point) and custom (precise customer specifications, just-in-time manufacturing, high-end price point). NA Cabinet Component's primary market is semi-custom.\nOur business is seasonal, particularly our fenestration business, as inclement weather during the winter months tends to slow down construction, particularly as related to outside of the house\u201d construction. To some extent, we believe our kitchen and bathroom cabinet door business lessens the impact of seasonality on our operating results, as the cabinet business is inside of the house\u201d and less susceptible to weather.\nWe are impacted by regulation of energy standards. Although the U.S. government has been less aggressively pursuing higher energy efficiency standards in recent years, other countries have implemented higher energy efficiency standards which should bode well for our fenestration-related business in these markets, particularly our warm-edge spacer products.\nSeveral commodities in our business are subject to pricing fluctuations, including polyvinyl resin (PVC), titanium dioxide (TiO2), petroleum products, aluminum and wood. For the majority of our customers and critical suppliers, we have price adjusters in place which effectively share the base pass-through price changes for our primary commodities with our customers commensurate with the market at large. Our long-term exposure to these price fluctuations is somewhat mitigated due to the contractual component of the adjuster program. However, these adjusters are not in place with all customers and for all commodities, and there is a level of exposure to such volatility due to the lag associated with the timing of price updates in accordance with our customer agreements, particularly with regard to hardwoods. In addition, some of these commodities, such as silicone, are in high demand, particularly in Europe, which can affect the cost of the raw materials, a portion of which we may not be able to fully recover. Thus far we have not experienced any supply or logistics disruptions as lower demand has not required us to source the same level of supply.\nOn June 23, 2016, citizens of the U.K. voted to exit the European Union (E.U.) (referred to as Brexit). In October 2019, the U.K. and E.U. ratified a withdrawal agreement, and subsequently the U.K. left the E.U. on January 31, 2020. A transition period is in place until December 31, 2020 while the U.K. and E.U. negotiate additional arrangements. The current E.U. rules for trade, travel, and business for the U.K. will lapse on December 31, 2020 with any new rules taking effect January 1, 2021.\nGiven the lack of comparable precedent, it is difficult for us to predict the future impacts on our U.K. based operations, which accounted for approximately 15% of our total sales for the year ended October 31, 2020. Due to the fact that we manufacture and sell a majority of our U.K. products within the U.K., there is minimal risk to our ability to physically deliver goods and complete sales. As such, we believe we are well positioned within the U.K. to respond to potential changes to underlying demand as a result of the final Brexit outcome. The primary risk mitigation focus for our U.K. operations centers on the availability and pricing of raw materials. While we source the majority of our raw materials from within the U.K., many of the primary upstream raw materials our vendors use are being sourced from outside of the U.K., which could expose us to cross-border issues and raw material price impacts. We will mitigate this potential impact of Brexit on the import of goods to the U.K. by strategically managing our inventory levels and logistical channels.\nIn February 2020, the U.K. announced its intention to introduce border controls and our U.K. businesses have positioned themselves well to cope with additional demands and tariffs that this will bring in order to comply and facilitate the flow of goods in and out of the U.K. We are still clarifying what the impact of associated tariffs could be.\nThe global economy remains uncertain due to currency devaluations, political unrest, terror threats, global pandemics such as COVID-19, and even the political landscape in the U.S. These and other macro-economic factors have impacted the global financial markets, which may have contributed to significant changes in foreign currencies. We continue to monitor our exposure to changes in exchange rates.\nComparison of the fiscal years ended October 31, 2020 and 2019\nThis table sets forth our consolidated results of operations for the twelve-month periods ended October 31, 2020 and 2019.\nTable 16: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>For the Years Ended October 31, </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 vs. 2019 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Amounts </td> <td> </td> <td>% of Sales </td> <td> </td> <td>Amounts </td> <td> </td> <td>% of Sales </td> <td> </td> <td>$ Change </td> <td> </td> <td>Variance % </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>(Dollars in millions) </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net sales </td> <td>$ </td> <td>851.6 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>100% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>893.8 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>100% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(42.2) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(5)% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cost of sales (excluding depreciation and amortization) </td> <td>658.8 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>77% </td> <td> </td> <td>694.4 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>78% </td> <td> </td> <td>(35.6) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Selling, general and administrative </td> <td>89.7 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>11% </td> <td> </td> <td>101.2 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>11% </td> <td> </td> <td>(11.5) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>11% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Restructuring charges </td> <td>0.6 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>-% </td> <td> </td> <td>0.4 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>-% </td> <td> </td> <td>0.2 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(50)% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Depreciation and amortization </td> <td>47.2 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6% </td> <td> </td> <td>49.6 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6% </td> <td> </td> <td>(2.4) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Asset impairment charges </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>-% </td> <td> </td> <td>74.6 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>8% </td> <td> </td> <td>(74.6) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>100% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating income (loss) </td> <td>55.3 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6% </td> <td> </td> <td>(26.4) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(3)% </td> <td> </td> <td>81.7 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>309% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest expense </td> <td>(5.2) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(1)% </td> <td> </td> <td>(9.6) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(1)% </td> <td> </td> <td>4.4 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>46% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other, net </td> <td>0.2 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>-% </td> <td> </td> <td>0.1 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>-% </td> <td> </td> <td>0.1 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>100% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Income tax expense </td> <td>(11.8) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(1)% </td> <td> </td> <td>(10.8) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(1)% </td> <td> </td> <td>(1.0) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(9)% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net income (loss) </td> <td>$ </td> <td>38.5 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(46.7) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(5)% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>85.2 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>182% </td> </tr>\n</table>\nOur year-over-year results by reportable segment follow.

Net sales decreased $20.4 million, or 4%, for the twelve months ended October 31, 2020 compared to the same period in 2019, which was primarily driven by a decrease in volumes of $22.9 million, which includes the impacts of COVID-19. The decrease in volume was partially offset by increases in prices and surcharges of $2.5 million.\nCost of Sales. Cost of sales decreased $14.4 million, or 4%, for the twelve months ended October 31, 2020 compared to the same period in 2019. Cost of sales decreased due to lower volumes during the period, including a corresponding decrease in selling expenses as a result of the impacts of COVID-19 as mentioned above.\nSelling, General and Administrative. Our selling, general and administrative expenses decreased by $2.6 million, or 5%, for the twelve months ended October 31, 2020 compared to the same period in 2019. This decrease was due primarily to lower general expenses due to COVID-19 restrictions and lower compensation and benefits year-over-year.\nRestructuring Charges. Restructuring charges incurred during the twelve months ended October 31, 2020 and 2019 relate to facility lease expense for a vinyl extrusion plant in the U.S. which was closed in January 2017 that has not been sublet or otherwise exited as of October 31, 2020.\nEU Fenestration\nTable 18: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>For the Years Ended October 31, </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>$ Change </td> <td> </td> <td>Variance % </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>(Dollars in millions) </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net sales </td> <td>$ </td> <td>161.1 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>164.9 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(3.8) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(2)% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cost of sales (excluding depreciation and amortization) </td> <td>108.8 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>114.1 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(5.3) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Selling, general and administrative </td> <td>22.7 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>23.0 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(0.3) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Depreciation and amortization </td> <td>9.5 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>8.8 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.7 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(8)% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating income </td> <td>$ </td> <td>20.1 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>19.0 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1.1 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating income margin </td> <td>12 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>12 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nNet Sales.

Cost of sales for Corporate & Other consists of the elimination of inter-segment sales, profit in inventory, and other costs.\nSelling, General and Administrative. Our selling, general and administrative expenses decreased $8.5 million, for the twelve months ended October 31, 2020 compared to the same period in 2019. This decrease is attributable to $4.4 million of lower medical expenses, $2.0 million of lower compensation expense primarily related to the valuations of our stock based compensation awards, lower transaction costs of $1.4 million and lower severance costs related to executive severance and headcount reduction.\nChanges Related to Non-Operating Items:\nInterest Expense. Interest expense decreased $4.4 million for the twelve months ended October 31, 2020 compared to the same period in 2019 primarily due to lower interest rates and lower overall debt outstanding. The weighted average interest rate for borrowings outstanding for the twelve months ended October 31, 2020 was 2.45% compared with 4.07% for the twelve months ended October 31, 2019.\nOther, net. Other, net increased $0.1 million for the twelve months ended October 31, 2020 compared to the same period in 2019. Improvements in the impacts of foreign currency transactions were partially offset by a decrease in pension benefits year-over-year.\nIncome Taxes. We recorded income tax expense of $11.8 million on pre-tax income of $50.3 million for the twelve months ended October 31, 2020, an effective rate of 23.5%, and income tax expense of $10.8 million on pre-tax loss of $36.0 million for the twelve months ended October 31, 2019, an effective rate of 30.0%. The effective rate for the twelve months ended October 31, 2020 was impacted by the true-up of our accruals and related deferred taxes from prior year filings and settled audits. The effective rate for the twelve months ended October 31, 2019 was primarily impacted by the $74.6 million asset impairment charge in the NA Cabinet Components segment which did not generate a tax benefit, and a net charge of $1.2 million related to GILTI and FDII.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nOverview\nHistorically, our principal sources of funds have been cash on hand, cash flow from operations, and borrowings under our credit facilities. As of October 31, 2020, we had $51.6 million of cash and cash equivalents, $103.0 million outstanding under our credit facilities, $4.8 million of outstanding letters of credit and $15.3 million outstanding under finance leases. We had $217.2 million available for use under a revolving credit facility at October 31, 2020.\nOn July 29, 2016, we entered into a $450.0 million credit agreement comprising a $150.0 million Term Loan A and a $300.0 million revolving credit facility (collectively, the 2016 Credit Agreement\u201d), under which we borrowed $150.0 million and $150.0 million, respectively. The proceeds from the 2016 Credit Agreement, along with additional funding of $16.4 million of cash on hand, were used to repay outstanding borrowings under our prior credit facilities of $309.2 million, to pay a 1% prepayment call premium, to settle outstanding interest accrued, and to pay loan fees which totaled $2.8 million. In addition, we expensed $8.1 million to write-off unamortized deferred financing fees and $5.5 million of unamortized original issuer's discount associated with our prior credit facilities. The 2016 Credit Agreement was to mature in 2021 (5-year term) and required interest payments calculated, at our election and depending upon our Consolidated Leverage Ratio, at either a Base Rate plus an applicable margin (0.50% to 1.25%) or the LIBOR Rate plus an applicable margin (1.50% to 2.25%). We included deferred financing fees of $2.8 million as a contra-liability account, and were amortizing this balance straight-line over the term of the facility.\nOn October 18, 2018, we amended and restated the 2016 Credit Agreement by entering into a $325.0 million revolving credit facility (the 2018 Credit Facility\u201d), under which we borrowed $205.0 million. The proceeds from the 2018 Credit Facility, along with additional funding of $10.0 million of cash on hand, were used to repay outstanding borrowings under the 2016 Credit Agreement of $213.5 million, to settle outstanding interest accrued under the prior facility, and to pay loan fees which totaled $1.0 million. In addition, we expensed $1.1 million to write-off unamortized deferred financing fees associated with the 2016 Credit Agreement. The 2018 Credit Facility matures in 2023 (5-year term) and requires interest payments calculated, at our election and depending upon our Consolidated Leverage Ratio, at either a Base Rate plus an applicable margin (0.25% to 1.00%) or the LIBOR Rate plus an applicable margin (1.25% to 2.00%). We included deferred financing fees of $1.5 million as a contra-liability account, and are amortizing this balance straight-line over the term of the facility.\nThe weighted average interest rate of borrowings outstanding for the twelve-month periods ended October 31, 2020 and 2019 was 2.45% and 4.07%, respectively. We were in compliance with our debt covenants as of October 31, 2020. For additional details of the Credit Agreement, see \"Item 1A. Risk Factors,\" included elsewhere within this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nWe expect to repatriate excess cash moving forward and use the funds to retire debt or meet current working capital needs. Funds from operations may be impacted by softer demand and liquidity concerns of our customers as a result of COVID-19. In the U.K., we insure against a portion of our credit losses. In light of the COVID-19 pandemic, the Company has implemented a range of actions aimed at reducing costs and preserving liquidity. We believe our business model, our current cash reserves and the recent steps we have taken to strengthen our balance sheet leave us well-positioned to manage our business as a going concern and remain in compliance with our debt covenants through the COVID-19 crisis as it continues to unfold.\nAnalysis of Cash Flow\nThe following table summarizes our cash flow results for the years ended October 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018:\nTable 21: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Year Ended October 31, </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>2018 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>(In millions) </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cash flows provided by operating activities </td> <td>$ </td> <td>100.8 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>96.4 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>104.6 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cash flows used for investing activities </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(25.2) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(23.6) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(26.1) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cash flows used for financing activities </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(55.1) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(71.3) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(65.8) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nOur year-over-year cash flow analysis follows. Our cash flow analysis for the fiscal years ended October 31, 2019 and 2018 for the prior year comparative periods can be found in the annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended October 31, 2019.\nOperating Activities\nOperating cash flow for the year ended October 31, 2020 increased $4.4 million while cash flow for the year ending October 31, 2019 decreased by $8.2 million. Our ability to continue operations and deliver orders as an essential service provider mitigated some of the effects of COVID-19. Our efforts to maintain operating levels in accordance with demand allowed us to remain efficient with our working capital and use inventory effectively. To date, slower paying customers as a result of COVID-19 have not significantly impacted our liquidity, but this could become a concern in the future.\nInvesting Activities\nCash used for investing activities for the year ended October 31, 2020 increased $1.7 million compared to the year ended October 31, 2019 due to an increase of $0.8 million in our investment in capital expenditures and a decline in proceeds from the disposition of capital assets of $0.8 million.\nAt October 31, 2020, we had firm purchase commitments of approximately $2.2 million for the purchase or construction of capital assets. We plan to fund these capital expenditures through cash from operations or borrowings under our revolving credit facility.\nFinancing Activities\nIn 2020, cash used for financing activities was $55.1 million and related primarily to net debt repayments of $40.5 million, payment of dividends of $10.5 million, and share repurchases of $7.2 million. In 2019, cash used for financing activities was $71.3 million and related primarily to net debt repayments of $54.0 million, payment of dividends of $10.6 million, and share repurchases of $9.6 million.\nLiquidity Requirements\nOur strategy for deploying cash is to invest in organic growth opportunities, develop our infrastructure, and explore strategic acquisitions. Other uses of cash include paying cash dividends to our shareholders and repurchasing our own stock. We maintain cash balances in foreign countries which totaled $16.8 million and $9.8 million as of October 31, 2020 and 2019. During the years ended October 31, 2020 and 2019, we repatriated $31.9 million and $24.2 million, respectively, of foreign earnings from our international divisions.\nWe believe that we have sufficient funds and adequate financial resources available to meet our anticipated liquidity needs. We expect to use our cash flow from operations to fund operations for the next twelve months and the foreseeable future. We believe these funds should be adequate to provide for our working capital requirements, capital expenditures, and dividends, while continuing to meet our debt service requirements.\nSenior Credit Facility\nWe maintain our $325.0 million 2018 Credit Facility, which contains a revolving credit facility, with Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as Agent, Swingline Lender and Issuing Lender, and Bank of America, N.A. serving as Syndication Agent. The 2018 Credit Facility has a five-year term, maturing on October 18, 2023, and requires interest payments calculated, at our election and depending upon our Consolidated Leverage Ratio, at either a Base Rate plus an applicable margin or the LIBOR Rate plus an applicable margin. At the time of the initial borrowing, the applicable rate was LIBOR + 1.50%. In addition, we are subject to commitment fees for the unused portion of the 2018 Credit Facility. The applicable margin and commitment fees range from 0.45% to 2.30%, depending upon the type of loan and consolidated leverage ratio. The Credit Facility contains appropriate provisions to substitute LIBOR with a replacement rate upon transition away from LIBOR. These provisions include a temporary conversion of applicable interest for all borrowings outstanding to be calculated as base rate loans until such time that the replacement rate is agreed upon.\nThe 2018 Credit Facility provides for revolving credit commitments for a minimum principal amount of $10.0 million, up to an aggregate amount of $150.0 million, subject to the lender's discretion to elect or decline the incremental increase. We can also borrow up to the lesser of $15.0 million or the revolving credit commitment, as defined, under a Swingline feature of the 2018 Credit Facility.\nThe 2018 Credit Facility contains a: (1) Consolidated Interest Coverage Ratio requirement whereby we must not permit the Consolidated Interest Coverage Ratio, as defined, to be less than 2.25 to 1.00, and (2) Consolidated Leverage Ratio requirement, whereby we must not permit the Consolidated Leverage Ratio, as defined, to be greater than 3.25 to 1.00.\nIn addition to maintaining these financial covenants, the 2018 Credit Facility also limits our ability to enter into certain business transactions, such as to incur indebtedness or liens, to acquire businesses or dispose of material assets, make restricted payments, pay dividends (limited to $20.0 million per year) and to conduct other transactions as further defined in the 2018 Credit Facility. Some of these limitations, however, do not take effect so long as total leverage is less than or equal to 2.75 to 1.00 and available liquidity exceeds $25 million. Substantially all of our domestic assets, with the exception of real property, are pledged as collateral for the 2018 Credit Facility.\nIssuer Purchases of Equity Securities\nOn August 30, 2018, our Board of Directors approved a stock repurchase program that authorized the repurchase of up to $60.0 million worth of shares of our common stock. Repurchases under the new program will be made in open market transactions or privately negotiated transactions, subject to market conditions, applicable legal requirements and other relevant factors. The program does not have an expiration date or a limit on the number of shares that may be purchased. During the years ended October 31, 2020 and 2019, we purchased 450,000 shares and 583,398 shares, respectively, at a cost of $7.2 million and $9.6 million, respectively, under this program.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nThe preparation of our financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (U.S. GAAP) requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. Estimates and assumptions about future events and their effects cannot be perceived with certainty. Estimates may change as new events occur, as more experience is acquired, as additional information becomes available and as our operating environment changes. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, and that we believe provide a basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily available through open market quotes. We must use our judgment with regard to uncertainties in order to make these estimates. Actual results could differ from these estimates.\nWe believe the following are the most critical accounting policies used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements as well as the significant judgments and uncertainties affecting the application of these policies. We consider an estimate to be critical if it is subjective and if changes in the estimate using different assumptions would result in a material impact to our financial position or results of operations.\nWhile there have been no changes in the application of principles, methods, and assumptions used to determine our significant estimates, we may be required to revise certain accounting estimates and judgments related to the economic and business impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, such as, but not limited to, those related to the valuation of goodwill, intangibles, long-lived assets, accounts receivable, and inventory, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations.\nRevenue from Contracts with Customers\nRevenue recognition\nWe recognize revenue that reflects the consideration we expect to receive for product sales upon transfer to customers. Revenue for product sales is recognized when control of the promised products is transferred to our customers, and we expect to be entitled to consideration in exchange for transferring those products. We account for a contract when a customer provides us with a firm purchase order that identifies the products to be provided, the payment terms for those services, and when collectability of the consideration due is probable.\nPerformance obligations\nA performance obligation is a promise to provide the customer with a good or service. Our performance obligations include product sales, with each product included in a customer contract being recognized as a separate performance obligation. For contracts with multiple performance obligations, the standalone selling price of each product is generally readily observable.\nRevenue from product sales is recognized at a point in time when the product is transferred to the customer, in accordance with the shipping terms, which is generally upon shipment. We estimate a provision for sales returns and warranty allowances to account for product returns related to general returns and product nonconformance.\nPricing and sales incentives\nPricing is established at or prior to the time of sale with our customers and we record sales at the agreed-upon net selling price, reflective of current and prospective discounts.\nPractical expedients and exemptions\nWe generally expense incremental costs of obtaining a contract when incurred because the amortization period would be less than one year. Additionally, we do not disclose the value of unsatisfied performance obligations for contracts with an original expected length of one year or less.\nShipping and handling costs\nWe have elected to account for shipping and handling services as fulfillment services in accordance with ASC Topic 606 guidance; accordingly, freight revenue will be combined with the product deliverable rather than being accounted for as a distinct performance obligation within the terms of the agreement. Shipping and handling costs incurred by us for the delivery of goods to customers are considered a cost to fulfill the contract and are included in cost of sales in the accompanying consolidated statements of income (loss).\nContract assets and liabilities\nDeferred revenue, which is not significant, is recorded when we have remaining unsatisfied performance obligations for which we have received consideration.\nDisaggregation of revenue\nWe produce a wide variety of products that are used in the fenestration industry, including window spacer systems; extruded vinyl products; metal fabricated products; and astragals, thresholds and screens. In addition, we produce certain non-fenestration products, including kitchen and bath cabinet doors and components, flooring and trim moldings, solar edge tape, plastic decking, fencing, water retention barriers, conservatory roof components, and other products.\nAllowance for Doubtful Accounts\nWe record trade accounts receivable at billed amounts, less an allowance for doubtful accounts. This allowance is established to estimate the risk of loss associated with our trade receivables which may arise due to the inability of our customers to pay or due to changes in circumstances. The allowance is maintained at a level that we consider appropriate based on factors that affect collectability, including: (a) historical trends of write-offs, recoveries and credit losses; (b) the credit quality of our customers; and (c) projected economic and market conditions. Different assumptions or changes in economic circumstances could result in changes to the allowance. Our historical bad debt expense has been less than 0.1% of sales for the years ended October 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018. If bad debt expense increased by 1% of net sales, the impact on operating results would have been a decrease in net income of $6.4 million for the year ended October 31, 2020, an increase in net loss of $6.8 million for the year ended October 31, 2019 and a decrease in net income of $9.2 million for the year ended October 31, 2018.\nBusiness Combinations - Contingencies\nWe apply the acquisition method of accounting for business combinations in accordance with U.S. GAAP, which requires us to make use of estimates and judgments to allocate the purchase price paid for acquisitions to the fair value of the net assets and liabilities acquired. We use established valuation techniques and engage reputable valuation specialists to assist us with these valuations. However, there is a risk that we may not identify all pre-acquisition contingencies or that our estimates may not reflect the actual results when realized. We use a reasonable measurement period to record any adjustment related to the opening balance sheet (generally, less than one year). After the measurement period, changes to the opening balance sheet can result in the recognition of income or expense as period costs. To the extent these items stem from contingencies that existed at the balance sheet date, but are contingent upon the realization of future events, the cost is charged to expense at the time the future event becomes known. If our purchase accounting estimates are not correct, or if we do not recognize contingent assets or liabilities accurately, we may incur losses.\nImpairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets\nProperty, Plant and Equipment and Intangible Assets with Defined Lives\nWe make judgments and estimates in conjunction with the carrying value of our long-term assets, including property, plant and equipment, and identifiable intangibles. These judgments may include the basis for capitalization, depreciation and amortization methods and the useful lives of the underlying assets. In accordance with U.S. GAAP, we review the carrying values of these assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. We determine that the carrying amount is not recoverable if it exceeds the sum of the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the asset. If the carrying value exceeds the sum of the undiscounted cash flows and after considering alternate uses for the asset, an impairment charge would be recorded in the period in which such review is performed. We measure the impairment loss as the amount by which the carrying amount of the long-lived asset exceeds its fair value. Fair value is determined by reference to quoted market prices in active markets, if available, or by calculating the discounted cash flows associated with the use and eventual disposition of the asset. Therefore, if there are indicators of impairment, we are required to make long-term forecasts of our future revenues and costs related to the assets subject to review. Forecasts require assumptions about demand for our products and future market conditions. Although there may be no indicators of impairment in the current period, unanticipated changes to assumptions or circumstances in future periods could result in an impairment charge in the period of the change. No impairment charges were incurred with regard to our property, plant and equipment for the years ended October 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018.\nWe monitor relevant circumstances, including industry trends, general economic conditions, and the potential impact that such circumstances might have on the valuation of our identifiable intangibles. Events and changes in circumstances that may cause a triggering event and necessitate such a review include, but are not limited to: a decrease in sales for certain customers, improvements or changes in technology, and/or a decision to phase-out a trademark or trade name. Such events could negatively impact the carrying value of our identifiable intangibles. It is possible that changes in such circumstances or in the numerous variables associated with the judgments, assumptions, and estimates made by us in assessing the appropriate valuation of our identifiable intangibles could require us to further write down a portion of our identifiable intangibles and record related non-cash impairment charges in the future. We apply a variety of techniques to establish the carrying value of our intangible assets, including the relief from royalty and excess current year earnings methods.\nGoodwill\nWe use the acquisition method to account for business combinations and, to the extent that the purchase price exceeds the fair value of the net assets acquired, we record goodwill. In accordance with U.S. GAAP, we are required to evaluate our goodwill at least annually. We perform our annual goodwill assessment as of August 31, or more frequently if indicators of impairment exist. Qualitative factors that indicate impairment could include, but are not limited to, (i) macroeconomic conditions, (ii) industry and market considerations, (iii) cost factors, (iv) overall financial performance of the reporting unit, and (v) other relevant entity-specific events. The first step in our annual goodwill assessment is to perform the optional qualitative assessment allowed by ASC Topic 350 Intangibles - Goodwill and Other\u201d (ASC 350). In our qualitative assessment, we evaluate relevant events or circumstances to determine whether it is more likely than not (i.e., greater than 50%) that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. If we determine that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, ASC 350 requires us to compare the fair value of such reporting unit to its carrying value including goodwill. To determine the fair value of our reporting units, we use multiple valuation techniques including a discounted cash flow analysis, using the applicable weighted average cost of capital, in combination with a market approach that uses market multiples and a selection of guideline public companies. This test requires us to make assumptions about the future growth of our business and the market in general, as well as other variables such as the level of investment in capital expenditure, growth in working capital requirements and the terminal or residual value of our reporting units beyond the periods of estimated annual cash flows. We use a third-party valuation firm to assist us with this analysis. If the fair value of each reporting unit exceeds its carrying value, no action is required. Otherwise, an impairment loss is recorded to the extent that the carrying amount of the reporting unit including goodwill exceeds the fair value of that reporting unit. We believe the estimates and assumptions used in our impairment assessment are reasonable based on available market information, but variations in any of the assumptions could result in materially different calculations of fair value and determinations of whether or not an impairment is indicated during current or future periods.\nAs a result of quantitative assessments performed during the year ended October 31, 2019, we recorded impairment charges totaling $74.6 million during the year ended October 31, 2019, reducing the goodwill balance applicable to the reporting unit included in our NA Cabinet Components operating segment from $113.7 million to $39.1 million.\nFor the year ended October 31, 2020, the World Health Organization's declaration of COVID-19 as a global pandemic also created significant changes in market conditions that were indicators of triggering events which necessitated an evaluation of certain long-term assets, including goodwill, for potential impairment. We performed quantitative assessments based upon undiscounted cash flows we expected to realize associated with these assets over the remaining useful lives of the primary operating assets to the net book value of the long-term assets, including goodwill, and determined that these assets, including goodwill, were not impaired.\nAt our annual testing date, August 31, 2020, we had five reporting units with goodwill balances: two reporting units included in our NA Fenestration operating segment, two reporting units included in our EU Fenestration operating segment, and one reporting unit included in our NA Cabinet Components operating segment. We performed a qualitative assessment of the two reporting units in the NA Fenestration segment and one of the reporting units in the EU Fenestration segment. This review included an analysis of historical goodwill test results, operating results relative to forecast, projected results over the next five years, and other measures and concluded that there were no indicators of potential impairment associated with these reporting units. Therefore, no additional testing was deemed necessary for the reporting units in the NA Fenestration segment and the EU Fenestration segment that were assessed qualitatively. We also updated the quantitative assessments for the reportable unit in the NA Cabinet Compnents segment and the second reportable unit in the EU Fenestration segment. We determined the fair value of these reportable units exceeded the carrying value by 5% and 36%, respectively, and concluded that no impairment was necessary.\nRestructuring\nWe account for restructuring costs in accordance with U.S. GAAP, whereby we accrue for one-time severance benefits pursuant to an approved plan of restructuring at the communication date, when affected employees have been notified of the potential severance and sufficient information has been provided for the employee to calculate severance benefits, in the event the employee is involuntarily terminated. In addition, we accrue costs associated with the termination of contractual commitments including operating leases at the time the lease is terminated pursuant to the lease provisions or in accordance with another agreement with the landlord. Otherwise, we continue to recognize operating lease expense through the cease-use date. After the cease-use date, we determine if our operating lease payments are at market. We assume sublet of the facility at the market rate. To the extent our lease obligations exceed the fair value rentals, we discount to arrive at the present value and record a liability. If the facility is not sublet, we expense the amount of the lease in the current period until sublet. For other costs directly related to the restructuring effort, such as equipment moving costs, we expense in the period incurred.\nLeases\nEffective November 1, 2019, we adopted Accounting Standards Codification Topic 842, \"Leases\" (ASC Topic 842), which requires leases to be recognized on the balance sheet. We recognize a right-of-use (ROU) asset and lease liability for each operating and finance lease with a contractual term greater than 12 months at the time of lease inception. We include ROU assets and lease liabilities for leases that exist within other contracts. Leases with an original term of 12 months or less are not recognized on the balance sheet, and the rent expense related to those short-term leases is recognized over the lease term. We do not account for lease and non-lease (e.g. common area maintenance) components of contracts separately for any underlying asset class.\nWe lease certain manufacturing plants, warehouses, office space, vehicles and equipment under finance and operating leases. Lease commencement occurs on the date we take possession or control of the property or equipment. Original terms for our real estate-related leases are generally between five and twenty years. Original terms for equipment-related leases, primarily manufacturing equipment and vehicles, are generally between one and ten years. Some of our leases also include rental escalation clauses. Renewal options are included in the determination of lease payments when management determines the options are reasonably certain of exercise, considering financial performance, strategic importance and/or invested capital.\nIf readily determinable, the rate implicit in the lease is used to discount lease payments to present value; however, substantially all of our leases do not provide a readily determinable implicit rate. When the implicit rate is not determinable, our estimated incremental borrowing rate is utilized, determined on a collateralized basis, to discount lease payments based on information available at lease commencement.\nTotal lease costs recorded include fixed operating lease costs and variable lease costs. Most of our real estate leases require we pay certain expenses, such as common area maintenance costs, of which the fixed portion is included in operating lease costs. We recognize operating lease costs on a straight-line basis over the lease term. In addition to the above costs, variable lease costs are recognized when probable and are not included in determining the present value of our lease liability.\nThe ROU asset is measured at the initial amount of the lease liability adjusted for lease payments made at or before the lease commencement date and initial direct costs. For operating leases, ROU assets are reduced over the lease term by the recognized straight-line lease expense less the amount of accretion of the lease liability determined using the effective interest method. For finance leases, ROU assets are amortized on a straight-line basis over the shorter of the useful life of the leased asset or the lease term. Interest expense on each finance lease liability is recognized utilizing the effective interest method. ROU assets are tested for impairment in the same manner as long-lived assets. Additionally, we monitor for events or changes in circumstances that may require a reassessment of one of our leases and determine if a remeasurement is required.\nIncome Taxes\nWe operate in various jurisdictions and therefore our income tax expense relates to income taxes in the U.S., U.K., Canada, and Germany, as well as local and state income taxes. We recognize the effect of a change in tax rates in the period of the change. We record the estimated future tax effects of temporary differences between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and the amounts reported in our consolidated balance sheets, as well as net operating losses and tax credit carry forward. We evaluate the carrying value of our net deferred tax assets and determine if our business will generate sufficient future taxable income to realize the net deferred tax assets. We perform this review for recoverability on a jurisdictional basis, whereby we consider both positive and negative evidence related to the likelihood of realization of the deferred tax assets. The weight given to the positive and negative evidence is commensurate with the extent to which the evidence can be objectively verified. We evaluate recoverability based on an estimate of future taxable income using the long-term forecasts we use to evaluate long-lived assets, goodwill and intangible assets for impairment, taking into consideration the future reversal of existing taxable temporary differences and reviewing our current financial operations. In the event that our estimates and assumptions indicate we will not generate sufficient future taxable income to realize our deferred tax assets, we will record a valuation allowance, to the extent indicated, to reduce our deferred tax assets to their realizable value.\nAnnually, we evaluate our tax positions to determine if there have been any changes in uncertain tax positions or if there has been a lapse in the statute of limitations with regard to such positions. Our liability for uncertain tax positions at October 31, 2020 and 2019 totaled $0.5 million and $0.6 million, respectively, and related to certain state tax items regarding the interpretation of tax laws and regulations.\nWe believe we will have sufficient taxable income in the future to fully utilize our unreserved deferred tax assets recorded as of October 31, 2020. There is a risk that our estimates related to the future use of loss carry forwards and our ability to realize our deferred tax assets may not come to fruition, and that the results could materially impact our financial position and results of operations. We have recorded the benefit associated with the patent box\u201d deduction in the U.K. with regard to our operations at Liniar. We believe that it is more likely than not that our deduction with regard to this position would be sustained upon examination. Our deferred tax assets at October 31, 2020 and 2019 totaled $20.1 million and $21.0 million, respectively, against which we had recorded a valuation allowance of $1.5 million and $1.6 million, respectively.\nInsurance\nWe manage our costs of workers' compensation, group medical, property, casualty and other liability exposures through a combination of self-insurance retentions and insurance coverage with third-party carriers. Liabilities associated with our portion of this exposure are not discounted. We estimate our exposure by considering various factors which may include: (1) historical claims experience, (2) severity factors, (3) estimated claims incurred but not reported and (4) loss development factors, which are used to estimate how claims will develop over time until settled or closed. While we consider a number of factors in preparing our estimate of risk exposure, we must use our judgment to determine the amounts to accrue in our financial statements. Actual claims can differ significantly from estimated liabilities if future claims experience differs from historical experience, and if we determine that our assumptions used for analysis or our development factors are flawed. We do not recognize insurance recoveries until any contingencies relating to the claim have been resolved.\nInventory\nWe record inventory at the lower of cost or net realizable value. Inventories are valued using the first-in first-out (FIFO) method. Fixed costs related to excess manufacturing capacity have been expensed in the period, and therefore, are not capitalized into inventory. Inventory quantities are regularly reviewed and provisions for excess or obsolete inventory are recorded primarily based on our forecast of future demand and market conditions. Significant unanticipated changes to our forecasts or changes in the net realizable value of our inventory would require a change in the provision for excess or obsolete inventory. For the years ended October 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, our inventory reserves are approximately 10%, 5%, and 6% of gross inventory, respectively. Assuming an increase in obsolescence equal to 1% of gross inventory, net income would have decreased by $0.5 million for the year ended October 31, 2020, net loss would have increased by $0.5 million for the year ended October 31, 2019, and net income would have been reduced by $1.0 million for the year ended October 31, 2018.\nRetirement Plans\nWe sponsor a defined benefit pension plan and an unfunded postretirement plan that provides health care and life insurance benefits for a limited pool of eligible retirees and dependents. On January 1, 2020, we enacted changes to our pension plan whereby the benefits for all participants were frozen and thereafter those participants will receive increased benefits in the company sponsored defined contribution plan in lieu of participation in a defined benefit plan. The measurement of liabilities related to these plans is based on our assumptions related to future events, including expected return on plan assets and healthcare cost trend rates. The discount rate reflects the rate at which benefits could be effectively settled on the measurement date. We determine our discount rate using a RATE: Link Model whereby target yields are developed from bonds across a range of maturity points, and a curve is fitted to those targets. Spot rates (zero coupon bond yields) are developed from the curve and used to discount benefit payments associated with each future year. This model assumes spot rates will remain level beyond the 30-year point. We determine the present value of plan benefits by applying the discount rates to projected benefit cash flows. Actual pension plan asset investment performance, as well as other economic experience such as discount rate and demographic experience, will either reduce or increase unamortized pension losses at the end of any fiscal year, which ultimately affects future pension costs.\nAs of October 31, 2020, our projected benefit obligation (PBO) and accumulated benefit obligation (ABO) each exceeded the fair value of the plan assets by $10.7 million. As a comparison, our PBO and ABO exceeded the fair value of plan assets by $13.1 million and $12.1 million, respectively, as of October 31, 2019. During fiscal 2020, we contributed $3.7 million to the pension plan to meet minimum contribution requirements. Expected contributions are dependent on many variables, including the variability of the market value of the assets as compared to the obligation and other market or regulatory conditions. In addition, we take into consideration our business investment opportunities and our cash requirements. Accordingly, actual funding may differ greatly from current estimates. As of October 31, 2020, a 1% decrease in the discount rate would result in an increase in the PBO of $5.8 million.\nUnder U.S. GAAP, we are not required to immediately recognize the effects of a deviation between actual and assumed experience under our pension plan, or to revise our estimate as a result. This approach allows the favorable and unfavorable effects that fall within an acceptable range to be netted and disclosed as an unrecognized gain or loss. As of October 31, 2020 and 2019, a net actuarial loss of $9.9 million and $6.7 million, respectively, was included in our accumulated other comprehensive (loss) income. There were no net prior service costs or transition obligations for the years ended October 31, 2020 and 2019. The effect on fiscal years after 2020 will depend on the actual experience of the plans.\nMortality assumptions used to determine the obligations for our pension plans are based on the Pri-2012 base mortality table with MP-2018 mortality improvement scale.\nStock-Based Compensation\nWe have issued stock-based compensation in the form of stock options to directors, employees and officers, and non-vested restricted stock awards to certain key employees and officers. We apply the provisions of ASC Topic 718 Compensation - Stock Compensation\u201d (ASC 718) to determine the fair value of stock option awards on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes valuation model. We recognize the fair value as compensation expense on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period of the award based on awards ultimately expected to vest. Stock options granted to directors vest immediately while the stock options granted to our employees and officers typically vest ratably over a three-year period with service and continued employment as the vesting conditions. For new option grants to retirement-eligible employees, we recognize expense and vest immediately upon grant, consistent with the retirement vesting acceleration provisions of these grants. For employees near retirement age, we amortize such grants over the period from the grant date to the retirement-eligibility date if such period is shorter than the standard vesting schedule. For grants of non-vested restricted stock, we calculate the compensation expense at the grant date as the number of shares granted multiplied by the closing stock price of our common stock on the date of grant. This expense is recognized ratably over the vesting period. Our non-vested restricted stock grants to officers and employees cliff vest over a three-year period with service and continued employment as the only vesting criteria. Our fair value determination of stock-based payment awards on the date of grant using an option-pricing model is affected by our stock price as well as assumptions regarding a number of highly complex and subjective variables. These variables include, but are not limited to, our expected stock price volatility over the term of the awards, actual and projected employee stock option exercise behavior over the expected term, our dividend rate, risk-free rate and expectation with regards to forfeitures. Option-pricing models were developed for use in estimating the value of traded options that have no vesting or hedging restrictions and are fully transferable. Because our employee stock options have certain characteristics that are significantly different from traded options, and because changes in the subjective assumptions can materially affect the estimated value, the valuation models may not provide an accurate measure of the fair value of our employee stock options. Accordingly, that value may not be indicative of the fair value observed in a willing buyer/willing seller market transaction.\nWe have granted other awards which are linked to the performance of our common stock, but will settle in cash rather than the issuance of shares of our common stock. The value of these awards fluctuates with changes in our stock price, with the resulting gains or losses reflected in the period of the change. We have recorded current and non-current liabilities related to these awards reflected in our consolidated balance sheets at October 31, 2020 and 2019, included elsewhere within this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nIn addition, we have granted performance share awards which settle in cash and shares upon vesting. The award granted during the year ended October 31, 2018 has vesting criteria based on a market condition (relative total shareholder return) and an internal performance condition (earnings per share growth). The awards granted during the years ended October 31, 2020 and 2019 use return on net assets as the vesting condition and settle in cash. We use a Monte Carlo simulation model to value the market condition and our stock price on the date of grant to value the internal performance condition. We bifurcate the liability and equity portion of the awards (amounts expected to settle in cash and shares, respectively) and recognize expense ratably over the vesting period of three years. We estimate that the performance measures will be met and shares will vest at target until the year of settlement (third year of cliff vesting). As of October 31, 2020, we do not expect any performance share awards to vest.\nWe also awarded performance restricted stock units to key employees and officers in December 2019, 2018, and 2017. These awards cliff vest upon a three-year service period with the absolute total shareholder return of our common stock over this three-year term as the vesting criteria. The number of performance restricted stock units earned is variable depending on the metric achieved, and the settlement method is 100% in our common stock, with accrued dividends paid in cash at the time of vesting, assuming the shares had been outstanding throughout the performance period. To value the performance restricted stock units, we use a Monte Carlo simulation model to arrive at a grant-date fair value. This amount will be adjusted for forfeitures and expensed over the three-year term of the award with a credit to additional paid-in-capital. Similar to performance shares, the performance restricted stock units are not considered outstanding shares, do not have voting rights, and are excluded from diluted weighted-average shares used to calculate earnings per share until the performance criteria is probable to result in the issuance of contingent shares. As of October 31, 2020, we have deemed 32,322 shares related to the December 2017 grants of performance restricted stock units as probable to vest.\nContractual Obligations and Commercial Commitments\nOur contractual obligations and commercial commitments include unconditional purchase obligations which consist of commitments to buy miscellaneous parts, inventory, and expenditures related to capital projects in progress. In addition, during fiscal 2021, we expect to contribute approximately $0.5 million to our pension plan to meet our minimum contribution requirements. Pension contributions beyond 2021 cannot be determined since the amount of any contribution is heavily dependent on the future economic environment and investment returns on pension plan assets. Obligations are based on current and projected obligations of the plans, performance of the plan assets, if applicable, and the timing and amount of funding contributions. At October 31, 2020, we have recorded a long-term liability for deferred pension and postretirement benefits totaling $10.9 million. We believe the effect of the plans on liquidity is not significant to our overall financial condition.\nOur supplemental benefit plan and deferred compensation plan liabilities fluctuate based on changes in the market value of certain equity securities, including our common stock. As of October 31, 2020, our liability under the supplemental benefit plan and the deferred compensation plan was approximately $2.6 million and $3.3 million, respectively.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements, as such term is defined in the rules promulgated by the SEC, that we believe would be material to investors and for which it is reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources.\nEffects of Inflation\nWe have experienced the impact of inflation on our cost of raw materials, labor, freight and overhead. Although we use contractual price indexing along with periodic base price increases to minimize the effect of inflation on our results, we have not been able to fully recover all of the inflationary cost increases. We believe inflation has not had a significant effect on our earnings or financial position over the previous three fiscal years. We cannot provide assurance, however, that our results of operations and financial position will not be materially impacted by inflation in the future.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nIn June 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2016-13, Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326). This amendment replaces the incurred loss impairment methodology in current U.S. GAAP and requires that financial assets be measured on an amortized cost basis and presented at the net amount expected to be collected. This new methodology reflects expected credit losses (rather than probable credit losses) and requires consideration of a broader range of supportable information when determining these estimated credit losses, including relevant experience, current conditions and supportable forecasts to determine collectability. In addition, the amendment provides guidance with regard to the use of an allowance for credit losses for purchased financial assets and available-for-sale debt securities. This amendment becomes effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019, including interim periods within that fiscal year. We expect to adopt this amendment during fiscal 2021, with no material impact on our consolidated financial statements.\nIn August 2018, the FASB issued ASU No. 2018-14, Compensation - Retirement Benefits - Defined Benefit Plans - General (Subtopic 715-20). This amendment modifies the disclosure requirements for employers that sponsor defined benefit pensions or other postretirement plans. Specifically, the amendment removes disclosures which were no longer considered cost beneficial, clarifies certain disclosure requirements, and adds disclosures identified as relevant. This amendment becomes effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2020, including interim periods within that fiscal year. We expect to adopt this amendment during fiscal 2022 with no material impact on our consolidated financial statements.", "item_7_text": "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nThe following discussion and analysis contains forward-looking statements based on our current assumptions, expectations, estimates and projections about our business and the homebuilding industry, and therefore, it should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes thereto, as well as the \"Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\" discussed elsewhere within this Annual Report on Form 10-K. For a listing of potential risks and uncertainties which impact our business and industry, see \"Item 1A. Risk Factors.\" Actual results could differ from our expectations due to several factors which include, but are not limited to: the impact of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, market price and demand for our products, economic and competitive conditions, capital expenditures, new technology, regulatory changes and other uncertainties. Unless otherwise required by law, we undertake no obligation to publicly update any forward-looking statements, even if new information becomes available or other events occur in the future.\nOur Business\nWe manufacture components for original equipment manufacturers in the building products industry. These components can be categorized as window and door (fenestration) components and kitchen and bath cabinet components. Examples of fenestration components include (1) energy-efficient flexible insulating glass spacers, (2) extruded vinyl profiles, (3) window and door screens, and (4) precision-formed metal and wood products. In addition, we provide certain other non-fenestration components and products, which include solar panel sealants, trim moldings, vinyl decking, fencing, water retention barriers, and conservatory roof components. We use low-cost production processes and engineering expertise to provide our customers with specialized products for their specific window, door, and cabinet applications. We believe these capabilities provide us with unique competitive advantages. We serve a primary customer base in North America and the U.K., and also serve customers in international markets through our operating plants in the U.K. and Germany, as well as through sales and marketing efforts in other countries.\nWe continue to invest in organic growth initiatives and we intend to continue evaluating business acquisitions that allow us to expand our existing fenestration and cabinet component footprint, enhance our product offerings, provide new complementary technology, enhance our leadership position within the markets we serve, and expand into new markets or service lines. We have disposed of non-core businesses in the past, and continue to evaluate our business portfolio to ensure that we are investing in markets where we believe there is potential future growth.\nWe currently have three reportable business segments: (1) North American Fenestration segment ( NA Fenestration\u201d), comprising three operating segments, manufacturing vinyl profiles, IG spacers, screens and other fenestration components; (2) European Fenestration segment ( EU Fenestration\u201d), comprising our U.K.-based vinyl extrusion business, manufacturing vinyl profiles and conservatories, and the European insulating glass business manufacturing IG spacers; and (3) North American Cabinet Components segment ( NA Cabinet Components\u201d), comprising our North American cabinet door and components business and two wood-manufacturing plants. We maintain a grouping called Unallocated Corporate & Other, which includes transaction expenses, stock-based compensation, long-term incentive awards based on the performance of our common stock and other factors, certain severance and legal costs not deemed to be allocable to all segments, depreciation of corporate assets, interest expense, other, net, income taxes and inter-segment eliminations, and executive incentive compensation and medical expense fluctuations relative to planned costs as determined during the annual planning process. Other corporate general and administrative costs have been allocated to the reportable business segments, based upon a relative measure of profitability in order to more accurately reflect each reportable business segment's administrative costs. We allocate corporate expenses to businesses acquired mid-year from the date of acquisition. The accounting policies of our operating segments are the same as those used to prepare our accompanying consolidated financial statements. Corporate general and administrative expenses allocated during the years ended October 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018 were $21.7 million, $18.3 million and $18.7 million, respectively.\nNotable Items\nCOVID-19 Impacts\nOn March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization,(WHO), declared the outbreak of COVID-19 to be a global pandemic and recommended containment and mitigation measures. Our first priority with regard to the COVID-19 pandemic is to do everything we can to ensure the safety, health and welfare of our employees, customers, suppliers and other partners. With the implementation of health and safety practices at our facilities, we are continuing to supply the industry during this uncertain time, recognizing the essential role the construction industry plays in providing housing and necessary infrastructure.\nAs federal, state and local governments react to the public health crisis, significant uncertainties have been created in the economy. The COVID-19 pandemic and its related effects continue to have a significant adverse effect on many sectors of the economy and we may be further impacted.\nAs part of our response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we have taken the following measures:\n\u2022We are continuing to provide our products to support critical infrastructure needs while following national, state, and local guidelines required to continue operations during the existence of the pandemic and related local declarations of emergency. All manufacturing facilities in the United States and Germany remained operational for the duration of the pandemic while both U.K. plants shut down in late March 2020 and became operational again during May 2020. However, local or regional hotspots of the pandemic could result in other locations being temporarily idled due to the need to deep clean areas where an employee who has tested positive for COVID-19 worked.\n\u2022While we currently expect any negative impact on sales to be temporary and minimal, the duration of the COVID-19 pandemic, the actions to contain the pandemic and treat its impacts, and the effects on our operations are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted at this time.\n\u2022We reassessed and adjusted our operational needs, including reducing our 2020 capital expenditure plans by approximately 25% to 30%.\n\u2022We have taken precautionary measures intended to help minimize the risk of the virus to our employees, including temporarily requiring some employees to work remotely.\n\u2022We continue to monitor the rapidly evolving situation and guidance from international and domestic authorities, including federal, state and local public health authorities and may take additional actions based on their recommendations. In these circumstances, there may be developments outside our control requiring us to adjust our operating plan.\nTax Cuts and Job Act\nOn December 22, 2017, President Trump signed into law the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the Act) that included sweeping tax reform which affected U.S. corporations, including a reduction of the statutory federal corporate tax rate from 35% to 21%. We made an initial assessment of the Act and recorded a discrete benefit of $6.5 million, which included a charge of $1.2 million for a one-time mandatory transition tax on deemed repatriation of previously tax-deferred and unremitted foreign earnings during the fiscal year ended October 31, 2018. We completed the accounting for the income tax effects of the Act and recorded a charge of $0.4 million for the re-measurement of the one-time mandatory transition tax during the year ended October 31, 2019. The Act also imposed additional tax law changes that became effective during fiscal 2019, which include new requirements for a global intangible low-taxed income provision (GILTI) and a deduction for foreign-derived intangible income (FDII), which resulted in a net charge of $1.2 million during the year ended October 31, 2019.\nMarket Overview and Outlook\nWe believe the primary drivers of our operating results continue to be North American residential remodeling and replacement (R&R) and new home construction activity. We believe that housing starts and window shipments are indicators of activity levels in the homebuilding and window industries, and we use this data, as published by or derived from third-party sources, to evaluate the market. We have historically evaluated the market using data from the National Association of Homebuilders (NAHB) with regard to housing starts, and published reports by Ducker Worldwide, LLC (Ducker), a consulting and research firm, with regard to window shipments in the U.S. We obtain market data from Catalina research, a consulting and research firm, for insight into the U.S. residential wood cabinet demand.\nIn November 2020, the NAHB forecasted calendar-year housing starts (excluding manufactured units) to be 1.4 million in 2020, 1.3 million in 2021, and 1.4 million in 2022. The November 2020 Ducker forecast indicated that window shipments in the R&R market are expected to decrease approximately 1% for calendar year 2020 and increase 2% and 3% in 2021 and 2022, respectively. Derived from reports published by Ducker, the overall decrease in window shipments for the trailing twelve months ended September 30, 2020 was 0.3%. During this period, new construction activities increased 1.1% and R&R decreased 1.4%. In November 2020, Catalina Research estimated that residential semi-custom cabinet demand in the U.S. will decline approximately 6% in 2020, however, 2021 is estimated to grow 3.7%. In line with market forecasts, we expect that some sales originally planned for the year ended October 31, 2020 may be realized during the years ended October 31, 2021 and 2022.\nOur U.K. vinyl business (commonly referred to as \"Liniar\") is largely focused on the sale of vinyl house systems under the trade name Liniar\u201d to smaller window manufacturers in the U.K. Liniar is one of the larger providers of vinyl extruded products in the U.K. in terms of volume shipped. Currently, the U.K. is experiencing a shortage in affordable housing, with rising demand due in part to a growing immigrant population. Liniar's current primary customers are smaller window fabricators, as opposed to the larger OEMs that comprise a large portion of the North American market. These manufacturers seek the quality and technology of the specific products identified by the Liniar trade name. In addition, Liniar services non-fenestration markets including the manufacture of roofing for conservatories, vinyl decking and vinyl water retention barriers\nused for landscaping. We believe there are growth opportunities within these markets in the U.K. and potential synergies which may enable us to sell complementary products.\nNA Cabinet Components manufactures kitchen and bathroom cabinet doors and components, amongst other products, using a variety of woods from traditional hardwoods to engineered wood products. Currently, most of the revenue in the NA Cabinet Components is earned in the U.S., so domestic housing starts and R&R activity constitute the primary drivers of this business as well. The cabinet door market is stratified as follows: stock (low-cost, low-variations), semi-custom (more customized, just-in-time manufacturing, higher price point) and custom (precise customer specifications, just-in-time manufacturing, high-end price point). NA Cabinet Component's primary market is semi-custom.\nOur business is seasonal, particularly our fenestration business, as inclement weather during the winter months tends to slow down construction, particularly as related to outside of the house\u201d construction. To some extent, we believe our kitchen and bathroom cabinet door business lessens the impact of seasonality on our operating results, as the cabinet business is inside of the house\u201d and less susceptible to weather.\nWe are impacted by regulation of energy standards. Although the U.S. government has been less aggressively pursuing higher energy efficiency standards in recent years, other countries have implemented higher energy efficiency standards which should bode well for our fenestration-related business in these markets, particularly our warm-edge spacer products.\nSeveral commodities in our business are subject to pricing fluctuations, including polyvinyl resin (PVC), titanium dioxide (TiO2), petroleum products, aluminum and wood. For the majority of our customers and critical suppliers, we have price adjusters in place which effectively share the base pass-through price changes for our primary commodities with our customers commensurate with the market at large. Our long-term exposure to these price fluctuations is somewhat mitigated due to the contractual component of the adjuster program. However, these adjusters are not in place with all customers and for all commodities, and there is a level of exposure to such volatility due to the lag associated with the timing of price updates in accordance with our customer agreements, particularly with regard to hardwoods. In addition, some of these commodities, such as silicone, are in high demand, particularly in Europe, which can affect the cost of the raw materials, a portion of which we may not be able to fully recover. Thus far we have not experienced any supply or logistics disruptions as lower demand has not required us to source the same level of supply.\nOn June 23, 2016, citizens of the U.K. voted to exit the European Union (E.U.) (referred to as Brexit). In October 2019, the U.K. and E.U. ratified a withdrawal agreement, and subsequently the U.K. left the E.U. on January 31, 2020. A transition period is in place until December 31, 2020 while the U.K. and E.U. negotiate additional arrangements. The current E.U. rules for trade, travel, and business for the U.K. will lapse on December 31, 2020 with any new rules taking effect January 1, 2021.\nGiven the lack of comparable precedent, it is difficult for us to predict the future impacts on our U.K. based operations, which accounted for approximately 15% of our total sales for the year ended October 31, 2020. Due to the fact that we manufacture and sell a majority of our U.K. products within the U.K., there is minimal risk to our ability to physically deliver goods and complete sales. As such, we believe we are well positioned within the U.K. to respond to potential changes to underlying demand as a result of the final Brexit outcome. The primary risk mitigation focus for our U.K. operations centers on the availability and pricing of raw materials. While we source the majority of our raw materials from within the U.K., many of the primary upstream raw materials our vendors use are being sourced from outside of the U.K., which could expose us to cross-border issues and raw material price impacts. We will mitigate this potential impact of Brexit on the import of goods to the U.K. by strategically managing our inventory levels and logistical channels.\nIn February 2020, the U.K. announced its intention to introduce border controls and our U.K. businesses have positioned themselves well to cope with additional demands and tariffs that this will bring in order to comply and facilitate the flow of goods in and out of the U.K. We are still clarifying what the impact of associated tariffs could be.\nThe global economy remains uncertain due to currency devaluations, political unrest, terror threats, global pandemics such as COVID-19, and even the political landscape in the U.S. These and other macro-economic factors have impacted the global financial markets, which may have contributed to significant changes in foreign currencies. We continue to monitor our exposure to changes in exchange rates.\nComparison of the fiscal years ended October 31, 2020 and 2019\nThis table sets forth our consolidated results of operations for the twelve-month periods ended October 31, 2020 and 2019.\n\nOur year-over-year results by reportable segment follow. Our comparison of the results for the fiscal years ended October 31, 2019 and 2018 by reportable segment for the prior year comparative periods can be found in the annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended October 31, 2019.\nChanges Related to Operating Income by Reportable Segment:\nNA Fenestration\n\nNet Sales. Net sales decreased $20.4 million, or 4%, for the twelve months ended October 31, 2020 compared to the same period in 2019, which was primarily driven by a decrease in volumes of $22.9 million, which includes the impacts of COVID-19. The decrease in volume was partially offset by increases in prices and surcharges of $2.5 million.\nCost of Sales. Cost of sales decreased $14.4 million, or 4%, for the twelve months ended October 31, 2020 compared to the same period in 2019. Cost of sales decreased due to lower volumes during the period, including a corresponding decrease in selling expenses as a result of the impacts of COVID-19 as mentioned above.\nSelling, General and Administrative. Our selling, general and administrative expenses decreased by $2.6 million, or 5%, for the twelve months ended October 31, 2020 compared to the same period in 2019. This decrease was due primarily to lower general expenses due to COVID-19 restrictions and lower compensation and benefits year-over-year.\nRestructuring Charges. Restructuring charges incurred during the twelve months ended October 31, 2020 and 2019 relate to facility lease expense for a vinyl extrusion plant in the U.S. which was closed in January 2017 that has not been sublet or otherwise exited as of October 31, 2020.\nEU Fenestration\n\nNet Sales. Net sales decreased $3.8 million, or 2%, when comparing the twelve months ended October 31, 2020 compared to the same period in 2019. A decrease in volumes of $5.5 million year-over-year, which includes of the impacts of COVID-19 was partially offset by $1.1 million of base price increases and $0.6 million of favorable foreign currency rate changes.\nCost of Sales. The cost of sales decreased $5.3 million for the twelve months ended October 31, 2020 compared to the same period in 2019. Cost of sales decreased due to lower volumes during the period, including a corresponding decrease in selling expenses as a result of the impacts of COVID-19 as mentioned above.\nSelling, General and Administrative. Our selling, general and administrative expense decreased $0.3 million for the twelve months ended October 31, 2020 compared to the same period in 2019. The decrease is due to savings incurred from reduced marketing and other general expenses as a result of COVID-19 restrictions, reimbursements for labor costs in the U.K. from government aid for COVID-19 furloughs, and lower incentive compensation.\nNA Cabinet Components\n\nNet Sales. Net sales decreased $19.5 million for the twelve months ended October 31, 2020 compared to the same period in 2019. Approximately $14.0 million of the decrease in sales was due to lower volume related to customer strategic shifts and the impacts of COVID-19. Sales declined an additional $5.5 million due to lower price impacts.\nCost of Sales. The cost of sales decreased $17.4 million for the twelve months ended October 31, 2020 compared to the same period in 2019 as a result of lower volume, including a corresponding decrease in selling expenses as a result of the impacts of COVID-19 as mentioned above.\nSelling, General and Administrative. Our selling, general and administrative expense remained relatively flat for the twelve months ended October 31, 2020 compared to the same period in 2019.\nRestructuring Charges. Restructuring charges of $0.3 million in the twelve months ended October 31, 2020 related to severance, equipment moving and other charges incurred for a plant closure.\nAsset Impairment Charge. Asset impairment charges incurred during the twelve months ended October 31, 2019 related to goodwill impairment charges. There were no corresponding asset impairment charges incurred during the twelve months ended October 31, 2020. For further information, see Note 6, \"Goodwill and Intangible Assets,\" of the accompanying financial statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nUnallocated Corporate & Other\n\nNet Sales. Net sales for Unallocated Corporate & Other represents the elimination of inter-segment sales for the twelve months ended October 31, 2020 and 2019.\nCost of Sales. Cost of sales for Corporate & Other consists of the elimination of inter-segment sales, profit in inventory, and other costs.\nSelling, General and Administrative. Our selling, general and administrative expenses decreased $8.5 million, for the twelve months ended October 31, 2020 compared to the same period in 2019. This decrease is attributable to $4.4 million of lower medical expenses, $2.0 million of lower compensation expense primarily related to the valuations of our stock based compensation awards, lower transaction costs of $1.4 million and lower severance costs related to executive severance and headcount reduction.\nChanges Related to Non-Operating Items:\nInterest Expense. Interest expense decreased $4.4 million for the twelve months ended October 31, 2020 compared to the same period in 2019 primarily due to lower interest rates and lower overall debt outstanding. The weighted average interest rate for borrowings outstanding for the twelve months ended October 31, 2020 was 2.45% compared with 4.07% for the twelve months ended October 31, 2019.\nOther, net. Other, net increased $0.1 million for the twelve months ended October 31, 2020 compared to the same period in 2019. Improvements in the impacts of foreign currency transactions were partially offset by a decrease in pension benefits year-over-year.\nIncome Taxes. We recorded income tax expense of $11.8 million on pre-tax income of $50.3 million for the twelve months ended October 31, 2020, an effective rate of 23.5%, and income tax expense of $10.8 million on pre-tax loss of $36.0 million for the twelve months ended October 31, 2019, an effective rate of 30.0%. The effective rate for the twelve months ended October 31, 2020 was impacted by the true-up of our accruals and related deferred taxes from prior year filings and settled audits. The effective rate for the twelve months ended October 31, 2019 was primarily impacted by the $74.6 million asset impairment charge in the NA Cabinet Components segment which did not generate a tax benefit, and a net charge of $1.2 million related to GILTI and FDII.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nOverview\nHistorically, our principal sources of funds have been cash on hand, cash flow from operations, and borrowings under our credit facilities. As of October 31, 2020, we had $51.6 million of cash and cash equivalents, $103.0 million outstanding under our credit facilities, $4.8 million of outstanding letters of credit and $15.3 million outstanding under finance leases. We had $217.2 million available for use under a revolving credit facility at October 31, 2020.\nOn July 29, 2016, we entered into a $450.0 million credit agreement comprising a $150.0 million Term Loan A and a $300.0 million revolving credit facility (collectively, the 2016 Credit Agreement\u201d), under which we borrowed $150.0 million and $150.0 million, respectively. The proceeds from the 2016 Credit Agreement, along with additional funding of $16.4 million of cash on hand, were used to repay outstanding borrowings under our prior credit facilities of $309.2 million, to pay a 1% prepayment call premium, to settle outstanding interest accrued, and to pay loan fees which totaled $2.8 million. In addition, we expensed $8.1 million to write-off unamortized deferred financing fees and $5.5 million of unamortized original issuer's discount associated with our prior credit facilities. The 2016 Credit Agreement was to mature in 2021 (5-year term) and required interest payments calculated, at our election and depending upon our Consolidated Leverage Ratio, at either a Base Rate plus an applicable margin (0.50% to 1.25%) or the LIBOR Rate plus an applicable margin (1.50% to 2.25%). We included deferred financing fees of $2.8 million as a contra-liability account, and were amortizing this balance straight-line over the term of the facility.\nOn October 18, 2018, we amended and restated the 2016 Credit Agreement by entering into a $325.0 million revolving credit facility (the 2018 Credit Facility\u201d), under which we borrowed $205.0 million. The proceeds from the 2018 Credit Facility, along with additional funding of $10.0 million of cash on hand, were used to repay outstanding borrowings under the 2016 Credit Agreement of $213.5 million, to settle outstanding interest accrued under the prior facility, and to pay loan fees which totaled $1.0 million. In addition, we expensed $1.1 million to write-off unamortized deferred financing fees associated with the 2016 Credit Agreement. The 2018 Credit Facility matures in 2023 (5-year term) and requires interest payments calculated, at our election and depending upon our Consolidated Leverage Ratio, at either a Base Rate plus an applicable margin (0.25% to 1.00%) or the LIBOR Rate plus an applicable margin (1.25% to 2.00%). We included deferred financing fees of $1.5 million as a contra-liability account, and are amortizing this balance straight-line over the term of the facility.\nThe weighted average interest rate of borrowings outstanding for the twelve-month periods ended October 31, 2020 and 2019 was 2.45% and 4.07%, respectively. We were in compliance with our debt covenants as of October 31, 2020. For additional details of the Credit Agreement, see \"Item 1A. Risk Factors,\" included elsewhere within this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nWe expect to repatriate excess cash moving forward and use the funds to retire debt or meet current working capital needs. Funds from operations may be impacted by softer demand and liquidity concerns of our customers as a result of COVID-19. In the U.K., we insure against a portion of our credit losses. In light of the COVID-19 pandemic, the Company has implemented a range of actions aimed at reducing costs and preserving liquidity. We believe our business model, our current cash reserves and the recent steps we have taken to strengthen our balance sheet leave us well-positioned to manage our business as a going concern and remain in compliance with our debt covenants through the COVID-19 crisis as it continues to unfold.\nAnalysis of Cash Flow\nThe following table summarizes our cash flow results for the years ended October 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018:\n\nOur year-over-year cash flow analysis follows. Our cash flow analysis for the fiscal years ended October 31, 2019 and 2018 for the prior year comparative periods can be found in the annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended October 31, 2019.\nOperating Activities\nOperating cash flow for the year ended October 31, 2020 increased $4.4 million while cash flow for the year ending October 31, 2019 decreased by $8.2 million. Our ability to continue operations and deliver orders as an essential service provider mitigated some of the effects of COVID-19. Our efforts to maintain operating levels in accordance with demand allowed us to remain efficient with our working capital and use inventory effectively. To date, slower paying customers as a result of COVID-19 have not significantly impacted our liquidity, but this could become a concern in the future.\nInvesting Activities\nCash used for investing activities for the year ended October 31, 2020 increased $1.7 million compared to the year ended October 31, 2019 due to an increase of $0.8 million in our investment in capital expenditures and a decline in proceeds from the disposition of capital assets of $0.8 million.\nAt October 31, 2020, we had firm purchase commitments of approximately $2.2 million for the purchase or construction of capital assets. We plan to fund these capital expenditures through cash from operations or borrowings under our revolving credit facility.\nFinancing Activities\nIn 2020, cash used for financing activities was $55.1 million and related primarily to net debt repayments of $40.5 million, payment of dividends of $10.5 million, and share repurchases of $7.2 million. In 2019, cash used for financing activities was $71.3 million and related primarily to net debt repayments of $54.0 million, payment of dividends of $10.6 million, and share repurchases of $9.6 million.\nLiquidity Requirements\nOur strategy for deploying cash is to invest in organic growth opportunities, develop our infrastructure, and explore strategic acquisitions. Other uses of cash include paying cash dividends to our shareholders and repurchasing our own stock. We maintain cash balances in foreign countries which totaled $16.8 million and $9.8 million as of October 31, 2020 and 2019. During the years ended October 31, 2020 and 2019, we repatriated $31.9 million and $24.2 million, respectively, of foreign earnings from our international divisions.\nWe believe that we have sufficient funds and adequate financial resources available to meet our anticipated liquidity needs. We expect to use our cash flow from operations to fund operations for the next twelve months and the foreseeable future. We believe these funds should be adequate to provide for our working capital requirements, capital expenditures, and dividends, while continuing to meet our debt service requirements.\nSenior Credit Facility\nWe maintain our $325.0 million 2018 Credit Facility, which contains a revolving credit facility, with Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as Agent, Swingline Lender and Issuing Lender, and Bank of America, N.A. serving as Syndication Agent. The 2018 Credit Facility has a five-year term, maturing on October 18, 2023, and requires interest payments calculated, at our election and depending upon our Consolidated Leverage Ratio, at either a Base Rate plus an applicable margin or the LIBOR Rate plus an applicable margin. At the time of the initial borrowing, the applicable rate was LIBOR + 1.50%. In addition, we are subject to commitment fees for the unused portion of the 2018 Credit Facility. The applicable margin and commitment fees range from 0.45% to 2.30%, depending upon the type of loan and consolidated leverage ratio. The Credit Facility contains appropriate provisions to substitute LIBOR with a replacement rate upon transition away from LIBOR. These provisions include a temporary conversion of applicable interest for all borrowings outstanding to be calculated as base rate loans until such time that the replacement rate is agreed upon.\nThe 2018 Credit Facility provides for revolving credit commitments for a minimum principal amount of $10.0 million, up to an aggregate amount of $150.0 million, subject to the lender's discretion to elect or decline the incremental increase. We can also borrow up to the lesser of $15.0 million or the revolving credit commitment, as defined, under a Swingline feature of the 2018 Credit Facility.\nThe 2018 Credit Facility contains a: (1) Consolidated Interest Coverage Ratio requirement whereby we must not permit the Consolidated Interest Coverage Ratio, as defined, to be less than 2.25 to 1.00, and (2) Consolidated Leverage Ratio requirement, whereby we must not permit the Consolidated Leverage Ratio, as defined, to be greater than 3.25 to 1.00.\nIn addition to maintaining these financial covenants, the 2018 Credit Facility also limits our ability to enter into certain business transactions, such as to incur indebtedness or liens, to acquire businesses or dispose of material assets, make restricted payments, pay dividends (limited to $20.0 million per year) and to conduct other transactions as further defined in the 2018 Credit Facility. Some of these limitations, however, do not take effect so long as total leverage is less than or equal to 2.75 to 1.00 and available liquidity exceeds $25 million. Substantially all of our domestic assets, with the exception of real property, are pledged as collateral for the 2018 Credit Facility.\nIssuer Purchases of Equity Securities\nOn August 30, 2018, our Board of Directors approved a stock repurchase program that authorized the repurchase of up to $60.0 million worth of shares of our common stock. Repurchases under the new program will be made in open market transactions or privately negotiated transactions, subject to market conditions, applicable legal requirements and other relevant factors. The program does not have an expiration date or a limit on the number of shares that may be purchased. During the years ended October 31, 2020 and 2019, we purchased 450,000 shares and 583,398 shares, respectively, at a cost of $7.2 million and $9.6 million, respectively, under this program.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nThe preparation of our financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (U.S. GAAP) requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. Estimates and assumptions about future events and their effects cannot be perceived with certainty. Estimates may change as new events occur, as more experience is acquired, as additional information becomes available and as our operating environment changes. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, and that we believe provide a basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily available through open market quotes. We must use our judgment with regard to uncertainties in order to make these estimates. Actual results could differ from these estimates.\nWe believe the following are the most critical accounting policies used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements as well as the significant judgments and uncertainties affecting the application of these policies. We consider an estimate to be critical if it is subjective and if changes in the estimate using different assumptions would result in a material impact to our financial position or results of operations.\nWhile there have been no changes in the application of principles, methods, and assumptions used to determine our significant estimates, we may be required to revise certain accounting estimates and judgments related to the economic and business impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, such as, but not limited to, those related to the valuation of goodwill, intangibles, long-lived assets, accounts receivable, and inventory, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations.\nRevenue from Contracts with Customers\nRevenue recognition\nWe recognize revenue that reflects the consideration we expect to receive for product sales upon transfer to customers. Revenue for product sales is recognized when control of the promised products is transferred to our customers, and we expect to be entitled to consideration in exchange for transferring those products. We account for a contract when a customer provides us with a firm purchase order that identifies the products to be provided, the payment terms for those services, and when collectability of the consideration due is probable.\nPerformance obligations\nA performance obligation is a promise to provide the customer with a good or service. Our performance obligations include product sales, with each product included in a customer contract being recognized as a separate performance obligation. For contracts with multiple performance obligations, the standalone selling price of each product is generally readily observable.\nRevenue from product sales is recognized at a point in time when the product is transferred to the customer, in accordance with the shipping terms, which is generally upon shipment. We estimate a provision for sales returns and warranty allowances to account for product returns related to general returns and product nonconformance.\nPricing and sales incentives\nPricing is established at or prior to the time of sale with our customers and we record sales at the agreed-upon net selling price, reflective of current and prospective discounts.\nPractical expedients and exemptions\nWe generally expense incremental costs of obtaining a contract when incurred because the amortization period would be less than one year. Additionally, we do not disclose the value of unsatisfied performance obligations for contracts with an original expected length of one year or less.\nShipping and handling costs\nWe have elected to account for shipping and handling services as fulfillment services in accordance with ASC Topic 606 guidance; accordingly, freight revenue will be combined with the product deliverable rather than being accounted for as a distinct performance obligation within the terms of the agreement. Shipping and handling costs incurred by us for the delivery of goods to customers are considered a cost to fulfill the contract and are included in cost of sales in the accompanying consolidated statements of income (loss).\nContract assets and liabilities\nDeferred revenue, which is not significant, is recorded when we have remaining unsatisfied performance obligations for which we have received consideration.\nDisaggregation of revenue\nWe produce a wide variety of products that are used in the fenestration industry, including window spacer systems; extruded vinyl products; metal fabricated products; and astragals, thresholds and screens. In addition, we produce certain non-fenestration products, including kitchen and bath cabinet doors and components, flooring and trim moldings, solar edge tape, plastic decking, fencing, water retention barriers, conservatory roof components, and other products.\nAllowance for Doubtful Accounts\nWe record trade accounts receivable at billed amounts, less an allowance for doubtful accounts. This allowance is established to estimate the risk of loss associated with our trade receivables which may arise due to the inability of our customers to pay or due to changes in circumstances. The allowance is maintained at a level that we consider appropriate based on factors that affect collectability, including: (a) historical trends of write-offs, recoveries and credit losses; (b) the credit quality of our customers; and (c) projected economic and market conditions. Different assumptions or changes in economic circumstances could result in changes to the allowance. Our historical bad debt expense has been less than 0.1% of sales for the years ended October 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018. If bad debt expense increased by 1% of net sales, the impact on operating results would have been a decrease in net income of $6.4 million for the year ended October 31, 2020, an increase in net loss of $6.8 million for the year ended October 31, 2019 and a decrease in net income of $9.2 million for the year ended October 31, 2018.\nBusiness Combinations - Contingencies\nWe apply the acquisition method of accounting for business combinations in accordance with U.S. GAAP, which requires us to make use of estimates and judgments to allocate the purchase price paid for acquisitions to the fair value of the net assets and liabilities acquired. We use established valuation techniques and engage reputable valuation specialists to assist us with these valuations. However, there is a risk that we may not identify all pre-acquisition contingencies or that our estimates may not reflect the actual results when realized. We use a reasonable measurement period to record any adjustment related to the opening balance sheet (generally, less than one year). After the measurement period, changes to the opening balance sheet can result in the recognition of income or expense as period costs. To the extent these items stem from contingencies that existed at the balance sheet date, but are contingent upon the realization of future events, the cost is charged to expense at the time the future event becomes known. If our purchase accounting estimates are not correct, or if we do not recognize contingent assets or liabilities accurately, we may incur losses.\nImpairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets\nProperty, Plant and Equipment and Intangible Assets with Defined Lives\nWe make judgments and estimates in conjunction with the carrying value of our long-term assets, including property, plant and equipment, and identifiable intangibles. These judgments may include the basis for capitalization, depreciation and amortization methods and the useful lives of the underlying assets. In accordance with U.S. GAAP, we review the carrying values of these assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. We determine that the carrying amount is not recoverable if it exceeds the sum of the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the asset. If the carrying value exceeds the sum of the undiscounted cash flows and after considering alternate uses for the asset, an impairment charge would be recorded in the period in which such review is performed. We measure the impairment loss as the amount by which the carrying amount of the long-lived asset exceeds its fair value. Fair value is determined by reference to quoted market prices in active markets, if available, or by calculating the discounted cash flows associated with the use and eventual disposition of the asset. Therefore, if there are indicators of impairment, we are required to make long-term forecasts of our future revenues and costs related to the assets subject to review. Forecasts require assumptions about demand for our products and future market conditions. Although there may be no indicators of impairment in the current period, unanticipated changes to assumptions or circumstances in future periods could result in an impairment charge in the period of the change. No impairment charges were incurred with regard to our property, plant and equipment for the years ended October 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018.\nWe monitor relevant circumstances, including industry trends, general economic conditions, and the potential impact that such circumstances might have on the valuation of our identifiable intangibles. Events and changes in circumstances that may cause a triggering event and necessitate such a review include, but are not limited to: a decrease in sales for certain customers, improvements or changes in technology, and/or a decision to phase-out a trademark or trade name. Such events could negatively impact the carrying value of our identifiable intangibles. It is possible that changes in such circumstances or in the numerous variables associated with the judgments, assumptions, and estimates made by us in assessing the appropriate valuation of our identifiable intangibles could require us to further write down a portion of our identifiable intangibles and record related non-cash impairment charges in the future. We apply a variety of techniques to establish the carrying value of our intangible assets, including the relief from royalty and excess current year earnings methods.\nGoodwill\nWe use the acquisition method to account for business combinations and, to the extent that the purchase price exceeds the fair value of the net assets acquired, we record goodwill. In accordance with U.S. GAAP, we are required to evaluate our goodwill at least annually. We perform our annual goodwill assessment as of August 31, or more frequently if indicators of impairment exist. Qualitative factors that indicate impairment could include, but are not limited to, (i) macroeconomic conditions, (ii) industry and market considerations, (iii) cost factors, (iv) overall financial performance of the reporting unit, and (v) other relevant entity-specific events. The first step in our annual goodwill assessment is to perform the optional qualitative assessment allowed by ASC Topic 350 Intangibles - Goodwill and Other\u201d (ASC 350). In our qualitative assessment, we evaluate relevant events or circumstances to determine whether it is more likely than not (i.e., greater than 50%) that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. If we determine that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, ASC 350 requires us to compare the fair value of such reporting unit to its carrying value including goodwill. To determine the fair value of our reporting units, we use multiple valuation techniques including a discounted cash flow analysis, using the applicable weighted average cost of capital, in combination with a market approach that uses market multiples and a selection of guideline public companies. This test requires us to make assumptions about the future growth of our business and the market in general, as well as other variables such as the level of investment in capital expenditure, growth in working capital requirements and the terminal or residual value of our reporting units beyond the periods of estimated annual cash flows. We use a third-party valuation firm to assist us with this analysis. If the fair value of each reporting unit exceeds its carrying value, no action is required. Otherwise, an impairment loss is recorded to the extent that the carrying amount of the reporting unit including goodwill exceeds the fair value of that reporting unit. We believe the estimates and assumptions used in our impairment assessment are reasonable based on available market information, but variations in any of the assumptions could result in materially different calculations of fair value and determinations of whether or not an impairment is indicated during current or future periods.\nAs a result of quantitative assessments performed during the year ended October 31, 2019, we recorded impairment charges totaling $74.6 million during the year ended October 31, 2019, reducing the goodwill balance applicable to the reporting unit included in our NA Cabinet Components operating segment from $113.7 million to $39.1 million.\nFor the year ended October 31, 2020, the World Health Organization's declaration of COVID-19 as a global pandemic also created significant changes in market conditions that were indicators of triggering events which necessitated an evaluation of certain long-term assets, including goodwill, for potential impairment. We performed quantitative assessments based upon undiscounted cash flows we expected to realize associated with these assets over the remaining useful lives of the primary operating assets to the net book value of the long-term assets, including goodwill, and determined that these assets, including goodwill, were not impaired.\nAt our annual testing date, August 31, 2020, we had five reporting units with goodwill balances: two reporting units included in our NA Fenestration operating segment, two reporting units included in our EU Fenestration operating segment, and one reporting unit included in our NA Cabinet Components operating segment. We performed a qualitative assessment of the two reporting units in the NA Fenestration segment and one of the reporting units in the EU Fenestration segment. This review included an analysis of historical goodwill test results, operating results relative to forecast, projected results over the next five years, and other measures and concluded that there were no indicators of potential impairment associated with these reporting units. Therefore, no additional testing was deemed necessary for the reporting units in the NA Fenestration segment and the EU Fenestration segment that were assessed qualitatively. We also updated the quantitative assessments for the reportable unit in the NA Cabinet Compnents segment and the second reportable unit in the EU Fenestration segment. We determined the fair value of these reportable units exceeded the carrying value by 5% and 36%, respectively, and concluded that no impairment was necessary.\nRestructuring\nWe account for restructuring costs in accordance with U.S. GAAP, whereby we accrue for one-time severance benefits pursuant to an approved plan of restructuring at the communication date, when affected employees have been notified of the potential severance and sufficient information has been provided for the employee to calculate severance benefits, in the event the employee is involuntarily terminated. In addition, we accrue costs associated with the termination of contractual commitments including operating leases at the time the lease is terminated pursuant to the lease provisions or in accordance with another agreement with the landlord. Otherwise, we continue to recognize operating lease expense through the cease-use date. After the cease-use date, we determine if our operating lease payments are at market. We assume sublet of the facility at the market rate. To the extent our lease obligations exceed the fair value rentals, we discount to arrive at the present value and record a liability. If the facility is not sublet, we expense the amount of the lease in the current period until sublet. For other costs directly related to the restructuring effort, such as equipment moving costs, we expense in the period incurred.\nLeases\nEffective November 1, 2019, we adopted Accounting Standards Codification Topic 842, \"Leases\" (ASC Topic 842), which requires leases to be recognized on the balance sheet. We recognize a right-of-use (ROU) asset and lease liability for each operating and finance lease with a contractual term greater than 12 months at the time of lease inception. We include ROU assets and lease liabilities for leases that exist within other contracts. Leases with an original term of 12 months or less are not recognized on the balance sheet, and the rent expense related to those short-term leases is recognized over the lease term. We do not account for lease and non-lease (e.g. common area maintenance) components of contracts separately for any underlying asset class.\nWe lease certain manufacturing plants, warehouses, office space, vehicles and equipment under finance and operating leases. Lease commencement occurs on the date we take possession or control of the property or equipment. Original terms for our real estate-related leases are generally between five and twenty years. Original terms for equipment-related leases, primarily manufacturing equipment and vehicles, are generally between one and ten years. Some of our leases also include rental escalation clauses. Renewal options are included in the determination of lease payments when management determines the options are reasonably certain of exercise, considering financial performance, strategic importance and/or invested capital.\nIf readily determinable, the rate implicit in the lease is used to discount lease payments to present value; however, substantially all of our leases do not provide a readily determinable implicit rate. When the implicit rate is not determinable, our estimated incremental borrowing rate is utilized, determined on a collateralized basis, to discount lease payments based on information available at lease commencement.\nTotal lease costs recorded include fixed operating lease costs and variable lease costs. Most of our real estate leases require we pay certain expenses, such as common area maintenance costs, of which the fixed portion is included in operating lease costs. We recognize operating lease costs on a straight-line basis over the lease term. In addition to the above costs, variable lease costs are recognized when probable and are not included in determining the present value of our lease liability.\nThe ROU asset is measured at the initial amount of the lease liability adjusted for lease payments made at or before the lease commencement date and initial direct costs. For operating leases, ROU assets are reduced over the lease term by the recognized straight-line lease expense less the amount of accretion of the lease liability determined using the effective interest method. For finance leases, ROU assets are amortized on a straight-line basis over the shorter of the useful life of the leased asset or the lease term. Interest expense on each finance lease liability is recognized utilizing the effective interest method. ROU assets are tested for impairment in the same manner as long-lived assets. Additionally, we monitor for events or changes in circumstances that may require a reassessment of one of our leases and determine if a remeasurement is required.\nIncome Taxes\nWe operate in various jurisdictions and therefore our income tax expense relates to income taxes in the U.S., U.K., Canada, and Germany, as well as local and state income taxes. We recognize the effect of a change in tax rates in the period of the change. We record the estimated future tax effects of temporary differences between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and the amounts reported in our consolidated balance sheets, as well as net operating losses and tax credit carry forward. We evaluate the carrying value of our net deferred tax assets and determine if our business will generate sufficient future taxable income to realize the net deferred tax assets. We perform this review for recoverability on a jurisdictional basis, whereby we consider both positive and negative evidence related to the likelihood of realization of the deferred tax assets. The weight given to the positive and negative evidence is commensurate with the extent to which the evidence can be objectively verified. We evaluate recoverability based on an estimate of future taxable income using the long-term forecasts we use to evaluate long-lived assets, goodwill and intangible assets for impairment, taking into consideration the future reversal of existing taxable temporary differences and reviewing our current financial operations. In the event that our estimates and assumptions indicate we will not generate sufficient future taxable income to realize our deferred tax assets, we will record a valuation allowance, to the extent indicated, to reduce our deferred tax assets to their realizable value.\nAnnually, we evaluate our tax positions to determine if there have been any changes in uncertain tax positions or if there has been a lapse in the statute of limitations with regard to such positions. Our liability for uncertain tax positions at October 31, 2020 and 2019 totaled $0.5 million and $0.6 million, respectively, and related to certain state tax items regarding the interpretation of tax laws and regulations.\nWe believe we will have sufficient taxable income in the future to fully utilize our unreserved deferred tax assets recorded as of October 31, 2020. There is a risk that our estimates related to the future use of loss carry forwards and our ability to realize our deferred tax assets may not come to fruition, and that the results could materially impact our financial position and results of operations. We have recorded the benefit associated with the patent box\u201d deduction in the U.K. with regard to our operations at Liniar. We believe that it is more likely than not that our deduction with regard to this position would be sustained upon examination. Our deferred tax assets at October 31, 2020 and 2019 totaled $20.1 million and $21.0 million, respectively, against which we had recorded a valuation allowance of $1.5 million and $1.6 million, respectively.\nInsurance\nWe manage our costs of workers' compensation, group medical, property, casualty and other liability exposures through a combination of self-insurance retentions and insurance coverage with third-party carriers. Liabilities associated with our portion of this exposure are not discounted. We estimate our exposure by considering various factors which may include: (1) historical claims experience, (2) severity factors, (3) estimated claims incurred but not reported and (4) loss development factors, which are used to estimate how claims will develop over time until settled or closed. While we consider a number of factors in preparing our estimate of risk exposure, we must use our judgment to determine the amounts to accrue in our financial statements. Actual claims can differ significantly from estimated liabilities if future claims experience differs from historical experience, and if we determine that our assumptions used for analysis or our development factors are flawed. We do not recognize insurance recoveries until any contingencies relating to the claim have been resolved.\nInventory\nWe record inventory at the lower of cost or net realizable value. Inventories are valued using the first-in first-out (FIFO) method. Fixed costs related to excess manufacturing capacity have been expensed in the period, and therefore, are not capitalized into inventory. Inventory quantities are regularly reviewed and provisions for excess or obsolete inventory are recorded primarily based on our forecast of future demand and market conditions. Significant unanticipated changes to our forecasts or changes in the net realizable value of our inventory would require a change in the provision for excess or obsolete inventory. For the years ended October 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, our inventory reserves are approximately 10%, 5%, and 6% of gross inventory, respectively. Assuming an increase in obsolescence equal to 1% of gross inventory, net income would have decreased by $0.5 million for the year ended October 31, 2020, net loss would have increased by $0.5 million for the year ended October 31, 2019, and net income would have been reduced by $1.0 million for the year ended October 31, 2018.\nRetirement Plans\nWe sponsor a defined benefit pension plan and an unfunded postretirement plan that provides health care and life insurance benefits for a limited pool of eligible retirees and dependents. On January 1, 2020, we enacted changes to our pension plan whereby the benefits for all participants were frozen and thereafter those participants will receive increased benefits in the company sponsored defined contribution plan in lieu of participation in a defined benefit plan. The measurement of liabilities related to these plans is based on our assumptions related to future events, including expected return on plan assets and healthcare cost trend rates. The discount rate reflects the rate at which benefits could be effectively settled on the measurement date. We determine our discount rate using a RATE: Link Model whereby target yields are developed from bonds across a range of maturity points, and a curve is fitted to those targets. Spot rates (zero coupon bond yields) are developed from the curve and used to discount benefit payments associated with each future year. This model assumes spot rates will remain level beyond the 30-year point. We determine the present value of plan benefits by applying the discount rates to projected benefit cash flows. Actual pension plan asset investment performance, as well as other economic experience such as discount rate and demographic experience, will either reduce or increase unamortized pension losses at the end of any fiscal year, which ultimately affects future pension costs.\nAs of October 31, 2020, our projected benefit obligation (PBO) and accumulated benefit obligation (ABO) each exceeded the fair value of the plan assets by $10.7 million. As a comparison, our PBO and ABO exceeded the fair value of plan assets by $13.1 million and $12.1 million, respectively, as of October 31, 2019. During fiscal 2020, we contributed $3.7 million to the pension plan to meet minimum contribution requirements. Expected contributions are dependent on many variables, including the variability of the market value of the assets as compared to the obligation and other market or regulatory conditions. In addition, we take into consideration our business investment opportunities and our cash requirements. Accordingly, actual funding may differ greatly from current estimates. As of October 31, 2020, a 1% decrease in the discount rate would result in an increase in the PBO of $5.8 million.\nUnder U.S. GAAP, we are not required to immediately recognize the effects of a deviation between actual and assumed experience under our pension plan, or to revise our estimate as a result. This approach allows the favorable and unfavorable effects that fall within an acceptable range to be netted and disclosed as an unrecognized gain or loss. As of October 31, 2020 and 2019, a net actuarial loss of $9.9 million and $6.7 million, respectively, was included in our accumulated other comprehensive (loss) income. There were no net prior service costs or transition obligations for the years ended October 31, 2020 and 2019. The effect on fiscal years after 2020 will depend on the actual experience of the plans.\nMortality assumptions used to determine the obligations for our pension plans are based on the Pri-2012 base mortality table with MP-2018 mortality improvement scale.\nStock-Based Compensation\nWe have issued stock-based compensation in the form of stock options to directors, employees and officers, and non-vested restricted stock awards to certain key employees and officers. We apply the provisions of ASC Topic 718 Compensation - Stock Compensation\u201d (ASC 718) to determine the fair value of stock option awards on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes valuation model. We recognize the fair value as compensation expense on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period of the award based on awards ultimately expected to vest. Stock options granted to directors vest immediately while the stock options granted to our employees and officers typically vest ratably over a three-year period with service and continued employment as the vesting conditions. For new option grants to retirement-eligible employees, we recognize expense and vest immediately upon grant, consistent with the retirement vesting acceleration provisions of these grants. For employees near retirement age, we amortize such grants over the period from the grant date to the retirement-eligibility date if such period is shorter than the standard vesting schedule. For grants of non-vested restricted stock, we calculate the compensation expense at the grant date as the number of shares granted multiplied by the closing stock price of our common stock on the date of grant. This expense is recognized ratably over the vesting period. Our non-vested restricted stock grants to officers and employees cliff vest over a three-year period with service and continued employment as the only vesting criteria. Our fair value determination of stock-based payment awards on the date of grant using an option-pricing model is affected by our stock price as well as assumptions regarding a number of highly complex and subjective variables. These variables include, but are not limited to, our expected stock price volatility over the term of the awards, actual and projected employee stock option exercise behavior over the expected term, our dividend rate, risk-free rate and expectation with regards to forfeitures. Option-pricing models were developed for use in estimating the value of traded options that have no vesting or hedging restrictions and are fully transferable. Because our employee stock options have certain characteristics that are significantly different from traded options, and because changes in the subjective assumptions can materially affect the estimated value, the valuation models may not provide an accurate measure of the fair value of our employee stock options. Accordingly, that value may not be indicative of the fair value observed in a willing buyer/willing seller market transaction.\nWe have granted other awards which are linked to the performance of our common stock, but will settle in cash rather than the issuance of shares of our common stock. The value of these awards fluctuates with changes in our stock price, with the resulting gains or losses reflected in the period of the change. We have recorded current and non-current liabilities related to these awards reflected in our consolidated balance sheets at October 31, 2020 and 2019, included elsewhere within this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nIn addition, we have granted performance share awards which settle in cash and shares upon vesting. The award granted during the year ended October 31, 2018 has vesting criteria based on a market condition (relative total shareholder return) and an internal performance condition (earnings per share growth). The awards granted during the years ended October 31, 2020 and 2019 use return on net assets as the vesting condition and settle in cash. We use a Monte Carlo simulation model to value the market condition and our stock price on the date of grant to value the internal performance condition. We bifurcate the liability and equity portion of the awards (amounts expected to settle in cash and shares, respectively) and recognize expense ratably over the vesting period of three years. We estimate that the performance measures will be met and shares will vest at target until the year of settlement (third year of cliff vesting). As of October 31, 2020, we do not expect any performance share awards to vest.\nWe also awarded performance restricted stock units to key employees and officers in December 2019, 2018, and 2017. These awards cliff vest upon a three-year service period with the absolute total shareholder return of our common stock over this three-year term as the vesting criteria. The number of performance restricted stock units earned is variable depending on the metric achieved, and the settlement method is 100% in our common stock, with accrued dividends paid in cash at the time of vesting, assuming the shares had been outstanding throughout the performance period. To value the performance restricted stock units, we use a Monte Carlo simulation model to arrive at a grant-date fair value. This amount will be adjusted for forfeitures and expensed over the three-year term of the award with a credit to additional paid-in-capital. Similar to performance shares, the performance restricted stock units are not considered outstanding shares, do not have voting rights, and are excluded from diluted weighted-average shares used to calculate earnings per share until the performance criteria is probable to result in the issuance of contingent shares. As of October 31, 2020, we have deemed 32,322 shares related to the December 2017 grants of performance restricted stock units as probable to vest.\nContractual Obligations and Commercial Commitments\nOur contractual obligations and commercial commitments include unconditional purchase obligations which consist of commitments to buy miscellaneous parts, inventory, and expenditures related to capital projects in progress. In addition, during fiscal 2021, we expect to contribute approximately $0.5 million to our pension plan to meet our minimum contribution requirements. Pension contributions beyond 2021 cannot be determined since the amount of any contribution is heavily dependent on the future economic environment and investment returns on pension plan assets. Obligations are based on current and projected obligations of the plans, performance of the plan assets, if applicable, and the timing and amount of funding contributions. At October 31, 2020, we have recorded a long-term liability for deferred pension and postretirement benefits totaling $10.9 million. We believe the effect of the plans on liquidity is not significant to our overall financial condition.\nOur supplemental benefit plan and deferred compensation plan liabilities fluctuate based on changes in the market value of certain equity securities, including our common stock. As of October 31, 2020, our liability under the supplemental benefit plan and the deferred compensation plan was approximately $2.6 million and $3.3 million, respectively.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements, as such term is defined in the rules promulgated by the SEC, that we believe would be material to investors and for which it is reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources.\nEffects of Inflation\nWe have experienced the impact of inflation on our cost of raw materials, labor, freight and overhead. Although we use contractual price indexing along with periodic base price increases to minimize the effect of inflation on our results, we have not been able to fully recover all of the inflationary cost increases. We believe inflation has not had a significant effect on our earnings or financial position over the previous three fiscal years. We cannot provide assurance, however, that our results of operations and financial position will not be materially impacted by inflation in the future.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nIn June 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2016-13, Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326). This amendment replaces the incurred loss impairment methodology in current U.S. GAAP and requires that financial assets be measured on an amortized cost basis and presented at the net amount expected to be collected. This new methodology reflects expected credit losses (rather than probable credit losses) and requires consideration of a broader range of supportable information when determining these estimated credit losses, including relevant experience, current conditions and supportable forecasts to determine collectability. In addition, the amendment provides guidance with regard to the use of an allowance for credit losses for purchased financial assets and available-for-sale debt securities. This amendment becomes effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019, including interim periods within that fiscal year. We expect to adopt this amendment during fiscal 2021, with no material impact on our consolidated financial statements.\nIn August 2018, the FASB issued ASU No. 2018-14, Compensation - Retirement Benefits - Defined Benefit Plans - General (Subtopic 715-20). This amendment modifies the disclosure requirements for employers that sponsor defined benefit pensions or other postretirement plans. Specifically, the amendment removes disclosures which were no longer considered cost beneficial, clarifies certain disclosure requirements, and adds disclosures identified as relevant. This amendment becomes effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2020, including interim periods within that fiscal year. We expect to adopt this amendment during fiscal 2022 with no material impact on our consolidated financial statements.", "item_7_tables": "Table 16: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>

million in fiscal 2020 compared to $893.8 million in fiscal 2019, primarily due to lower volumes related to COVID-19.\n\n- Operating income was $55.3 million in fiscal 2020 versus an operating loss of $26.4 million in fiscal 2019. The increase was primarily due to the prior year including a $74.6 million asset impairment charge.\n\n- Net income was $38.5 million in fiscal 2020 compared to a net loss of $46.7 million in fiscal 2019. The improvement was mainly due to higher operating income. \n\n- By segment, NA Fenestration and EU Fenestration operating income increased slightly while NA Cabinet Components went from an operating loss of $74.2 million to an operating loss of $2.4 million due to the absence of an impairment charge.\n\n- Cash from operations was $100.8 million in fiscal 2020 versus $96.4 million in fiscal 2019. Cash was used for investing activities, debt repayments, dividends and share repurchases. \n\n- The company has taken actions during COVID-19 to reduce costs, preserve liquidity, and believes it is well-positioned to manage through the pandemic.\n\nIn summary, the company improved profitability and cash flow in fiscal 2020 compared to the prior year, despite lower revenue related to COVID-19 impacts. Performance varied by segment but was aided by the absence of an impairment charge. The company appears financially stable to withstand challenges from the pandemic."}
