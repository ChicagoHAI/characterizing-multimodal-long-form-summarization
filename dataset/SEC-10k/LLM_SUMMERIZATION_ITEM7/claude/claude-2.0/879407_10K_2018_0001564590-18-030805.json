Using a broad portfolio of RNA chemistries and efficient modes of delivery, Arrowhead therapies trigger the RNA interference mechanism to induce rapid, deep and durable knockdown of target genes. RNA interference, or RNAi, is a mechanism present in living cells that inhibits the expression of a specific gene, thereby affecting the production of a specific protein. Deemed to be one of the most important recent discoveries in life science with the potential to transform medicine, the discoverers of RNAi were awarded a Nobel Prize in 2006 for their work. Arrowhead's RNAi-based therapeutics leverage this natural pathway of gene silencing. The company's pipeline includes ARO-AAT for liver disease associated with alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency (AATD), ARO-APOC3 for hypertriglyceridemia, ARO-ANG3 for dyslipidemia, ARO-ENaC for cystic fibrosis, and ARO-HIF2 for renal cell carcinoma. ARO-LPA (AMG 890) for cardiovascular disease was out-licensed to Amgen Inc. in 2016. ARO-AMG1 for an undisclosed genetically validated cardiovascular target is under a license and collaboration agreement with Amgen Inc. ARO-HBV for chronic hepatitis B virus was out-licensed to Janssen Pharmaceuticals, Inc. in October 2018.\nArrowhead operates a lab facility in Madison, Wisconsin, where the Company's research and development activities, including the development of RNAi therapeutics, are based. The Company's principal executive offices are located in Pasadena, California.\nArrowhead has refocused its resources on therapeutics that exclusively utilize the company's Targeted RNAi Molecule (TRiMTM) platform technology. Therapeutics built on the TRiMTM platform have demonstrated high levels of pharmacologic activity in multiple animal models spanning several therapeutic areas. TRiMTM enabled therapeutics offer several potential advantages over prior generation and competing technologies, including: simplified manufacturing and reduced costs; multiple routes of administration including subcutaneous injection and inhaled administration; the ability to target multiple tissue types including liver, lung, and tumors; and the potential for improved safety and reduced risk of intracellular buildup, because there are less metabolites from smaller, simpler molecules.\nDuring fiscal 2018, the Company achieved substantial progress on its pipeline candidates. In the first half of fiscal 2018, Clinical Trial Applications (CTAs) were filed for ARO-AAT and ARO-HBV, and the associated phase 1 (ARO-AAT) and phase 1 / 2 (ARO-HBV) studies are ongoing. Dosing has completed for the ARO-AAT phase 1 clinical study. In October 2018, the Company also filed a CTA for ARO-ANG3 and, pending approval, the Company anticipates the startup of this study in 2019. The Company has also achieved substantial progress on its other preclinical candidates including ARO-APOC3, ARO-ENaC and ARO-HIF2, with planned CTA or equivalent filings planned in late calendar 2018 for ARO-APOC3 and in 2019 for ARO-ENaC and ARO-HIF2.\nThe Company also made significant progress on its business development and partnership collaboration efforts. In October 2018, the Company entered into a License Agreement ( Janssen License Agreement\u201d) and a Research Collaboration and Option Agreement ( Janssen Collaboration Agreement\u201d) with Janssen Pharmaceuticals, Inc. ( Janssen\u201d) part of the Janssen Pharmaceutical Companies of Johnson & Johnson. The Company also entered into a Stock Purchase Agreement ( JJDC Stock Purchase Agreement\u201d) with Johnson & Johnson Innovation-JJDC, Inc. ( JJDC\u201d), a New Jersey corporation. Under the Janssen License Agreement, Janssen has received a worldwide, exclusive license to the Company's ARO-HBV program, the Company's third-generation subcutaneously administered RNAi therapeutic candidate being developed as a potentially curative therapy for patients with chronic hepatitis B virus infection. Beyond the Company's ongoing Phase 1 / 2 study of ARO-HBV, Janssen will be wholly responsible for clinical development and commercialization. Under the Janssen Collaboration Agreement, Janssen will be able to select three new targets against which Arrowhead will develop clinical candidates. These candidates are subject to certain restrictions and will not include candidates in the Company's current pipeline. The Company will perform discovery, optimization and preclinical development, entirely funded by Janssen, sufficient to allow the filing of a U.S. Investigational New Drug application or equivalent, at which time Janssen will have the option to take an exclusive license. If the option is exercised, Janssen will be wholly responsible for clinical development and commercialization. Under the JJDC Stock Purchase Agreement, in October 2018 the Company sold 3,260,869 shares of common stock to JJDC at a price of $23.00 per share. Under the terms of the agreements taken together, the Company has received $175 million as an upfront payment, $75 million in the form of an equity investment by JJDC in Arrowhead common stock, and may receive up to $1.6\nbillion in development and sales milestones payments for the Janssen License Agreement, and up to $1.9 billion in development and sales milestone payments for the three additional targets covered under the Janssen Collaboration Agreement. The Company is further eligible to receive tiered royalties up to mid teens under the Janssen License Agreement and up to low teens under the Janssen Collaboration Agreement on product sales.\nThe Company's collaboration agreements with Amgen also continue to progress as it relates to the AMG 890 (ARO-LPA) and ARO-AMG1 candidates. Under the terms of the agreements taken together, the Company has received $35 million in upfront payments and $21.5 million in the form of an equity investment by Amgen in the Company's Common Stock and could receive up to $617 million in option payments and development, regulatory and sales milestone payments. The Company is further eligible to receive single-digit royalties for sales of products under the ARO-AMG1 agreement and up to low double-digit royalties for sales of products under the AMG 890 (ARO-LPA) Agreement. On August 1, 2018, the Company announced that it had earned a $10 million milestone payment from Amgen following the administration of the first dose of AMG 890 (ARO-LPA) in a phase 1 clinical study. This milestone payment was recognized as Revenue in its entirety during the year ended September 30, 2018.\nThe Company continues to develop other clinical candidates for future clinical trials. Clinical candidates are tested internally and through GLP toxicology studies at outside laboratories. Drug materials for such studies and clinical trials are contracted to third-party manufactures when cGMP production is required. The Company engages third-party contract research organizations (CROs) to manage clinical trials and works cooperatively with such organizations on all aspects of clinical trial management, including plan design, patient recruiting, and follow up. These outside costs, relating to the preparation for and administration of clinical trials, are referred to as program costs\u201d. If the clinical candidates progress through human testing, program costs will increase.\nNet losses were $54.5 million, $34.4 million and $81.7 million during the years ended September 30, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Diluted losses per share were $0.65, $0.47 and $1.34 during the years ended September 30, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. A decrease in revenue in 2018 from the collaborations with Amgen is the driver of the increases in the net losses and diluted losses per share, as discussed further below.\nThe Company strengthened its liquidity and financial position through an equity offering completed in January 2018, which generated $56.6 million of net cash proceeds for the Company, as well as the $10 million milestone payment earned from Amgen under the AMG 890 (ARO-LPA) Agreement. Additionally, with the recent agreements made with Janssen, the Company has secured an additional $250 million in cash proceeds in October 2018. These cash proceeds secure the funding needed to continue to advance our preclinical candidates. The Company had $30.1 million of cash and cash equivalents, $46.4 million in short-term investments and $111.6 million of total assets as of September 30, 2018, as compared to $24.8 million, $40.8 million and $104.0 million as of September 30, 2017, respectively. Based upon the Company's current cash and short-term investment resources and operating plan, the Company expects to have sufficient liquidity to fund operations for at least the next twelve months.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nManagement makes certain judgments and uses certain estimates and assumptions when applying GAAP in the preparation of our Consolidated Financial Statements. We evaluate our estimates and judgments on an ongoing basis and base our estimates on historical experience and on assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Our experience and assumptions form the basis for our judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may vary from what we anticipate and different assumptions or estimates about the future could change our reported results. We believe the following accounting policies are the most critical to us, in that they require our most difficult, subjective or complex judgments in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements. For further information, see Note 1, Organization and Significant Accounting Policies, to our Consolidated Financial Statements, which outlines our application of significant accounting policies.\nRevenue Recognition\nRevenue from product sales is recorded when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, title has passed, and delivery has occurred, a price is fixed and determinable, and collection is reasonably assured.\nThe Company may generate revenue from technology licenses, collaborative research and development arrangements, research grants and product sales. Revenue under technology licenses and collaborative agreements typically consists of nonrefundable and/or guaranteed technology license fees, collaborative research funding, manufacturing and development services and various milestone and future product royalty or profit-sharing payments. These agreements are generally referred to as multiple element arrangements\u201d.\nThe Company applies the accounting standard on revenue recognition for multiple element arrangements. The fair value of deliverables under the arrangement may be derived using a best estimate of selling price if vendor specific objective evidence and third-party evidence is not available. Deliverables under the arrangement will be separate units of accounting if a delivered item has value to the customer on a standalone basis and if the arrangement includes a general right of return for the delivered item, delivery or performance of the undelivered item is considered probable and substantially in the Company's control.\nThe Company recognizes upfront license payments as revenue upon delivery of the license only if the license has standalone value from any undelivered performance obligations and that value can be determined. The undelivered performance obligations typically include manufacturing or development services or research and/or steering committee services. If the fair value of the undelivered performance obligations can be determined, then these obligations would be accounted for separately. If the license is not considered to have standalone value, then the license and other undelivered performance obligations would be accounted for as a single unit of accounting. In this case, the license payments and payments for performance obligations are recognized as revenue over the estimated period of when the performance obligations are performed or deferred indefinitely until the undelivered performance obligation is determined.\nWhenever the Company determines that an arrangement should be accounted for as a single unit of accounting, the Company determines the period over which the performance obligations will be performed, and revenue will be recognized. Revenue is recognized using a proportional performance or straight-line method. The proportional performance method is used when the level of effort required to complete performance obligations under an arrangement can be reasonably estimated. The amount of revenue recognized under the proportional performance method is determined by multiplying the total payments under the contract, excluding royalties and payments contingent upon achievement of milestones, by the ratio of the level of effort performed to date to the estimated total level of effort required to complete performance obligations under the arrangement. If the Company cannot reasonably estimate the level of effort to complete performance obligations under an arrangement, the Company recognizes revenue under the arrangement on a straight-line basis over the period the Company is expected to complete its performance obligations. Significant management judgment is required in determining the level of effort required under an arrangement and the period over which the Company is expected to complete its performance obligations under an arrangement.\nThe Company's collaboration agreements typically entitle the Company to additional payments upon the achievement of development, regulatory and sales performance-based milestones. If the achievement of a milestone is considered probable at the inception of the collaboration, the related milestone payment is included with other collaboration consideration, such as upfront fees and research funding, in the Company's revenue calculation. Typically, these milestones are not considered probable at the inception of the collaboration. As such, milestones will typically be recognized in one of two ways depending on the timing of when the milestone is achieved. If the milestone is achieved during the performance period, then the Company will only recognize revenue to the extent of the proportional performance achieved at that date, or the proportion of the straight-line basis achieved at that date, and the remainder will be recorded as deferred revenue to be amortized over the remaining performance period. If the milestone is achieved after the performance period has completed and all performance obligations have been delivered, then the Company will recognize the milestone payment as Revenue in its entirety in the period the milestone was achieved.\nDeferred revenue will be classified as part of Current or Long-Term Liabilities in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets based on the Company's estimate of the portion of the performance obligations regarding that revenue will be completed within the next 12 months divided by the total performance period estimate. This estimate is based on the Company's current operating plan and, if the Company's operating plan should change in the future, the Company may recognize a different amount of deferred revenue over the next 12-month period.\nThe new revenue recognition guidance (ASC 606) was effective as of October 1, 2018, and it will not have a material impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements. Please read Note 1 to our Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data,\u201d of this annual report on Form 10-K for our discussion of recent accounting pronouncements for the expected impact of this new accounting guidance.\nImpairment of Long-lived Assets\nWe review long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in business circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of assets may not be fully recoverable or that our assumptions about the useful lives of these assets are no longer appropriate. If impairment is indicated, recoverability is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to the estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset. If the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its estimated future cash flows, an impairment charge is recognized in the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the fair value of the asset.\nImpairment of Intangible assets\nIntangible assets consist of a license agreement and patents acquired in conjunction with a business or asset acquisition. Intangible assets are monitored for potential impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable and are also reviewed annually to determine whether any impairment is necessary. Based on ASU 2012-02, the annual review of intangible assets is performed via a two-step process. First, a qualitative assessment is performed to determine if it is more likely than not that the intangible asset is impaired. If required, a quantitative assessment is performed and, if necessary, impairment is recorded.\nStock-Based Compensation\nWe account for stock-based compensation arrangements in accordance with FASB ASC 718, which requires the measurement and recognition of compensation expense for all share-based payment awards to be based on estimated fair values. The Company uses the Black-Scholes option valuation model to estimate the fair value of its stock options at the date of grant. The Black-Scholes option valuation model requires the input of subjective assumptions to calculate the value of stock options. For restricted stock units, the value of the award is based on the Company's stock price at the grant date. For performance-based restricted stock unit awards, the value of the award is based on the Company's stock price at the grant date. The Company uses historical data and other information to estimate the expected price volatility for stock option awards and the expected forfeiture rate for all awards. Expense is recognized over the vesting period for all awards and commences at the grant date for time-based awards and upon the Company's determination that the achievement of such performance conditions is probable for performance-based awards. This determination requires significant judgement by management.\nContingent Consideration\nThe consideration for our acquisitions often includes future payments that are contingent upon the occurrence of a particular event. For example, milestone payments might be based on progress of clinical development, the achievement of various regulatory approvals or future sales milestones, and royalty payments might be based on drug product sales levels. The Company records a contingent consideration obligation for such contingent payments at fair value on the acquisition date. The Company estimates the fair value of contingent consideration obligations through valuation models designed to estimate the probability of the occurrence of such contingent payments based on various assumptions and incorporating estimated success rates. Estimated payments are discounted using present value techniques to arrive at estimated fair value at the balance sheet date. Changes in the fair value of our contingent consideration obligations are recognized within our Consolidated Statements of Operations. Changes in the fair value of the contingent consideration obligations can result from changes to one or multiple inputs, including adjustments to the discount rates, changes in the amount or timing of expected expenditures associated with product development, changes in the amount or timing of cash flows from products upon commercialization, changes in the assumed achievement or timing of any development milestones, changes in the probability of certain clinical events and changes in the assumed probability associated with regulatory approval. These fair value measurements are based on significant inputs not observable in the market. Substantial judgment is employed in determining the appropriateness of these assumptions as of the acquisition date and for each subsequent period. Accordingly, changes in assumptions could have a material impact on the amount of contingent consideration expense the Company records in any given period.\nResults of Operations\nThe following data summarizes our results of operations for the following periods indicated:\nTable 129: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Year ended September 30,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 16,142,321\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 31,407,709\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 158,333\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Operating Loss\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (55,936,235\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (36,995,909\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (81,742,726\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net Loss\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (54,450,478\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (34,380,295\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (81,723,002\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Earnings (Losses) per Share (Basic and Diluted)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (0.65\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (0.47\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (1.34\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe decrease in our Revenue during the year ended September 30, 2018 was driven by the timing of the recognition of the initial $30 million payment associated with the AMG 890 (ARO-LPA) Agreement. This Revenue was recognized primarily in fiscal 2017 as performance was completed. This decrease in Revenue was also the key driver of the increase in our Operating Loss, Net Loss and Loss per Share. Research and Development expenses increased during fiscal 2018 due to the progress of ARO-AAT and ARO-HBV into phase 1 and phase 1 / 2 clinical studies.\nResults of Operations Comparison for 2018 and 2017\nRevenues\nTotal revenue was $16,142,321 for the year ended September 30, 2018 and $31,407,709 for the year ended September 30, 2017. Revenue in the current period is primarily related to the $10 million milestone payment received from Amgen in August 2018, which\nwas earned following the administration of the first dose of AMG 890 (ARO-LPA) in a phase 1 clinical study. Revenue in the previous period was primarily related to the upfront payments received from Amgen in 2016 that we recognized as Revenue as performance was completed for the AMG 890 (ARO-LPA) and ARO-AMG1 Agreements. The decrease in our Revenue during the year ended September 30, 2018 was driven by a reduction in the amount of Revenue recognized associated with the $30 million upfront payment received from Amgen associated with the AMG 890 (ARO-LPA) Agreement. We recognized Revenue from the ARO-LPA (AMG-890) Agreement on a straight-line basis as performance was completed from November 2016 thru October 2017.\nUnder the terms of the AMG 890 (ARO-LPA) Agreement, the Company has granted a worldwide, exclusive license to AMG 890 (ARO-LPA). The Company is also responsible for assisting Amgen in the oversight of certain development and manufacturing activities (the AMG 890 (ARO-LPA) R&D Services\u201d), most of which are to be covered at Amgen's cost. The Company has determined that the significant deliverables under the AMG 890 (ARO-LPA) Agreement include the license and the AMG 890 (ARO-LPA) R&D Services. The Company also determined that, pursuant to the accounting guidance governing revenue recognition on multiple element arrangements, the license and the AMG 890 (ARO-LPA) R&D Services do not have standalone value due to the specialized nature of the activities and services to be provided by the Company. Therefore, the deliverables are not separable and, accordingly, the license and the AMG 890 (ARO-LPA) R&D Services are being treated as a single unit of accounting. The Company recognized revenue on a straight-line basis from November 18, 2016 (the Hart-Scott-Rodino clearance date), through October 31, 2017, which was the date where the AMG 890 (ARO-LPA) R&D Services were substantially completed. The Company received the upfront payment of $30 million due under the AMG 890 (ARO-LPA) Agreement in November 2016. The upfront $30 million payment was initially recorded as Deferred Revenue. During the years ended September 30, 2018 and 2017, $2.7 million and $27.3 million of this upfront payment were recognized into Revenue, respectively. This upfront payment has been recognized as Revenue in its entirety as of September 30, 2018.\nOn August 1, 2018, the Company announced that it had earned a $10 million milestone payment from Amgen following the administration of the first dose of AMG 890 (ARO-LPA) in a phase 1 clinical study. The Company has recognized this payment as Revenue in its entirety during the year ended September 30, 2018 as the performance obligations had already been substantially completed.\nUnder the terms of the ARO-AMG1 Agreement, the Company has granted an option to a worldwide, exclusive license to ARO-AMG1, an undisclosed genetically validated cardiovascular target. The Company is also responsible for developing, optimizing and manufacturing the candidate through certain preclinical efficacy and toxicology studies to determine whether the candidate the Company has developed meets the required criteria as defined in the agreement (the Arrowhead Deliverable\u201d). The Company delivered the candidate in August 2018 and Amgen currently has the option to an exclusive license for the intellectual property generated through the Company's development efforts. If Amgen exercises its option, it would likely assume all development, regulatory and commercialization efforts for the candidate. The Company determined that the significant deliverables under the ARO-AMG1 Agreement include the option to license and the development and manufacturing activities toward achieving the Arrowhead Deliverable (the ARO-AMG1 R&D Services\u201d). The Company also determined that, pursuant to the accounting guidance governing revenue recognition on multiple element arrangements, the option to license and ARO-AMG1 R&D Services do not have standalone value due to the specialized nature of the activities and services to be provided by the Company. Therefore, the deliverables are not separable and, accordingly, the option to license and ARO-AMG1 R&D Services are being treated as a single unit of accounting. The Company has recognized revenue on a straight-line basis from October 1, 2016, through September 30, 2018, as the Company completed the Arrowhead Deliverable during the three months ended September 30, 2018. The Company received an upfront payment of $5 million due under this agreement in September 2016. The upfront $5 million payment was initially recorded as Deferred Revenue. During the years ended September 30, 2018 and 2017, $2.5 million and $2.5 million of this upfront payment were recognized into Revenue, respectively. This upfront payment has been recognized as Revenue in its entirety as of September 30, 2018.\nThe Company also entered into a separate services agreement and separate statements of work with Amgen to provide certain services related to process development, manufacturing, materials supply, discovery studies, and other consulting services related to AMG 890 (ARO-LPA) and ARO-AMG1. During the years ended September 30, 2018 and 2017, these work orders generated approximately $1.0 million and $1.5 million of Revenue, respectively.\nOperating Expenses\nThe analysis below details the operating expenses and discusses the expenditures of the Company within the major expense categories. Certain reclassifications have been made to prior-period operating expense categories to conform to the current period presentation. For purposes of comparison, the amounts for the years ended September 30, 2018 and 2017 are shown in the tables below.\nResearch and Development Expenses\nR&D expenses are related to the Company's research and development efforts, and related program costs which are comprised primarily of outsourced costs related to the manufacturing of clinical supplies, toxicity/efficacy studies and clinical trial expenses. Internal costs primarily relate to operations at our research facility in Madison, Wisconsin, including facility costs and laboratory-related expenses. Salaries and stock compensation expense consist of salary, bonuses, payroll taxes and related benefits and stock compensation for our R&D personnel. Depreciation and amortization expense relates to depreciation on lab equipment and leasehold improvements at our Madison research facility.

The increase in the expense is primarily due to an increase in R&D headcount that has occurred since the Company's reduction in force in late 2016 associated with the discontinuation of our previous clinical candidates.\nStock compensation expense, a non-cash expense, decreased by $444,000 from $2,840,000 during the year ended September 30, 2017 to $2,396,000 during the current period. Stock compensation expense is based upon the valuation of stock options and restricted stock units granted to employees, directors, and certain consultants. Many variables affect the amount expensed, including the Company's stock price on the date of the grant, as well as other assumptions. The decrease in the expense is primarily due to a mix of lower grant date fair values of awards amortizing during the periods due to the Company's stock price at the time of the grants.\nIn vivo studies expense increased by $192,000 from $2,513,000 during the year ended September 30, 2017 to $2,705,000 during the current period. In vivo studies expense can vary depending on the stage of preclinical candidates, the nature and amount of testing required and the cost variation of different in vivo testing models. The increase in in vivo studies expense is a result of additional discovery studies being conducted for the Company's potential drug candidates.\nDrug manufacturing expense increased by $3,107,000 from $11,229,000 during the year ended September 30, 2017 to $14,336,000 during the current period. The increase in the expense primarily relates to the timing of manufacturing campaigns for ARO-AAT, ARO-HBV, ARO-ANG3 and ARO-APOC3 clinical trials and toxicology studies. We anticipate this expense to increase as the volume of candidates in our pipeline increases and as each candidate progresses through clinical trial phases.\nToxicity/efficacy studies expense increased by $4,526,000 from $1,768,000 during the year ended September 30, 2017 to $6,294,000 during the current period. This category includes IND-enabling toxicology studies as well as post-IND toxicology studies, such as long-term toxicology studies, and other efficacy studies. The increase in the expense primarily relates to toxicology studies for ARO-AAT and ARO-HBV as each candidate progresses through clinical trials. We anticipate this expense to increase as we prepare to enter clinical trials with our other drug candidates.\nClinical trials expense decreased by $6,228,000 from $9,163,000 during the year ended September 30, 2017 to $2,935,000 during the current period. The decrease in the expense is primarily due to the discontinuation of our previous clinical candidates, and the close out of those studies. We anticipate this expense to increase as ARO-AAT progresses through clinical trials and as we prepare to enter clinical trials with our other drug candidates.\nLicense, royalty and milestones expense was relatively minor in both periods. This category includes milestone payments which can vary from period to period depending on the nature of our various license agreements, and the timing of reaching various development milestones requiring payment. No significant milestones were achieved in either period.\nFacilities expense decreased by $57,000 from $2,337,000 during the year ended September 30, 2017 to $2,280,000 during the current period. This category includes rental costs for our research and development facility in Madison, Wisconsin. The decrease in the expense relates to reduced CAM costs.\nDepreciation and amortization expense, was consistent at $4,653,000 during the year ended September 30, 2017 and $4,672,000 during the current period. The majority of depreciation and amortization expense relates to depreciation on lab equipment at our Madison research facility. In addition, the Company records depreciation on leasehold improvements at its Madison research facility.\nOther research expense decreased by $76,000 from $4,674,000 during the year ended September 30, 2017 to $4,598,000 during the current period. This category includes the following costs to support discovery efforts and the advancement of current drug candidates: in-house laboratory supplies, outsourced labs services, and other miscellaneous research and development expenses. The decrease in the expense primarily relates to a reduction in outsourced lab services as we have expanded our in-house manufacturing capabilities.\nGeneral & Administrative Expenses\nThe following table provides details of our general and administrative expenses for the periods indicated:\n(in thousands)\nTable 131: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Twelve\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Twelve\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Months Ended\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> % of Expense\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Months Ended\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> % of Expense\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Increase (Decrease)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> September 30, 2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Category\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> September 30, 2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Category\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Salaries\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 6,382\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 5,571\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Stock compensation\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 6,059\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 5,052\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,007\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Professional/outside services\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 4,331\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 4,660\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (329\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Facilities related\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (163\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Depreciation/amortization\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (11\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other G&A\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,584\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,288\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 19,110\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 17,499\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,611\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nSalaries expense increased by $811,000 from $5,571,000 during the year ended September 30, 2017 to $6,382,000 during the current period. The increase in the expense is primarily driven by annual merit increases, performance bonuses and increased headcount.\nStock compensation expense increased by $1,007,000 from $5,052,000 during the year ended September 30, 2017 to $6,059,000 during the current period. Stock compensation expense is based upon the valuation of stock options and restricted stock units granted to employees, directors, and certain consultants. Many variables affect the amount expensed, including the Company's stock price on the date of the grant, as well as other assumptions. The increase in the expense is primarily due to the achievement of certain performance-based awards during the current period.\nProfessional/outside services include legal, accounting, consulting, patent expenses, business insurance expenses and other outside services retained by the Company. Professional/outside services expense decreased by $329,000 from $4,660,000 during the year ended September 30, 2017 to $4,331,000 during the current period. The decrease in the expense is primarily related to reduced legal expenses on our outstanding litigation cases.\nFacilities-related expense decreased $163,000 from $890,000 during the year ended September 30, 2017 to $727,000 during the current period. This category primarily includes rental costs for our corporate headquarters in Pasadena, California. However, the decrease in the expense is primarily related to moving expenses incurred in the previous period associated with our research facility in Madison, Wisconsin.\nDepreciation and amortization expense, a noncash expense, was relatively minor in each of the periods. The majority of general and administrative depreciation and amortization expense relates to depreciation on leasehold improvements at our Pasadena headquarters.\nOther G&A expense increased by $296,000 from $1,288,000 during the year ended September 30, 2017 to $1,584,000 during the current period. This category consists primarily of travel, communication and technology, office expenses, and franchise and property tax expenses. The increase in the expense was due to various travel and communication and technology expenses.\nOther Income / Expense\nOther income / expense was income of $2,618,014 during the year ended September 30, 2017 as compared to income of $1,488,157 during the current period. The largest component of other income / expense in the current period was interest income of $1.0 million earned on the Company's short-term investments. The largest component of other income / expense in the previous period was $1.3 million in other income due to an insurance settlement related to one of the Company's recent litigation cases. The settlement amount was received in fiscal 2017. The other significant component of other income / expense is related to the change in the value of derivative liabilities related to certain warrants with a price adjustment feature, which requires derivative accounting. The change in value of derivative liabilities was an income of approximately $0.9 million in 2017 and an income of approximately $0.4 million in the current period. The fluctuations in each period were primarily driven by changes in the Company's stock price, which had a corresponding impact on the valuation of the underlying warrant liability.\nResults of Operations Comparison for 2017 and 2016\nRevenues\nTotal revenue was $31,407,709 for the year ended September 30, 2017 and $158,333 for the year ended September 30, 2016. Revenue during the year ended September 30, 2017 is primarily related to the upfront payments received from Amgen that we are recognizing as performance is completed for the AMG 890 (ARO-LPA) and ARO-AMG1 agreements\nUnder the terms of the AMG 890 (ARO-LPA) Agreement, the Company has granted a worldwide, exclusive license to AMG 890 (ARO-LPA). The Company is also responsible for assisting Amgen in the oversight of certain development and manufacturing activities (the AMG 890 (ARO-LPA) R&D Services\u201d), most of which are to be covered at Amgen's cost. The Company has determined that the significant deliverables under the AMG 890 (ARO-LPA) Agreement include the license and the AMG 890 (ARO-LPA) R&D Services. The Company also determined that, pursuant to the accounting guidance governing revenue recognition on multiple element arrangements, the license and the AMG 890 (ARO-LPA) R&D Services do not have standalone value due to the specialized nature of the activities and services to be provided by the Company. Therefore, the deliverables are not separable and, accordingly, the license and the AMG 890 (ARO-LPA) R&D Services are being treated as a single unit of accounting. The Company recognized revenue on a straight-line basis from November 18, 2016 (the Hart-Scott-Rodino clearance date), through October 31, 2017, which was the date where the AMG 890 (ARO-LPA) R&D Services were substantially completed. The Company received the upfront payment of $30 million due under this agreement in November 2016. The initial $30 million payment was recorded as Deferred Revenue, and $27.3 million of this was amortized into Revenue during the year ended September 30, 2017.\nUnder the terms of the ARO-AMG1 Agreement, the Company has granted an option to a worldwide, exclusive license to ARO-AMG1, an undisclosed genetically validated cardiovascular target. The Company is also responsible for developing, optimizing and manufacturing the candidate through certain preclinical efficacy and toxicology studies to determine whether the candidate the Company has developed meets the required criteria as defined in the agreement (the Arrowhead Deliverable\u201d). The Company delivered the candidate in August 2018 and Amgen currently has the option to an exclusive license for the intellectual property generated through the Company's development efforts. If Amgen exercises its option, it would likely assume all development, regulatory and commercialization efforts for the candidate. The Company determined that the significant deliverables under the ARO-AMG1 Agreement include the option to license and the development and manufacturing activities toward achieving the Arrowhead Deliverable (the ARO-AMG1 R&D Services\u201d). The Company also determined that, pursuant to the accounting guidance governing revenue recognition on multiple element arrangements, the option to license and ARO-AMG1 R&D Services do not have standalone value due to the specialized nature of the activities and services to be provided by the Company. Therefore, the deliverables are not separable and, accordingly, the option to license and ARO-AMG1 R&D Services are being treated as a single unit of accounting. The Company has recognized revenue on a straight-line basis from October 1, 2016, through September 30, 2018, as the Company completed the Arrowhead Deliverable during the three months ended September 30, 2018. The Company received an upfront payment of $5 million due under this agreement in September 2016. The upfront $5 million payment was initially recorded as Deferred Revenue. The initial $5 million payment was recorded as Deferred Revenue, and $2.5 million of this was amortized into Revenue during the year ended September 30, 2017.\nIn January 2017, the Company also entered into a separate services agreement with Amgen to provide certain services related to process development, manufacturing, materials supply, discovery studies, and other consulting services related to AMG 890 (ARO-LPA). During the year ended September 30, 2017, work orders under this services agreement generated approximately $1.5 million of Revenue.\nOperating Expenses\nThe analysis below details the operating expenses and discusses the expenditures of the Company within the major expense categories. Certain reclassifications have been made to prior-period operating expense categories to conform to the current period presentation. For purposes of comparison, the amounts for the years ended September 30, 2017 and 2016 are shown in the tables below.\nResearch and Development Expenses\nR&D expenses are related to the Company's on-going research and development efforts, primarily related to program costs, composed primarily of outsourced costs related to the manufacturing of clinical supplies, toxicity/efficacy studies and clinical trial expenses. Internal costs primarily relate to operations at our research and development facility in Madison, Wisconsin, including facility costs and laboratory-related expenses.

The decrease in the expense is primarily due to a reduction in force in late 2016 associated with the discontinuation of our previous clinical candidates.\nStock compensation expense, a non-cash expense, decreased by $708,000 from $3,548,000 during the year ended September 30, 2016 to $2,840,000 during the year ended September 30, 2017. Stock compensation expense is based upon the valuation of stock options and restricted stock units granted to employees, directors, and certain consultants. Many variables affect the amount expensed, including the Company's stock price on the date of the grant, as well as other assumptions. The decrease in the expense is primarily due to a mix of lower grant date fair values of awards amortizing during the periods due to the Company's stock price at the time of the grants.\nIn vivo studies expense increased $882,000 from $1,631,000 during the year ended September 30, 2016 to $2,513,000 during the year ended September 30, 2017.

Stock compensation expense is based upon the valuation of stock options and restricted stock units granted to employees, directors, and certain consultants. Many variables affect the amount expensed, including the Company's stock price on the date of the grant, as well as other assumptions. The decrease in the expense is primarily due to a mix of lower grant date fair values of awards amortizing during the periods due to the Company's stock price at the time of the grants.\nProfessional/outside services include legal, accounting, consulting, patent expenses, business insurance expenses and other outside services retained by the Company Professional/outside services expense decreased $1,702,000 from $6,362,000 during the year ended September 30, 2016 to $4,660,000 during the year ended September 30, 2017. The decrease in professional fees primarily related to legal fees related to previous litigation events.\nFacilities-related expense increased $268,000 from $622,000 during the year ended September 30, 2016 to $890,000 in the year ended September 30, 2017. This category primarily includes rental costs for our corporate headquarters in Pasadena, California. However, the increase in the expense is primarily related to moving expenses incurred in the previous period associated with our research facility in Madison, Wisconsin.\nDepreciation and amortization expense, a noncash expense, was relatively minor in each of the periods. The majority of general and administrative depreciation and amortization expense relates to depreciation on leasehold improvements at our Pasadena headquarters.\nOther expense decreased $1,668,000 from $2,956,000 during the year ended September 30, 2016 to $1,288,000 during the year ended September 30, 2017. This category consists primarily of conference attendance fees, franchise and property tax expenses and marketing expenses. The decrease in other expense relates to litigation in the fiscal 2016 period that was settled.\nOther Income / Expense\nOther income / expense was income of $22,124 during the year ended September 30, 2016 as compared to income of $2,618,014 during the year ended September 30, 2017. The largest component of other income / expense in the year ended September 30, 2017 was $1.3 million in other income due to an insurance settlement related to one of the Company's recent litigation cases. The settlement amount was received in fiscal 2017. The other significant component of other income / expense is related to the change in the value of derivative liabilities related to certain warrants with a price adjustment feature, which requires derivative accounting. The change in value of derivative liabilities was an expense of approximately $0.3 million in 2016 and an income of approximately $0.9 million in the year ended September 30, 2017. The fluctuations in each period were primarily driven by changes in the Company's stock price, which had a corresponding impact on the valuation of the underlying warrant liability\nLiquidity and Cash Resources\nArrowhead has historically financed its operations through the sale of its equity securities. Research and development activities have required significant capital investment since the Company's inception and are expected to continue to require significant cash expenditure in the future.\nAt September 30, 2018, the Company had cash on hand of approximately $30.1 million as compared to $24.8 million at September 30, 2017. Excess cash invested in fixed income securities was $46.4 million at September 30, 2018, compared to $40.8 million at September 30, 2017. The Company believes its current financial resources are sufficient to fund its operations through at least the next twelve months.\nA summary of cash flows for the years ended September 30, 2018, 2017, and 2016 is as follows:\nTable 134: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Year ended September 30,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Cash Flow from:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Operating Activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (47,223,417\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (23,938,972\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (64,427,486\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Investing Activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (7,434,963\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (48,644,218\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 13,447,763\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Financing Activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 59,953,026\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 12,055,309\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 55,131,817\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net increase (decrease) in cash\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 5,294,646\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (60,527,881\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 4,152,094\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Cash at beginning of period\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 24,838,567\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 85,366,448\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 81,214,354\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Cash at end of period\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 30,133,213\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 24,838,567\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 85,366,448\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nDuring the year ended September 30, 2018, the Company used $47.2 million in cash from operating activities, which was primarily related to $57.2 million used for the on-going expenses of its research and development programs and general and administrative expenses, offset by the $10 million milestone payment for the AMG 890 (ARO-LPA) Agreement with Amgen.

Using a broad portfolio of RNA chemistries and efficient modes of delivery, Arrowhead therapies trigger the RNA interference mechanism to induce rapid, deep and durable knockdown of target genes. RNA interference, or RNAi, is a mechanism present in living cells that inhibits the expression of a specific gene, thereby affecting the production of a specific protein. Deemed to be one of the most important recent discoveries in life science with the potential to transform medicine, the discoverers of RNAi were awarded a Nobel Prize in 2006 for their work. Arrowhead's RNAi-based therapeutics leverage this natural pathway of gene silencing. The company's pipeline includes ARO-AAT for liver disease associated with alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency (AATD), ARO-APOC3 for hypertriglyceridemia, ARO-ANG3 for dyslipidemia, ARO-ENaC for cystic fibrosis, and ARO-HIF2 for renal cell carcinoma. ARO-LPA (AMG 890) for cardiovascular disease was out-licensed to Amgen Inc. in 2016. ARO-AMG1 for an undisclosed genetically validated cardiovascular target is under a license and collaboration agreement with Amgen Inc. ARO-HBV for chronic hepatitis B virus was out-licensed to Janssen Pharmaceuticals, Inc. in October 2018.\nArrowhead operates a lab facility in Madison, Wisconsin, where the Company's research and development activities, including the development of RNAi therapeutics, are based. The Company's principal executive offices are located in Pasadena, California.\nArrowhead has refocused its resources on therapeutics that exclusively utilize the company's Targeted RNAi Molecule (TRiMTM) platform technology. Therapeutics built on the TRiMTM platform have demonstrated high levels of pharmacologic activity in multiple animal models spanning several therapeutic areas. TRiMTM enabled therapeutics offer several potential advantages over prior generation and competing technologies, including: simplified manufacturing and reduced costs; multiple routes of administration including subcutaneous injection and inhaled administration; the ability to target multiple tissue types including liver, lung, and tumors; and the potential for improved safety and reduced risk of intracellular buildup, because there are less metabolites from smaller, simpler molecules.\nDuring fiscal 2018, the Company achieved substantial progress on its pipeline candidates. In the first half of fiscal 2018, Clinical Trial Applications (CTAs) were filed for ARO-AAT and ARO-HBV, and the associated phase 1 (ARO-AAT) and phase 1 / 2 (ARO-HBV) studies are ongoing. Dosing has completed for the ARO-AAT phase 1 clinical study. In October 2018, the Company also filed a CTA for ARO-ANG3 and, pending approval, the Company anticipates the startup of this study in 2019. The Company has also achieved substantial progress on its other preclinical candidates including ARO-APOC3, ARO-ENaC and ARO-HIF2, with planned CTA or equivalent filings planned in late calendar 2018 for ARO-APOC3 and in 2019 for ARO-ENaC and ARO-HIF2.\nThe Company also made significant progress on its business development and partnership collaboration efforts. In October 2018, the Company entered into a License Agreement ( Janssen License Agreement\u201d) and a Research Collaboration and Option Agreement ( Janssen Collaboration Agreement\u201d) with Janssen Pharmaceuticals, Inc. ( Janssen\u201d) part of the Janssen Pharmaceutical Companies of Johnson & Johnson. The Company also entered into a Stock Purchase Agreement ( JJDC Stock Purchase Agreement\u201d) with Johnson & Johnson Innovation-JJDC, Inc. ( JJDC\u201d), a New Jersey corporation. Under the Janssen License Agreement, Janssen has received a worldwide, exclusive license to the Company's ARO-HBV program, the Company's third-generation subcutaneously administered RNAi therapeutic candidate being developed as a potentially curative therapy for patients with chronic hepatitis B virus infection. Beyond the Company's ongoing Phase 1 / 2 study of ARO-HBV, Janssen will be wholly responsible for clinical development and commercialization. Under the Janssen Collaboration Agreement, Janssen will be able to select three new targets against which Arrowhead will develop clinical candidates. These candidates are subject to certain restrictions and will not include candidates in the Company's current pipeline. The Company will perform discovery, optimization and preclinical development, entirely funded by Janssen, sufficient to allow the filing of a U.S. Investigational New Drug application or equivalent, at which time Janssen will have the option to take an exclusive license. If the option is exercised, Janssen will be wholly responsible for clinical development and commercialization. Under the JJDC Stock Purchase Agreement, in October 2018 the Company sold 3,260,869 shares of common stock to JJDC at a price of $23.00 per share. Under the terms of the agreements taken together, the Company has received $175 million as an upfront payment, $75 million in the form of an equity investment by JJDC in Arrowhead common stock, and may receive up to $1.6\nbillion in development and sales milestones payments for the Janssen License Agreement, and up to $1.9 billion in development and sales milestone payments for the three additional targets covered under the Janssen Collaboration Agreement. The Company is further eligible to receive tiered royalties up to mid teens under the Janssen License Agreement and up to low teens under the Janssen Collaboration Agreement on product sales.\nThe Company's collaboration agreements with Amgen also continue to progress as it relates to the AMG 890 (ARO-LPA) and ARO-AMG1 candidates. Under the terms of the agreements taken together, the Company has received $35 million in upfront payments and $21.5 million in the form of an equity investment by Amgen in the Company's Common Stock and could receive up to $617 million in option payments and development, regulatory and sales milestone payments. The Company is further eligible to receive single-digit royalties for sales of products under the ARO-AMG1 agreement and up to low double-digit royalties for sales of products under the AMG 890 (ARO-LPA) Agreement. On August 1, 2018, the Company announced that it had earned a $10 million milestone payment from Amgen following the administration of the first dose of AMG 890 (ARO-LPA) in a phase 1 clinical study. This milestone payment was recognized as Revenue in its entirety during the year ended September 30, 2018.\nThe Company continues to develop other clinical candidates for future clinical trials. Clinical candidates are tested internally and through GLP toxicology studies at outside laboratories. Drug materials for such studies and clinical trials are contracted to third-party manufactures when cGMP production is required. The Company engages third-party contract research organizations (CROs) to manage clinical trials and works cooperatively with such organizations on all aspects of clinical trial management, including plan design, patient recruiting, and follow up. These outside costs, relating to the preparation for and administration of clinical trials, are referred to as program costs\u201d. If the clinical candidates progress through human testing, program costs will increase.\nNet losses were $54.5 million, $34.4 million and $81.7 million during the years ended September 30, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Diluted losses per share were $0.65, $0.47 and $1.34 during the years ended September 30, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. A decrease in revenue in 2018 from the collaborations with Amgen is the driver of the increases in the net losses and diluted losses per share, as discussed further below.\nThe Company strengthened its liquidity and financial position through an equity offering completed in January 2018, which generated $56.6 million of net cash proceeds for the Company, as well as the $10 million milestone payment earned from Amgen under the AMG 890 (ARO-LPA) Agreement. Additionally, with the recent agreements made with Janssen, the Company has secured an additional $250 million in cash proceeds in October 2018. These cash proceeds secure the funding needed to continue to advance our preclinical candidates. The Company had $30.1 million of cash and cash equivalents, $46.4 million in short-term investments and $111.6 million of total assets as of September 30, 2018, as compared to $24.8 million, $40.8 million and $104.0 million as of September 30, 2017, respectively. Based upon the Company's current cash and short-term investment resources and operating plan, the Company expects to have sufficient liquidity to fund operations for at least the next twelve months.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nManagement makes certain judgments and uses certain estimates and assumptions when applying GAAP in the preparation of our Consolidated Financial Statements. We evaluate our estimates and judgments on an ongoing basis and base our estimates on historical experience and on assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Our experience and assumptions form the basis for our judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may vary from what we anticipate and different assumptions or estimates about the future could change our reported results. We believe the following accounting policies are the most critical to us, in that they require our most difficult, subjective or complex judgments in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements. For further information, see Note 1, Organization and Significant Accounting Policies, to our Consolidated Financial Statements, which outlines our application of significant accounting policies.\nRevenue Recognition\nRevenue from product sales is recorded when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, title has passed, and delivery has occurred, a price is fixed and determinable, and collection is reasonably assured.\nThe Company may generate revenue from technology licenses, collaborative research and development arrangements, research grants and product sales. Revenue under technology licenses and collaborative agreements typically consists of nonrefundable and/or guaranteed technology license fees, collaborative research funding, manufacturing and development services and various milestone and future product royalty or profit-sharing payments. These agreements are generally referred to as multiple element arrangements\u201d.\nThe Company applies the accounting standard on revenue recognition for multiple element arrangements. The fair value of deliverables under the arrangement may be derived using a best estimate of selling price if vendor specific objective evidence and third-party evidence is not available. Deliverables under the arrangement will be separate units of accounting if a delivered item has value to the customer on a standalone basis and if the arrangement includes a general right of return for the delivered item, delivery or performance of the undelivered item is considered probable and substantially in the Company's control.\nThe Company recognizes upfront license payments as revenue upon delivery of the license only if the license has standalone value from any undelivered performance obligations and that value can be determined. The undelivered performance obligations typically include manufacturing or development services or research and/or steering committee services. If the fair value of the undelivered performance obligations can be determined, then these obligations would be accounted for separately. If the license is not considered to have standalone value, then the license and other undelivered performance obligations would be accounted for as a single unit of accounting. In this case, the license payments and payments for performance obligations are recognized as revenue over the estimated period of when the performance obligations are performed or deferred indefinitely until the undelivered performance obligation is determined.\nWhenever the Company determines that an arrangement should be accounted for as a single unit of accounting, the Company determines the period over which the performance obligations will be performed, and revenue will be recognized. Revenue is recognized using a proportional performance or straight-line method. The proportional performance method is used when the level of effort required to complete performance obligations under an arrangement can be reasonably estimated. The amount of revenue recognized under the proportional performance method is determined by multiplying the total payments under the contract, excluding royalties and payments contingent upon achievement of milestones, by the ratio of the level of effort performed to date to the estimated total level of effort required to complete performance obligations under the arrangement. If the Company cannot reasonably estimate the level of effort to complete performance obligations under an arrangement, the Company recognizes revenue under the arrangement on a straight-line basis over the period the Company is expected to complete its performance obligations. Significant management judgment is required in determining the level of effort required under an arrangement and the period over which the Company is expected to complete its performance obligations under an arrangement.\nThe Company's collaboration agreements typically entitle the Company to additional payments upon the achievement of development, regulatory and sales performance-based milestones. If the achievement of a milestone is considered probable at the inception of the collaboration, the related milestone payment is included with other collaboration consideration, such as upfront fees and research funding, in the Company's revenue calculation. Typically, these milestones are not considered probable at the inception of the collaboration. As such, milestones will typically be recognized in one of two ways depending on the timing of when the milestone is achieved. If the milestone is achieved during the performance period, then the Company will only recognize revenue to the extent of the proportional performance achieved at that date, or the proportion of the straight-line basis achieved at that date, and the remainder will be recorded as deferred revenue to be amortized over the remaining performance period. If the milestone is achieved after the performance period has completed and all performance obligations have been delivered, then the Company will recognize the milestone payment as Revenue in its entirety in the period the milestone was achieved.\nDeferred revenue will be classified as part of Current or Long-Term Liabilities in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets based on the Company's estimate of the portion of the performance obligations regarding that revenue will be completed within the next 12 months divided by the total performance period estimate. This estimate is based on the Company's current operating plan and, if the Company's operating plan should change in the future, the Company may recognize a different amount of deferred revenue over the next 12-month period.\nThe new revenue recognition guidance (ASC 606) was effective as of October 1, 2018, and it will not have a material impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements. Please read Note 1 to our Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data,\u201d of this annual report on Form 10-K for our discussion of recent accounting pronouncements for the expected impact of this new accounting guidance.\nImpairment of Long-lived Assets\nWe review long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in business circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of assets may not be fully recoverable or that our assumptions about the useful lives of these assets are no longer appropriate. If impairment is indicated, recoverability is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to the estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset. If the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its estimated future cash flows, an impairment charge is recognized in the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the fair value of the asset.\nImpairment of Intangible assets\nIntangible assets consist of a license agreement and patents acquired in conjunction with a business or asset acquisition. Intangible assets are monitored for potential impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable and are also reviewed annually to determine whether any impairment is necessary. Based on ASU 2012-02, the annual review of intangible assets is performed via a two-step process. First, a qualitative assessment is performed to determine if it is more likely than not that the intangible asset is impaired. If required, a quantitative assessment is performed and, if necessary, impairment is recorded.\nStock-Based Compensation\nWe account for stock-based compensation arrangements in accordance with FASB ASC 718, which requires the measurement and recognition of compensation expense for all share-based payment awards to be based on estimated fair values. The Company uses the Black-Scholes option valuation model to estimate the fair value of its stock options at the date of grant. The Black-Scholes option valuation model requires the input of subjective assumptions to calculate the value of stock options. For restricted stock units, the value of the award is based on the Company's stock price at the grant date. For performance-based restricted stock unit awards, the value of the award is based on the Company's stock price at the grant date. The Company uses historical data and other information to estimate the expected price volatility for stock option awards and the expected forfeiture rate for all awards. Expense is recognized over the vesting period for all awards and commences at the grant date for time-based awards and upon the Company's determination that the achievement of such performance conditions is probable for performance-based awards. This determination requires significant judgement by management.\nContingent Consideration\nThe consideration for our acquisitions often includes future payments that are contingent upon the occurrence of a particular event. For example, milestone payments might be based on progress of clinical development, the achievement of various regulatory approvals or future sales milestones, and royalty payments might be based on drug product sales levels. The Company records a contingent consideration obligation for such contingent payments at fair value on the acquisition date. The Company estimates the fair value of contingent consideration obligations through valuation models designed to estimate the probability of the occurrence of such contingent payments based on various assumptions and incorporating estimated success rates. Estimated payments are discounted using present value techniques to arrive at estimated fair value at the balance sheet date. Changes in the fair value of our contingent consideration obligations are recognized within our Consolidated Statements of Operations. Changes in the fair value of the contingent consideration obligations can result from changes to one or multiple inputs, including adjustments to the discount rates, changes in the amount or timing of expected expenditures associated with product development, changes in the amount or timing of cash flows from products upon commercialization, changes in the assumed achievement or timing of any development milestones, changes in the probability of certain clinical events and changes in the assumed probability associated with regulatory approval. These fair value measurements are based on significant inputs not observable in the market. Substantial judgment is employed in determining the appropriateness of these assumptions as of the acquisition date and for each subsequent period. Accordingly, changes in assumptions could have a material impact on the amount of contingent consideration expense the Company records in any given period.\nResults of Operations\nThe following data summarizes our results of operations for the following periods indicated:\nTable 129: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Year ended September 30,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 16,142,321\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 31,407,709\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 158,333\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Operating Loss\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (55,936,235\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (36,995,909\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (81,742,726\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net Loss\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (54,450,478\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (34,380,295\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (81,723,002\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Earnings (Losses) per Share (Basic and Diluted)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (0.65\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (0.47\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (1.34\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe decrease in our Revenue during the year ended September 30, 2018 was driven by the timing of the recognition of the initial $30 million payment associated with the AMG 890 (ARO-LPA) Agreement. This Revenue was recognized primarily in fiscal 2017 as performance was completed. This decrease in Revenue was also the key driver of the increase in our Operating Loss, Net Loss and Loss per Share. Research and Development expenses increased during fiscal 2018 due to the progress of ARO-AAT and ARO-HBV into phase 1 and phase 1 / 2 clinical studies.\nResults of Operations Comparison for 2018 and 2017\nRevenues\nTotal revenue was $16,142,321 for the year ended September 30, 2018 and $31,407,709 for the year ended September 30, 2017. Revenue in the current period is primarily related to the $10 million milestone payment received from Amgen in August 2018, which\nwas earned following the administration of the first dose of AMG 890 (ARO-LPA) in a phase 1 clinical study. Revenue in the previous period was primarily related to the upfront payments received from Amgen in 2016 that we recognized as Revenue as performance was completed for the AMG 890 (ARO-LPA) and ARO-AMG1 Agreements. The decrease in our Revenue during the year ended September 30, 2018 was driven by a reduction in the amount of Revenue recognized associated with the $30 million upfront payment received from Amgen associated with the AMG 890 (ARO-LPA) Agreement. We recognized Revenue from the ARO-LPA (AMG-890) Agreement on a straight-line basis as performance was completed from November 2016 thru October 2017.\nUnder the terms of the AMG 890 (ARO-LPA) Agreement, the Company has granted a worldwide, exclusive license to AMG 890 (ARO-LPA). The Company is also responsible for assisting Amgen in the oversight of certain development and manufacturing activities (the AMG 890 (ARO-LPA) R&D Services\u201d), most of which are to be covered at Amgen's cost. The Company has determined that the significant deliverables under the AMG 890 (ARO-LPA) Agreement include the license and the AMG 890 (ARO-LPA) R&D Services. The Company also determined that, pursuant to the accounting guidance governing revenue recognition on multiple element arrangements, the license and the AMG 890 (ARO-LPA) R&D Services do not have standalone value due to the specialized nature of the activities and services to be provided by the Company. Therefore, the deliverables are not separable and, accordingly, the license and the AMG 890 (ARO-LPA) R&D Services are being treated as a single unit of accounting. The Company recognized revenue on a straight-line basis from November 18, 2016 (the Hart-Scott-Rodino clearance date), through October 31, 2017, which was the date where the AMG 890 (ARO-LPA) R&D Services were substantially completed. The Company received the upfront payment of $30 million due under the AMG 890 (ARO-LPA) Agreement in November 2016. The upfront $30 million payment was initially recorded as Deferred Revenue. During the years ended September 30, 2018 and 2017, $2.7 million and $27.3 million of this upfront payment were recognized into Revenue, respectively. This upfront payment has been recognized as Revenue in its entirety as of September 30, 2018.\nOn August 1, 2018, the Company announced that it had earned a $10 million milestone payment from Amgen following the administration of the first dose of AMG 890 (ARO-LPA) in a phase 1 clinical study. The Company has recognized this payment as Revenue in its entirety during the year ended September 30, 2018 as the performance obligations had already been substantially completed.\nUnder the terms of the ARO-AMG1 Agreement, the Company has granted an option to a worldwide, exclusive license to ARO-AMG1, an undisclosed genetically validated cardiovascular target. The Company is also responsible for developing, optimizing and manufacturing the candidate through certain preclinical efficacy and toxicology studies to determine whether the candidate the Company has developed meets the required criteria as defined in the agreement (the Arrowhead Deliverable\u201d). The Company delivered the candidate in August 2018 and Amgen currently has the option to an exclusive license for the intellectual property generated through the Company's development efforts. If Amgen exercises its option, it would likely assume all development, regulatory and commercialization efforts for the candidate. The Company determined that the significant deliverables under the ARO-AMG1 Agreement include the option to license and the development and manufacturing activities toward achieving the Arrowhead Deliverable (the ARO-AMG1 R&D Services\u201d). The Company also determined that, pursuant to the accounting guidance governing revenue recognition on multiple element arrangements, the option to license and ARO-AMG1 R&D Services do not have standalone value due to the specialized nature of the activities and services to be provided by the Company. Therefore, the deliverables are not separable and, accordingly, the option to license and ARO-AMG1 R&D Services are being treated as a single unit of accounting. The Company has recognized revenue on a straight-line basis from October 1, 2016, through September 30, 2018, as the Company completed the Arrowhead Deliverable during the three months ended September 30, 2018. The Company received an upfront payment of $5 million due under this agreement in September 2016. The upfront $5 million payment was initially recorded as Deferred Revenue. During the years ended September 30, 2018 and 2017, $2.5 million and $2.5 million of this upfront payment were recognized into Revenue, respectively. This upfront payment has been recognized as Revenue in its entirety as of September 30, 2018.\nThe Company also entered into a separate services agreement and separate statements of work with Amgen to provide certain services related to process development, manufacturing, materials supply, discovery studies, and other consulting services related to AMG 890 (ARO-LPA) and ARO-AMG1. During the years ended September 30, 2018 and 2017, these work orders generated approximately $1.0 million and $1.5 million of Revenue, respectively.\nOperating Expenses\nThe analysis below details the operating expenses and discusses the expenditures of the Company within the major expense categories. Certain reclassifications have been made to prior-period operating expense categories to conform to the current period presentation. For purposes of comparison, the amounts for the years ended September 30, 2018 and 2017 are shown in the tables below.\nResearch and Development Expenses\nR&D expenses are related to the Company's research and development efforts, and related program costs which are comprised primarily of outsourced costs related to the manufacturing of clinical supplies, toxicity/efficacy studies and clinical trial expenses. Internal costs primarily relate to operations at our research facility in Madison, Wisconsin, including facility costs and laboratory-related expenses. Salaries and stock compensation expense consist of salary, bonuses, payroll taxes and related benefits and stock compensation for our R&D personnel. Depreciation and amortization expense relates to depreciation on lab equipment and leasehold improvements at our Madison research facility. The following table provides details of research and development expense for the periods indicated:\n(in thousands)\nTable 130: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Twelve\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Twelve\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Months Ended\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> % of Expense\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Months Ended\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> % of Expense\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Increase (Decrease)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> September 30, 2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Category\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> September 30, 2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Category\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Salaries\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 12,721\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 11,722\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Stock compensation\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,396\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,840\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (444\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> In Vivo studies\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,705\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,513\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Drug manufacturing\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 14,336\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 11,229\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3,107\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Toxicity/efficacy studies\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 6,294\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,768\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 4,526\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Clinical trials\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,935\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 9,163\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (6,228\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> License, royalty & milestones\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> N/A\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Facilities and related\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,280\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,337\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (57\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Depreciation/amortization\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 4,672\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 4,653\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other R&D\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 4,598\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 4,674\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (76\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 52,969\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 50,904\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 2,065\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nSalaries expense increased by $999,000 from $11,722,000 during the year ended September 30, 2017 to $12,721,000 during the current period. The increase in the expense is primarily due to an increase in R&D headcount that has occurred since the Company's reduction in force in late 2016 associated with the discontinuation of our previous clinical candidates.\nStock compensation expense, a non-cash expense, decreased by $444,000 from $2,840,000 during the year ended September 30, 2017 to $2,396,000 during the current period. Stock compensation expense is based upon the valuation of stock options and restricted stock units granted to employees, directors, and certain consultants. Many variables affect the amount expensed, including the Company's stock price on the date of the grant, as well as other assumptions. The decrease in the expense is primarily due to a mix of lower grant date fair values of awards amortizing during the periods due to the Company's stock price at the time of the grants.\nIn vivo studies expense increased by $192,000 from $2,513,000 during the year ended September 30, 2017 to $2,705,000 during the current period. In vivo studies expense can vary depending on the stage of preclinical candidates, the nature and amount of testing required and the cost variation of different in vivo testing models. The increase in in vivo studies expense is a result of additional discovery studies being conducted for the Company's potential drug candidates.\nDrug manufacturing expense increased by $3,107,000 from $11,229,000 during the year ended September 30, 2017 to $14,336,000 during the current period. The increase in the expense primarily relates to the timing of manufacturing campaigns for ARO-AAT, ARO-HBV, ARO-ANG3 and ARO-APOC3 clinical trials and toxicology studies. We anticipate this expense to increase as the volume of candidates in our pipeline increases and as each candidate progresses through clinical trial phases.\nToxicity/efficacy studies expense increased by $4,526,000 from $1,768,000 during the year ended September 30, 2017 to $6,294,000 during the current period. This category includes IND-enabling toxicology studies as well as post-IND toxicology studies, such as long-term toxicology studies, and other efficacy studies. The increase in the expense primarily relates to toxicology studies for ARO-AAT and ARO-HBV as each candidate progresses through clinical trials. We anticipate this expense to increase as we prepare to enter clinical trials with our other drug candidates.\nClinical trials expense decreased by $6,228,000 from $9,163,000 during the year ended September 30, 2017 to $2,935,000 during the current period. The decrease in the expense is primarily due to the discontinuation of our previous clinical candidates, and the close out of those studies. We anticipate this expense to increase as ARO-AAT progresses through clinical trials and as we prepare to enter clinical trials with our other drug candidates.\nLicense, royalty and milestones expense was relatively minor in both periods. This category includes milestone payments which can vary from period to period depending on the nature of our various license agreements, and the timing of reaching various development milestones requiring payment. No significant milestones were achieved in either period.\nFacilities expense decreased by $57,000 from $2,337,000 during the year ended September 30, 2017 to $2,280,000 during the current period. This category includes rental costs for our research and development facility in Madison, Wisconsin. The decrease in the expense relates to reduced CAM costs.\nDepreciation and amortization expense, was consistent at $4,653,000 during the year ended September 30, 2017 and $4,672,000 during the current period. The majority of depreciation and amortization expense relates to depreciation on lab equipment at our Madison research facility. In addition, the Company records depreciation on leasehold improvements at its Madison research facility.\nOther research expense decreased by $76,000 from $4,674,000 during the year ended September 30, 2017 to $4,598,000 during the current period. This category includes the following costs to support discovery efforts and the advancement of current drug candidates: in-house laboratory supplies, outsourced labs services, and other miscellaneous research and development expenses. The decrease in the expense primarily relates to a reduction in outsourced lab services as we have expanded our in-house manufacturing capabilities.\nGeneral & Administrative Expenses\nThe following table provides details of our general and administrative expenses for the periods indicated:\n(in thousands)\nTable 131: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Twelve\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Twelve\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Months Ended\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> % of Expense\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Months Ended\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> % of Expense\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Increase (Decrease)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> September 30, 2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Category\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> September 30, 2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Category\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Salaries\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 6,382\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 5,571\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Stock compensation\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 6,059\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 5,052\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,007\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Professional/outside services\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 4,331\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 4,660\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (329\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Facilities related\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (163\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Depreciation/amortization\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (11\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other G&A\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,584\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,288\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 19,110\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 17,499\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,611\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nSalaries expense increased by $811,000 from $5,571,000 during the year ended September 30, 2017 to $6,382,000 during the current period. The increase in the expense is primarily driven by annual merit increases, performance bonuses and increased headcount.\nStock compensation expense increased by $1,007,000 from $5,052,000 during the year ended September 30, 2017 to $6,059,000 during the current period. Stock compensation expense is based upon the valuation of stock options and restricted stock units granted to employees, directors, and certain consultants. Many variables affect the amount expensed, including the Company's stock price on the date of the grant, as well as other assumptions. The increase in the expense is primarily due to the achievement of certain performance-based awards during the current period.\nProfessional/outside services include legal, accounting, consulting, patent expenses, business insurance expenses and other outside services retained by the Company. Professional/outside services expense decreased by $329,000 from $4,660,000 during the year ended September 30, 2017 to $4,331,000 during the current period. The decrease in the expense is primarily related to reduced legal expenses on our outstanding litigation cases.\nFacilities-related expense decreased $163,000 from $890,000 during the year ended September 30, 2017 to $727,000 during the current period. This category primarily includes rental costs for our corporate headquarters in Pasadena, California. However, the decrease in the expense is primarily related to moving expenses incurred in the previous period associated with our research facility in Madison, Wisconsin.\nDepreciation and amortization expense, a noncash expense, was relatively minor in each of the periods. The majority of general and administrative depreciation and amortization expense relates to depreciation on leasehold improvements at our Pasadena headquarters.\nOther G&A expense increased by $296,000 from $1,288,000 during the year ended September 30, 2017 to $1,584,000 during the current period. This category consists primarily of travel, communication and technology, office expenses, and franchise and property tax expenses. The increase in the expense was due to various travel and communication and technology expenses.\nOther Income / Expense\nOther income / expense was income of $2,618,014 during the year ended September 30, 2017 as compared to income of $1,488,157 during the current period. The largest component of other income / expense in the current period was interest income of $1.0 million earned on the Company's short-term investments. The largest component of other income / expense in the previous period was $1.3 million in other income due to an insurance settlement related to one of the Company's recent litigation cases. The settlement amount was received in fiscal 2017. The other significant component of other income / expense is related to the change in the value of derivative liabilities related to certain warrants with a price adjustment feature, which requires derivative accounting. The change in value of derivative liabilities was an income of approximately $0.9 million in 2017 and an income of approximately $0.4 million in the current period. The fluctuations in each period were primarily driven by changes in the Company's stock price, which had a corresponding impact on the valuation of the underlying warrant liability.\nResults of Operations Comparison for 2017 and 2016\nRevenues\nTotal revenue was $31,407,709 for the year ended September 30, 2017 and $158,333 for the year ended September 30, 2016. Revenue during the year ended September 30, 2017 is primarily related to the upfront payments received from Amgen that we are recognizing as performance is completed for the AMG 890 (ARO-LPA) and ARO-AMG1 agreements\nUnder the terms of the AMG 890 (ARO-LPA) Agreement, the Company has granted a worldwide, exclusive license to AMG 890 (ARO-LPA). The Company is also responsible for assisting Amgen in the oversight of certain development and manufacturing activities (the AMG 890 (ARO-LPA) R&D Services\u201d), most of which are to be covered at Amgen's cost. The Company has determined that the significant deliverables under the AMG 890 (ARO-LPA) Agreement include the license and the AMG 890 (ARO-LPA) R&D Services. The Company also determined that, pursuant to the accounting guidance governing revenue recognition on multiple element arrangements, the license and the AMG 890 (ARO-LPA) R&D Services do not have standalone value due to the specialized nature of the activities and services to be provided by the Company. Therefore, the deliverables are not separable and, accordingly, the license and the AMG 890 (ARO-LPA) R&D Services are being treated as a single unit of accounting. The Company recognized revenue on a straight-line basis from November 18, 2016 (the Hart-Scott-Rodino clearance date), through October 31, 2017, which was the date where the AMG 890 (ARO-LPA) R&D Services were substantially completed. The Company received the upfront payment of $30 million due under this agreement in November 2016. The initial $30 million payment was recorded as Deferred Revenue, and $27.3 million of this was amortized into Revenue during the year ended September 30, 2017.\nUnder the terms of the ARO-AMG1 Agreement, the Company has granted an option to a worldwide, exclusive license to ARO-AMG1, an undisclosed genetically validated cardiovascular target. The Company is also responsible for developing, optimizing and manufacturing the candidate through certain preclinical efficacy and toxicology studies to determine whether the candidate the Company has developed meets the required criteria as defined in the agreement (the Arrowhead Deliverable\u201d). The Company delivered the candidate in August 2018 and Amgen currently has the option to an exclusive license for the intellectual property generated through the Company's development efforts. If Amgen exercises its option, it would likely assume all development, regulatory and commercialization efforts for the candidate. The Company determined that the significant deliverables under the ARO-AMG1 Agreement include the option to license and the development and manufacturing activities toward achieving the Arrowhead Deliverable (the ARO-AMG1 R&D Services\u201d). The Company also determined that, pursuant to the accounting guidance governing revenue recognition on multiple element arrangements, the option to license and ARO-AMG1 R&D Services do not have standalone value due to the specialized nature of the activities and services to be provided by the Company. Therefore, the deliverables are not separable and, accordingly, the option to license and ARO-AMG1 R&D Services are being treated as a single unit of accounting. The Company has recognized revenue on a straight-line basis from October 1, 2016, through September 30, 2018, as the Company completed the Arrowhead Deliverable during the three months ended September 30, 2018. The Company received an upfront payment of $5 million due under this agreement in September 2016. The upfront $5 million payment was initially recorded as Deferred Revenue. The initial $5 million payment was recorded as Deferred Revenue, and $2.5 million of this was amortized into Revenue during the year ended September 30, 2017.\nIn January 2017, the Company also entered into a separate services agreement with Amgen to provide certain services related to process development, manufacturing, materials supply, discovery studies, and other consulting services related to AMG 890 (ARO-LPA). During the year ended September 30, 2017, work orders under this services agreement generated approximately $1.5 million of Revenue.\nOperating Expenses\nThe analysis below details the operating expenses and discusses the expenditures of the Company within the major expense categories. Certain reclassifications have been made to prior-period operating expense categories to conform to the current period presentation. For purposes of comparison, the amounts for the years ended September 30, 2017 and 2016 are shown in the tables below.\nResearch and Development Expenses\nR&D expenses are related to the Company's on-going research and development efforts, primarily related to program costs, composed primarily of outsourced costs related to the manufacturing of clinical supplies, toxicity/efficacy studies and clinical trial expenses. Internal costs primarily relate to operations at our research and development facility in Madison, Wisconsin, including facility costs and laboratory-related expenses.

In addition, the Company records depreciation on leasehold improvements at its Madison research facility. The increase in the expense is primarily due to the depreciation on leasehold improvements at the Company's new Madison, Wisconsin research facility.\nOther research expense increased $1,554,000 from $3,123,000 during the year ended September 30, 2016 to $4,677,000 during the year ended September 30, 2017. The increase primarily relates to additional miscellaneous supplies purchased to support efforts at our larger facility in Madison, Wisconsin.\nGeneral & Administrative Expenses\nThe following table provides details of our general and administrative expenses for the periods indicated:\n(in thousands)\nTable 133: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Twelve\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Twelve\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Months Ended\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> % of Expense\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Months Ended\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> % of Expense\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Increase (Decrease)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> September 30, 2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Category\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> September 30, 2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Category\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Salaries\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 5,571\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 5,579\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (8\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Stock compensation\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 5,052\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 8,048\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (2,996\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Professional/outside services\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 4,660\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 6,362\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (1,702\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Facilities related\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Depreciation/amortization\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other G&A\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,288\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,956\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (1,668\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 17,499\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 23,595\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (6,096\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nSalaries expense was consistent at $5,579,000 for the year ended September 30, 2016 and $5,571,000 for the year ended September 30, 2017.\nStock compensation expense, a non-cash expense, decreased by $2,996,000 from $8,048,000 during the year ended September 30, 2016 to $5,052,000 during the year ended September 30, 2017. Stock compensation expense is based upon the valuation of stock options and restricted stock units granted to employees, directors, and certain consultants. Many variables affect the amount expensed, including the Company's stock price on the date of the grant, as well as other assumptions. The decrease in the expense is primarily due to a mix of lower grant date fair values of awards amortizing during the periods due to the Company's stock price at the time of the grants.\nProfessional/outside services include legal, accounting, consulting, patent expenses, business insurance expenses and other outside services retained by the Company Professional/outside services expense decreased $1,702,000 from $6,362,000 during the year ended September 30, 2016 to $4,660,000 during the year ended September 30, 2017. The decrease in professional fees primarily related to legal fees related to previous litigation events.\nFacilities-related expense increased $268,000 from $622,000 during the year ended September 30, 2016 to $890,000 in the year ended September 30, 2017. This category primarily includes rental costs for our corporate headquarters in Pasadena, California. However, the increase in the expense is primarily related to moving expenses incurred in the previous period associated with our research facility in Madison, Wisconsin.\nDepreciation and amortization expense, a noncash expense, was relatively minor in each of the periods. The majority of general and administrative depreciation and amortization expense relates to depreciation on leasehold improvements at our Pasadena headquarters.\nOther expense decreased $1,668,000 from $2,956,000 during the year ended September 30, 2016 to $1,288,000 during the year ended September 30, 2017. This category consists primarily of conference attendance fees, franchise and property tax expenses and marketing expenses. The decrease in other expense relates to litigation in the fiscal 2016 period that was settled.\nOther Income / Expense\nOther income / expense was income of $22,124 during the year ended September 30, 2016 as compared to income of $2,618,014 during the year ended September 30, 2017. The largest component of other income / expense in the year ended September 30, 2017 was $1.3 million in other income due to an insurance settlement related to one of the Company's recent litigation cases. The settlement amount was received in fiscal 2017. The other significant component of other income / expense is related to the change in the value of derivative liabilities related to certain warrants with a price adjustment feature, which requires derivative accounting. The change in value of derivative liabilities was an expense of approximately $0.3 million in 2016 and an income of approximately $0.9 million in the year ended September 30, 2017. The fluctuations in each period were primarily driven by changes in the Company's stock price, which had a corresponding impact on the valuation of the underlying warrant liability\nLiquidity and Cash Resources\nArrowhead has historically financed its operations through the sale of its equity securities. Research and development activities have required significant capital investment since the Company's inception and are expected to continue to require significant cash expenditure in the future.\nAt September 30, 2018, the Company had cash on hand of approximately $30.1 million as compared to $24.8 million at September 30, 2017. Excess cash invested in fixed income securities was $46.4 million at September 30, 2018, compared to $40.8 million at September 30, 2017. The Company believes its current financial resources are sufficient to fund its operations through at least the next twelve months.\nA summary of cash flows for the years ended September 30, 2018, 2017, and 2016 is as follows:\nTable 134: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Year ended September 30,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Cash Flow from:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Operating Activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (47,223,417\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (23,938,972\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (64,427,486\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Investing Activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (7,434,963\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (48,644,218\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 13,447,763\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Financing Activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 59,953,026\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 12,055,309\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 55,131,817\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net increase (decrease) in cash\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 5,294,646\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (60,527,881\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 4,152,094\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Cash at beginning of period\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 24,838,567\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 85,366,448\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 81,214,354\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Cash at end of period\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 30,133,213\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 24,838,567\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 85,366,448\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nDuring the year ended September 30, 2018, the Company used $47.2 million in cash from operating activities, which was primarily related to $57.2 million used for the on-going expenses of its research and development programs and general and administrative expenses, offset by the $10 million milestone payment for the AMG 890 (ARO-LPA) Agreement with Amgen. Cash used in investing activities was $7.4 million, which was primarily related to maturities of fixed-income investments of $46.1 million offset by purchases of fixed-income securities of $52.1 million. Cash provided by financing activities of $60.0 million was driven by the $56.6 million of cash generated from the underwritten public offering in January 2018.\nDuring the year ended September 30, 2017, the Company used $23.9 million in cash from operating activities, primarily driven by $53.9 million of cash used for the on-going expenses of its research and development programs and general and administrative expenses, partially offset by the $30 million upfront payment received from Amgen. Cash used in investing activities was $48.6 million, which was primarily related to investments in short-term fixed-income securities of $45.0 million and $7.9 million of capital expenditures primarily for leasehold improvements on the Company's Madison, Wisconsin research facility and lab equipment purchases. Cash generated by financing activities of $12.1 million was driven by the $12.5 million equity investment received from Amgen and was partially offset by cash paid for employee taxes on net share settlements of restricted stock units that vested during the period.\nDuring the year ended September 30, 2016, the Company used $64.4 million in cash from operating activities, which represents the on-going expenses of its research and development programs and corporate overhead. Cash outlays were primarily composed of the following: research and development costs were $42.6 million, salary and payroll-related expenses were $16.4 million and general and administrative costs were $9.9 million. These expenditures were partially offset by $5 million received under the First Collaboration and License Agreement with Amgen. Cash provided by investing activities was $13.4 million, primarily related to the maturity of certain marketable securities of $17.3 million partially offset by capital expenditures of $3.9 million. Cash provided by financing activities of $55.1 million primarily includes an equity financing in August 2016, which yielded net proceeds of $43.2 million to the Company, and $9 million of equity investments from the Company's Common Stock Purchase Agreement with Amgen.\nContractual Obligations\nIn the table below, we set forth our enforceable and legally binding obligations and future commitments at September 30, 2018 for the categories shown, as well as obligations related to contracts in such categories that we are likely to continue. Some of the figures that we include in this table are based on management's estimates and assumptions about these obligations, including their duration, the possibility of renewal, anticipated actions by third parties and other factors. Because these estimates and assumptions are necessarily subjective, the obligations we will actually pay in future periods may vary from those reflected in the table. The following table does not include any future obligations that may be owed under existing license agreements, as the certainty of achieving the relevant milestones that would trigger these payments is currently unknown.\nTable 135: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Payments due by Period\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Less than 1 Year\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1-3 Years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3-5 Years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> More than 5 Years\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Long-Term Debt\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,101,198\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 498,161\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 574,022\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,029,015\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Capital Leases\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Operating Leases\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 9,316,831\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,435,409\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,114,927\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,221,613\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3,544,882\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Purchase Obligations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 27,500,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 20,051,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 7,449,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other Long-Term Liabilities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,902,801\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 307,335\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 424,319\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 424,319\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 746,828\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 40,820,830\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 21,793,744\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 10,486,407\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 3,219,954\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 5,320,725\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nAs of September 30, 2018, we did not have any off-balance sheet arrangements, as defined in Item 303(a)(4)(ii) of SEC Regulation S-K.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nSee Note 1 to our Consolidated Financial Statements of this annual report on Form 10-K for a description of recent accounting pronouncements applicable to our business.\nTable 136: <table> <tr> <td>", "item_7_text": "ITEM 7.\n</td> <td> MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nDescription of Business\nUnless otherwise noted, (1) the term Arrowhead\u201d refers to Arrowhead Pharmaceuticals, Inc., a Delaware corporation, (2) the terms Company,\u201d we,\u201d us,\u201d and our,\u201d refer to the ongoing business operations of Arrowhead and its Subsidiaries, whether conducted through Arrowhead or a subsidiary of Arrowhead, (3) the term Subsidiaries\u201d refers collectively to Arrowhead Madison Inc.

Using a broad portfolio of RNA chemistries and efficient modes of delivery, Arrowhead therapies trigger the RNA interference mechanism to induce rapid, deep and durable knockdown of target genes. RNA interference, or RNAi, is a mechanism present in living cells that inhibits the expression of a specific gene, thereby affecting the production of a specific protein. Deemed to be one of the most important recent discoveries in life science with the potential to transform medicine, the discoverers of RNAi were awarded a Nobel Prize in 2006 for their work. Arrowhead's RNAi-based therapeutics leverage this natural pathway of gene silencing. The company's pipeline includes ARO-AAT for liver disease associated with alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency (AATD), ARO-APOC3 for hypertriglyceridemia, ARO-ANG3 for dyslipidemia, ARO-ENaC for cystic fibrosis, and ARO-HIF2 for renal cell carcinoma. ARO-LPA (AMG 890) for cardiovascular disease was out-licensed to Amgen Inc. in 2016. ARO-AMG1 for an undisclosed genetically validated cardiovascular target is under a license and collaboration agreement with Amgen Inc. ARO-HBV for chronic hepatitis B virus was out-licensed to Janssen Pharmaceuticals, Inc. in October 2018.\nArrowhead operates a lab facility in Madison, Wisconsin, where the Company's research and development activities, including the development of RNAi therapeutics, are based. The Company's principal executive offices are located in Pasadena, California.\nArrowhead has refocused its resources on therapeutics that exclusively utilize the company's Targeted RNAi Molecule (TRiMTM) platform technology. Therapeutics built on the TRiMTM platform have demonstrated high levels of pharmacologic activity in multiple animal models spanning several therapeutic areas. TRiMTM enabled therapeutics offer several potential advantages over prior generation and competing technologies, including: simplified manufacturing and reduced costs; multiple routes of administration including subcutaneous injection and inhaled administration; the ability to target multiple tissue types including liver, lung, and tumors; and the potential for improved safety and reduced risk of intracellular buildup, because there are less metabolites from smaller, simpler molecules.\nDuring fiscal 2018, the Company achieved substantial progress on its pipeline candidates. In the first half of fiscal 2018, Clinical Trial Applications (CTAs) were filed for ARO-AAT and ARO-HBV, and the associated phase 1 (ARO-AAT) and phase 1 / 2 (ARO-HBV) studies are ongoing. Dosing has completed for the ARO-AAT phase 1 clinical study. In October 2018, the Company also filed a CTA for ARO-ANG3 and, pending approval, the Company anticipates the startup of this study in 2019. The Company has also achieved substantial progress on its other preclinical candidates including ARO-APOC3, ARO-ENaC and ARO-HIF2, with planned CTA or equivalent filings planned in late calendar 2018 for ARO-APOC3 and in 2019 for ARO-ENaC and ARO-HIF2.\nThe Company also made significant progress on its business development and partnership collaboration efforts. In October 2018, the Company entered into a License Agreement ( Janssen License Agreement\u201d) and a Research Collaboration and Option Agreement ( Janssen Collaboration Agreement\u201d) with Janssen Pharmaceuticals, Inc. ( Janssen\u201d) part of the Janssen Pharmaceutical Companies of Johnson & Johnson. The Company also entered into a Stock Purchase Agreement ( JJDC Stock Purchase Agreement\u201d) with Johnson & Johnson Innovation-JJDC, Inc. ( JJDC\u201d), a New Jersey corporation. Under the Janssen License Agreement, Janssen has received a worldwide, exclusive license to the Company's ARO-HBV program, the Company's third-generation subcutaneously administered RNAi therapeutic candidate being developed as a potentially curative therapy for patients with chronic hepatitis B virus infection. Beyond the Company's ongoing Phase 1 / 2 study of ARO-HBV, Janssen will be wholly responsible for clinical development and commercialization. Under the Janssen Collaboration Agreement, Janssen will be able to select three new targets against which Arrowhead will develop clinical candidates. These candidates are subject to certain restrictions and will not include candidates in the Company's current pipeline. The Company will perform discovery, optimization and preclinical development, entirely funded by Janssen, sufficient to allow the filing of a U.S. Investigational New Drug application or equivalent, at which time Janssen will have the option to take an exclusive license. If the option is exercised, Janssen will be wholly responsible for clinical development and commercialization. Under the JJDC Stock Purchase Agreement, in October 2018 the Company sold 3,260,869 shares of common stock to JJDC at a price of $23.00 per share. Under the terms of the agreements taken together, the Company has received $175 million as an upfront payment, $75 million in the form of an equity investment by JJDC in Arrowhead common stock, and may receive up to $1.6\nbillion in development and sales milestones payments for the Janssen License Agreement, and up to $1.9 billion in development and sales milestone payments for the three additional targets covered under the Janssen Collaboration Agreement. The Company is further eligible to receive tiered royalties up to mid teens under the Janssen License Agreement and up to low teens under the Janssen Collaboration Agreement on product sales.\nThe Company's collaboration agreements with Amgen also continue to progress as it relates to the AMG 890 (ARO-LPA) and ARO-AMG1 candidates. Under the terms of the agreements taken together, the Company has received $35 million in upfront payments and $21.5 million in the form of an equity investment by Amgen in the Company's Common Stock and could receive up to $617 million in option payments and development, regulatory and sales milestone payments. The Company is further eligible to receive single-digit royalties for sales of products under the ARO-AMG1 agreement and up to low double-digit royalties for sales of products under the AMG 890 (ARO-LPA) Agreement. On August 1, 2018, the Company announced that it had earned a $10 million milestone payment from Amgen following the administration of the first dose of AMG 890 (ARO-LPA) in a phase 1 clinical study. This milestone payment was recognized as Revenue in its entirety during the year ended September 30, 2018.\nThe Company continues to develop other clinical candidates for future clinical trials. Clinical candidates are tested internally and through GLP toxicology studies at outside laboratories. Drug materials for such studies and clinical trials are contracted to third-party manufactures when cGMP production is required. The Company engages third-party contract research organizations (CROs) to manage clinical trials and works cooperatively with such organizations on all aspects of clinical trial management, including plan design, patient recruiting, and follow up. These outside costs, relating to the preparation for and administration of clinical trials, are referred to as program costs\u201d. If the clinical candidates progress through human testing, program costs will increase.\nNet losses were $54.5 million, $34.4 million and $81.7 million during the years ended September 30, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Diluted losses per share were $0.65, $0.47 and $1.34 during the years ended September 30, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. A decrease in revenue in 2018 from the collaborations with Amgen is the driver of the increases in the net losses and diluted losses per share, as discussed further below.\nThe Company strengthened its liquidity and financial position through an equity offering completed in January 2018, which generated $56.6 million of net cash proceeds for the Company, as well as the $10 million milestone payment earned from Amgen under the AMG 890 (ARO-LPA) Agreement. Additionally, with the recent agreements made with Janssen, the Company has secured an additional $250 million in cash proceeds in October 2018. These cash proceeds secure the funding needed to continue to advance our preclinical candidates. The Company had $30.1 million of cash and cash equivalents, $46.4 million in short-term investments and $111.6 million of total assets as of September 30, 2018, as compared to $24.8 million, $40.8 million and $104.0 million as of September 30, 2017, respectively. Based upon the Company's current cash and short-term investment resources and operating plan, the Company expects to have sufficient liquidity to fund operations for at least the next twelve months.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nManagement makes certain judgments and uses certain estimates and assumptions when applying GAAP in the preparation of our Consolidated Financial Statements. We evaluate our estimates and judgments on an ongoing basis and base our estimates on historical experience and on assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Our experience and assumptions form the basis for our judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may vary from what we anticipate and different assumptions or estimates about the future could change our reported results. We believe the following accounting policies are the most critical to us, in that they require our most difficult, subjective or complex judgments in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements. For further information, see Note 1, Organization and Significant Accounting Policies, to our Consolidated Financial Statements, which outlines our application of significant accounting policies.\nRevenue Recognition\nRevenue from product sales is recorded when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, title has passed, and delivery has occurred, a price is fixed and determinable, and collection is reasonably assured.\nThe Company may generate revenue from technology licenses, collaborative research and development arrangements, research grants and product sales. Revenue under technology licenses and collaborative agreements typically consists of nonrefundable and/or guaranteed technology license fees, collaborative research funding, manufacturing and development services and various milestone and future product royalty or profit-sharing payments. These agreements are generally referred to as multiple element arrangements\u201d.\nThe Company applies the accounting standard on revenue recognition for multiple element arrangements. The fair value of deliverables under the arrangement may be derived using a best estimate of selling price if vendor specific objective evidence and third-party evidence is not available. Deliverables under the arrangement will be separate units of accounting if a delivered item has value to the customer on a standalone basis and if the arrangement includes a general right of return for the delivered item, delivery or performance of the undelivered item is considered probable and substantially in the Company's control.\nThe Company recognizes upfront license payments as revenue upon delivery of the license only if the license has standalone value from any undelivered performance obligations and that value can be determined. The undelivered performance obligations typically include manufacturing or development services or research and/or steering committee services. If the fair value of the undelivered performance obligations can be determined, then these obligations would be accounted for separately. If the license is not considered to have standalone value, then the license and other undelivered performance obligations would be accounted for as a single unit of accounting. In this case, the license payments and payments for performance obligations are recognized as revenue over the estimated period of when the performance obligations are performed or deferred indefinitely until the undelivered performance obligation is determined.\nWhenever the Company determines that an arrangement should be accounted for as a single unit of accounting, the Company determines the period over which the performance obligations will be performed, and revenue will be recognized. Revenue is recognized using a proportional performance or straight-line method. The proportional performance method is used when the level of effort required to complete performance obligations under an arrangement can be reasonably estimated. The amount of revenue recognized under the proportional performance method is determined by multiplying the total payments under the contract, excluding royalties and payments contingent upon achievement of milestones, by the ratio of the level of effort performed to date to the estimated total level of effort required to complete performance obligations under the arrangement. If the Company cannot reasonably estimate the level of effort to complete performance obligations under an arrangement, the Company recognizes revenue under the arrangement on a straight-line basis over the period the Company is expected to complete its performance obligations. Significant management judgment is required in determining the level of effort required under an arrangement and the period over which the Company is expected to complete its performance obligations under an arrangement.\nThe Company's collaboration agreements typically entitle the Company to additional payments upon the achievement of development, regulatory and sales performance-based milestones. If the achievement of a milestone is considered probable at the inception of the collaboration, the related milestone payment is included with other collaboration consideration, such as upfront fees and research funding, in the Company's revenue calculation. Typically, these milestones are not considered probable at the inception of the collaboration. As such, milestones will typically be recognized in one of two ways depending on the timing of when the milestone is achieved. If the milestone is achieved during the performance period, then the Company will only recognize revenue to the extent of the proportional performance achieved at that date, or the proportion of the straight-line basis achieved at that date, and the remainder will be recorded as deferred revenue to be amortized over the remaining performance period. If the milestone is achieved after the performance period has completed and all performance obligations have been delivered, then the Company will recognize the milestone payment as Revenue in its entirety in the period the milestone was achieved.\nDeferred revenue will be classified as part of Current or Long-Term Liabilities in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets based on the Company's estimate of the portion of the performance obligations regarding that revenue will be completed within the next 12 months divided by the total performance period estimate. This estimate is based on the Company's current operating plan and, if the Company's operating plan should change in the future, the Company may recognize a different amount of deferred revenue over the next 12-month period.\nThe new revenue recognition guidance (ASC 606) was effective as of October 1, 2018, and it will not have a material impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements. Please read Note 1 to our Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data,\u201d of this annual report on Form 10-K for our discussion of recent accounting pronouncements for the expected impact of this new accounting guidance.\nImpairment of Long-lived Assets\nWe review long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in business circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of assets may not be fully recoverable or that our assumptions about the useful lives of these assets are no longer appropriate. If impairment is indicated, recoverability is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to the estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset. If the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its estimated future cash flows, an impairment charge is recognized in the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the fair value of the asset.\nImpairment of Intangible assets\nIntangible assets consist of a license agreement and patents acquired in conjunction with a business or asset acquisition. Intangible assets are monitored for potential impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable and are also reviewed annually to determine whether any impairment is necessary. Based on ASU 2012-02, the annual review of intangible assets is performed via a two-step process. First, a qualitative assessment is performed to determine if it is more likely than not that the intangible asset is impaired. If required, a quantitative assessment is performed and, if necessary, impairment is recorded.\nStock-Based Compensation\nWe account for stock-based compensation arrangements in accordance with FASB ASC 718, which requires the measurement and recognition of compensation expense for all share-based payment awards to be based on estimated fair values. The Company uses the Black-Scholes option valuation model to estimate the fair value of its stock options at the date of grant. The Black-Scholes option valuation model requires the input of subjective assumptions to calculate the value of stock options. For restricted stock units, the value of the award is based on the Company's stock price at the grant date. For performance-based restricted stock unit awards, the value of the award is based on the Company's stock price at the grant date. The Company uses historical data and other information to estimate the expected price volatility for stock option awards and the expected forfeiture rate for all awards. Expense is recognized over the vesting period for all awards and commences at the grant date for time-based awards and upon the Company's determination that the achievement of such performance conditions is probable for performance-based awards. This determination requires significant judgement by management.\nContingent Consideration\nThe consideration for our acquisitions often includes future payments that are contingent upon the occurrence of a particular event. For example, milestone payments might be based on progress of clinical development, the achievement of various regulatory approvals or future sales milestones, and royalty payments might be based on drug product sales levels. The Company records a contingent consideration obligation for such contingent payments at fair value on the acquisition date. The Company estimates the fair value of contingent consideration obligations through valuation models designed to estimate the probability of the occurrence of such contingent payments based on various assumptions and incorporating estimated success rates. Estimated payments are discounted using present value techniques to arrive at estimated fair value at the balance sheet date. Changes in the fair value of our contingent consideration obligations are recognized within our Consolidated Statements of Operations. Changes in the fair value of the contingent consideration obligations can result from changes to one or multiple inputs, including adjustments to the discount rates, changes in the amount or timing of expected expenditures associated with product development, changes in the amount or timing of cash flows from products upon commercialization, changes in the assumed achievement or timing of any development milestones, changes in the probability of certain clinical events and changes in the assumed probability associated with regulatory approval. These fair value measurements are based on significant inputs not observable in the market. Substantial judgment is employed in determining the appropriateness of these assumptions as of the acquisition date and for each subsequent period. Accordingly, changes in assumptions could have a material impact on the amount of contingent consideration expense the Company records in any given period.\nResults of Operations\nThe following data summarizes our results of operations for the following periods indicated:\n\nThe decrease in our Revenue during the year ended September 30, 2018 was driven by the timing of the recognition of the initial $30 million payment associated with the AMG 890 (ARO-LPA) Agreement. This Revenue was recognized primarily in fiscal 2017 as performance was completed. This decrease in Revenue was also the key driver of the increase in our Operating Loss, Net Loss and Loss per Share. Research and Development expenses increased during fiscal 2018 due to the progress of ARO-AAT and ARO-HBV into phase 1 and phase 1 / 2 clinical studies.\nResults of Operations Comparison for 2018 and 2017\nRevenues\nTotal revenue was $16,142,321 for the year ended September 30, 2018 and $31,407,709 for the year ended September 30, 2017. Revenue in the current period is primarily related to the $10 million milestone payment received from Amgen in August 2018, which\nwas earned following the administration of the first dose of AMG 890 (ARO-LPA) in a phase 1 clinical study. Revenue in the previous period was primarily related to the upfront payments received from Amgen in 2016 that we recognized as Revenue as performance was completed for the AMG 890 (ARO-LPA) and ARO-AMG1 Agreements. The decrease in our Revenue during the year ended September 30, 2018 was driven by a reduction in the amount of Revenue recognized associated with the $30 million upfront payment received from Amgen associated with the AMG 890 (ARO-LPA) Agreement. We recognized Revenue from the ARO-LPA (AMG-890) Agreement on a straight-line basis as performance was completed from November 2016 thru October 2017.\nUnder the terms of the AMG 890 (ARO-LPA) Agreement, the Company has granted a worldwide, exclusive license to AMG 890 (ARO-LPA). The Company is also responsible for assisting Amgen in the oversight of certain development and manufacturing activities (the AMG 890 (ARO-LPA) R&D Services\u201d), most of which are to be covered at Amgen's cost. The Company has determined that the significant deliverables under the AMG 890 (ARO-LPA) Agreement include the license and the AMG 890 (ARO-LPA) R&D Services. The Company also determined that, pursuant to the accounting guidance governing revenue recognition on multiple element arrangements, the license and the AMG 890 (ARO-LPA) R&D Services do not have standalone value due to the specialized nature of the activities and services to be provided by the Company. Therefore, the deliverables are not separable and, accordingly, the license and the AMG 890 (ARO-LPA) R&D Services are being treated as a single unit of accounting. The Company recognized revenue on a straight-line basis from November 18, 2016 (the Hart-Scott-Rodino clearance date), through October 31, 2017, which was the date where the AMG 890 (ARO-LPA) R&D Services were substantially completed. The Company received the upfront payment of $30 million due under the AMG 890 (ARO-LPA) Agreement in November 2016. The upfront $30 million payment was initially recorded as Deferred Revenue. During the years ended September 30, 2018 and 2017, $2.7 million and $27.3 million of this upfront payment were recognized into Revenue, respectively. This upfront payment has been recognized as Revenue in its entirety as of September 30, 2018.\nOn August 1, 2018, the Company announced that it had earned a $10 million milestone payment from Amgen following the administration of the first dose of AMG 890 (ARO-LPA) in a phase 1 clinical study. The Company has recognized this payment as Revenue in its entirety during the year ended September 30, 2018 as the performance obligations had already been substantially completed.\nUnder the terms of the ARO-AMG1 Agreement, the Company has granted an option to a worldwide, exclusive license to ARO-AMG1, an undisclosed genetically validated cardiovascular target. The Company is also responsible for developing, optimizing and manufacturing the candidate through certain preclinical efficacy and toxicology studies to determine whether the candidate the Company has developed meets the required criteria as defined in the agreement (the Arrowhead Deliverable\u201d). The Company delivered the candidate in August 2018 and Amgen currently has the option to an exclusive license for the intellectual property generated through the Company's development efforts. If Amgen exercises its option, it would likely assume all development, regulatory and commercialization efforts for the candidate. The Company determined that the significant deliverables under the ARO-AMG1 Agreement include the option to license and the development and manufacturing activities toward achieving the Arrowhead Deliverable (the ARO-AMG1 R&D Services\u201d). The Company also determined that, pursuant to the accounting guidance governing revenue recognition on multiple element arrangements, the option to license and ARO-AMG1 R&D Services do not have standalone value due to the specialized nature of the activities and services to be provided by the Company. Therefore, the deliverables are not separable and, accordingly, the option to license and ARO-AMG1 R&D Services are being treated as a single unit of accounting. The Company has recognized revenue on a straight-line basis from October 1, 2016, through September 30, 2018, as the Company completed the Arrowhead Deliverable during the three months ended September 30, 2018. The Company received an upfront payment of $5 million due under this agreement in September 2016. The upfront $5 million payment was initially recorded as Deferred Revenue. During the years ended September 30, 2018 and 2017, $2.5 million and $2.5 million of this upfront payment were recognized into Revenue, respectively. This upfront payment has been recognized as Revenue in its entirety as of September 30, 2018.\nThe Company also entered into a separate services agreement and separate statements of work with Amgen to provide certain services related to process development, manufacturing, materials supply, discovery studies, and other consulting services related to AMG 890 (ARO-LPA) and ARO-AMG1. During the years ended September 30, 2018 and 2017, these work orders generated approximately $1.0 million and $1.5 million of Revenue, respectively.\nOperating Expenses\nThe analysis below details the operating expenses and discusses the expenditures of the Company within the major expense categories. Certain reclassifications have been made to prior-period operating expense categories to conform to the current period presentation. For purposes of comparison, the amounts for the years ended September 30, 2018 and 2017 are shown in the tables below.\nResearch and Development Expenses\nR&D expenses are related to the Company's research and development efforts, and related program costs which are comprised primarily of outsourced costs related to the manufacturing of clinical supplies, toxicity/efficacy studies and clinical trial expenses. Internal costs primarily relate to operations at our research facility in Madison, Wisconsin, including facility costs and laboratory-related expenses. Salaries and stock compensation expense consist of salary, bonuses, payroll taxes and related benefits and stock compensation for our R&D personnel. Depreciation and amortization expense relates to depreciation on lab equipment and leasehold improvements at our Madison research facility. The following table provides details of research and development expense for the periods indicated:\n(in thousands)\n\nSalaries expense increased by $999,000 from $11,722,000 during the year ended September 30, 2017 to $12,721,000 during the current period. The increase in the expense is primarily due to an increase in R&D headcount that has occurred since the Company's reduction in force in late 2016 associated with the discontinuation of our previous clinical candidates.\nStock compensation expense, a non-cash expense, decreased by $444,000 from $2,840,000 during the year ended September 30, 2017 to $2,396,000 during the current period. Stock compensation expense is based upon the valuation of stock options and restricted stock units granted to employees, directors, and certain consultants. Many variables affect the amount expensed, including the Company's stock price on the date of the grant, as well as other assumptions. The decrease in the expense is primarily due to a mix of lower grant date fair values of awards amortizing during the periods due to the Company's stock price at the time of the grants.\nIn vivo studies expense increased by $192,000 from $2,513,000 during the year ended September 30, 2017 to $2,705,000 during the current period. In vivo studies expense can vary depending on the stage of preclinical candidates, the nature and amount of testing required and the cost variation of different in vivo testing models. The increase in in vivo studies expense is a result of additional discovery studies being conducted for the Company's potential drug candidates.\nDrug manufacturing expense increased by $3,107,000 from $11,229,000 during the year ended September 30, 2017 to $14,336,000 during the current period. The increase in the expense primarily relates to the timing of manufacturing campaigns for ARO-AAT, ARO-HBV, ARO-ANG3 and ARO-APOC3 clinical trials and toxicology studies. We anticipate this expense to increase as the volume of candidates in our pipeline increases and as each candidate progresses through clinical trial phases.\nToxicity/efficacy studies expense increased by $4,526,000 from $1,768,000 during the year ended September 30, 2017 to $6,294,000 during the current period. This category includes IND-enabling toxicology studies as well as post-IND toxicology studies, such as long-term toxicology studies, and other efficacy studies. The increase in the expense primarily relates to toxicology studies for ARO-AAT and ARO-HBV as each candidate progresses through clinical trials. We anticipate this expense to increase as we prepare to enter clinical trials with our other drug candidates.\nClinical trials expense decreased by $6,228,000 from $9,163,000 during the year ended September 30, 2017 to $2,935,000 during the current period. The decrease in the expense is primarily due to the discontinuation of our previous clinical candidates, and the close out of those studies. We anticipate this expense to increase as ARO-AAT progresses through clinical trials and as we prepare to enter clinical trials with our other drug candidates.\nLicense, royalty and milestones expense was relatively minor in both periods. This category includes milestone payments which can vary from period to period depending on the nature of our various license agreements, and the timing of reaching various development milestones requiring payment. No significant milestones were achieved in either period.\nFacilities expense decreased by $57,000 from $2,337,000 during the year ended September 30, 2017 to $2,280,000 during the current period. This category includes rental costs for our research and development facility in Madison, Wisconsin. The decrease in the expense relates to reduced CAM costs.\nDepreciation and amortization expense, was consistent at $4,653,000 during the year ended September 30, 2017 and $4,672,000 during the current period. The majority of depreciation and amortization expense relates to depreciation on lab equipment at our Madison research facility. In addition, the Company records depreciation on leasehold improvements at its Madison research facility.\nOther research expense decreased by $76,000 from $4,674,000 during the year ended September 30, 2017 to $4,598,000 during the current period. This category includes the following costs to support discovery efforts and the advancement of current drug candidates: in-house laboratory supplies, outsourced labs services, and other miscellaneous research and development expenses. The decrease in the expense primarily relates to a reduction in outsourced lab services as we have expanded our in-house manufacturing capabilities.\nGeneral & Administrative Expenses\nThe following table provides details of our general and administrative expenses for the periods indicated:\n(in thousands)\n\nSalaries expense increased by $811,000 from $5,571,000 during the year ended September 30, 2017 to $6,382,000 during the current period. The increase in the expense is primarily driven by annual merit increases, performance bonuses and increased headcount.\nStock compensation expense increased by $1,007,000 from $5,052,000 during the year ended September 30, 2017 to $6,059,000 during the current period. Stock compensation expense is based upon the valuation of stock options and restricted stock units granted to employees, directors, and certain consultants. Many variables affect the amount expensed, including the Company's stock price on the date of the grant, as well as other assumptions. The increase in the expense is primarily due to the achievement of certain performance-based awards during the current period.\nProfessional/outside services include legal, accounting, consulting, patent expenses, business insurance expenses and other outside services retained by the Company. Professional/outside services expense decreased by $329,000 from $4,660,000 during the year ended September 30, 2017 to $4,331,000 during the current period. The decrease in the expense is primarily related to reduced legal expenses on our outstanding litigation cases.\nFacilities-related expense decreased $163,000 from $890,000 during the year ended September 30, 2017 to $727,000 during the current period. This category primarily includes rental costs for our corporate headquarters in Pasadena, California. However, the decrease in the expense is primarily related to moving expenses incurred in the previous period associated with our research facility in Madison, Wisconsin.\nDepreciation and amortization expense, a noncash expense, was relatively minor in each of the periods. The majority of general and administrative depreciation and amortization expense relates to depreciation on leasehold improvements at our Pasadena headquarters.\nOther G&A expense increased by $296,000 from $1,288,000 during the year ended September 30, 2017 to $1,584,000 during the current period. This category consists primarily of travel, communication and technology, office expenses, and franchise and property tax expenses. The increase in the expense was due to various travel and communication and technology expenses.\nOther Income / Expense\nOther income / expense was income of $2,618,014 during the year ended September 30, 2017 as compared to income of $1,488,157 during the current period. The largest component of other income / expense in the current period was interest income of $1.0 million earned on the Company's short-term investments. The largest component of other income / expense in the previous period was $1.3 million in other income due to an insurance settlement related to one of the Company's recent litigation cases. The settlement amount was received in fiscal 2017. The other significant component of other income / expense is related to the change in the value of derivative liabilities related to certain warrants with a price adjustment feature, which requires derivative accounting. The change in value of derivative liabilities was an income of approximately $0.9 million in 2017 and an income of approximately $0.4 million in the current period. The fluctuations in each period were primarily driven by changes in the Company's stock price, which had a corresponding impact on the valuation of the underlying warrant liability.\nResults of Operations Comparison for 2017 and 2016\nRevenues\nTotal revenue was $31,407,709 for the year ended September 30, 2017 and $158,333 for the year ended September 30, 2016. Revenue during the year ended September 30, 2017 is primarily related to the upfront payments received from Amgen that we are recognizing as performance is completed for the AMG 890 (ARO-LPA) and ARO-AMG1 agreements\nUnder the terms of the AMG 890 (ARO-LPA) Agreement, the Company has granted a worldwide, exclusive license to AMG 890 (ARO-LPA).

Many variables affect the amount expensed, including the Company's stock price on the date of the grant, as well as other assumptions. The decrease in the expense is primarily due to a mix of lower grant date fair values of awards amortizing during the periods due to the Company's stock price at the time of the grants.\nProfessional/outside services include legal, accounting, consulting, patent expenses, business insurance expenses and other outside services retained by the Company Professional/outside services expense decreased $1,702,000 from $6,362,000 during the year ended September 30, 2016 to $4,660,000 during the year ended September 30, 2017. The decrease in professional fees primarily related to legal fees related to previous litigation events.\nFacilities-related expense increased $268,000 from $622,000 during the year ended September 30, 2016 to $890,000 in the year ended September 30, 2017. This category primarily includes rental costs for our corporate headquarters in Pasadena, California. However, the increase in the expense is primarily related to moving expenses incurred in the previous period associated with our research facility in Madison, Wisconsin.\nDepreciation and amortization expense, a noncash expense, was relatively minor in each of the periods. The majority of general and administrative depreciation and amortization expense relates to depreciation on leasehold improvements at our Pasadena headquarters.\nOther expense decreased $1,668,000 from $2,956,000 during the year ended September 30, 2016 to $1,288,000 during the year ended September 30, 2017. This category consists primarily of conference attendance fees, franchise and property tax expenses and marketing expenses. The decrease in other expense relates to litigation in the fiscal 2016 period that was settled.\nOther Income / Expense\nOther income / expense was income of $22,124 during the year ended September 30, 2016 as compared to income of $2,618,014 during the year ended September 30, 2017. The largest component of other income / expense in the year ended September 30, 2017 was $1.3 million in other income due to an insurance settlement related to one of the Company's recent litigation cases. The settlement amount was received in fiscal 2017. The other significant component of other income / expense is related to the change in the value of derivative liabilities related to certain warrants with a price adjustment feature, which requires derivative accounting. The change in value of derivative liabilities was an expense of approximately $0.3 million in 2016 and an income of approximately $0.9 million in the year ended September 30, 2017. The fluctuations in each period were primarily driven by changes in the Company's stock price, which had a corresponding impact on the valuation of the underlying warrant liability\nLiquidity and Cash Resources\nArrowhead has historically financed its operations through the sale of its equity securities. Research and development activities have required significant capital investment since the Company's inception and are expected to continue to require significant cash expenditure in the future.\nAt September 30, 2018, the Company had cash on hand of approximately $30.1 million as compared to $24.8 million at September 30, 2017. Excess cash invested in fixed income securities was $46.4 million at September 30, 2018, compared to $40.8 million at September 30, 2017. The Company believes its current financial resources are sufficient to fund its operations through at least the next twelve months.\nA summary of cash flows for the years ended September 30, 2018, 2017, and 2016 is as follows:\n\nDuring the year ended September 30, 2018, the Company used $47.2 million in cash from operating activities, which was primarily related to $57.2 million used for the on-going expenses of its research and development programs and general and administrative expenses, offset by the $10 million milestone payment for the AMG 890 (ARO-LPA) Agreement with Amgen. Cash used in investing activities was $7.4 million, which was primarily related to maturities of fixed-income investments of $46.1 million offset by purchases of fixed-income securities of $52.1 million. Cash provided by financing activities of $60.0 million was driven by the $56.6 million of cash generated from the underwritten public offering in January 2018.\nDuring the year ended September 30, 2017, the Company used $23.9 million in cash from operating activities, primarily driven by $53.9 million of cash used for the on-going expenses of its research and development programs and general and administrative expenses, partially offset by the $30 million upfront payment received from Amgen. Cash used in investing activities was $48.6 million, which was primarily related to investments in short-term fixed-income securities of $45.0 million and $7.9 million of capital expenditures primarily for leasehold improvements on the Company's Madison, Wisconsin research facility and lab equipment purchases. Cash generated by financing activities of $12.1 million was driven by the $12.5 million equity investment received from Amgen and was partially offset by cash paid for employee taxes on net share settlements of restricted stock units that vested during the period.\nDuring the year ended September 30, 2016, the Company used $64.4 million in cash from operating activities, which represents the on-going expenses of its research and development programs and corporate overhead. Cash outlays were primarily composed of the following: research and development costs were $42.6 million, salary and payroll-related expenses were $16.4 million and general and administrative costs were $9.9 million. These expenditures were partially offset by $5 million received under the First Collaboration and License Agreement with Amgen. Cash provided by investing activities was $13.4 million, primarily related to the maturity of certain marketable securities of $17.3 million partially offset by capital expenditures of $3.9 million. Cash provided by financing activities of $55.1 million primarily includes an equity financing in August 2016, which yielded net proceeds of $43.2 million to the Company, and $9 million of equity investments from the Company's Common Stock Purchase Agreement with Amgen.\nContractual Obligations\nIn the table below, we set forth our enforceable and legally binding obligations and future commitments at September 30, 2018 for the categories shown, as well as obligations related to contracts in such categories that we are likely to continue. Some of the figures that we include in this table are based on management's estimates and assumptions about these obligations, including their duration, the possibility of renewal, anticipated actions by third parties and other factors. Because these estimates and assumptions are necessarily subjective, the obligations we will actually pay in future periods may vary from those reflected in the table. The following table does not include any future obligations that may be owed under existing license agreements, as the certainty of achieving the relevant milestones that would trigger these payments is currently unknown.\n\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nAs of September 30, 2018, we did not have any off-balance sheet arrangements, as defined in Item 303(a)(4)(ii) of SEC Regulation S-K.\nRecent

"summary": " This MD&A report provides an overview of Arrowhead Pharmaceuticals' financial performance and liquidity for fiscal years 2018, 2017, and 2016. The key points are:\n\n- Revenue decreased from $31.4 million in FY2017 to $16.1 million in FY2018, primarily due to lower revenue recognition from the Amgen agreements as performance obligations were completed. This revenue decrease drove the increase in net loss. \n\n- R&D expenses increased from $50.9 million in FY2017 to $53.0 million in FY2018, largely due to increased spending on drug manufacturing, toxicity/efficacy studies, and salaries as pipeline programs progressed. Clinical trials expense decreased as previous candidates were discontinued.\n\n- G&A expenses increased from $17.5 million in FY2017 to $19.1 million in FY2018, mainly driven by higher salaries and stock compensation expense. \n\n- Cash used in operating activities was $47.2 million in FY2018 compared to $23.9 million in FY2017, reflecting ongoing R&D and G&A spending. Cash from financing activities was $60.0 million in FY2018 due to a public offering.\n\n- Arrowhead believes it has sufficient liquidity to fund operations for at least the next 12 months. Key future obligations are purchase commitments and operating leases.\n\nIn summary, the report shows an increase in R&D spending and net loss as Arrowhead progressed its pipeline, while maintaining liquidity through financing activities. Revenue decreased due to the timing of recognition from Amgen collaborations."}
