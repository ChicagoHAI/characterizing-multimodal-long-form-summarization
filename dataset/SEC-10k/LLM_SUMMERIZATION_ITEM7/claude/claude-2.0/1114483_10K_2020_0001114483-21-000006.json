MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF\nOPERATIONS\nTable 31: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read together with our selected financial data and our consolidated financial statements and the related notes appearing elsewhere in this report.\nThis discussion and analysis contains forward-looking statements that involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions. Our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of many factors, including but not limited to those under the heading Risk Factors\u201d in Item 1A of this report.\nOur Business\n\u2022Our business\n\u2022Impact of COVID-19\n\u2022Recent business acquisitions\n\u2022Discontinued operations and divestiture\n\u2022Patent litigation\n\u2022Strategic overview\n\u2022Financial overview\nOur Financial Results\n\u2022Fiscal 2020 compared with fiscal 2019\n\u2022Liquidity and capital resources\n\u2022Off-balance sheet arrangements\n\u2022Contractual obligations\n\u2022Impact of recently issued accounting standards\nCritical Accounting Estimates\n\u2022Inventories\n\u2022Valuation of goodwill and intangible assets\nOur Business\nInteger Holdings Corporation is one of the largest MDO manufacturers in the world serving the cardiac, neuromodulation, orthopedics, vascular and advanced surgical markets. We also develop batteries for high-end niche applications in the non-medical energy, military, and environmental markets. Our vision is to enhance the lives of patients worldwide by being our customers' partner of choice for innovative technologies and services.\nWe organize our business into two reportable segments, Medical and Non-Medical, and derive our revenues from four principle product lines. The Medical segment includes the Cardio & Vascular, Cardiac & Neuromodulation and Advanced Surgical, Orthopedics & Portable Medical product lines and the Non-Medical segment comprises the Electrochem product line. For more information on our segments, please refer to Note 18 Segment and Geographic Information\u201d of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Item 8 of this report.\nImpact of COVID-19\nBeginning in early March 2020, the global spread of the novel coronavirus ( COVID-19\u201d) created significant uncertainty and worldwide economic disruption. Specific impacts to our business include delayed or reduced customer orders and sales, restrictions on our associates' ability to travel or work, delays in shipments to and from certain countries, and disruptions in our supply chain. The extent to which COVID-19 impacts our operations will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain, including, among others, the duration of the outbreak, new information that may emerge concerning the severity of COVID-19 and the actions, especially those taken by governmental authorities, to contain the pandemic or treat its impact. As pandemic-related events continue to evolve, additional impacts may arise that we are not aware of currently. Any prolonged material disruption of our associates, suppliers, manufacturing, or customers could materially impact our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows.\n- 29 -\nMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS\nRecent Business Acquisitions\nOn February 19, 2020, we acquired certain assets and liabilities of InoMec Ltd. ( InoMec\u201d), a privately-held company based in Israel that specializes in the research, development and manufacturing of medical devices, including minimally invasive tools, delivery systems, tubing and catheters, surgery tools, drug-device combination, laser combined devices, and tooling and production. The acquisition enables us to create a research and development center in Israel, closer to the customer base in the region.\nIn October 2019, we purchased certain assets and liabilities of US BioDesign, LLC ( USB\u201d), a privately-held developer and manufacturer of complex braided biomedical structures for disposable and implantable medical devices. The acquisition added a differentiated capability related to the development and manufacture of complex braided and formed biomedical structures to our broad portfolio, that we believe further positions us as a partner of choice for innovative medical technologies.\nDiscontinued Operations and Divestiture\nIn July 2018, we completed the sale of the AS&O Product Line for net cash proceeds of approximately $581 million. In connection with the sale, the parties executed a transition services agreement whereby we provided certain corporate services (including accounting, payroll, and information technology services) to Viant to facilitate an orderly transfer of business operations. Viant paid us for these services as specified in the transition services agreement, which were complete as of June 28, 2019. In addition, the parties executed long-term supply agreements under which the parties have agreed to supply the other with certain products at prices specified in the agreements for a term of three years.\nIn connection with the closing of the transaction but prior to a net working capital adjustment, we recognized a pre-tax gain on sale of discontinued operations of $195.0 million during the year ended December 28, 2018. During 2019, we received, and recognized as gain on sale from discontinued operations, $4.8 million due to the final net working capital adjustment agreed to with Viant.\nThe results of operations of the AS&O Product Line have been classified as discontinued operations for all periods presented. Prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to the continuing operations reporting presentation. All results and information presented exclude the AS&O Product Line unless otherwise noted.\nRefer to Note 2 Business Acquisitions, Divestiture and Discontinued Operations\u201d of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Item 8 of this report for additional information about the acquisition of certain assets of InoMec and USB and the divestiture of the AS&O Product Line.\nPatent Litigation\nIn April 2013, we commenced an action against a competitor alleging they had infringed on the our patents by manufacturing and selling filtered feedthrough assemblies used in implantable pacemakers and cardioverter defibrillators that incorporate our patented technology.\nFollowing four trials and an appeal, the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit affirmed, in all respects, a judgment in our favor. We received proceeds related to the judgment of $28.9 million in October 2020, and after recognizing certain related expenses, recognized a net gain of $28.2 million, which is recorded in Selling, general and administrative expenses. The proceeds were used to pay down a portion of our Revolving Credit Facility.\nRefer to Note 13 Commitments and Contingencies\u201d of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Item 8 of this report for additional information on this matter.\n- 30 -\nMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS\nStrategic Overview\nWe continue to take steps to better align our resources in order to invest to grow and protect, and preserve our portfolio of products. In addition to our portfolio strategy, we continue to execute our six key operational strategic imperatives designed to drive excellence in everything we do:\n\u2022Sales Force Excellence: We have changed the organizational structure to match product line growth strategies and customer needs. This change is about getting more out of the capabilities we already have, and has increased individual accountability and clarity of ownership, while serving customers more effectively.\n\u2022Market Focused Innovation: We are ensuring we get the most return on our research and development investments. We are focused on having a clear picture of how we spend our money so we can increase investments to drive future growth.\n\u2022Manufacturing Excellence: The goal is to deliver world-class operational performance in the areas of safety, quality, delivery and overall efficiency. We want to transition our manufacturing into a competitive advantage through a single, enterprise-wide manufacturing structure known as the Integer Production System. This system will provide standardized systems and processes by leveraging best practices and applying them across all of our global sites.\n\u2022Business Process Excellence: We are taking a systematic approach to driving excellence in everything we do by standardizing, optimizing and ultimately sustaining all of our processes.\n\u2022Leadership Capability: We have a robust plan to make leadership a competitive advantage for us, and as the success rate is higher with internal hires, we are focusing on finding and developing leaders from within the Company to build critical capabilities for future success.\n\u2022Performance Excellence: We are raising the bar on associate performance to maximize our impact. This includes aligning key roles with critical capabilities, positioning the best talent against the biggest work, and putting tools and processes in place to provide higher financial rewards for top performers, so our top performers can see increased results in pay for increased results in their performance.\nWe believe we are well-positioned within the medical technology and MDO manufacturing market and that there is a robust pipeline of opportunities to pursue. We have expanded our medical device capabilities and are excited about opportunities to partner with customers to drive innovation. We believe we have the scale and global presence, supported by world-class manufacturing and quality capabilities, to capture these opportunities. We are confident in our capabilities as one of the largest MDO manufacturers, with a long history of successfully integrating companies, driving down costs and growing revenues over the long-term. Ultimately, our strategic vision is to drive shareholder value by enhancing the lives of patients worldwide by being our customers' partner of choice for innovative technologies and services.\nFinancial Overview\nFiscal 2020 Compared with Fiscal 2019\nIncome from continuing operations for 2020 was $77.3 million or $2.33 per diluted share compared to $91.2 million or $2.76 per diluted share for 2019. These variances are primarily the result of the following:\n\u2022Sales from continuing operations for 2020 decreased 15% primarily due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\u2022Gross profit for 2020 decreased $69.3 million or 20%, primarily from a decrease in sales volume, price reductions to our customers, and a loss in volume leverage, which resulted from our sales decrease, partially offset by 2019 charges associated with a customer bankruptcy (see Customer Bankruptcy under Our Financial Results below).\n\u2022Operating expenses for 2020 decreased by $32.3 million compared to 2019, due to decreases of $29.7 million in SG&A expenses and $4.5 million in Other operating expenses, partially offset by a $1.9 million increase in RD&E expenses. Included in SG&A expenses for 2020 is a net gain of $28.2 million recognized in connection with a previously mentioned patent litigation judgment.\n\u2022Interest expense for 2020 decreased by $14.3 million primarily due to lower interest rates and lower outstanding debt balances.\n\u2022We recognized a net gain on equity investments of $5.3 million in 2020, compared to a net loss on equity investments of $0.5 million during 2019. Gains and losses on equity investments are generally unpredictable in nature.\n\u2022Other loss, net for 2020 was $1.5 million compared to other income, net of $0.6 million during 2019, primarily due to fluctuations in foreign currency gains and losses in the respective periods.\n\u2022We recorded provisions for income taxes of $8.9 million and $14.0 million for 2020 and 2019, respectively. The decrease in provision for income taxes is primarily due to our decrease in pre-tax income and the beneficial impact of the final Treasury Regulations issued in 2020.\n- 31 -\nMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS\nFiscal 2019 Compared with Fiscal 2018\nIncome from continuing operations for 2019 was $91.2 million or $2.76 per diluted share compared to $47.0 million or $1.44 per diluted share for 2018. These variances are primarily the result of the following:\n\u2022Sales from continuing operations for 2019 increased 4% primarily driven by growth in Cardio & Vascular and Cardiac & Neuromodulation sales.\n\u2022Gross profit for 2019 decreased $7.7 million, primarily due to higher costs of sales due to inventory write-downs and other expenses totaling $21.4 million related to a customer who filed bankruptcy in 2019 (see Customer Bankruptcy\u201d), partially offset by a $43.1 million increase in sales from continuing operations.\n\u2022Operating expenses for 2019 decreased by 5% compared to 2018, due to decreases of $3.7 million in SG&A expenses, $2.1 million in RD&E expenses and $3.9 million in Other operating expenses.\n\u2022Interest expense for 2019 decreased by $46.8 million primarily due to lower outstanding debt balances due to the repayment of debt over the last year and extinguishment of debt charges included in 2018 related to the repayment of indebtedness in connection with the divestiture of the AS&O Product Line. Debt extinguishment expenses included in Interest expense for 2019 were lower by $40.1 million compared to 2018.\n\u2022We recognized a net loss on equity investments of $0.5 million in 2019, compared to a net gain on equity investments of $5.6 million during 2018. Gains and losses on equity investments are generally unpredictable in nature.\n\u2022Other income, net for 2019 was $0.6 million compared to other loss, net of $0.8 million during 2018, primarily due to foreign currency gains in 2019 compared to foreign currency losses in 2018.\n\u2022We recorded an income tax provision of $14.0 million for 2019, compared to a provision of $14.1 million for 2018.\n- 32 -\nMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS\nOur Financial Results\nThe following table presents selected financial information derived from our Consolidated Financial Statements, contained in

Bankruptcy Court for the Eastern District of Texas seeking relief under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. During 2020 and 2019, we recorded pre-tax charges totaling $1.2 million and $24.2 million, respectively, in connection with the bankruptcy. These charges were primarily non-cash and were associated with certain Nuvectra-related assets, primarily consisting of inventory, accounts receivable, as well as certain non-cancelable inventory commitments. The charges for 2020 were included in Cost of sales ($1.1 million) and SG&A expenses ($0.1 million). The charges for 2019 were included in Cost of sales ($21.4 million), SG&A expenses ($2.4 million) and Other operating expenses ($0.4 million).\n- 33 -\nMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS\nThe following discussion is a comparison between fiscal year 2020 and fiscal year 2019 results. For a discussion of our results of operations for fiscal year 2019 compared to fiscal year 2018, please refer to Item 7 of Part II, Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2019, which was filed with the SEC on February 20, 2020.\nFiscal 2020 Compared with Fiscal 2019\nSales\nSales by product line for 2020 and 2019 were as follows (dollars in thousands):\nTable 33: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Change </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td> </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Medical Sales: </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cardio & Vascular </td> <td>$ </td> <td>569,948 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>610,056 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(40,108) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(6.6) </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cardiac & Neuromodulation </td> <td>346,242 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>457,194 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(110,952) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(24.3) </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Advanced Surgical, Orthopedics & Portable Medical </td> <td>121,788 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>132,429 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(10,641) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(8.0) </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total Medical Sales </td> <td>1,037,978 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,199,679 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(161,701) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(13.5) </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Non-Medical </td> <td>35,464 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>58,415 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(22,951) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(39.3) </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total sales </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,073,442 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,258,094 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(184,652) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(14.7) </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTotal 2020 sales decreased 15% to $1.073 billion in comparison to 2019. The most significant drivers of this decrease were as follows:\nCardio & Vascular sales for 2020 decreased $40.1 million or 7% in comparison to 2019. Cardio & Vascular sales were negatively impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic and a blend of our customers' responses across nearly all Cardio & Vascular markets. During 2020, price reductions reduced Cardio & Vascular sales by $7.1 million in comparison to 2019. Foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations and acquisitions of USB and Inomec increased Cardio & Vascular sales for 2020 by $0.8 million and $7.9 million, respectively, in comparison to 2019.\nCardiac & Neuromodulation sales for 2020 decreased $111.0 million or 24% in comparison to 2019. Cardiac & Neuromodulation sales were negatively impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic and a blend of our customers' responses. Additionally, the Nuvectra bankruptcy created a headwind of $16.7 million for the 2020 fiscal year. During 2020, price reductions reduced Cardiac & Neuromodulation sales by approximately $10.7 million in comparison to 2019. Foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations and acquisitions did not have a material impact on Cardiac & Neuromodulation sales during 2020 in comparison to 2019.\nAdvanced Surgical, Orthopedic & Portable Medical includes sales to the acquirer of our AS&O Product Lines, Viant, under the LSA for the sale of products by the Company to Viant. Advanced Surgical, Orthopedics & Portable Medical sales for 2020 decreased by $10.6 million in comparison to 2019, driven by the impact of COVID-19 and a blend of our customers' responses. Price reductions reduced Advanced Surgical, Orthopedic & Portable Medical sales by $1.4 million in comparison to 2019. Foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations and acquisitions did not have a material impact on Advanced Surgical, Orthopedic & Portable Medical sales during 2020 in comparison to 2019.\nNon-Medical sales for 2020 decreased $23.0 million or 39% in comparison to 2019. The decreases in Non-Medical sales were primarily driven by a severe decline in the energy market and demand fall-out from the COVID-19 pandemic. Price and foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations did not have a material impact on Non-Medical sales during 2020 in comparison to 2019.\n- 34 -\nMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS\nGross Profit\nChanges to gross profit as a percentage of sales ( Gross Margin\u201d) from the prior year were due to the following:\nTable 34: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>% Change </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>2020 vs. 2019 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Price(a)\n</td> <td>(1.3) </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Mix(b)\n</td> <td>(0.6) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Volume Leverage(c)\n</td> <td>(1.3) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Customer Bankruptcy(d)\n</td> <td>1.6 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total percentage point change to gross profit as a percentage of sales </td> <td>(1.6) </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table>\n__________\n(a)Our Gross Margin for 2020 was negatively impacted by price reductions given to our larger OEM customers in return for long-term volume commitments.\n(b)Amount represents the impact to our Gross Margin attributable to changes in the mix of product sales during the period.\n(c)Our gross margin for 2020 was negatively impacted by lower sales from the COVID-19 pandemic. Given our indirect labor and overhead costs are less variable, and in most cases fixed, the resulting reduction in sales negatively impacted gross margin. However, we continue to execute on our Manufacturing Excellence strategic imperative and maintain our facility infrastructure as we expect the sales decline to be temporary.\n(d)Amount represents the impact to our Gross Margin attributable to the Customer Bankruptcy.\nSG&A Expenses\nChanges to SG&A expenses were primarily due to the following (in thousands):\nTable 35: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>$ Change </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>2020 vs. 2019 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Customer Bankruptcy(a)\n</td> <td>$ </td> <td>(2,274) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Transition services agreement(b)\n</td> <td>2,733 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Patent litigation gain, net(c)\n</td> <td>(28,167) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>All other SG&A, net(d)\n</td> <td>(1,981) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net decrease in SG&A Expenses </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(29,689) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\n__________\n(a)Amount consists primarily of a $2.3 million reserve against outstanding receivables recorded during 2019 attributable to the Customer Bankruptcy.\n(b)Represents the amount included in SG&A expenses which was billed to Viant for transition services during 2019. We executed a transition services agreement in conjunction with the sale of the AS&O Product Line, whereby we agreed to provide certain corporate services (including accounting, payroll, and information technology services) to Viant to facilitate an orderly transfer of business operations. This provision of services under the agreement was completed during the second quarter of 2019.\n(c)We recognized a net gain of $28.2 million during 2020 related to a patent litigation judgment. Refer to Note 13 Commitments and Contingencies\u201d of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Item 8 of this report for additional information on this matter.\n(d)The net decrease in all other SG&A expenses for 2020 compared to 2019 is primarily attributable to lower compensation and benefits cost, travel related expenses and depreciation expense, partially offset by an increase in amortization expense.\nRD&E Expenses\nRD&E expenses for 2020 and 2019 were $48.5 million and $46.5 million, respectively. The increase in RD&E expenses for 2020 compared to 2019 is primarily attributable to increased compensation and benefits costs, consistent with our strategy to invest in capabilities for growth. RD&E expenses are influenced by the number and timing of in-process projects and labor hours and other costs associated with these projects. Our research and development initiatives continue to emphasize new product development, product improvements, and the development of new technological platform innovations.\n- 35 -\nMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS\nOther Operating Expenses\nOOE comprises the following for 2020 and 2019 (in thousands):\nTable 36: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>Change </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operational excellence(a)\n</td> <td>$ </td> <td>2,791 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2,791 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Strategic reorganization and alignment(b)\n</td> <td>686 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5,812 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(5,126) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Manufacturing alignment to support growth(c)\n</td> <td>241 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,145 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(1,904) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Acquisition and integration costs(d)\n</td> <td>(776) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>377 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(1,153) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other general expenses(e)\n</td> <td>4,679 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3,817 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>862 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other operating expenses </td> <td>$ </td> <td>7,621 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>12,151 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(4,530) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\n__________\n(a)These projects focus on changing our organizational structure to match product line growth strategies and customer needs, transitioning our manufacturing process into a competitive advantage and standardizing and optimizing our business processes. Costs related to our 2020 initiatives mainly include termination benefits.\n(b)As a result of the strategic review of our customers, competitors and markets, we began taking steps in 2017 to better align our resources to enhance the profitability of our portfolio of products. These initiatives primarily included aligning resources with our strategic direction, improving profitability to invest in accelerated growth and the expansion of a facility. Costs related to these initiatives mainly included termination benefits and fees for professional services. These actions were completed during 2020.\n(c)In 2017, we commenced several initiatives designed to reduce costs, increase manufacturing capacity to accommodate growth and improve operating efficiencies. The plan involved the relocation of certain manufacturing operations and expansion of certain of our facilities. These actions were completed during 2020.\n(d)Amounts include expenses related to the purchase of certain assets and liabilities from InoMec and USB. The 2020 amount also includes a $2.0 million adjustment to reduce the fair value of acquisition-related contingent consideration liabilities. See Note 17 Financial Instruments and Fair Value Measurements\u201d of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Item 8 of this report for additional information related to the fair value measurement of the contingent consideration.\n(e)Amounts include expenses related to other initiatives not described above, which relate primarily to actions to align labor with customer demand as a result of COVID-19 and the decline of the energy market and integration and operational initiatives to reduce future costs and improve efficiencies. The 2020 and 2019 amounts primarily include severance, information technology systems conversion expenses, expenses incurred in connection with the Customer Bankruptcy, and expenses related to the restructuring of certain legal entities of the Company.\nRefer to Note 11 Other Operating Expenses\u201d of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Item 8 of this report for additional information regarding these initiatives.\n- 36 -\nMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS\nInterest Expense\nInterest expense consists primarily of cash interest and debt related charges, such as amortization of debt issuance costs and original issue discount. Interest expense decreased $14.3 million to $38.2 million in 2020 from $52.5 million in 2019, primarily from a decrease in cash interest due to lower interest rates. The weighted average interest rates paid on the average principal amount of debt outstanding during 2020 and 2019 was 3.79% and 4.99%, respectively. The weighted average interest rates paid in 2020 compared to 2019 reflect decreases in LIBOR. In November 2019, we reduced the applicable interest rate margins by amending our Senior Secured Credit Facilities.\nDebt related charges included in interest expense were $4.8 million for 2020 compared to $7.8 million for 2019. The decrease in debt related charges during 2020 compared to 2019 is primarily attributable to lower accelerated write-offs (losses from extinguishment of debt) of debt issuance costs and unamortized discounts related to prepayments of portions of our Term Loan B facility. We recognized losses from extinguishment of debt during 2020 and 2019 of $0.5 million and $2.5 million, respectively.\nAs of December 31, 2020, approximately 27% of our principal amount of debt outstanding was subject to variable rates, in comparison to approximately 20% as of December 31, 2019. We enter into interest rate swap agreements to reduce our exposure to fluctuations in the LIBOR rate. See Note 17 Financial Instruments and Fair Value Measurements\u201d of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Item 8 of this report for additional information pertaining to our interest rate swap agreements.\n(Gain) Loss on Equity Investments, Net\nDuring 2020, we realized net gains of $5.3 million on our equity investments compared to net losses of $0.5 million for 2019. Gains and losses on equity investments are generally unpredictable in nature. During 2020 and 2019, we recognized impairment charges of $0.4 million and $1.6 million, respectively, related to investments in our non-marketable equity securities. The residual amounts for 2020 and 2019 relate to our share of equity method investee gains/losses, including unrealized appreciation of the underlying interests of the investee. As of December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, the carrying value of our equity investments were $27.2 million and $22.3 million, respectively. See Note 17 Financial Instruments and Fair Value Measurements\u201d of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Item 8 of this report for further details regarding these investments.\nOther (Income) Loss, Net\nOther (income) loss, net was a loss of $1.5 million during 2020 compared to income of $0.6 million during 2019. Other (income) loss, net primarily comprises gains/losses from the impact of exchange rates on transactions denominated in foreign currencies. Our foreign currency transaction gains/losses are based primarily on fluctuations of the U.S. dollar relative to the Euro, Mexican peso, Uruguayan pesos, Malaysian ringgits, or Israeli shekel.\nThe impact of foreign currency exchange rates on transactions denominated in foreign currencies included in Other (income) loss, net for 2020 and 2019 were losses of $1.6 million and $0.04 million, respectively. We continually monitor our foreign currency exposures and seek to take steps to mitigate these risks. However, fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates could have a significant impact, positive or negative, on our financial results in the future.\n- 37 -\nMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS\nProvision for Income Taxes\nDuring 2020 and 2019, our provision for income taxes was $8.9 million on worldwide pre-tax income of $86.2 million\n(10.4%) and $14.0 million on worldwide pre-tax income of $105.1 million (13.3%), respectively. The stand-alone U.S. component of the effective tax rate for 2020 reflected a $3.1 million provision on $35.3 million of pre-tax book income (8.9%) versus a $5.7 million provision on $40.2 million of pre-tax book income (14.2%) for 2019. The stand-alone International component of the effective tax rate for 2020 reflected a $5.8 million provision on $50.9 million of pre-tax book income (11.4%) versus a $8.3 million provision on $65.0 million of pre-tax book income (12.7%) for 2019.\nThe provision for income taxes for 2020 differs from the U.S. statutory rate due to the following (dollars in thousands):\nTable 37: <table><tr><td>

2020 is lower than our effective tax rate of 13.3% for 2019, primarily due to the beneficial impact of the final Treasury Regulations with respect to the Global Intangible Low-Taxed Income ( GILTI\u201d), Foreign Derived Intangible Income (FDII\u201d) and Foreign Tax Credits that were issued during the third quarter of 2020, producing a non-recurring benefit to our effective tax rate in 2020.\n- 38 -\nMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS\nThe Company's effective tax rate for 2020 differs from the U.S. federal statutory tax rate of 21% due principally to the estimated impact of Federal Tax Credits (including R&D credits and Foreign tax credits), stock based compensation windfalls, and the impact of the Company's earnings realized in foreign jurisdictions with statutory rates that are different than the U.S. federal statutory rate. These benefits are partially offset by the impact of U.S taxes on foreign earnings, including the GILTI provision which requires the Company to include foreign subsidiary earnings in excess of a deemed return on a foreign subsidiary's tangible assets in its U.S. income tax return. The U.S. tax on foreign earnings is reflected net of a statutory deduction of 50% of the GILTI inclusion (subject to limitations based on U.S. taxable income, if any) and net of FDII that provides a 37.5% deduction to domestic companies for certain foreign sales and services income. The primary foreign jurisdictions in which we operate and the statutory tax rate for each respective jurisdiction include Switzerland (22%), Mexico (30%), Uruguay (25%), and Ireland (12.5%). We currently have a tax holiday in Malaysia through April 2023 provided certain conditions continue to be met.\nThere is a potential for volatility of our effective tax rate due to several factors, including changes in the mix of pre-tax income and the jurisdictions to which it relates, business acquisitions, settlements with taxing authorities, changes in tax rates, and foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. In addition, we continue to explore tax planning opportunities that may have a material impact on our effective tax rate.\nWe believe it is reasonably possible that a reduction of approximately $3.4 million of the balance of unrecognized tax benefits may occur within the next twelve months as a result of the lapse of the statute of limitations and/or audit settlements. As of December 31, 2020, approximately $5.5 million of unrecognized tax benefits would favorably impact the effective tax rate (net of federal impact on state issues), if recognized.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nTable 39: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(dollars in thousands) </td> <td>December 31,\n2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>December 31,\n2019 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cash and cash equivalents </td> <td>$ </td> <td>49,206 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>13,535 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Working capital from continuing operations </td> <td>$ </td> <td>256,746 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>236,317 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Current ratio from continuing operations </td> <td>2.64 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2.32 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nCash and cash equivalents at December 31, 2020 increased by $35.7 million from December 31, 2019 primarily as a result of cash generated from operating activities, inclusive of proceeds from the sale of accounts receivable under a supplier financing program, partially offset by purchases of property, plant and equipment and a net reduction of borrowings outstanding on our Senior Secured Credit Facility. The increase in cash and cash equivalents is consistent with our actions to increase liquidity given the uncertainty surrounding the COVID-19 pandemic.\nDuring 2020, we began utilizing supplier financing arrangements with financial institutions to sell certain accounts receivable on a non-recourse basis. These transactions are treated as a sale of, and are accounted for as a reduction to, accounts receivable. The agreement transfers control and risk related to the receivables to the respective financial institution. We have no continuing involvement in the transferred receivables subsequent to the sale.\nWorking capital increased by $20.4 million from December 31, 2019, primarily due to an increase in cash and cash equivalents supplemented by a decrease in current liabilities primarily from lower purchasing levels in 2020, partially offset by a decrease in accounts receivable from lower sales volume.\nAt December 31, 2020, $12.9 million of our cash and cash equivalents were held by foreign subsidiaries. We intend to limit our distributions from foreign subsidiaries to previously taxed income or current period earnings. If distributions are made utilizing current period earnings, we will record foreign withholding taxes in the period of the distribution.\nSummary of Cash Flow\nThe following cash flow summary information includes cash flows related to discontinued operations (in thousands):\nTable 40: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cash provided by (used in): </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating activities </td> <td>$ </td> <td>181,341 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>165,358 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Investing activities </td> <td>(56,576) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(58,862) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Financing activities </td> <td>(88,578) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(117,926) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Effect of foreign currency exchange rates on cash and cash equivalents </td> <td>(516) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(604) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net change in cash and cash equivalents </td> <td>$ </td> <td>35,671 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(12,034) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\n- 39 -\nMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS\nOperating Activities - During 2020, we generated $181.3 million in cash from operations compared to $165.4 million in 2019. The increase of $15.9 million was due to an an increase of $56.2 million in cash flow provided by working capital, offset by a decrease of $40.3 million in cash net income (net income plus adjustments to reconcile net income to net cash provided by operating activities). The increase in cash from working capital is the result of changes in certain assets and liabilities affecting cash flows, primarily an increase in cash flows from accounts receivable of $45.1 million, which decreased in the current year from lower sales and supplier financing, and inventory of $14.7 million, partially offset by a decrease in cash flows from accounts payable of $10.9 million. The decrease in cash net income is primarily from lower gross profit from sales and gross margin declines partially offset by lower SG&A expenses, interest expense, and income tax expense.\nInvesting Activities - The $2.3 million decrease in net cash used in investing activities was primarily attributable to a decrease in net cash paid for business acquisitions of $9.8 million and decreased purchases of property, plant, and equipment of $1.4 million, partially offset by an increase from the purchase of an intangible asset of $4.6 million in 2020 and lower net cash proceeds from the sale of the AS&O Product Line of $4.7 million in 2019.\nFinancing Activities - Net cash used in financing activities during 2020 was $88.6 million compared to $117.9 million in 2019. Financing activities during 2020 included net payments of $87.5 million related to paying down our debt obligations compared to $116.5 million in 2019. The payments made during 2020 include the utilization of proceeds received in conjunction with the patent litigation judgment during the fourth quarter of 2020.\nCapital Structure - As of December 31, 2020, our capital structure consists of $731.3 million of debt, net of deferred debt issuance costs and unamortized discounts, outstanding under our Senior Secured Credit Facilities and 33 million shares of common stock outstanding. We continue to have access to $193.2 million of borrowing capacity under our Revolving Credit Facility, available for normal course of business and letters of credit. We are also authorized to issue up to 100 million shares of common stock and 100 million shares of preferred stock. As of December 31, 2020, our contractual debt service obligations for 2021, consisting of principal and interest on our outstanding debt, are estimated to be approximately $60 million. Actual principal and interest payments may be higher if, for instance, the applicable interest rates on our Senior Secured Credit Facilities increase, we borrow additional amounts on our Revolving Credit Facility, or we pay principal amounts in excess of the required minimums reflected in the contractual debt service obligations above.\nBased on current expectations, we believe that our projected cash flows provided by operations, available cash and cash equivalents and borrowings under our Revolving Credit Facility are sufficient to meet our working capital, debt service and capital expenditure requirements for the next twelve months. If our future financing needs increase, we may need to arrange additional debt or equity financing. We continually evaluate and consider various financing alternatives to enhance or supplement our existing financial resources, including our Senior Secured Credit Facilities. However, we cannot be assured that we will be able to enter into any such arrangements on acceptable terms or at all. In addition, the recent COVID-19 pandemic, which has caused disruption in the capital markets, could make any such financing more difficult and/or expensive.\nCredit Facilities - As of December 31, 2020, we had senior secured credit facilities (the Senior Secured Credit Facilities\u201d) that consist of (i) a $200 million revolving credit facility (the Revolving Credit Facility\u201d), which had available borrowing capacity of $193.2 million as of December 31, 2020, (ii) a term loan A facility (the TLA Facility\u201d) with outstanding principal balance of $230 million, and (iii) a term loan B facility (the TLB Facility\u201d) with outstanding principal balance of $508 million. The Senior Secured Credit Facilities will mature on October 27, 2022. The Senior Secured Credit Facilities include a mandatory prepayment provision customary for credit facilities of its nature.\nThe Revolving Credit Facility and TLA Facility contain covenants requiring (A) a maximum total net leverage ratio of 4.75:1.00 subject to a step down to 4.50 to 1.00 for the third fiscal quarter of 2021, and reverting to and remaining at 4.00 to 1.00 beginning with the fourth quarter of 2021 through maturity, and (B) a minimum interest coverage ratio of adjusted EBITDA (as defined in the Senior Secured Credit Facilities) to interest expense of 3.0:1.0. Additionally, the total net leverage ratio can be increased by 0.50 for up to four consecutive quarters commencing in any fiscal quarter in which we consummate an Eligible Adjustment Acquisition (as defined in the Amendment) with a $40 million or greater purchase price. As of December 31, 2020, the Company was in compliance with these financial covenants. The TLB Facility does not contain any financial maintenance covenants. As of December 31, 2020, our total net leverage ratio, calculated in accordance with our Senior Secured Credit Facilities agreement, was approximately 3.2 to 1.0. For the twelve month period ended December 31, 2020, our ratio of adjusted EBITDA to interest expense, calculated in accordance with our Senior Secured Credit Facilities agreement, was approximately 6.5 to 1.0.\n- 40 -\nMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS\nFailure to comply with these financial covenants would result in an event of default as defined under the Revolving Credit Facility and TLA Facility unless waived by the lenders. An event of default may result in the acceleration of our indebtedness. As a result, management believes that compliance with these covenants is material to us. As of December 31, 2020, our adjusted EBITDA would have to decline by approximately $70 million, or approximately 32%, for us to not be in compliance with our financial covenants. The Revolving Credit Facility is supported by a consortium of twelve lenders with no lender controlling more than 27% of the facility.\nRefer to Note 8 Debt\u201d of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Item 8 of this report for further description of our outstanding debt.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe have no off-balance sheet arrangements within the meaning of Item 303(a)(4) of Regulation S-K.\nContractual Obligations\nPresented below is a summary of contractual obligations and other minimum commitments as of December 31, 2020.

Refer to Note 12 Income Taxes\u201d of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this report for additional information about these unrecognized tax benefits.\nImpact of Recently Issued Accounting Standards\nIn the normal course of business, we evaluate all new accounting pronouncements issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB\u201d), SEC, or other authoritative accounting bodies to determine the potential impact they may have on our Consolidated Financial Statements. Refer to Note 1 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\u201d of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Item 8 of this report for additional information about these recently issued accounting standards and their potential impact on our financial condition or results of operations.\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES\nManagement's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. We make estimates and assumptions in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, revenue and expenses and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. We base our estimates and judgments upon historical experience and other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Changes in estimates or assumptions could result in a material adjustment to the consolidated financial statements.\n- 41 -\nMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS\nWe have identified several critical accounting estimates. An accounting estimate is considered critical if both: (a) the nature of the estimates or assumptions is material due to the levels of subjectivity and judgment involved, and (b) the impact of changes in the estimates and assumptions would have a material effect on the consolidated financial statements. This listing is not a comprehensive list of all of our accounting policies. For further information regarding the application of these and other accounting policies, see Note 1 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\u201d of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Item 8 of this report.\nInventories\nInventories are measured on a first-in, first-out basis at the lower of cost or net realizable value. Net realizable value is the estimated selling prices in the ordinary course of business, less reasonably predictable costs of completion, disposal, and transportation. The valuation of inventory requires us to estimate obsolete or excess inventory, as well as inventory that is not of saleable quality.\nHistorically, our inventory adjustment has been adequate to cover our losses. However, variations in methods or assumptions could have a material impact on our results. If our demand forecast for specific products is greater than actual demand and we fail to reduce manufacturing output accordingly, we could be required to record additional inventory write-down or expense a greater amount of overhead costs, which would negatively impact our net income.\nValuation of Goodwill and Intangible Assets\nWe make assumptions in establishing the carrying value, fair value and, if applicable, the estimated lives of our goodwill, intangible and other long-lived assets. Goodwill and intangible assets determined to have an indefinite useful life are not amortized. Instead, these assets are evaluated for impairment on an annual basis on the last day of our fiscal year and whenever events or business conditions change that could indicate that the asset is impaired. Long-lived assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset (asset group) may not be recoverable.\nEvaluation of goodwill for impairment\nWe test each reporting unit's goodwill for impairment on the last day of our fiscal year and between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more-likely-than-not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value. In conducting this annual impairment testing, we may first perform a qualitative assessment of whether it is more-likely-than-not that a reporting unit's fair value is less than its carrying value. If not, no further goodwill impairment testing is required. If it is more-likely-than-not that a reporting unit's fair value is less than its carrying value, or if we elect not to perform a qualitative assessment of a reporting unit, a quantitative analysis is performed, in which the fair value of the reporting unit is compared to its carrying value. If the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, an impairment loss is recognized equal to the excess, limited to the amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit.\nIn the first quarter of 2020, a trigger event was identified as a result of the collapse in the demand for oil caused by this unprecedented global health and economic crisis, coupled with oil oversupply, and adversely impacted the demand for products in the Company's Non-Medical reportable segment. The Company performed a quantitative analysis to test goodwill for impairment as of April 3, 2020. The fair value of the Non-Medical reporting unit exceeded its carrying amount as of April 3, 2020.\nWe performed a qualitative assessment of our Medical reporting unit as of December 31, 2020. As part of this analysis, we evaluated factors including, but not limited to, our market capitalization and stock price performance, macro-economic conditions, market and industry conditions, cost factors, the competitive environment, and the operational stability and overall financial performance of the reporting unit. The assessment indicated that it was more likely than not that the fair value of the Medical reporting unit exceeded its carrying value.\nWe elected to bypass the qualitative assessment and performed a quantitative analysis for our Non-Medical reporting unit. Resulting from the quantitative analysis, the fair value exceeded the carrying value of the Non-Medical reporting unit by approximately 85%. We do not believe that any of our reporting units are at risk for impairment. However, changes to the factors considered above could affect the estimated fair value of one or more of our reporting units and could result in a goodwill impairment charge in a future period. We may be unaware of one or more significant factors that, if we had been aware of, would cause our conclusion to change, which could result in a goodwill impairment charge in a future period.\n- 42 -\nMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS\nEvaluation of indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment\nOur indefinite-lived intangible assets include the Greatbatch Medical and Lake Region Medical tradenames. Similar to goodwill, we perform an annual impairment review of our indefinite-lived intangible assets on the last day of our fiscal year, unless events occur that trigger the need for an interim impairment review. We have the option to first assess qualitative factors in determining whether it is more-likely-than-not that an indefinite-lived intangible asset is impaired. If we elect not to use this option, or we determine that it is more-likely-than-not that the asset is impaired, we perform a quantitative assessment that requires us to estimate the fair value of each indefinite-lived intangible asset and compare that amount to its carrying value. Fair value is estimated using the relief-from-royalty method. Significant assumptions inherent in this methodology include estimates of royalty rates and discount rates. The discount rate applied is based on the risk inherent in the respective intangible assets and royalty rates are based on the rates at which comparable tradenames are being licensed in the marketplace. Impairment, if any, is based on the excess of the carrying value over the fair value of these assets.\nWe performed a quantitative assessment to test our indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment as of December 31, 2020. For the Greatbatch Medical tradename, the excess of the estimated fair value over carrying value (expressed as a percentage of carrying value) was in excess of its carrying value of $20 million by approximately 278% as of December 31, 2020. The Lake Region Medical tradename had an excess of the estimated fair value over carrying value of approximately 43% and a carrying value of $70 million at December 31, 2020. We do not believe that our indefinite-lived intangible assets are at risk for impairment. However, a significant increase in the discount rate, decrease in the terminal growth rate, increase in tax rates, decrease in the royalty rate or substantial reductions in our end-markets and volume assumptions could have a negative impact on the estimated fair values of either of our tradenames and require us to recognize impairments of these indefinite-lived intangible assets in a future period.\nEvaluation of long-lived assets for impairment\nWhen impairment indicators exist, we determine if the carrying value of the long-lived asset(s) or definite-lived intangible asset(s) exceeds the related undiscounted future cash flows. In cases where the carrying value exceeds the undiscounted future cash flows, the carrying value is written down to fair value. Fair value is generally determined using a discounted cash flow analysis. When it is determined that the useful life of an asset (asset group) is shorter than the originally estimated life, and there are sufficient cash flows to support the carrying value of the asset (asset group), we accelerate the rate of depreciation/amortization in order to fully depreciate/amortize the asset over its shorter useful life.\nEstimation of the cash flows and useful lives of long-lived assets and definite-lived intangible assets requires significant management judgment. Events could occur that would materially affect our estimates and assumptions. Unforeseen changes, such as the loss of one or more significant customers, technology obsolescence, or significant manufacturing disruption, among other factors, could substantially alter the assumptions regarding the ability to realize the return of our investment in long-lived assets, definite-lived intangible assets or their estimated useful lives.\n- 43 -\nTable 42: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> </tr>\n</table>", "item_7_truncated": "ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF\nOPERATIONS\n \nThe following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read together with our selected financial data and our consolidated financial statements and the related notes appearing elsewhere in this report.\nThis discussion and analysis contains forward-looking statements that involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions.

We also develop batteries for high-end niche applications in the non-medical energy, military, and environmental markets. Our vision is to enhance the lives of patients worldwide by being our customers' partner of choice for innovative technologies and services.\nWe organize our business into two reportable segments, Medical and Non-Medical, and derive our revenues from four principle product lines. The Medical segment includes the Cardio & Vascular, Cardiac & Neuromodulation and Advanced Surgical, Orthopedics & Portable Medical product lines and the Non-Medical segment comprises the Electrochem product line. For more information on our segments, please refer to Note 18 Segment and Geographic Information\u201d of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Item 8 of this report.\nImpact of COVID-19\nBeginning in early March 2020, the global spread of the novel coronavirus ( COVID-19\u201d) created significant uncertainty and worldwide economic disruption. Specific impacts to our business include delayed or reduced customer orders and sales, restrictions on our associates' ability to travel or work, delays in shipments to and from certain countries, and disruptions in our supply chain. The extent to which COVID-19 impacts our operations will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain, including, among others, the duration of the outbreak, new information that may emerge concerning the severity of COVID-19 and the actions, especially those taken by governmental authorities, to contain the pandemic or treat its impact. As pandemic-related events continue to evolve, additional impacts may arise that we are not aware of currently. Any prolonged material disruption of our associates, suppliers, manufacturing, or customers could materially impact our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows.\n- 29 -\nMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS\nRecent Business Acquisitions\nOn February 19, 2020, we acquired certain assets and liabilities of InoMec Ltd. ( InoMec\u201d), a privately-held company based in Israel that specializes in the research, development and manufacturing of medical devices, including minimally invasive tools, delivery systems, tubing and catheters, surgery tools, drug-device combination, laser combined devices, and tooling and production. The acquisition enables us to create a research and development center in Israel, closer to the customer base in the region.\nIn October 2019, we purchased certain assets and liabilities of US BioDesign, LLC ( USB\u201d), a privately-held developer and manufacturer of complex braided biomedical structures for disposable and implantable medical devices. The acquisition added a differentiated capability related to the development and manufacture of complex braided and formed biomedical structures to our broad portfolio, that we believe further positions us as a partner of choice for innovative medical technologies.\nDiscontinued Operations and Divestiture\nIn July 2018, we completed the sale of the AS&O Product Line for net cash proceeds of approximately $581 million. In connection with the sale, the parties executed a transition services agreement whereby we provided certain corporate services (including accounting, payroll, and information technology services) to Viant to facilitate an orderly transfer of business operations. Viant paid us for these services as specified in the transition services agreement, which were complete as of June 28, 2019. In addition, the parties executed long-term supply agreements under which the parties have agreed to supply the other with certain products at prices specified in the agreements for a term of three years.\nIn connection with the closing of the transaction but prior to a net working capital adjustment, we recognized a pre-tax gain on sale of discontinued operations of $195.0 million during the year ended December 28, 2018. During 2019, we received, and recognized as gain on sale from discontinued operations, $4.8 million due to the final net working capital adjustment agreed to with Viant.\nThe results of operations of the AS&O Product Line have been classified as discontinued operations for all periods presented. Prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to the continuing operations reporting presentation. All results and information presented exclude the AS&O Product Line unless otherwise noted.\nRefer to Note 2 Business Acquisitions, Divestiture and Discontinued Operations\u201d of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Item 8 of this report for additional information about the acquisition of certain assets of InoMec and USB and the divestiture of the AS&O Product Line.\nPatent Litigation\nIn April 2013, we commenced an action against a competitor alleging they had infringed on the our patents by manufacturing and selling filtered feedthrough assemblies used in implantable pacemakers and cardioverter defibrillators that incorporate our patented technology.\nFollowing four trials and an appeal, the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit affirmed, in all respects, a judgment in our favor. We received proceeds related to the judgment of $28.9 million in October 2020, and after recognizing certain related expenses, recognized a net gain of $28.2 million, which is recorded in Selling, general and administrative expenses. The proceeds were used to pay down a portion of our Revolving Credit Facility.\nRefer to Note 13 Commitments and Contingencies\u201d of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Item 8 of this report for additional information on this matter.\n- 30 -\nMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS\nStrategic Overview\nWe continue to take steps to better align our resources in order to invest to grow and protect, and preserve our portfolio of products. In addition to our portfolio strategy, we continue to execute our six key operational strategic imperatives designed to drive excellence in everything we do:\n\u2022Sales Force Excellence: We have changed the organizational structure to match product line growth strategies and customer needs. This change is about getting more out of the capabilities we already have, and has increased individual accountability and clarity of ownership, while serving customers more effectively.\n\u2022Market Focused Innovation: We are ensuring we get the most return on our research and development investments. We are focused on having a clear picture of how we spend our money so we can increase investments to drive future growth.\n\u2022Manufacturing Excellence: The goal is to deliver world-class operational performance in the areas of safety, quality, delivery and overall efficiency. We want to transition our manufacturing into a competitive advantage through a single, enterprise-wide manufacturing structure known as the Integer Production System. This system will provide standardized systems and processes by leveraging best practices and applying them across all of our global sites.\n\u2022Business Process Excellence: We are taking a systematic approach to driving excellence in everything we do by standardizing, optimizing and ultimately sustaining all of our processes.\n\u2022Leadership Capability: We have a robust plan to make leadership a competitive advantage for us, and as the success rate is higher with internal hires, we are focusing on finding and developing leaders from within the Company to build critical capabilities for future success.\n\u2022Performance Excellence: We are raising the bar on associate performance to maximize our impact. This includes aligning key roles with critical capabilities, positioning the best talent against the biggest work, and putting tools and processes in place to provide higher financial rewards for top performers, so our top performers can see increased results in pay for increased results in their performance.\nWe believe we are well-positioned within the medical technology and MDO manufacturing market and that there is a robust pipeline of opportunities to pursue. We have expanded our medical device capabilities and are excited about opportunities to partner with customers to drive innovation. We believe we have the scale and global presence, supported by world-class manufacturing and quality capabilities, to capture these opportunities. We are confident in our capabilities as one of the largest MDO manufacturers, with a long history of successfully integrating companies, driving down costs and growing revenues over the long-term. Ultimately, our strategic vision is to drive shareholder value by enhancing the lives of patients worldwide by being our customers' partner of choice for innovative technologies and services.\nFinancial Overview\nFiscal 2020 Compared with Fiscal 2019\nIncome from continuing operations for 2020 was $77.3 million or $2.33 per diluted share compared to $91.2 million or $2.76 per diluted share for 2019. These variances are primarily the result of the following:\n\u2022Sales from continuing operations for 2020 decreased 15% primarily due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\u2022Gross profit for 2020 decreased $69.3 million or 20%, primarily from a decrease in sales volume, price reductions to our customers, and a loss in volume leverage, which resulted from our sales decrease, partially offset by 2019 charges associated with a customer bankruptcy (see Customer Bankruptcy under Our Financial Results below).\n\u2022Operating expenses for 2020 decreased by $32.3 million compared to 2019, due to decreases of $29.7 million in SG&A expenses and $4.5 million in Other operating expenses, partially offset by a $1.9 million increase in RD&E expenses. Included in SG&A expenses for 2020 is a net gain of $28.2 million recognized in connection with a previously mentioned patent litigation judgment.\n\u2022Interest expense for 2020 decreased by $14.3 million primarily due to lower interest rates and lower outstanding debt balances.\n\u2022We recognized a net gain on equity investments of $5.3 million in 2020, compared to a net loss on equity investments of $0.5 million during 2019. Gains and losses on equity investments are generally unpredictable in nature.\n\u2022Other loss, net for 2020 was $1.5 million compared to other income, net of $0.6 million during 2019, primarily due to fluctuations in foreign currency gains and losses in the respective periods.\n\u2022We recorded provisions for income taxes of $8.9 million and $14.0 million for 2020 and 2019, respectively. The decrease in provision for income taxes is primarily due to our decrease in pre-tax income and the beneficial impact of the final Treasury Regulations issued in 2020.\n- 31 -\nMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS\nFiscal 2019 Compared with Fiscal 2018\nIncome from continuing operations for 2019 was $91.2 million or $2.76 per diluted share compared to $47.0 million or $1.44 per diluted share for 2018. These variances are primarily the result of the following:\n\u2022Sales from continuing operations for 2019 increased 4% primarily driven by growth in Cardio & Vascular and Cardiac & Neuromodulation sales.\n\u2022Gross profit for 2019 decreased $7.7 million, primarily due to higher costs of sales due to inventory write-downs and other expenses totaling $21.4 million related to a customer who filed bankruptcy in 2019 (see Customer Bankruptcy\u201d), partially offset by a $43.1 million increase in sales from continuing operations.\n\u2022Operating expenses for 2019 decreased by 5% compared to 2018, due to decreases of $3.7 million in SG&A expenses, $2.1 million in RD&E expenses and $3.9 million in Other operating expenses.\n\u2022Interest expense for 2019 decreased by $46.8 million primarily due to lower outstanding debt balances due to the repayment of debt over the last year and extinguishment of debt charges included in 2018 related to the repayment of indebtedness in connection with the divestiture of the AS&O Product Line. Debt extinguishment expenses included in Interest expense for 2019 were lower by $40.1 million compared to 2018.\n\u2022We recognized a net loss on equity investments of $0.5 million in 2019, compared to a net gain on equity investments of $5.6 million during 2018. Gains and losses on equity investments are generally unpredictable in nature.\n\u2022Other income, net for 2019 was $0.6 million compared to other loss, net of $0.8 million during 2018, primarily due to foreign currency gains in 2019 compared to foreign currency losses in 2018.\n\u2022We recorded an income tax provision of $14.0 million for 2019, compared to a provision of $14.1 million for 2018.\n- 32 -\nMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS\nOur Financial Results\nThe following table presents selected financial information derived from our Consolidated Financial Statements, contained in

Bankruptcy Court for the Eastern District of Texas seeking relief under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. During 2020 and 2019, we recorded pre-tax charges totaling $1.2 million and $24.2 million, respectively, in connection with the bankruptcy. These charges were primarily non-cash and were associated with certain Nuvectra-related assets, primarily consisting of inventory, accounts receivable, as well as certain non-cancelable inventory commitments. The charges for 2020 were included in Cost of sales ($1.1 million) and SG&A expenses ($0.1 million). The charges for 2019 were included in Cost of sales ($21.4 million), SG&A expenses ($2.4 million) and Other operating expenses ($0.4 million).\n- 33 -\nMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS\nThe following discussion is a comparison between fiscal year 2020 and fiscal year 2019 results.

The most significant drivers of this decrease were as follows:\nCardio & Vascular sales for 2020 decreased $40.1 million or 7% in comparison to 2019. Cardio & Vascular sales were negatively impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic and a blend of our customers' responses across nearly all Cardio & Vascular markets. During 2020, price reductions reduced Cardio & Vascular sales by $7.1 million in comparison to 2019. Foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations and acquisitions of USB and Inomec increased Cardio & Vascular sales for 2020 by $0.8 million and $7.9 million, respectively, in comparison to 2019.\nCardiac & Neuromodulation sales for 2020 decreased $111.0 million or 24% in comparison to 2019. Cardiac & Neuromodulation sales were negatively impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic and a blend of our customers' responses. Additionally, the Nuvectra bankruptcy created a headwind of $16.7 million for the 2020 fiscal year. During 2020, price reductions reduced Cardiac & Neuromodulation sales by approximately $10.7 million in comparison to 2019. Foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations and acquisitions did not have a material impact on Cardiac & Neuromodulation sales during 2020 in comparison to 2019.\nAdvanced Surgical, Orthopedic & Portable Medical includes sales to the acquirer of our AS&O Product Lines, Viant, under the LSA for the sale of products by the Company to Viant. Advanced Surgical, Orthopedics & Portable Medical sales for 2020 decreased by $10.6 million in comparison to 2019, driven by the impact of COVID-19 and a blend of our customers' responses. Price reductions reduced Advanced Surgical, Orthopedic & Portable Medical sales by $1.4 million in comparison to 2019. Foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations and acquisitions did not have a material impact on Advanced Surgical, Orthopedic & Portable Medical sales during 2020 in comparison to 2019.\nNon-Medical sales for 2020 decreased $23.0 million or 39% in comparison to 2019. The decreases in Non-Medical sales were primarily driven by a severe decline in the energy market and demand fall-out from the COVID-19 pandemic. Price and foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations did not have a material impact on Non-Medical sales during 2020 in comparison to 2019.\n- 34 -\nMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS\nGross Profit\nChanges to gross profit as a percentage of sales ( Gross Margin\u201d) from the prior year were due to the following:\nTable 34: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>% Change </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>2020 vs. 2019 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Price(a)\n</td> <td>(1.3) </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Mix(b)\n</td> <td>(0.6) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Volume Leverage(c)\n</td> <td>(1.3) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Customer Bankruptcy(d)\n</td> <td>1.6 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total percentage point change to gross profit as a percentage of sales </td> <td>(1.6) </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table>\n__________\n(a)Our Gross Margin for 2020 was negatively impacted by price reductions given to our larger OEM customers in return for long-term volume commitments.\n(b)Amount represents the impact to our Gross Margin attributable to changes in the mix of product sales during the period.\n(c)Our gross margin for 2020 was negatively impacted by lower sales from the COVID-19 pandemic. Given our indirect labor and overhead costs are less variable, and in most cases fixed, the resulting reduction in sales negatively impacted gross margin. However, we continue to execute on our Manufacturing Excellence strategic imperative and maintain our facility infrastructure as we expect the sales decline to be temporary.\n(d)Amount represents the impact to our Gross Margin attributable to the Customer Bankruptcy.\nSG&A Expenses\nChanges to SG&A expenses were primarily due to the following (in thousands):\nTable 35: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>$ Change </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>2020 vs. 2019 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Customer Bankruptcy(a)\n</td> <td>$ </td> <td>(2,274) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Transition services agreement(b)\n</td> <td>2,733 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Patent litigation gain, net(c)\n</td> <td>(28,167) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>All other SG&A, net(d)\n</td> <td>(1,981) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net decrease in SG&A Expenses </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(29,689) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\n__________\n(a)Amount consists primarily of a $2.3 million reserve against outstanding receivables recorded during 2019 attributable to the Customer Bankruptcy.\n(b)Represents the amount included in SG&A expenses which was billed to Viant for transition services during 2019. We executed a transition services agreement in conjunction with the sale of the AS&O Product Line, whereby we agreed to provide certain corporate services (including accounting, payroll, and information technology services) to Viant to facilitate an orderly transfer of business operations. This provision of services under the agreement was completed during the second quarter of 2019.\n(c)We recognized a net gain of $28.2 million during 2020 related to a patent litigation judgment. Refer to Note 13 Commitments and Contingencies\u201d of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Item 8 of this report for additional information on this matter.\n(d)The net decrease in all other SG&A expenses for 2020 compared to 2019 is primarily attributable to lower compensation and benefits cost, travel related expenses and depreciation expense, partially offset by an increase in amortization expense.\nRD&E Expenses\nRD&E expenses for 2020 and 2019 were $48.5 million and $46.5 million, respectively. The increase in RD&E expenses for 2020 compared to 2019 is primarily attributable to increased compensation and benefits costs, consistent with our strategy to invest in capabilities for growth. RD&E expenses are influenced by the number and timing of in-process projects and labor hours and other costs associated with these projects. Our research and development initiatives continue to emphasize new product development, product improvements, and the development of new technological platform innovations.\n- 35 -\nMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS\nOther Operating Expenses\nOOE comprises the following for 2020 and 2019 (in thousands):\nTable 36: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>Change </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operational excellence(a)\n</td> <td>$ </td> <td>2,791 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2,791 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Strategic reorganization and alignment(b)\n</td> <td>686 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5,812 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(5,126) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Manufacturing alignment to support growth(c)\n</td> <td>241 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,145 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(1,904) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Acquisition and integration costs(d)\n</td> <td>(776) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>377 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(1,153) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other general expenses(e)\n</td> <td>4,679 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3,817 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>862 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other operating expenses </td> <td>$ </td> <td>7,621 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>12,151 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(4,530) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\n__________\n(a)These projects focus on changing our organizational structure to match product line growth strategies and customer needs, transitioning our manufacturing process into a competitive advantage and standardizing and optimizing our business processes. Costs related to our 2020 initiatives mainly include termination benefits.\n(b)As a result of the strategic review of our customers, competitors and markets, we began taking steps in 2017 to better align our resources to enhance the profitability of our portfolio of products. These initiatives primarily included aligning resources with our strategic direction, improving profitability to invest in accelerated growth and the expansion of a facility. Costs related to these initiatives mainly included termination benefits and fees for professional services. These actions were completed during 2020.\n(c)In 2017, we commenced several initiatives designed to reduce costs, increase manufacturing capacity to accommodate growth and improve operating efficiencies. The plan involved the relocation of certain manufacturing operations and expansion of certain of our facilities. These actions were completed during 2020.\n(d)Amounts include expenses related to the purchase of certain assets and liabilities from InoMec and USB. The 2020 amount also includes a $2.0 million adjustment to reduce the fair value of acquisition-related contingent consideration liabilities. See Note 17 Financial Instruments and Fair Value Measurements\u201d of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Item 8 of this report for additional information related to the fair value measurement of the contingent consideration.\n(e)Amounts include expenses related to other initiatives not described above, which relate primarily to actions to align labor with customer demand as a result of COVID-19 and the decline of the energy market and integration and operational initiatives to reduce future costs and improve efficiencies. The 2020 and 2019 amounts primarily include severance, information technology systems conversion expenses, expenses incurred in connection with the Customer Bankruptcy, and expenses related to the restructuring of certain legal entities of the Company.\nRefer to Note 11 Other Operating Expenses\u201d of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Item 8 of this report for additional information regarding these initiatives.\n- 36 -\nMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS\nInterest Expense\nInterest expense consists primarily of cash interest and debt related charges, such as amortization of debt issuance costs and original issue discount. Interest expense decreased $14.3 million to $38.2 million in 2020 from $52.5 million in 2019, primarily from a decrease in cash interest due to lower interest rates. The weighted average interest rates paid on the average principal amount of debt outstanding during 2020 and 2019 was 3.79% and 4.99%, respectively. The weighted average interest rates paid in 2020 compared to 2019 reflect decreases in LIBOR. In November 2019, we reduced the applicable interest rate margins by amending our Senior Secured Credit Facilities.\nDebt related charges included in interest expense were $4.8 million for 2020 compared to $7.8 million for 2019. The decrease in debt related charges during 2020 compared to 2019 is primarily attributable to lower accelerated write-offs (losses from extinguishment of debt) of debt issuance costs and unamortized discounts related to prepayments of portions of our Term Loan B facility. We recognized losses from extinguishment of debt during 2020 and 2019 of $0.5 million and $2.5 million, respectively.\nAs of December 31, 2020, approximately 27% of our principal amount of debt outstanding was subject to variable rates, in comparison to approximately 20% as of December 31, 2019. We enter into interest rate swap agreements to reduce our exposure to fluctuations in the LIBOR rate. See Note 17 Financial Instruments and Fair Value Measurements\u201d of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Item 8 of this report for additional information pertaining to our interest rate swap agreements.\n(Gain) Loss on Equity Investments, Net\nDuring 2020, we realized net gains of $5.3 million on our equity investments compared to net losses of $0.5 million for 2019. Gains and losses on equity investments are generally unpredictable in nature. During 2020 and 2019, we recognized impairment charges of $0.4 million and $1.6 million, respectively, related to investments in our non-marketable equity securities. The residual amounts for 2020 and 2019 relate to our share of equity method investee gains/losses, including unrealized appreciation of the underlying interests of the investee. As of December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, the carrying value of our equity investments were $27.2 million and $22.3 million, respectively. See Note 17 Financial Instruments and Fair Value Measurements\u201d of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Item 8 of this report for further details regarding these investments.\nOther (Income) Loss, Net\nOther (income) loss, net was a loss of $1.5 million during 2020 compared to income of $0.6 million during 2019. Other (income) loss, net primarily comprises gains/losses from the impact of exchange rates on transactions denominated in foreign currencies. Our foreign currency transaction gains/losses are based primarily on fluctuations of the U.S. dollar relative to the Euro, Mexican peso, Uruguayan pesos, Malaysian ringgits, or Israeli shekel.\nThe impact of foreign currency exchange rates on transactions denominated in foreign currencies included in Other (income) loss, net for 2020 and 2019 were losses of $1.6 million and $0.04 million, respectively. We continually monitor our foreign currency exposures and seek to take steps to mitigate these risks. However, fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates could have a significant impact, positive or negative, on our financial results in the future.\n- 37 -\nMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS\nProvision for Income Taxes\nDuring 2020 and 2019, our provision for income taxes was $8.9 million on worldwide pre-tax income of $86.2 million\n(10.4%) and $14.0 million on worldwide pre-tax income of $105.1 million (13.3%), respectively. The stand-alone U.S. component of the effective tax rate for 2020 reflected a $3.1 million provision on $35.3 million of pre-tax book income (8.9%) versus a $5.7 million provision on $40.2 million of pre-tax book income (14.2%) for 2019. The stand-alone International component of the effective tax rate for 2020 reflected a $5.8 million provision on $50.9 million of pre-tax book income (11.4%) versus a $8.3 million provision on $65.0 million of pre-tax book income (12.7%) for 2019.\nThe provision for income taxes for 2020 differs from the U.S. statutory rate due to the following (dollars in thousands):\nTable 37: <table><tr><td>

2020 is lower than our effective tax rate of 13.3% for 2019, primarily due to the beneficial impact of the final Treasury Regulations with respect to the Global Intangible Low-Taxed Income ( GILTI\u201d), Foreign Derived Intangible Income (FDII\u201d) and Foreign Tax Credits that were issued during the third quarter of 2020, producing a non-recurring benefit to our effective tax rate in 2020.\n- 38 -\nMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS\nThe Company's effective tax rate for 2020 differs from the U.S. federal statutory tax rate of 21% due principally to the estimated impact of Federal Tax Credits (including R&D credits and Foreign tax credits), stock based compensation windfalls, and the impact of the Company's earnings realized in foreign jurisdictions with statutory rates that are different than the U.S. federal statutory rate. These benefits are partially offset by the impact of U.S taxes on foreign earnings, including the GILTI provision which requires the Company to include foreign subsidiary earnings in excess of a deemed return on a foreign subsidiary's tangible assets in its U.S. income tax return. The U.S. tax on foreign earnings is reflected net of a statutory deduction of 50% of the GILTI inclusion (subject to limitations based on U.S. taxable income, if any) and net of FDII that provides a 37.5% deduction to domestic companies for certain foreign sales and services income. The primary foreign jurisdictions in which we operate and the statutory tax rate for each respective jurisdiction include Switzerland (22%), Mexico (30%), Uruguay (25%), and Ireland (12.5%). We currently have a tax holiday in Malaysia through April 2023 provided certain conditions continue to be met.\nThere is a potential for volatility of our effective tax rate due to several factors, including changes in the mix of pre-tax income and the jurisdictions to which it relates, business acquisitions, settlements with taxing authorities, changes in tax rates, and foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. In addition, we continue to explore tax planning opportunities that may have a material impact on our effective tax rate.\nWe believe it is reasonably possible that a reduction of approximately $3.4 million of the balance of unrecognized tax benefits may occur within the next twelve months as a result of the lapse of the statute of limitations and/or audit settlements. As of December 31, 2020, approximately $5.5 million of unrecognized tax benefits would favorably impact the effective tax rate (net of federal impact on state issues), if recognized.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nTable 39: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(dollars in thousands) </td> <td>December 31,\n2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>December 31,\n2019 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cash and cash equivalents </td> <td>$ </td> <td>49,206 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>13,535 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Working capital from continuing operations </td> <td>$ </td> <td>256,746 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>236,317 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Current ratio from continuing operations </td> <td>2.64 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2.32 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nCash and cash equivalents at December 31, 2020 increased by $35.7 million from December 31, 2019 primarily as a result of cash generated from operating activities, inclusive of proceeds from the sale of accounts receivable under a supplier financing program, partially offset by purchases of property, plant and equipment and a net reduction of borrowings outstanding on our Senior Secured Credit Facility. The increase in cash and cash equivalents is consistent with our actions to increase liquidity given the uncertainty surrounding the COVID-19 pandemic.\nDuring 2020, we began utilizing supplier financing arrangements with financial institutions to sell certain accounts receivable on a non-recourse basis. These transactions are treated as a sale of, and are accounted for as a reduction to, accounts receivable. The agreement transfers control and risk related to the receivables to the respective financial institution. We have no continuing involvement in the transferred receivables subsequent to the sale.\nWorking capital increased by $20.4 million from December 31, 2019, primarily due to an increase in cash and cash equivalents supplemented by a decrease in current liabilities primarily from lower purchasing levels in 2020, partially offset by a decrease in accounts receivable from lower sales volume.\nAt December 31, 2020, $12.9 million of our cash and cash equivalents were held by foreign subsidiaries. We intend to limit our distributions from foreign subsidiaries to previously taxed income or current period earnings. If distributions are made utilizing current period earnings, we will record foreign withholding taxes in the period of the distribution.\nSummary of Cash Flow\nThe following cash flow summary information includes cash flows related to discontinued operations (in thousands):\nTable 40: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cash provided by (used in): </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating activities </td> <td>$ </td> <td>181,341 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>165,358 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Investing activities </td> <td>(56,576) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(58,862) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Financing activities </td> <td>(88,578) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(117,926) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Effect of foreign currency exchange rates on cash and cash equivalents </td> <td>(516) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(604) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net change in cash and cash equivalents </td> <td>$ </td> <td>35,671 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(12,034) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\n- 39 -\nMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS\nOperating Activities - During 2020, we generated $181.3 million in cash from operations compared to $165.4 million in 2019. The increase of $15.9 million was due to an an increase of $56.2 million in cash flow provided by working capital, offset by a decrease of $40.3 million in cash net income (net income plus adjustments to reconcile net income to net cash provided by operating activities). The increase in cash from working capital is the result of changes in certain assets and liabilities affecting cash flows, primarily an increase in cash flows from accounts receivable of $45.1 million, which decreased in the current year from lower sales and supplier financing, and inventory of $14.7 million, partially offset by a decrease in cash flows from accounts payable of $10.9 million. The decrease in cash net income is primarily from lower gross profit from sales and gross margin declines partially offset by lower SG&A expenses, interest expense, and income tax expense.\nInvesting Activities - The $2.3 million decrease in net cash used in investing activities was primarily attributable to a decrease in net cash paid for business acquisitions of $9.8 million and decreased purchases of property, plant, and equipment of $1.4 million, partially offset by an increase from the purchase of an intangible asset of $4.6 million in 2020 and lower net cash proceeds from the sale of the AS&O Product Line of $4.7 million in 2019.\nFinancing Activities - Net cash used in financing activities during 2020 was $88.6 million compared to $117.9 million in 2019. Financing activities during 2020 included net payments of $87.5 million related to paying down our debt obligations compared to $116.5 million in 2019. The payments made during 2020 include the utilization of proceeds received in conjunction with the patent litigation judgment during the fourth quarter of 2020.\nCapital Structure - As of December 31, 2020, our capital structure consists of $731.3 million of debt, net of deferred debt issuance costs and unamortized discounts, outstanding under our Senior Secured Credit Facilities and 33 million shares of common stock outstanding. We continue to have access to $193.2 million of borrowing capacity under our Revolving Credit Facility, available for normal course of business and letters of credit. We are also authorized to issue up to 100 million shares of common stock and 100 million shares of preferred stock. As of December 31, 2020, our contractual debt service obligations for 2021, consisting of principal and interest on our outstanding debt, are estimated to be approximately $60 million. Actual principal and interest payments may be higher if, for instance, the applicable interest rates on our Senior Secured Credit Facilities increase, we borrow additional amounts on our Revolving Credit Facility, or we pay principal amounts in excess of the required minimums reflected in the contractual debt service obligations above.\nBased on current expectations, we believe that our projected cash flows provided by operations, available cash and cash equivalents and borrowings under our Revolving Credit Facility are sufficient to meet our working capital, debt service and capital expenditure requirements for the next twelve months. If our future financing needs increase, we may need to arrange additional debt or equity financing. We continually evaluate and consider various financing alternatives to enhance or supplement our existing financial resources, including our Senior Secured Credit Facilities. However, we cannot be assured that we will be able to enter into any such arrangements on acceptable terms or at all. In addition, the recent COVID-19 pandemic, which has caused disruption in the capital markets, could make any such financing more difficult and/or expensive.\nCredit Facilities - As of December 31, 2020, we had senior secured credit facilities (the Senior Secured Credit Facilities\u201d) that consist of (i) a $200 million revolving credit facility (the Revolving Credit Facility\u201d), which had available borrowing capacity of $193.2 million as of December 31, 2020, (ii) a term loan A facility (the TLA Facility\u201d) with outstanding principal balance of $230 million, and (iii) a term loan B facility (the TLB Facility\u201d) with outstanding principal balance of $508 million. The Senior Secured Credit Facilities will mature on October 27, 2022. The Senior Secured Credit Facilities include a mandatory prepayment provision customary for credit facilities of its nature.\nThe Revolving Credit Facility and TLA Facility contain covenants requiring (A) a maximum total net leverage ratio of 4.75:1.00 subject to a step down to 4.50 to 1.00 for the third fiscal quarter of 2021, and reverting to and remaining at 4.00 to 1.00 beginning with the fourth quarter of 2021 through maturity, and (B) a minimum interest coverage ratio of adjusted EBITDA (as defined in the Senior Secured Credit Facilities) to interest expense of 3.0:1.0. Additionally, the total net leverage ratio can be increased by 0.50 for up to four consecutive quarters commencing in any fiscal quarter in which we consummate an Eligible Adjustment Acquisition (as defined in the Amendment) with a $40 million or greater purchase price. As of December 31, 2020, the Company was in compliance with these financial covenants. The TLB Facility does not contain any financial maintenance covenants. As of December 31, 2020, our total net leverage ratio, calculated in accordance with our Senior Secured Credit Facilities agreement, was approximately 3.2 to 1.0. For the twelve month period ended December 31, 2020, our ratio of adjusted EBITDA to interest expense, calculated in accordance with our Senior Secured Credit Facilities agreement, was approximately 6.5 to 1.0.\n- 40 -\nMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS\nFailure to comply with these financial covenants would result in an event of default as defined under the Revolving Credit Facility and TLA Facility unless waived by the lenders. An event of default may result in the acceleration of our indebtedness. As a result, management believes that compliance with these covenants is material to us. As of December 31, 2020, our adjusted EBITDA would have to decline by approximately $70 million, or approximately 32%, for us to not be in compliance with our financial covenants. The Revolving Credit Facility is supported by a consortium of twelve lenders with no lender controlling more than 27% of the facility.\nRefer to Note 8 Debt\u201d of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Item 8 of this report for further description of our outstanding debt.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe have no off-balance sheet arrangements within the meaning of Item 303(a)(4) of Regulation S-K.\nContractual Obligations\nPresented below is a summary of contractual obligations and other minimum commitments as of December 31, 2020.

These commitments do not include open purchase orders.\nThis table does not reflect $5.5 million of unrecognized tax benefits, as we are uncertain if or when such amounts may be settled. Refer to Note 12 Income Taxes\u201d of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this report for additional information about these unrecognized tax benefits.\nImpact of Recently Issued Accounting Standards\nIn the normal course of business, we evaluate all new accounting pronouncements issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB\u201d), SEC, or other authoritative accounting bodies to determine the potential impact they may have on our Consolidated Financial Statements. Refer to Note 1 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\u201d of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Item 8 of this report for additional information about these recently issued accounting standards and their potential impact on our financial condition or results of operations.\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES\nManagement's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. We make estimates and assumptions in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, revenue and expenses and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. We base our estimates and judgments upon historical experience and other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Changes in estimates or assumptions could result in a material adjustment to the consolidated financial statements.\n- 41 -\nMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS\nWe have identified several critical accounting estimates. An accounting estimate is considered critical if both: (a) the nature of the estimates or assumptions is material due to the levels of subjectivity and judgment involved, and (b) the impact of changes in the estimates and assumptions would have a material effect on the consolidated financial statements. This listing is not a comprehensive list of all of our accounting policies. For further information regarding the application of these and other accounting policies, see Note 1 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\u201d of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Item 8 of this report.\nInventories\nInventories are measured on a first-in, first-out basis at the lower of cost or net realizable value. Net realizable value is the estimated selling prices in the ordinary course of business, less reasonably predictable costs of completion, disposal, and transportation. The valuation of inventory requires us to estimate obsolete or excess inventory, as well as inventory that is not of saleable quality.\nHistorically, our inventory adjustment has been adequate to cover our losses. However, variations in methods or assumptions could have a material impact on our results. If our demand forecast for specific products is greater than actual demand and we fail to reduce manufacturing output accordingly, we could be required to record additional inventory write-down or expense a greater amount of overhead costs, which would negatively impact our net income.\nValuation of Goodwill and Intangible Assets\nWe make assumptions in establishing the carrying value, fair value and, if applicable, the estimated lives of our goodwill, intangible and other long-lived assets. Goodwill and intangible assets determined to have an indefinite useful life are not amortized. Instead, these assets are evaluated for impairment on an annual basis on the last day of our fiscal year and whenever events or business conditions change that could indicate that the asset is impaired. Long-lived assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset (asset group) may not be recoverable.\nEvaluation of goodwill for impairment\nWe test each reporting unit's goodwill for impairment on the last day of our fiscal year and between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more-likely-than-not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value. In conducting this annual impairment testing, we may first perform a qualitative assessment of whether it is more-likely-than-not that a reporting unit's fair value is less than its carrying value. If not, no further goodwill impairment testing is required. If it is more-likely-than-not that a reporting unit's fair value is less than its carrying value, or if we elect not to perform a qualitative assessment of a reporting unit, a quantitative analysis is performed, in which the fair value of the reporting unit is compared to its carrying value. If the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, an impairment loss is recognized equal to the excess, limited to the amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit.\nIn the first quarter of 2020, a trigger event was identified as a result of the collapse in the demand for oil caused by this unprecedented global health and economic crisis, coupled with oil oversupply, and adversely impacted the demand for products in the Company's Non-Medical reportable segment. The Company performed a quantitative analysis to test goodwill for impairment as of April 3, 2020. The fair value of the Non-Medical reporting unit exceeded its carrying amount as of April 3, 2020.\nWe performed a qualitative assessment of our Medical reporting unit as of December 31, 2020. As part of this analysis, we evaluated factors including, but not limited to, our market capitalization and stock price performance, macro-economic conditions, market and industry conditions, cost factors, the competitive environment, and the operational stability and overall financial performance of the reporting unit. The assessment indicated that it was more likely than not that the fair value of the Medical reporting unit exceeded its carrying value.\nWe elected to bypass the qualitative assessment and performed a quantitative analysis for our Non-Medical reporting unit. Resulting from the quantitative analysis, the fair value exceeded the carrying value of the Non-Medical reporting unit by approximately 85%. We do not believe that any of our reporting units are at risk for impairment. However, changes to the factors considered above could affect the estimated fair value of one or more of our reporting units and could result in a goodwill impairment charge in a future period. We may be unaware of one or more significant factors that, if we had been aware of, would cause our conclusion to change, which could result in a goodwill impairment charge in a future period.\n- 42 -\nMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS\nEvaluation of indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment\nOur indefinite-lived intangible assets include the Greatbatch Medical and Lake Region Medical tradenames. Similar to goodwill, we perform an annual impairment review of our indefinite-lived intangible assets on the last day of our fiscal year, unless events occur that trigger the need for an interim impairment review. We have the option to first assess qualitative factors in determining whether it is more-likely-than-not that an indefinite-lived intangible asset is impaired. If we elect not to use this option, or we determine that it is more-likely-than-not that the asset is impaired, we perform a quantitative assessment that requires us to estimate the fair value of each indefinite-lived intangible asset and compare that amount to its carrying value. Fair value is estimated using the relief-from-royalty method. Significant assumptions inherent in this methodology include estimates of royalty rates and discount rates. The discount rate applied is based on the risk inherent in the respective intangible assets and royalty rates are based on the rates at which comparable tradenames are being licensed in the marketplace. Impairment, if any, is based on the excess of the carrying value over the fair value of these assets.\nWe performed a quantitative assessment to test our indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment as of December 31, 2020. For the Greatbatch Medical tradename, the excess of the estimated fair value over carrying value (expressed as a percentage of carrying value) was in excess of its carrying value of $20 million by approximately 278% as of December 31, 2020. The Lake Region Medical tradename had an excess of the estimated fair value over carrying value of approximately 43% and a carrying value of $70 million at December 31, 2020. We do not believe that our indefinite-lived intangible assets are at risk for impairment. However, a significant increase in the discount rate, decrease in the terminal growth rate, increase in tax rates, decrease in the royalty rate or substantial reductions in our end-markets and volume assumptions could have a negative impact on the estimated fair values of either of our tradenames and require us to recognize impairments of these indefinite-lived intangible assets in a future period.\nEvaluation of long-lived assets for impairment\nWhen impairment indicators exist, we determine if the carrying value of the long-lived asset(s) or definite-lived intangible asset(s) exceeds the related undiscounted future cash flows. In cases where the carrying value exceeds the undiscounted future cash flows, the carrying value is written down to fair value. Fair value is generally determined using a discounted cash flow analysis. When it is determined that the useful life of an asset (asset group) is shorter than the originally estimated life, and there are sufficient cash flows to support the carrying value of the asset (asset group), we accelerate the rate of depreciation/amortization in order to fully depreciate/amortize the asset over its shorter useful life.\nEstimation of the cash flows and useful lives of long-lived assets and definite-lived intangible assets requires significant management judgment. Events could occur that would materially affect our estimates and assumptions. Unforeseen changes, such as the loss of one or more significant customers, technology obsolescence, or significant manufacturing disruption, among other factors, could substantially alter the assumptions regarding the ability to realize the return of our investment in long-lived assets, definite-lived intangible assets or their estimated useful lives.\n- 43 -\n ", "item_7_text": "ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF\nOPERATIONS\n \nThe following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read together with our selected financial data and our consolidated financial statements and the related notes appearing elsewhere in this report.\nThis discussion and analysis contains forward-looking statements that involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions.

We also develop batteries for high-end niche applications in the non-medical energy, military, and environmental markets. Our vision is to enhance the lives of patients worldwide by being our customers' partner of choice for innovative technologies and services.\nWe organize our business into two reportable segments, Medical and Non-Medical, and derive our revenues from four principle product lines. The Medical segment includes the Cardio & Vascular, Cardiac & Neuromodulation and Advanced Surgical, Orthopedics & Portable Medical product lines and the Non-Medical segment comprises the Electrochem product line. For more information on our segments, please refer to Note 18 Segment and Geographic Information\u201d of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Item 8 of this report.\nImpact of COVID-19\nBeginning in early March 2020, the global spread of the novel coronavirus ( COVID-19\u201d) created significant uncertainty and worldwide economic disruption. Specific impacts to our business include delayed or reduced customer orders and sales, restrictions on our associates' ability to travel or work, delays in shipments to and from certain countries, and disruptions in our supply chain. The extent to which COVID-19 impacts our operations will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain, including, among others, the duration of the outbreak, new information that may emerge concerning the severity of COVID-19 and the actions, especially those taken by governmental authorities, to contain the pandemic or treat its impact. As pandemic-related events continue to evolve, additional impacts may arise that we are not aware of currently. Any prolonged material disruption of our associates, suppliers, manufacturing, or customers could materially impact our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows.\n- 29 -\nMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS\nRecent Business Acquisitions\nOn February 19, 2020, we acquired certain assets and liabilities of InoMec Ltd. ( InoMec\u201d), a privately-held company based in Israel that specializes in the research, development and manufacturing of medical devices, including minimally invasive tools, delivery systems, tubing and catheters, surgery tools, drug-device combination, laser combined devices, and tooling and production. The acquisition enables us to create a research and development center in Israel, closer to the customer base in the region.\nIn October 2019, we purchased certain assets and liabilities of US BioDesign, LLC ( USB\u201d), a privately-held developer and manufacturer of complex braided biomedical structures for disposable and implantable medical devices. The acquisition added a differentiated capability related to the development and manufacture of complex braided and formed biomedical structures to our broad portfolio, that we believe further positions us as a partner of choice for innovative medical technologies.\nDiscontinued Operations and Divestiture\nIn July 2018, we completed the sale of the AS&O Product Line for net cash proceeds of approximately $581 million. In connection with the sale, the parties executed a transition services agreement whereby we provided certain corporate services (including accounting, payroll, and information technology services) to Viant to facilitate an orderly transfer of business operations. Viant paid us for these services as specified in the transition services agreement, which were complete as of June 28, 2019. In addition, the parties executed long-term supply agreements under which the parties have agreed to supply the other with certain products at prices specified in the agreements for a term of three years.\nIn connection with the closing of the transaction but prior to a net working capital adjustment, we recognized a pre-tax gain on sale of discontinued operations of $195.0 million during the year ended December 28, 2018. During 2019, we received, and recognized as gain on sale from discontinued operations, $4.8 million due to the final net working capital adjustment agreed to with Viant.\nThe results of operations of the AS&O Product Line have been classified as discontinued operations for all periods presented. Prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to the continuing operations reporting presentation. All results and information presented exclude the AS&O Product Line unless otherwise noted.\nRefer to Note 2 Business Acquisitions, Divestiture and Discontinued Operations\u201d of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Item 8 of this report for additional information about the acquisition of certain assets of InoMec and USB and the divestiture of the AS&O Product Line.\nPatent Litigation\nIn April 2013, we commenced an action against a competitor alleging they had infringed on the our patents by manufacturing and selling filtered feedthrough assemblies used in implantable pacemakers and cardioverter defibrillators that incorporate our patented technology.\nFollowing four trials and an appeal, the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit affirmed, in all respects, a judgment in our favor. We received proceeds related to the judgment of $28.9 million in October 2020, and after recognizing certain related expenses, recognized a net gain of $28.2 million, which is recorded in Selling, general and administrative expenses. The proceeds were used to pay down a portion of our Revolving Credit Facility.\nRefer to Note 13 Commitments and Contingencies\u201d of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Item 8 of this report for additional information on this matter.\n- 30 -\nMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS\nStrategic Overview\nWe continue to take steps to better align our resources in order to invest to grow and protect, and preserve our portfolio of products. In addition to our portfolio strategy, we continue to execute our six key operational strategic imperatives designed to drive excellence in everything we do:\n\u2022Sales Force Excellence: We have changed the organizational structure to match product line growth strategies and customer needs. This change is about getting more out of the capabilities we already have, and has increased individual accountability and clarity of ownership, while serving customers more effectively.\n\u2022Market Focused Innovation: We are ensuring we get the most return on our research and development investments. We are focused on having a clear picture of how we spend our money so we can increase investments to drive future growth.\n\u2022Manufacturing Excellence: The goal is to deliver world-class operational performance in the areas of safety, quality, delivery and overall efficiency. We want to transition our manufacturing into a competitive advantage through a single, enterprise-wide manufacturing structure known as the Integer Production System. This system will provide standardized systems and processes by leveraging best practices and applying them across all of our global sites.\n\u2022Business Process Excellence: We are taking a systematic approach to driving excellence in everything we do by standardizing, optimizing and ultimately sustaining all of our processes.\n\u2022Leadership Capability: We have a robust plan to make leadership a competitive advantage for us, and as the success rate is higher with internal hires, we are focusing on finding and developing leaders from within the Company to build critical capabilities for future success.\n\u2022Performance Excellence: We are raising the bar on associate performance to maximize our impact. This includes aligning key roles with critical capabilities, positioning the best talent against the biggest work, and putting tools and processes in place to provide higher financial rewards for top performers, so our top performers can see increased results in pay for increased results in their performance.\nWe believe we are well-positioned within the medical technology and MDO manufacturing market and that there is a robust pipeline of opportunities to pursue. We have expanded our medical device capabilities and are excited about opportunities to partner with customers to drive innovation. We believe we have the scale and global presence, supported by world-class manufacturing and quality capabilities, to capture these opportunities. We are confident in our capabilities as one of the largest MDO manufacturers, with a long history of successfully integrating companies, driving down costs and growing revenues over the long-term. Ultimately, our strategic vision is to drive shareholder value by enhancing the lives of patients worldwide by being our customers' partner of choice for innovative technologies and services.\nFinancial Overview\nFiscal 2020 Compared with Fiscal 2019\nIncome from continuing operations for 2020 was $77.3 million or $2.33 per diluted share compared to $91.2 million or $2.76 per diluted share for 2019. These variances are primarily the result of the following:\n\u2022Sales from continuing operations for 2020 decreased 15% primarily due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\u2022Gross profit for 2020 decreased $69.3 million or 20%, primarily from a decrease in sales volume, price reductions to our customers, and a loss in volume leverage, which resulted from our sales decrease, partially offset by 2019 charges associated with a customer bankruptcy (see Customer Bankruptcy under Our Financial Results below).\n\u2022Operating expenses for 2020 decreased by $32.3 million compared to 2019, due to decreases of $29.7 million in SG&A expenses and $4.5 million in Other operating expenses, partially offset by a $1.9 million increase in RD&E expenses. Included in SG&A expenses for 2020 is a net gain of $28.2 million recognized in connection with a previously mentioned patent litigation judgment.\n\u2022Interest expense for 2020 decreased by $14.3 million primarily due to lower interest rates and lower outstanding debt balances.\n\u2022We recognized a net gain on equity investments of $5.3 million in 2020, compared to a net loss on equity investments of $0.5 million during 2019. Gains and losses on equity investments are generally unpredictable in nature.\n\u2022Other loss, net for 2020 was $1.5 million compared to other income, net of $0.6 million during 2019, primarily due to fluctuations in foreign currency gains and losses in the respective periods.\n\u2022We recorded provisions for income taxes of $8.9 million and $14.0 million for 2020 and 2019, respectively. The decrease in provision for income taxes is primarily due to our decrease in pre-tax income and the beneficial impact of the final Treasury Regulations issued in 2020.\n- 31 -\nMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS\nFiscal 2019 Compared with Fiscal 2018\nIncome from continuing operations for 2019 was $91.2 million or $2.76 per diluted share compared to $47.0 million or $1.44 per diluted share for 2018. These variances are primarily the result of the following:\n\u2022Sales from continuing operations for 2019 increased 4% primarily driven by growth in Cardio & Vascular and Cardiac & Neuromodulation sales.\n\u2022Gross profit for 2019 decreased $7.7 million, primarily due to higher costs of sales due to inventory write-downs and other expenses totaling $21.4 million related to a customer who filed bankruptcy in 2019 (see Customer Bankruptcy\u201d), partially offset by a $43.1 million increase in sales from continuing operations.\n\u2022Operating expenses for 2019 decreased by 5% compared to 2018, due to decreases of $3.7 million in SG&A expenses, $2.1 million in RD&E expenses and $3.9 million in Other operating expenses.\n\u2022Interest expense for 2019 decreased by $46.8 million primarily due to lower outstanding debt balances due to the repayment of debt over the last year and extinguishment of debt charges included in 2018 related to the repayment of indebtedness in connection with the divestiture of the AS&O Product Line. Debt extinguishment expenses included in Interest expense for 2019 were lower by $40.1 million compared to 2018.\n\u2022We recognized a net loss on equity investments of $0.5 million in 2019, compared to a net gain on equity investments of $5.6 million during 2018. Gains and losses on equity investments are generally unpredictable in nature.\n\u2022Other income, net for 2019 was $0.6 million compared to other loss, net of $0.8 million during 2018, primarily due to foreign currency gains in 2019 compared to foreign currency losses in 2018.\n\u2022We recorded an income tax provision of $14.0 million for 2019, compared to a provision of $14.1 million for 2018.\n- 32 -\nMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS\nOur Financial Results\nThe following table presents selected financial information derived from our Consolidated Financial Statements, contained in Item 8 of this report, for the periods presented (dollars in thousands, except per share amounts):\n\nNM - Calculated change not meaningful.\nCustomer Bankruptcy\nIn November 2019, one of our customers, Nuvectra, filed a voluntary petition in U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Eastern District of Texas seeking relief under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. During 2020 and 2019, we recorded pre-tax charges totaling $1.2 million and $24.2 million, respectively, in connection with the bankruptcy. These charges were primarily non-cash and were associated with certain Nuvectra-related assets, primarily consisting of inventory, accounts receivable, as well as certain non-cancelable inventory commitments. The charges for 2020 were included in Cost of sales ($1.1 million) and SG&A expenses ($0.1 million). The charges for 2019 were included in Cost of sales ($21.4 million), SG&A expenses ($2.4 million) and Other operating expenses ($0.4 million).\n- 33 -\nMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS\nThe following discussion is a comparison between fiscal year 2020 and fiscal year 2019 results. For a discussion of our results of operations for fiscal year 2019 compared to fiscal year 2018, please refer to Item 7 of Part II, Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2019, which was filed with the SEC on February 20, 2020.\nFiscal 2020 Compared with Fiscal 2019\nSales\nSales by product line for 2020 and 2019 were as follows (dollars in thousands):\n\nTotal 2020 sales decreased 15% to $1.073 billion in comparison to 2019. The most significant drivers of this decrease were as follows:\nCardio & Vascular sales for 2020 decreased $40.1 million or 7% in comparison to 2019. Cardio & Vascular sales were negatively impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic and a blend of our customers' responses across nearly all Cardio & Vascular markets. During 2020, price reductions reduced Cardio & Vascular sales by $7.1 million in comparison to 2019. Foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations and acquisitions of USB and Inomec increased Cardio & Vascular sales for 2020 by $0.8 million and $7.9 million, respectively, in comparison to 2019.\nCardiac & Neuromodulation sales for 2020 decreased $111.0 million or 24% in comparison to 2019. Cardiac & Neuromodulation sales were negatively impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic and a blend of our customers' responses. Additionally, the Nuvectra bankruptcy created a headwind of $16.7 million for the 2020 fiscal year. During 2020, price reductions reduced Cardiac & Neuromodulation sales by approximately $10.7 million in comparison to 2019. Foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations and acquisitions did not have a material impact on Cardiac & Neuromodulation sales during 2020 in comparison to 2019.\nAdvanced Surgical, Orthopedic & Portable Medical includes sales to the acquirer of our AS&O Product Lines, Viant, under the LSA for the sale of products by the Company to Viant. Advanced Surgical, Orthopedics & Portable Medical sales for 2020 decreased by $10.6 million in comparison to 2019, driven by the impact of COVID-19 and a blend of our customers' responses. Price reductions reduced Advanced Surgical, Orthopedic & Portable Medical sales by $1.4 million in comparison to 2019. Foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations and acquisitions did not have a material impact on Advanced Surgical, Orthopedic & Portable Medical sales during 2020 in comparison to 2019.\nNon-Medical sales for 2020 decreased $23.0 million or 39% in comparison to 2019. The decreases in Non-Medical sales were primarily driven by a severe decline in the energy market and demand fall-out from the COVID-19 pandemic. Price and foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations did not have a material impact on Non-Medical sales during 2020 in comparison to 2019.\n- 34 -\nMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS\nGross Profit\nChanges to gross profit as a percentage of sales ( Gross Margin\u201d) from the prior year were due to the following:\n\n__________\n(a)Our Gross Margin for 2020 was negatively impacted by price reductions given to our larger OEM customers in return for long-term volume commitments.\n(b)Amount represents the impact to our Gross Margin attributable to changes in the mix of product sales during the period.\n(c)Our gross margin for 2020 was negatively impacted by lower sales from the COVID-19 pandemic. Given our indirect labor and overhead costs are less variable, and in most cases fixed, the resulting reduction in sales negatively impacted gross margin. However, we continue to execute on our Manufacturing Excellence strategic imperative and maintain our facility infrastructure as we expect the sales decline to be temporary.\n(d)Amount represents the impact to our Gross Margin attributable to the Customer Bankruptcy.\nSG&A Expenses\nChanges to SG&A expenses were primarily due to the following (in thousands):\n\n__________\n(a)Amount consists primarily of a $2.3 million reserve against outstanding receivables recorded during 2019 attributable to the Customer Bankruptcy.\n(b)Represents the amount included in SG&A expenses which was billed to Viant for transition services during 2019. We executed a transition services agreement in conjunction with the sale of the AS&O Product Line, whereby we agreed to provide certain corporate services (including accounting, payroll, and information technology services) to Viant to facilitate an orderly transfer of business operations. This provision of services under the agreement was completed during the second quarter of 2019.\n(c)We recognized a net gain of $28.2 million during 2020 related to a patent litigation judgment. Refer to Note 13 Commitments and Contingencies\u201d of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Item 8 of this report for additional information on this matter.\n(d)The net decrease in all other SG&A expenses for 2020 compared to 2019 is primarily attributable to lower compensation and benefits cost, travel related expenses and depreciation expense, partially offset by an increase in amortization expense.\nRD&E Expenses\nRD&E expenses for 2020 and 2019 were $48.5 million and $46.5 million, respectively. The increase in RD&E expenses for 2020 compared to 2019 is primarily attributable to increased compensation and benefits costs, consistent with our strategy to invest in capabilities for growth. RD&E expenses are influenced by the number and timing of in-process projects and labor hours and other costs associated with these projects. Our research and development initiatives continue to emphasize new product development, product improvements, and the development of new technological platform innovations.\n- 35 -\nMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS\nOther Operating Expenses\nOOE comprises the following for 2020 and 2019 (in thousands):\n\n__________\n(a)These projects focus on changing our organizational structure to match product line growth strategies and customer needs, transitioning our manufacturing process into a competitive advantage and standardizing and optimizing our business processes. Costs related to our 2020 initiatives mainly include termination benefits.\n(b)As a result of the strategic review of our customers, competitors and markets, we began taking steps in 2017 to better align our resources to enhance the profitability of our portfolio of products. These initiatives primarily included aligning resources with our strategic direction, improving profitability to invest in accelerated growth and the expansion of a facility. Costs related to these initiatives mainly included termination benefits and fees for professional services. These actions were completed during 2020.\n(c)In 2017, we commenced several initiatives designed to reduce costs, increase manufacturing capacity to accommodate growth and improve operating efficiencies. The plan involved the relocation of certain manufacturing operations and expansion of certain of our facilities. These actions were completed during 2020.\n(d)Amounts include expenses related to the purchase of certain assets and liabilities from InoMec and USB. The 2020 amount also includes a $2.0 million adjustment to reduce the fair value of acquisition-related contingent consideration liabilities. See Note 17 Financial Instruments and Fair Value Measurements\u201d of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Item 8 of this report for additional information related to the fair value measurement of the contingent consideration.\n(e)Amounts include expenses related to other initiatives not described above, which relate primarily to actions to align labor with customer demand as a result of COVID-19 and the decline of the energy market and integration and operational initiatives to reduce future costs and improve efficiencies. The 2020 and 2019 amounts primarily include severance, information technology systems conversion expenses, expenses incurred in connection with the Customer Bankruptcy, and expenses related to the restructuring of certain legal entities of the Company.\nRefer to Note 11 Other Operating Expenses\u201d of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Item 8 of this report for additional information regarding these initiatives.\n- 36 -\nMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS\nInterest Expense\nInterest expense consists primarily of cash interest and debt related charges, such as amortization of debt issuance costs and original issue discount. Interest expense decreased $14.3 million to $38.2 million in 2020 from $52.5 million in 2019, primarily from a decrease in cash interest due to lower interest rates. The weighted average interest rates paid on the average principal amount of debt outstanding during 2020 and 2019 was 3.79% and 4.99%, respectively. The weighted average interest rates paid in 2020 compared to 2019 reflect decreases in LIBOR. In November 2019, we reduced the applicable interest rate margins by amending our Senior Secured Credit Facilities.\nDebt related charges included in interest expense were $4.8 million for 2020 compared to $7.8 million for 2019. The decrease in debt related charges during 2020 compared to 2019 is primarily attributable to lower accelerated write-offs (losses from extinguishment of debt) of debt issuance costs and unamortized discounts related to prepayments of portions of our Term Loan B facility. We recognized losses from extinguishment of debt during 2020 and 2019 of $0.5 million and $2.5 million, respectively.\nAs of December 31, 2020, approximately 27% of our principal amount of debt outstanding was subject to variable rates, in comparison to approximately 20% as of December 31, 2019. We enter into interest rate swap agreements to reduce our exposure to fluctuations in the LIBOR rate. See Note 17 Financial Instruments and Fair Value Measurements\u201d of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Item 8 of this report for additional information pertaining to our interest rate swap agreements.\n(Gain) Loss on Equity Investments, Net\nDuring 2020, we realized net gains of $5.3 million on our equity investments compared to net losses of $0.5 million for 2019. Gains and losses on equity investments are generally unpredictable in nature. During 2020 and 2019, we recognized impairment charges of $0.4 million and $1.6 million, respectively, related to investments in our non-marketable equity securities. The residual amounts for 2020 and 2019 relate to our share of equity method investee gains/losses, including unrealized appreciation of the underlying interests of the investee. As of December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, the carrying value of our equity investments were $27.2 million and $22.3 million, respectively. See Note 17 Financial Instruments and Fair Value Measurements\u201d of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Item 8 of this report for further details regarding these investments.\nOther (Income) Loss, Net\nOther (income) loss, net was a loss of $1.5 million during 2020 compared to income of $0.6 million during 2019. Other (income) loss, net primarily comprises gains/losses from the impact of exchange rates on transactions denominated in foreign currencies. Our foreign currency transaction gains/losses are based primarily on fluctuations of the U.S. dollar relative to the Euro, Mexican peso, Uruguayan pesos, Malaysian ringgits, or Israeli shekel.\nThe impact of foreign currency exchange rates on transactions denominated in foreign currencies included in Other (income) loss, net for 2020 and 2019 were losses of $1.6 million and $0.04 million, respectively. We continually monitor our foreign currency exposures and seek to take steps to mitigate these risks. However, fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates could have a significant impact, positive or negative, on our financial results in the future.\n- 37 -\nMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS\nProvision for Income Taxes\nDuring 2020 and 2019, our provision for income taxes was $8.9 million on worldwide pre-tax income of $86.2 million\n(10.4%) and $14.0 million on worldwide pre-tax income of $105.1 million (13.3%), respectively. The stand-alone U.S. component of the effective tax rate for 2020 reflected a $3.1 million provision on $35.3 million of pre-tax book income (8.9%) versus a $5.7 million provision on $40.2 million of pre-tax book income (14.2%) for 2019. The stand-alone International component of the effective tax rate for 2020 reflected a $5.8 million provision on $50.9 million of pre-tax book income (11.4%) versus a $8.3 million provision on $65.0 million of pre-tax book income (12.7%) for 2019.\nThe provision for income taxes for 2020 differs from the U.S. statutory rate due to the following (dollars in thousands):\n\nThe provision for income taxes for 2019 differs from the U.S. statutory rate due to the following (dollars in thousands):\n\nOur effective tax rate of 10.4% for 2020 is lower than our effective tax rate of 13.3% for 2019, primarily due to the beneficial impact of the final Treasury Regulations with respect to the Global Intangible Low-Taxed Income ( GILTI\u201d), Foreign Derived Intangible Income (FDII\u201d) and Foreign Tax Credits that were issued during the third quarter of 2020, producing a non-recurring benefit to our effective tax rate in 2020.\n- 38 -\nMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS\nThe Company's effective tax rate for 2020 differs from the U.S. federal statutory tax rate of 21% due principally to the estimated impact of Federal Tax Credits (including R&D credits and Foreign tax credits), stock based compensation windfalls, and the impact of the Company's earnings realized in foreign jurisdictions with statutory rates that are different than the U.S. federal statutory rate. These benefits are partially offset by the impact of U.S taxes on foreign earnings, including the GILTI provision which requires the Company to include foreign subsidiary earnings in excess of a deemed return on a foreign subsidiary's tangible assets in its U.S. income tax return. The U.S. tax on foreign earnings is reflected net of a statutory deduction of 50% of the GILTI inclusion (subject to limitations based on U.S. taxable income, if any) and net of FDII that provides a 37.5% deduction to domestic companies for certain foreign sales and services income. The primary foreign jurisdictions in which we operate and the statutory tax rate for each respective jurisdiction include Switzerland (22%), Mexico (30%), Uruguay (25%), and Ireland (12.5%). We currently have a tax holiday in Malaysia through April 2023 provided certain conditions continue to be met.\nThere is a potential for volatility of our effective tax rate due to several factors, including changes in the mix of pre-tax income and the jurisdictions to which it relates, business acquisitions, settlements with taxing authorities, changes in tax rates, and foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. In addition, we continue to explore tax planning opportunities that may have a material impact on our effective tax rate.\nWe believe it is reasonably possible that a reduction of approximately $3.4 million of the balance of unrecognized tax benefits may occur within the next twelve months as a result of the lapse of the statute of limitations and/or audit settlements. As of December 31, 2020, approximately $5.5 million of unrecognized tax benefits would favorably impact the effective tax rate (net of federal impact on state issues), if recognized.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\n\nCash and cash equivalents at December 31, 2020 increased by $35.7 million from December 31, 2019 primarily as a result of cash generated from operating activities, inclusive of proceeds from the sale of accounts receivable under a supplier financing program, partially offset by purchases of property, plant and equipment and a net reduction of borrowings outstanding on our Senior Secured Credit Facility. The increase in cash and cash equivalents is consistent with our actions to increase liquidity given the uncertainty surrounding the COVID-19 pandemic.\nDuring 2020, we began utilizing supplier financing arrangements with financial institutions to sell certain accounts receivable on a non-recourse basis. These transactions are treated as a sale of, and are accounted for as a reduction to, accounts receivable. The agreement transfers control and risk related to the receivables to the respective financial institution. We have no continuing involvement in the transferred receivables subsequent to the sale.\nWorking capital increased by $20.4 million from December 31, 2019, primarily due to an increase in cash and cash equivalents supplemented by a decrease in current liabilities primarily from lower purchasing levels in 2020, partially offset by a decrease in accounts receivable from lower sales volume.\nAt December 31, 2020, $12.9 million of our cash and cash equivalents were held by foreign subsidiaries. We intend to limit our distributions from foreign subsidiaries to previously taxed income or current period earnings. If distributions are made utilizing current period earnings, we will record foreign withholding taxes in the period of the distribution.\nSummary of Cash Flow\nThe following cash flow summary information includes cash flows related to discontinued operations (in thousands):\n\n- 39 -\nMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS\nOperating Activities - During 2020, we generated $181.3 million in cash from operations compared to $165.4 million in 2019. The increase of $15.9 million was due to an an increase of $56.2 million in cash flow provided by working capital, offset by a decrease of $40.3 million in cash net income (net income plus adjustments to reconcile net income to net cash provided by operating activities). The increase in cash from working capital is the result of changes in certain assets and liabilities affecting cash flows, primarily an increase in cash flows from accounts receivable of $45.1 million, which decreased in the current year from lower sales and supplier financing, and inventory of $14.7 million, partially offset by a decrease in cash flows from accounts payable of $10.9 million. The decrease in cash net income is primarily from lower gross profit from sales and gross margin declines partially offset by lower SG&A expenses, interest expense, and income tax expense.\nInvesting Activities - The $2.3 million decrease in net cash used in investing activities was primarily attributable to a decrease in net cash paid for business acquisitions of $9.8 million and decreased purchases of property, plant, and equipment of $1.4 million, partially offset by an increase from the purchase of an intangible asset of $4.6 million in 2020 and lower net cash proceeds from the sale of the AS&O Product Line of $4.7 million in 2019.\nFinancing Activities - Net cash used in financing activities during 2020 was $88.6 million compared to $117.9 million in 2019. Financing activities during 2020 included net payments of $87.5 million related to paying down our debt obligations compared to $116.5 million in 2019. The payments made during 2020 include the utilization of proceeds received in conjunction with the patent litigation judgment during the fourth quarter of 2020.\nCapital Structure - As of December 31, 2020, our capital structure consists of $731.3 million of debt, net of deferred debt issuance costs and unamortized discounts, outstanding under our Senior Secured Credit Facilities and 33 million shares of common stock outstanding. We continue to have access to $193.2 million of borrowing capacity under our Revolving Credit Facility, available for normal course of business and letters of credit. We are also authorized to issue up to 100 million shares of common stock and 100 million shares of preferred stock. As of December 31, 2020, our contractual debt service obligations for 2021, consisting of principal and interest on our outstanding debt, are estimated to be approximately $60 million. Actual principal and interest payments may be higher if, for instance, the applicable interest rates on our Senior Secured Credit Facilities increase, we borrow additional amounts on our Revolving Credit Facility, or we pay principal amounts in excess of the required minimums reflected in the contractual debt service obligations above.\nBased on current expectations, we believe that our projected cash flows provided by operations, available cash and cash equivalents and borrowings under our Revolving Credit Facility are sufficient to meet our working capital, debt service and capital expenditure requirements for the next twelve months. If our future financing needs increase, we may need to arrange additional debt or equity financing. We continually evaluate and consider various financing alternatives to enhance or supplement our existing financial resources, including our Senior Secured Credit Facilities. However, we cannot be assured that we will be able to enter into any such arrangements on acceptable terms or at all. In addition, the recent COVID-19 pandemic, which has caused disruption in the capital markets, could make any such financing more difficult and/or expensive.\nCredit Facilities - As of December 31, 2020, we had senior secured credit facilities (the Senior Secured Credit Facilities\u201d) that consist of (i) a $200 million revolving credit facility (the Revolving Credit Facility\u201d), which had available borrowing capacity of $193.2 million as of December 31, 2020, (ii) a term loan A facility (the TLA Facility\u201d) with outstanding principal balance of $230 million, and (iii) a term loan B facility (the TLB Facility\u201d) with outstanding principal balance of $508 million. The Senior Secured Credit Facilities will mature on October 27, 2022. The Senior Secured Credit Facilities include a mandatory prepayment provision customary for credit facilities of its nature.\nThe Revolving Credit Facility and TLA Facility contain covenants requiring (A) a maximum total net leverage ratio of 4.75:1.00 subject to a step down to 4.50 to 1.00 for the third fiscal quarter of 2021, and reverting to and remaining at 4.00 to 1.00 beginning with the fourth quarter of 2021 through maturity, and (B) a minimum interest coverage ratio of adjusted EBITDA (as defined in the Senior Secured Credit Facilities) to interest expense of 3.0:1.0. Additionally, the total net leverage ratio can be increased by 0.50 for up to four consecutive quarters commencing in any fiscal quarter in which we consummate an Eligible Adjustment Acquisition (as defined in the Amendment) with a $40 million or greater purchase price. As of December 31, 2020, the Company was in compliance with these financial covenants. The TLB Facility does not contain any financial maintenance covenants. As of December 31, 2020, our total net leverage ratio, calculated in accordance with our Senior Secured Credit Facilities agreement, was approximately 3.2 to 1.0. For the twelve month period ended December 31, 2020, our ratio of adjusted EBITDA to interest expense, calculated in accordance with our Senior Secured Credit Facilities agreement, was approximately 6.5 to 1.0.\n- 40 -\nMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS\nFailure to comply with these financial covenants would result in an event of default as defined under the Revolving Credit Facility and TLA Facility unless waived by the lenders. An event of default may result in the acceleration of our indebtedness. As a result, management believes that compliance with these covenants is material to us. As of December 31, 2020, our adjusted EBITDA would have to decline by approximately $70 million, or approximately 32%, for us to not be in compliance with our financial covenants. The Revolving Credit Facility is supported by a consortium of twelve lenders with no lender controlling more than 27% of the facility.\nRefer to Note 8 Debt\u201d of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Item 8 of this report for further description of our outstanding debt.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe have no off-balance sheet arrangements within the meaning of Item 303(a)(4) of Regulation S-K.\nContractual Obligations\nPresented below is a summary of contractual obligations and other minimum commitments as of December 31, 2020. Refer to Note 13 Commitments and Contingencies\u201d of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Item 8 of this report for additional information regarding self-insurance liabilities, which are not reflected in the table below.\n\n(a)Interest payments in the table above reflect the contractual interest payments on our outstanding debt based upon the balance outstanding and applicable interest rates at December 31, 2020, and exclude the impact of the debt issuance cost and discount amortization and the impact of interest rate swap agreements. Refer to Note 8 Debt\u201d of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Item 8 of this report for additional information regarding long-term debt.\n(b)Refer to Note 14 Leases\u201d of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Item 8 of this report for additional information about our operating lease obligations.\n(c)Amounts include inventory purchase commitments, which are legally binding and specify minimum purchase quantities. These commitments do not include open purchase orders.\nThis table does not reflect $5.5 million of unrecognized tax benefits, as we are uncertain if or when such amounts may be settled. Refer to Note 12 Income Taxes\u201d of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this report for additional information about these unrecognized tax benefits.\nImpact of Recently Issued Accounting Standards\nIn the normal course of business, we evaluate all new accounting pronouncements issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB\u201d), SEC, or other authoritative accounting bodies to determine the potential impact they may have on our Consolidated Financial Statements. Refer to Note 1 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\u201d of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Item 8 of this report for additional information about these recently issued accounting standards and their potential impact on our financial condition or results of operations.\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES\nManagement's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. We make estimates and assumptions in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, revenue and expenses and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. We base our estimates and judgments upon historical experience and other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Changes in estimates or assumptions could result in a material adjustment to the consolidated financial statements.\n- 41 -\nMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS\nWe have identified several critical accounting estimates. An accounting estimate is considered critical if both: (a) the nature of the estimates or assumptions is material due to the levels of subjectivity and judgment involved, and (b) the impact of changes in the estimates and assumptions would have a material effect on the consolidated financial statements. This listing is not a comprehensive list of all of our accounting policies. For further information regarding the application of these and other accounting policies, see Note 1 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\u201d of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Item 8 of this report.\nInventories\nInventories are measured on a first-in, first-out basis at the lower of cost or net realizable value. Net realizable value is the estimated selling prices in the ordinary course of business, less reasonably predictable costs of completion, disposal, and transportation. The valuation of inventory requires us to estimate obsolete or excess inventory, as well as inventory that is not of saleable quality.\nHistorically, our inventory adjustment has been adequate to cover our losses. However, variations in methods or assumptions could have a material impact on our results. If our demand forecast for specific products is greater than actual demand and we fail to reduce manufacturing output accordingly, we could be required to record additional inventory write-down or expense a greater amount of overhead costs, which would negatively impact our net income.\nValuation of Goodwill and Intangible Assets\nWe make assumptions in establishing the carrying value, fair value and, if applicable, the estimated lives of our goodwill, intangible and other long-lived assets. Goodwill and intangible assets determined to have an indefinite useful life are not amortized. Instead, these assets are evaluated for impairment on an annual basis on the last day of our fiscal year and whenever events or business conditions change that could indicate that the asset is impaired. Long-lived assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset (asset group) may not be recoverable.\nEvaluation of goodwill for impairment\nWe test each reporting unit's goodwill for impairment on the last day of our fiscal year and between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more-likely-than-not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value. In conducting this annual impairment testing, we may first perform a qualitative assessment of whether it is more-likely-than-not that a reporting unit's fair value is less than its carrying value. If not, no further goodwill impairment testing is required. If it is more-likely-than-not that a reporting unit's fair value is less than its carrying value, or if we elect not to perform a qualitative assessment of a reporting unit, a quantitative analysis is performed, in which the fair value of the reporting unit is compared to its carrying value. If the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, an impairment loss is recognized equal to the excess, limited to the amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit.\nIn the first quarter of 2020, a trigger event was identified as a result of the collapse in the demand for oil caused by this unprecedented global health and economic crisis, coupled with oil oversupply, and adversely impacted the demand for products in the Company's Non-Medical reportable segment. The Company performed a quantitative analysis to test goodwill for impairment as of April 3, 2020. The fair value of the Non-Medical reporting unit exceeded its carrying amount as of April 3, 2020.\nWe performed a qualitative assessment of our Medical reporting unit as of December 31, 2020. As part of this analysis, we evaluated factors including, but not limited to, our market capitalization and stock price performance, macro-economic conditions, market and industry conditions, cost factors, the competitive environment, and the operational stability and overall financial performance of the reporting unit. The assessment indicated that it was more likely than not that the fair value of the Medical reporting unit exceeded its carrying value.\nWe elected to bypass the qualitative assessment and performed a quantitative analysis for our Non-Medical reporting unit. Resulting from the quantitative analysis, the fair value exceeded the carrying value of the Non-Medical reporting unit by approximately 85%. We do not believe that any of our reporting units are at risk for impairment. However, changes to the factors considered above could affect the estimated fair value of one or more of our reporting units and could result in a goodwill impairment charge in a future period. We may be unaware of one or more significant factors that, if we had been aware of, would cause our conclusion to change, which could result in a goodwill impairment charge in a future period.\n- 42 -\nMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS\nEvaluation of indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment\nOur indefinite-lived intangible assets include the Greatbatch Medical and Lake Region Medical tradenames. Similar to goodwill, we perform an annual impairment review of our indefinite-lived intangible assets on the last day of our fiscal year, unless events occur that trigger the need for an interim impairment review. We have the option to first assess qualitative factors in determining whether it is more-likely-than-not that an indefinite-lived intangible asset is impaired. If we elect not to use this option, or we determine that it is more-likely-than-not that the asset is impaired, we perform a quantitative assessment that requires us to estimate the fair value of each indefinite-lived intangible asset and compare that amount to its carrying value. Fair value is estimated using the relief-from-royalty method. Significant assumptions inherent in this methodology include estimates of royalty rates and discount rates. The discount rate applied is based on the risk inherent in the respective intangible assets and royalty rates are based on the rates at which comparable tradenames are being licensed in the marketplace. Impairment, if any, is based on the excess of the carrying value over the fair value of these assets.\nWe performed a quantitative assessment to test our indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment as of December 31, 2020. For the Greatbatch Medical tradename, the excess of the estimated fair value over carrying value (expressed as a percentage of carrying value) was in excess of its carrying value of $20 million by approximately 278% as of December 31, 2020. The Lake Region Medical tradename had an excess of the estimated fair value over carrying value of approximately 43% and a carrying value of $70 million at December 31, 2020. We do not believe that our indefinite-lived intangible assets are at risk for impairment. However, a significant increase in the discount rate, decrease in the terminal growth rate, increase in tax rates, decrease in the royalty rate or substantial reductions in our end-markets and volume assumptions could have a negative impact on the estimated fair values of either of our tradenames and require us to recognize impairments of these indefinite-lived intangible assets in a future period.\nEvaluation of long-lived assets for impairment\nWhen impairment indicators exist, we determine if the carrying value of the long-lived asset(s) or definite-lived intangible asset(s) exceeds the related undiscounted future cash flows. In cases where the carrying value exceeds the undiscounted future cash flows, the carrying value is written down to fair value. Fair value is generally determined using a discounted cash flow analysis. When it is determined that the useful life of an asset (asset group) is shorter than the originally estimated life, and there are sufficient cash flows to support the carrying value of the asset (asset group), we accelerate the rate of depreciation/amortization in order to fully depreciate/amortize the asset over its shorter useful life.\nEstimation of the cash flows and useful lives of long-lived assets and definite-lived intangible assets requires significant management judgment. Events could occur that would materially affect our estimates and assumptions. Unforeseen changes, such as the loss of one or more significant customers, technology obsolescence, or significant manufacturing disruption, among other factors, could substantially alter the assumptions regarding the ability to realize the return of our investment in long-lived assets, definite-lived intangible assets or their estimated useful lives.\n- 43 -\n ", "item_7_tables": "Table

Holdings Corporation's financial condition and results of operations for fiscal year 2020 compared to fiscal year 2019. \n\n- Total sales for 2020 decreased 15% to $1.073 billion compared to 2019, primarily due to the impact of COVID-19. All medical product lines saw declines, with Cardiac & Neuromodulation down 24%. \n\n- Gross profit margin declined from 28.2% in 2019 to 26.6% in 2020, driven by lower sales volume, price reductions, and loss of volume leverage from the sales decline.\n\n- Operating expenses decreased 16% in 2020 compared to 2019, mainly due to lower SG&A expenses including a $28.2 million net gain from a patent litigation judgment. \n\n- Net income from continuing operations was $77.3 million or $2.33 per diluted share in 2020, down from $91.2 million or $2.76 per diluted share in 2019. The decline was primarily due to lower sales and gross margins.\n\n- Cash flow from operations increased to $181.3 million in 2020 compared to $165.4 million in 2019, largely due to changes in working capital.\n\n- The company took actions to increase liquidity given uncertainties from COVID-19, including increasing cash balances and reducing debt.\n\nIn summary, Integer Holdings' financial performance declined in 2020 compared to 2019 primarily due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, but the company maintained strong cash flow and liquidity."}
