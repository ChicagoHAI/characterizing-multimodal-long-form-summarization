Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nThe following discussion compares the Company's financial condition at December 31, 2017 to its financial condition at December 31, 2016 and the results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016, and 2015. This discussion should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements and the Notes thereto appearing in Item 8 of Part II of this annual report.\nPERFORMANCE OVERVIEW\nThe Company recorded net income of $11.26 million for 2017, net income of $9.64 million for 2016, and net income of $7.11 million for 2015. The basic and diluted income per share was $0.89 for 2017, $0.76 for 2016, and $0.56 for 2015. When comparing 2017 to 2016 and 2015, earnings were significantly improved due to increases in net interest income and noninterest income, partially offset by increase in provision for credit losses and noninterest expenses.\nTotal assets were $1.394 billion at December 31, 2017, a $233.6 million, or 20.1%, increase when compared to the $1.160 billion at December 31, 2016. The primary factor contributing to the increase was the acquisition of three branches in the second quarter of 2017 which contributed $192.7 million of assets at December 31, 2017. Absent the branch acquisition, total assets have increased $40.9 million since December 31, 2016 which primarily resulted from increases in both gross loans of $113.9 million and investment securities of $33.2 million.\nTotal deposits increased $205.3 million, or 20.6%, to $1.203 billion at December 31, 2017. The increase was the direct result of the deposits acquired in the branch purchase which had a balance of $187.0 million at December 31, 2017. Excluding the acquisition, deposits increased $18.3 million. Total stockholders' equity increased $9.5 million, or 6.1%, to $163.7 million, or 11.75% of total assets at December 31, 2017.\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES\nThe Company's consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with GAAP and follow general practices within the industries in which it operates. Application of these principles requires management to make estimates, assumptions, and judgments that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes. These estimates, assumptions, and judgments are based on information available as of the date of the financial statements; accordingly, as this information changes, the financial statements could reflect different estimates, assumptions, and judgments. Certain policies inherently have a greater reliance on the use of estimates, assumptions, and judgments and as such have a greater possibility of producing results that could be materially different than originally reported. Estimates, assumptions, and judgments are necessary when assets and liabilities are required to be recorded at fair value, when a decline in the value of an asset not carried on the financial statements at fair value warrants an impairment write-down or valuation reserve to be established, or when an asset or liability needs to be recorded contingent upon a future event. Carrying assets and liabilities at fair value inherently results in more financial statement volatility. The fair values and the information used to record valuation adjustments for certain assets and liabilities are based on quoted market prices, collateral value or are provided by other third-party sources, when available.\nThe most significant accounting policies that the Company follows are presented in Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. These policies, along with the disclosures presented in the notes to the financial statements and in this discussion, provide information on how significant assets and liabilities are valued in the financial statements and how those values are determined. Based on the valuation techniques used and the sensitivity of financial statement amounts to the methods, assumptions, and estimates underlying those amounts, management has determined that the accounting policies with respect to the allowance for credit losses, goodwill and other intangible assets, deferred tax assets, and fair value are critical accounting policies. These policies are considered critical because they relate to accounting areas that require the most subjective or complex judgments, and, as such, could be most subject to revision as new information becomes available.\nThe allowance for credit losses represents management's estimate of credit losses inherent in the loan portfolio as of the balance sheet date. Determining the amount of the allowance for credit losses is considered a critical accounting estimate because it requires significant judgment and the use of estimates related to the amount and timing of expected future cash flows on impaired loans, estimated losses on pools of homogeneous loans based on historical loss experience, and consideration of current economic trends and conditions, all of which may be susceptible to significant change. The loan portfolio also represents the largest asset type on the consolidated balance sheets. Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements describes the methodology used to determine the allowance for credit losses. A discussion of the factors driving changes in the amount of the allowance for credit losses is included in the Asset Quality - Provision for Credit Losses and Risk Management section below.\nGoodwill represents the excess of the cost of an acquisition over the fair value of the net assets acquired. Other intangible assets represent purchased assets that also lack physical substance but can be distinguished from goodwill because of contractual or other legal rights or because the asset is capable of being sold or exchanged either on its own or in combination with a related contract, asset or liability. Goodwill and other intangible assets are required to be recorded at fair value at inception. Determining fair value is subjective, requiring the use of estimates, assumptions and management judgment. Goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives are tested at least annually for impairment, usually during the third quarter, or on an interim basis if circumstances dictate. Intangible assets that have finite lives are amortized over their estimated useful lives and also are subject to impairment testing. Impairment testing requires that the fair value of each of the Company's reporting units be compared to the carrying amount of its net assets, including goodwill. The Company's reporting units were identified based on an analysis of each of its individual operating segments (i.e., the Bank and Insurance Subsidiaries). If the fair value of a reporting unit is less than book value, an expense may be required to write down the related goodwill or purchased intangibles to record an impairment loss.\nTable 65: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>32 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nDeferred tax assets and liabilities are determined by applying the applicable federal and state income tax rates to cumulative temporary differences. These temporary differences represent differences between financial statement carrying amounts and the corresponding tax bases of certain assets and liabilities. Deferred taxes result from such temporary differences. A valuation allowance, if needed, reduces deferred tax assets to the expected amount most likely to be realized. Realization of deferred tax assets is dependent on the generation of a sufficient level of future taxable income, recoverable taxes paid in prior years and tax planning strategies. The Company evaluates all positive and negative evidence before determining if a valuation allowance is deemed necessary regarding the realization of deferred tax assets.\nThe Company measures certain financial assets and liabilities at fair value, with the measurements made on a recurring or nonrecurring basis. Significant financial instruments measured at fair value on a recurring basis are investment securities. Impaired loans and other real estate owned are significant financial instruments measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis. Fair value is defined as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. In determining fair value, the Company is required to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs, reducing subjectivity.\nRECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS AND DEVELOPMENTS\nNote 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements discusses new accounting policies that the Company adopted during 2017 and the expected impact of accounting policies recently issued or proposed but not yet required to be adopted. To the extent the adoption of new accounting standards materially affects our financial condition, results of operations or liquidity, the impacts are discussed in the applicable section(s) of this discussion and Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nNet Interest Income and Net Interest Margin\nNet interest income remains the most significant factor affecting our results of operations. Net interest income represents the excess of interest and fees earned on total average earning assets (loans, investment securities, federal funds sold and interest-bearing deposits with other banks) over interest owed on average interest-bearing liabilities (deposits and borrowings). Tax-equivalent net interest income is net interest income adjusted for the tax-favored status of income from certain loans and investments. As shown in the table below, tax-equivalent net interest income for 2017 was $45.8 million. This represented a $7.3 million, or 19.0%, increase from 2016, and net interest income increased $2.8 million, or 8.0%, for 2016 when compared to 2015. The increase in net interest income when comparing 2017 to 2016 was primarily the result of higher average balances on loans and lower rates paid on time deposits. Although the yields on loans declined compared to 2016, the funding of loan growth with lower yielding assets, coupled with higher yielding investment securities resulted in a higher overall yield on earning assets. The increase when comparing 2016 to 2015 was due to significant loan growth, which was funded by lower yielding assets and lower cost liabilities. When comparing 2017 to 2016, interest income increased $7.2 million while interest expense decreased $130 thousand. When comparing 2016 to 2015, interest income increased $1.9 million while interest expense decreased $943 thousand.\nOur net interest margin (i.e., tax-equivalent net interest income divided by average earning assets) represents the net yield on earning assets minus the cost of liabilities. The net interest margin is managed through loan and deposit pricing and asset/liability strategies. The net interest margin was 3.76% for 2017, 3.56% for 2016, and 3.43% for 2015. The net interest margin increased when comparing 2017 to 2016 due to the significant increase in the average balance of loans, higher yields on investment securities and a decrease in rates paid on interest bearing deposits. The net interest margin increased when comparing 2016 to 2015 due to an increase in the average balance of loans and lower rates paid on interest-bearing deposits. The net interest spread, which is the difference between the average yield on earning assets and the rate paid for interest-bearing liabilities, was 3.67% for 2017, 3.46% for 2016 and 3.31% for 2015.\nTable 66: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>33 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe following table sets forth the major components of net interest income, on a tax-equivalent basis, for the years

reported on a tax-equivalent basis computed using the statutory federal income tax rate of 35%, exclusive of the alternative minimum tax rate and nondeductible interest expense. The tax-equivalent adjustment amounts used in the above table to compute yields aggregated $242 thousand in 2017, $198 thousand in 2016 and $80 thousand in 2015.\n(2) Average loan balances include nonaccrual loans.\n(3) Interest income on loans includes amortized loan fees, net of costs, and all are included in the yield calculations.\nOn a tax-equivalent basis, total interest income was $48.0 million for 2017 compared to $40.9 million for 2016. The increase in interest income for 2017 compared to 2016 was primarily due to the increase in the average balance of loans coupled with a higher yield on taxable investment securities. Interest income on taxable investment securities increased $652 thousand or 20.4% in 2017 compared to 2016. In addition, interest-bearing deposits increased due to three fed fund rate hikes of 25bps during 2017. For 2017 compared to 2016, average loans increased $158.0 million and the yield earned on loans decreased 6 basis points. The increased volume of loans and the higher yield on loans purchased in the branch acquisition during the second quarter of 2017, outweighed the decline in the yield on originated loans resulting in an increase in tax-equivalent interest income of $6.5 million. Also impacting interest income is the accretion of acquisition accounting adjustments from the branch acquisition for loans of $420 thousand which is accounted for using a level yield method. In addition, the accretion on certificates of deposits acquired from the branch purchase, decreased interest expense by $86 thousand. Excluding average nonaccrual loans, the yield on loans would have been 4.49%, 4.59% and 4.79% for 2017, 2016, and 2015, respectively.\nTable 68: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>34 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nOn a tax-equivalent basis, total interest income was $40.9 million for 2016 compared to $39.0 million for 2015. The increase in interest income for 2016 compared to 2015 was primarily due to the increase in the average balance of loans coupled with an increase in the fed funds rate at the end of 2016 of 25bps. Interest income on taxable securities decreased $407 thousand or 11.3% in 2016 compared to 2015 due to a decrease in the average balance of $35.9 million which was used to fund loan growth. For 2016 compared to 2015, average loans increased $77.4 million and the yield earned on loans decreased 19 basis points. The increased volume of loans outweighed the decline in the yield resulting in an increase in interest income of $2.1 million.\nAs a percentage of total average earning assets, loans, investment securities, and interest-bearing deposits were 80.9%, 16.6%, and 2.5%, respectively, for 2017 which reflected an increase in higher-yielding earning assets when compared to 2016. The comparable percentages for 2016 were 76.4%, 18.2%, and 5.4%, respectively, and for 2015 were 72.2%, 22.4%, and 5.4%, respectively. When comparing 2017 to 2016, the overall increase in average balances of earning assets produced $7.1 million more in interest income and the decrease in yields on loans were offset by higher yields on taxable investment securities and interest-bearing deposits which produced $129 thousand more in interest income, as seen in the Rate/Volume Variance Analysis below. When comparing 2016 to 2015, the overall increase in average balances of earning assets produced $3.0 million more in interest income and the decrease in yields on earning assets produced $1.1 million less in interest income, as seen in the Rate/Volume Variance Analysis below.\nThe following table sets forth the average balance of the components of average earning assets as a percentage of total average earning assets for the year ended December 31.\nTable 69: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2017 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2016 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2015 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2014 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2013 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Loans </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>80.9 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>76.4 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>72.2 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>71.1 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>76.0 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Loans held for sale </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.4 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Investment securities </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>16.6 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>18.2 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>22.4 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>20.0 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>13.8 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Federal funds sold </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.2 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.3 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.2 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.4 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Interest-bearing deposits with other banks </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2.5 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5.2 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5.1 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>8.7 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>9.4 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>100.0 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>100.0 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>100.0 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>100.0 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>100.0 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table>\nInterest expense was $2.3 million for 2017 compared to $2.4 million for 2016. The decline in interest expense for 2017 was primarily due to lower expense on certificates of deposit and other time deposits. Interest expense on certificates of deposit and other time deposits declined $398 thousand in 2017 when compared to 2016, the result of a decrease of $4.5 million in average balances and a decline of 13 basis points on rates paid on these deposits. The decrease in average certificates of deposits and other time deposits reflected the lower rates due to the Bank not increasing these rates in conjunction with a rising interest rate environment. The decrease in average certificates of deposit and other time deposits was mostly transitioned to non-interest bearing and money market and savings deposits which reflected average increases of $54.9 million and $74.6 million, respectively.\nInterest expense was $2.4 million for 2016 compared to $3.3 million for 2015. The decline in interest expense for 2016 was primarily due to lower expense on certificates of deposit and other time deposits. Interest expense on certificates of deposit and other time deposits declined $959 thousand in 2016 when compared to 2015, the result of a decrease of $37.3 million in average balances and a decline of 23 basis points on rates paid on these deposits. The decrease in average certificates of deposit and other time deposits reflected the lower rates due to current market conditions. The decrease in average certificates of deposit and other time deposits was mostly transitioned to non-interest bearing and money market and savings deposits which reflected average increases of $30.2 million and $21.6 million, respectively.\nDuring 2017, lower rates on interest-bearing liabilities produced $218 thousand less in interest expense and increased volume produced $88 thousand more in interest expense, as shown in the table below. In 2016, lower rates on interest-bearing liabilities produced $690 thousand less in interest expense and decreased volume produced $253 thousand less in interest expense.\nTable 70: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>35 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe following Rate/Volume Variance Analysis identifies the portion of the changes in tax-equivalent net interest income attributable to changes in volume of average balances or to changes in the yield on earning assets and rates paid on interest-bearing liabilities.

The increase in noninterest expense in 2017 when compared to 2016 was primarily due to the branch purchase in the second quarter of 2017 which resulted in acquisition costs of $977 thousand and the cost of operating those branches for seven months. The operation of the additional purchased branches as well as the opening of a loan production office in Ocean City, MD in April of 2017 and a branch in Onley, VA in September of 2017 had an impact on nearly all noninterest expense accounts but had the most significant impact on salaries/wages and employee benefits of $693 thousand and $167 thousand, respectively. The most significant increases absent the operational costs from the additional branches were $1.7 million in salaries and wages due to accrued bonuses, incentive equity programs and a full year of pay increases from 2016 and $485 thousand in higher employer benefits due to more full-time employees and increased health care premiums.\nThe decrease in noninterest expense in 2016 when compared to 2015 was primarily due to a decline in legal and professional fees of $505 thousand and reduced FDIC insurance premiums of $518 thousand, partially offset by consolidation expenses for the former bank subsidiaries of $507 thousand and increases in write-downs on other real estate owned of $115 thousand and employee salaries/wages and employee benefits of $174 thousand. The increased legal and professional fees in 2016 were the direct result of management outsourcing its internal audit function which resulted in significant implementation costs. In addition, the lower FDIC insurance premiums over the prior period are the direct result of the upgraded regulatory status and financial performance of the former Talbot Bank in the second quarter of 2015 and an adjustment of the annual assessment in the third quarter of 2016.\nThe Company had 327 full-time equivalent employees at December 31, 2017, 287 full-time equivalent employees at

expense of $4.4 million for 2015. The effective tax rate was 43.1% for 2017, 39.4% for 2016 and 38.3% for 2015. The Company's income tax expense and its effective tax rate increased for 2017 from 2016 and 2015 primarily due to higher pretax income and the enactment of the Tax Act. Please refer to Note 16 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further information. The Company's future effective tax rate will be affected by the Tax Act. Effective in 2018, the Tax Act reduces the U.S. statutory corporate tax rate from 35% to 21% and creates new taxes on certain foreign-sourced earnings and certain related-party payments, which are referred to as the global intangible low-taxes income tax and the base erosion tax, respectively.\nREVIEW OF FINANCIAL CONDITION\nAsset and liability composition, capital resources, asset quality, market risk, interest sensitivity and liquidity are all factors that affect our financial condition. The following sections discuss each of these factors.\nAssets\nInterest-Bearing Deposits with Other Banks and Federal Funds Sold\nThe Company invests excess cash balances (i.e., the excess cash remaining after funding loans and investing in securities with deposits and borrowings) in interest-bearing accounts and federal funds sold offered by our correspondent banks. These liquid investments are maintained at a level that management believes is necessary to meet current liquidity needs. Total interest-bearing deposits with other banks and federal funds sold decreased $51.1 million from $61.3 million at December 31, 2016 to $10.3 million at December 31, 2017. This significant decrease was the direct result of funding a significant volume of new loans which closed late in the fourth quarter. Average interest-bearing deposits with other banks and federal funds sold decreased $27.4 million in 2017 and increased $1.8 million in 2016. The decrease in 2017 was due to higher period-end and average balances on loans which absorbed the excess liquidity in both average interest-bearing deposits with other banks and average balances on deposits. The increase in 2016 was due to higher period-end and average balances on deposits which resulted in excess liquidity for funding future loan growth.\nTable 75: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>37 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nInvestment Securities\nThe investment portfolio is structured to provide us with liquidity and also plays an important role in the overall management of interest rate risk. Investment securities available for sale are stated at estimated fair value based on quoted prices and may be sold as part of the asset/liability management strategy or which may be sold in response to changing interest rates. Net unrealized holding gains and losses on these securities are reported net of related income taxes as accumulated other comprehensive income, a separate component of stockholders' equity. Investment securities in the held to maturity category are stated at cost adjusted for amortization of premiums and accretion of discounts. We have the intent and current ability to hold such securities until maturity. At December 31, 2017, 97% of the portfolio was classified as available for sale and 3% as held to maturity, similar to the 96% and 4%, respectively, at December 31, 2016. The percentage of securities designated as available for sale reflects the amount that management believes is needed to support our anticipated growth and liquidity needs. With the exception of municipal securities, our general practice is to classify all newly-purchased securities as available for sale. On December 15, 2016, the Company bought $3.0 million in subordinated notes from a local regional bank which it intends to hold to maturity of December 30, 2026. We do not typically invest in derivative securities and held no such investments at December 31, 2017 or December 31, 2016. Total investment securities increased $32.6 million from $170.6 million at December 31, 2016 to $203.2 million at December 31, 2017. Average investment securities increased $5.6 million in 2017 due to receiving $81.2 million in cash from the branch acquisition in the second quarter of 2017 which was also utilized to fund our significant loan growth in the third and fourth quarters of 2017. The decrease in average investment securities of $36.1 million in 2016 from 2015 was due to funding new loan growth during 2016.\nInvestment securities available for sale were $197.0 million at the end of 2017 and $163.8 million at the end of 2016. Investment activity for 2017 included purchases of $53.5 million in mortgage-backed securities and $31.0 million in U.S. Government agencies, while investment activity for 2016 included purchases of $9.1 million in mortgage-backed securities and $9.0 million in U.S. Government agencies. At year-end 2017, 22.3% of the securities in the portfolio were U.S. Government agencies and 74.3% of the securities were mortgage-backed securities, compared to 20.9% and 78.7%, respectively, at year-end 2016. As seen in the table below, 38% of the available-for-sale portfolio will mature in over one through five years and 57% will mature in over ten years based on contractual maturities. The comparable amounts for 2016 were 10% and 73%, respectively. Our investments in mortgage-backed securities are issued or guaranteed by U.S. Government agencies or government-sponsored agencies.\nInvestment securities held to maturity totaled $6.2 million at December 31, 2017. The comparable amount was $6.8 million at December 31, 2016.\nThe following table sets forth the maturities and weighted average yields of the bond investment portfolio as of December 31, 2017.\nTable

Loans totaled $1.1 billion at December 31, 2017, an increase of $222.0 million, or 25.5%, from 2016. Loans significantly increased in 2017 when compared to 2016 due to organic loan growth of $113.9 million, or 13.1% and acquired loans from the branch acquisition which contributed $108.1 million, or 12.4% at December 31, 2017. Most of our loans are secured by real estate and are classified as construction, residential or commercial real estate loans. The increase in loans was comprised of increases in commercial real estate loans of $82.2 million, or 21.5%, residential real estate loans of $73.4 million, or 22.5%, construction loans of $41.7 million, or 49.7% and commercial loans, which include financial and agricultural loans, of $24.8 million, or 34.3%. Consumer loans, which consist of a small percentage of the overall loan portfolio, decreased $232 thousand, or 3.5%, at December 31, 2017 compared to December 31, 2016.\nTable 77: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>38 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nAt December 31, 2017, the real estate loan portfolio was comprised of 11.5% construction, 36.5% residential real estate and 42.5% commercial real estate. That compares to 9.6%, 37.4% and 43.9%, respectively, at December 31, 2016. Commercial and consumer loans were 8.9% and 0.6%, respectively, of the portfolio at December 31, 2017 and 8.3% and 0.8%, respectively, at December 31, 2016. At December 31, 2017, 74.2% of the loan portfolio had fixed interest rates and 25.8% had adjustable interest rates, compared to 74.8% and 25.2%, respectively, at December 31, 2016. See the discussion below under the caption Asset Quality - Provision for Credit Losses and Risk Management\u201d and Note 4, Loans and Allowance for Credit Losses\u201d, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.

securities. Total deposits increased from $997.5 million at December 31, 2016 to $1.2 billion at December 31, 2017. The increase was the direct result of the deposits acquired in the branch purchase which had a balance of $187.0 million at December 31, 2017. Excluding the acquisition, deposits increased $18.3 million. These increases were reflected in noninterest-bearing deposits of $66.7 million as well as an increase in interest-bearing transaction accounts of $136.0 million and an increase in certificates of deposit and other time deposits of $2.6 million. Average interest-bearing deposits increased $90.7 million, or 19.7%, in 2017, compared to an increase of $34.8 million, or 8.2% in 2016. Average certificates of deposit and other time deposits decreased $4.5 million, or 1.6% in 2017, compared to a decrease of $37.3 million, or 11.9% in 2016. Average noninterest-bearing deposits increased $54.9 million, or 22.8%, in 2017, compared to an increase of $30.2 million, or 14.3% in 2016. Deposits provided funding for approximately 91.9%, 90.5% and 91.5% of average earning assets for 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively.\nAverage deposits increased for 2016 primarily in noninterest-bearing deposits and interest-bearing transaction accounts which increased $65.0 million, or 10.2%, partially offset by decreases in certificates of deposit and other time deposits of $37.3 million, or 11.9%. The increase in noninterest-bearing and interest-bearing transaction accounts reflected continued growth in our customer base and a shift from certificates of deposit and other time deposits providing lower yields than in 2015.\nTable 80: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>39 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe following table sets forth the average balances of deposits and the percentage of each category to total average deposits for the years ended December 31.\nTable 81: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Average Balances </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>(Dollars in thousands) </td> <td> </td> <td>2017 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2016 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2015 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Noninterest-bearing demand </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>296,283 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>26.5 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>241,357 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>24.7 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>211,171 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>22.2 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Interest-bearing deposits </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Demand </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>210,139 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>18.8 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>194,062 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>19.9 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>180,810 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>19.1 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Money market and savings </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>339,971 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>30.4 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>265,323 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>27.2 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>243,731 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>25.7 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Certificates of deposit, $100,000 to $249,999 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>91,373 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>8.2 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>98,397 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>10.1 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>149,181 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>15.7 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Certificates of deposit, $250,000 or more (1) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>27,350 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2.4 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>29,071 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3.0 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Other time deposits </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>152,959 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>13.7 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>148,671 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>15.2 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>164,239 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>17.3 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Total </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,118,075 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>100.0 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>976,881 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>100.0 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>949,132 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>100.0 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table>\n(1) Disclosure of $250,000 or more for 2015 were not separately reported.\nThe following table sets forth the maturity ranges of certificates of deposit with balances of $250,000 or more as of December 31, 2017.\nTable 82: <table> <tr> <td>(Dollars in thousands) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Three months or less </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>4,556 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Over three through 6 months </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,422 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Over 6 through 12 months </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5,035 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Over 12 months </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>13,019 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Total </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>24,032 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nShort-Term Borrowings\nShort-term borrowings generally consist of securities sold under agreements to repurchase and short-term borrowings from the FHLB. Securities sold under agreements to repurchase are issued in conjunction with cash management services for commercial depositors. We also borrow from the FHLB on a short-term basis and occasionally borrow from correspondent banks under federal fund lines of credit arrangements to meet short-term liquidity needs. At December 31, 2017 short-term borrowings included advances and repurchase agreements. At December 31, 2016 and 2015, short-term borrowings included only repurchase agreements.\nThe average balance of short-term borrowings decreased $1.2 million, or 21.3%, in 2017, while the average balance decreased $473 thousand, or 7.6%, in 2016. In the month of December 2017, the Company borrowed $21.7 million due to significant loan closures late in the month, otherwise there was not a substantial need for short-term borrowings to supplement deposits as a funding source during 2017 and 2016.\nThe following table sets forth our position with respect to short-term borrowings.\nTable 83: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2017 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2016 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2015 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Interest </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Interest </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Interest </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>(Dollars in thousands) </td> <td> </td> <td>Balance </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Rate </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Balance </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Rate </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Balance </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Rate </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Average outstanding for the year </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>4,524 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.68 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>5,753 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.24 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>6,226 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.24 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Outstanding at year end </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>21,734 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1.36 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3,203 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.25 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6,672 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.23 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Maximum outstanding at any month end </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>21,734 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>9,877 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>10,423 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nLong-Term Debt\nWe use long-term borrowings to meet longer term liquidity needs, specifically to fund loan growth when liquidity from deposit growth is not sufficient. The Company had no long-term debt at the end of 2017 and 2016.\nCapital Resources Management\nTotal stockholders' equity for the Company was $163.8 million at December 31, 2017, compared to $154.3 million at December 31, 2016. The increase in stockholders' equity in 2017 was primarily due to net income during the year which was offset by dividends paid to common stockholders. The ratio of period-end equity to total assets was 11.75% for 2017, as compared to 13.30% for 2016. This ratio declined primarily due to the branch acquisition which significantly increased total assets and intangible assets.\nTable 84: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>40 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe record unrealized holding gains (losses), net of tax, on investment securities available for sale as accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), a separate component of stockholders' equity.

The Basel III Capital Rules were effective for the Company on January 1, 2015 and will be fully phased in on January 1, 2019. When fully phased in on January 1, 2019, the Basel III Capital Rules will require the Company to maintain (i) a minimum ratio of CET1 to risk-weighted assets of at least 4.5%, plus a 2.5% capital conservation buffer,\u201d (ii) a minimum ratio of Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets of at least 6.0%, plus the capital conservation buffer, (iii) a minimum ratio of Total capital to risk-weighted assets of at least 8.0%, plus the capital conservation buffer and (iv) a minimum leverage ratio of 4%, calculated as the ratio of Tier 1 capital to average assets. The Basel III Capital Rules eliminate the inclusion of certain instruments, such as trust preferred securities, from Tier 1 capital. Instruments issued prior to May 19, 2010 will be grandfathered for companies with consolidated assets of $15 billion or less.\nThe capital conservation buffer is designed to absorb losses during periods of economic stress. Banking institutions with a ratio of CET1 to risk-weighted assets above the minimum but below the conservation buffer will face constraints on dividends, equity repurchases and compensation based on the amount of the shortfall. The implementation of the capital conservation buffer began on January 1, 2016 at 0.625% and will be phased in over a four-year period, increasing by that amount on each January 1, until it reaches 2.5% on January 1, 2019.\nThe Basel III Capital Rules also revise the prompt corrective action\u201d regulations by (i) introducing a CET1 ratio requirement at each level (other than critically undercapitalized), with the required CET1 ratio being 6.5% for well-capitalized status and (ii) increasing the minimum Tier 1 capital ratio requirement for each category (other than critically undercapitalized), with the minimum Tier 1 capital ratio for well-capitalized status being 8% (as compared to the prior 6%). The Basel III Capital Rules do not change the total risk-based capital requirement for any prompt corrective action category.\nThe Company currently meets all capital adequacy requirements under the Basel III Capital Rules as they became effective for the Company on January 1, 2015. For additional information regarding the Basel III Capital Rules, see Business - Supervision and Regulation - Capital Requirements.\u201d\nTable 86: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>41 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nAsset Quality - Provision for Credit Losses and Risk Management\nOriginating loans involves a degree of risk that credit losses will occur in varying amounts according to, among other factors, the types of loans being made, the credit-worthiness of the borrowers over the terms of the loans, the quality of the collateral for the loans, if any, as well as general economic conditions. Through the Company's and the Bank's Asset/Liability Management Committees, the Company's Audit Committee and the Company's Board actively reviews critical risk positions, including credit, market, liquidity and operational risk. The Company's goal in managing risk is to reduce earnings volatility, control exposure to unnecessary risk, and ensure appropriate returns for risk assumed. Senior members of management actively manage risk at the product level, supplemented with corporate level oversight through the Asset/Liability Management Committee and internal audit function. The risk management structure is designed to identify risk through a systematic process, enabling timely and appropriate action to avoid and mitigate risk.\nCredit risk is mitigated through loan portfolio diversification, limiting exposure to any single industry or customer, collateral protection, and prudent lending policies and underwriting criteria. The following discussion provides information and statistics on the overall quality of the Company's loan portfolio. Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements describes the accounting policies related to nonperforming loans (nonaccrual and delinquent 90 days or more), TDRs and loan charge-offs and describes the methodologies used to develop the allowance for credit losses, including the specific, formula and unallocated components (also discussed below). Management believes the policies governing nonperforming loans, TDRs and charge-offs are consistent with regulatory standards. The amount of the allowance for credit losses and the resulting provision are reviewed monthly by senior members of management and approved quarterly by the Board of Directors.\nThe allowance is increased by provisions for credit losses charged to expense and recoveries of loans previously charged off. It is decreased by loans charged off in the current period. Loans, or portions thereof, are charged off when considered uncollectible by management. Provisions for credit losses are made to bring the allowance for credit losses within the range of balances that are considered appropriate.\nThe adequacy of the allowance for credit losses is determined based on management's estimate of the inherent risks associated with lending activities, estimated fair value of collateral, past experience and present indicators such as loan delinquency trends, nonaccrual loans and current market conditions. Management believes the current allowance is adequate to provide for probable losses inherent in our loan portfolio; however, future changes in the composition of the loan portfolio and financial condition of borrowers may result in additions to the allowance. Examination of the portfolio and allowance by various regulatory agencies and consultants engaged by the Company may result in the need for additional provisions based on information available at the time of the examination. The Bank maintains a separate allowance for credit losses, which is only available to absorb losses from their respective loan portfolios. The allowance set by the Bank is subject to regulatory examination and determination as to its adequacy.\nThe allowance for credit losses is comprised of three parts: (i) the specific allowance; (ii) the historical formula allowance; and (iii) the qualitative formula allowance. The specific allowance is established against impaired loans until charge offs are made. Loans are considered impaired (i.e., nonaccrual loans and accruing TDRs) when it is probable that the Company will not collect all principal and interest payments according to the loan's contractual terms. The qualitative formula allowance is determined based on management's assessment of industry trends and economic factors in the markets in which we operate. The determination of the formula allowance involves a higher risk of uncertainty and considers current risk factors that may not have yet manifested themselves in our historical loss factors.\nThe specific allowance is used to individually allocate an allowance to loans identified as impaired. An impaired loan may involve deficiencies in the borrower's overall financial condition, payment history, support available from financial guarantors and/or the fair market value of collateral. If it is determined that there is a loss associated with an impaired loan, a specific allowance is established until a charge off is made. Impaired loans, or portions thereof, are charged off when deemed uncollectible.\nThe historical formula allowance is used to estimate the loss on internally risk-rated loans, exclusive of those identified as impaired. Loans are grouped by type (construction, residential real estate, commercial real estate, commercial or consumer). Each loan type is assigned allowance factors based on management's estimate of the risk, complexity and size of individual loans within a particular category using average historical charge-offs by segment over the last 16 quarters. Loans that are identified as pass-watch, special mention, substandard and doubtful are considered to have elevated credit risk.\nThe qualitative formula allowance is used to estimate the loss on loans stemming from more global factors such as delinquencies, loss history, trends in volume and terms of loans, effects of changes in lending policy, the experience and depth of management, national and local economic trends, concentrations of credit, the quality of the loan review system and the effect of external factors such as competition and regulatory requirements. These loans are assigned higher allowance factors than favorably rated loans due to management's concerns regarding collectability or management's knowledge of particular elements regarding the borrower.\nBecause most of our loans are secured by real estate, the lack of a meaningful upturn in real estate related activities in our local real estate market and construction industry and slow improvement in general economic conditions had a material adverse effect on the performance of our loan portfolio and the value of the collateral securing that portfolio between 2009 and 2013. Factors impeding our loan performance and overall financial performance included our levels of loan charge-offs and provisions for credit losses. However, we believe that the proactive measures we took in 2011, 2012 and 2013 to critically review our loan portfolio, take the necessary charge-offs, provide prudent reserves and engage in difficult but timely asset sales allowed us to focus on loan growth and improved earnings beginning in 2014.\nTable 87: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>42 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nOn May 19, 2017, the Bank purchased three branches which resulted in $122.9 million in loans being added to the Bank's portfolio. Management evaluated expected cash flows, prepayment speeds and estimated loss factors to measure fair values for the loans acquired. The Bank only acquired loans which were deemed to be performing loans with no signs of credit deterioration. The Bank re-evaluated these acquired loans during the fourth quarter of 2017 noting they remained in performing condition, therefore no allowance has been recorded as of December 31, 2017.\nAs seen in the table below, the provision for credit losses was $2.3 million for 2017, $1.8 million for 2016 and $2.1 million for 2015. The increase in the level of provision for credit losses in 2017 was primarily due to the significant growth in loans as compared to 2016. Net loan charge-offs totaled $1.2 million in 2017, $1.4 million in 2016 and $1.5 million in 2015. Real estate loans were 44%, 75% and 83% of total loans charged off during 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively and also due to the change in allowance methodology disclosed in Note 4 of the consolidated financial statements. Management deemed the change in methodology necessary due to the increase in loans migrating to the pass-watch risk rating category and due to the amount of unseasoned growth in the originated portfolio experienced in 2016 and 2017. The change in methodology resulted in $1.4 million in additional provision for credit losses.\nThe allowance for credit losses was $9.8 million, or 0.99% of average outstanding loans at December 31, 2017, compared to an allowance of $8.7 million, or 1.06% of average outstanding loans at December 31, 2016. The higher allowance at the end of 2017 when compared to the end of 2016 was the result of significant growth in the loan portfolio and the above referenced change in methodology. At December 31, 2015, the allowance for credit losses was $8.3 million, or 1.11% of average outstanding loans. The ratio of net charge-offs to average loans was 0.13% in 2017, 0.17% in 2016 and 0.19% in 2015.\nThe overall credit quality improved in 2017 compared to 2016 primarily due to continued workout efforts on outstanding problem loans many of which were TDRs and nonperforming assets. Management will continue to monitor and charge off nonperforming assets as rapidly as possible, and focus on the generation of healthy loan growth and new business development opportunities.\nThe following table sets forth a summary of our loan loss experience for the years ended December 31.\nTable 88: <table> <tr> <td>(Dollars in thousands) </td> <td> </td> <td>2017 </td> <td> </td> <td>

decrease of $4.1 million, or 35.4%, when compared to December 31, 2016. Similarly, accruing TDRs were $13.3 million at December 31, 2017, an increase of $326 thousand, or 2.5%, when compared to December 31, 2016. At December 31, 2017, the ratio of nonaccrual loans to total assets was 0.36%, improving from 0.77% at December 31, 2016. Likewise, the ratio of accruing TDRs to total assets at December 31, 2017 was 0.96%, decreasing from 1.12% at December 31, 2016. When comparing December 31, 2017 to December 31, 2016, the positive trend in nonperforming assets, as well as the corresponding asset quality ratios, was due to continued work-out efforts and loan charge-offs. The slight increase in accruing TDRs from December 31, 2016 to December 31, 2017, was due to legacy nonaccrual TDRs transferring to accruing TDRs which also represented improving credit quality.\nThe Company continues to focus on the resolution of its nonperforming and problem loans. The efforts to accomplish this goal include frequently contacting borrowers until the delinquency is cured or until an acceptable payment plan has been agreed upon; obtaining updated appraisals; provisioning for credit losses; charging off loans; transferring loans to other real estate owned; aggressively marketing other real estate owned; and selling loans. The reduction of nonperforming and problem loans is and will continue to be a high priority for the Company.\nSelected Quarterly Consolidated Financial Data\nPlease refer to Note 26 of the Notes to

largely dependent on its net interest income. Net interest income is susceptible to interest rate risk to the extent that interest-bearing liabilities mature or re-price on a different basis than interest-earning assets. When interest-bearing liabilities mature or re-price more quickly than interest-earning assets in a given period, a significant increase in market rates of interest could adversely affect net interest income. Similarly, when interest-earning assets mature or re-price more quickly than interest-bearing liabilities, falling interest rates could result in a decrease in net interest income. Net interest income is also affected by changes in the portion of interest-earning assets that are funded by interest-bearing liabilities rather than by other sources of funds, such as noninterest-bearing deposits and stockholders' equity.\nThe Company's interest rate risk management goals are (1) to increase net interest income at a growth rate consistent with the growth rate of total assets, and (2) to minimize fluctuations in net interest margin as a percentage of interest-earning assets. Management attempts to achieve these goals by balancing, within policy limits, the volume of floating-rate liabilities with a similar volume of floating-rate assets; by keeping the average maturity of fixed-rate asset and liability contracts reasonably matched; by maintaining a pool of administered core deposits; and by adjusting pricing rates to market conditions on a continuing basis.\nThe Company's Board of Directors has established a comprehensive asset liability management policy, which is administered by management's Asset Liability Management Committee ( ALCO\u201d). The policy establishes limits on risk, which are quantitative measures of the percentage change in net interest income (a measure of net interest income at risk) and the fair value of equity capital (a measure of economic value of equity or EVE\u201d at risk) resulting from a hypothetical change in the yield curve of U.S. Treasury interest rates for maturities from one day to thirty years. The Company evaluates the potential adverse impacts that changing interest rates may have on its short-term earnings, long-term value, and liquidity by outsourcing simulation analysis through the use of computer modeling. The simulation model captures optionality factors such as call features and interest rate caps and floors imbedded in investment and loan portfolio contracts. As with any method of gauging interest rate risk, there are certain shortcomings inherent in the interest rate modeling methodology used by the Company. When interest rates change, actual movements in different categories of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities, loan prepayments, and withdrawals of time and other deposits, may deviate significantly from assumptions used in the model. As an example, certain money market deposit accounts are assumed to reprice at 50% of the interest rate change in each of the up rate shock scenarios even though this is not a contractual requirement. As a practical matter, management would likely lag the impact of any upward movement in market rates on these accounts as a mechanism to manage the Company's net interest margin. Finally, the methodology does not measure or reflect the impact that higher rates may have on adjustable-rate loan customers' ability to service their debts, or the impact of rate changes on demand for loan, lease, and deposit products.\nThe Company presents a current base case and several alternative simulations at least once a quarter and reports the analysis to the Board of Directors. In addition, more frequent forecasts could be produced when interest rates are particularly uncertain or when other business conditions so dictate.\nThe statement of condition is subject to quarterly testing for six alternative interest rate shock possibilities to indicate the inherent interest rate risk. Average interest rates are shocked by +/- 100, 200, 300 and 400 basis points ( bp\u201d), although the Company may elect not to use particular scenarios that it determines are impractical in a current rate environment. It is management's goal to structure the balance sheet so that net interest earnings at risk over a twelve-month period and the economic value of equity at risk do not exceed policy guidelines at the various interest rate shock levels.\nMeasures of net interest income at risk produced by simulation analysis are indicators of an institution's short-term performance in alternative rate environments. These measures are typically based upon a relatively brief period, usually one year. They do not necessarily indicate the long-term prospects or economic value of the institution.\nTable 94: <table> <tr> <td>Estimated Changes in Net Interest Income </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Change in Interest Rates: </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>+400 bp </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>+300 bp </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>+200 bp </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>+100 bp </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>-100 bp </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>-200 bp </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Policy Limit </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>40.00 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>30.00 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>20.00 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>10.00 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(10.00 </td> <td>)% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(20.00 </td> <td>)% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>December 31, 2017 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3.2 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2.5 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1.8 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.9 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(6.9 </td> <td>)% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(12.8 </td> <td>)% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>December 31, 2016 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5.4 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4.1 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2.8 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1.5 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(6.2 </td> <td>)% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(10.6 </td> <td>)% </td> </tr>\n</table>\nBased on our net interest income simulation as of December 31, 2017, net interest income is expected to increase as interest rates rise. The results of the simulation are well within the policy limits adopted by the Company. This is due in part to our strategy to maintain short investment portfolio durations. In addition, rising interest rates would drive higher rates on loans, and subsequently increase funding costs. However, lower interest rates would likely cause a decline in net interest income as lower rates would lead to lower yields on loans and investment securities. Since deposit costs are already at low levels, lower interest rates are unlikely to significantly impact our funding costs. Based on our net interest income simulation as of December 31, 2017, net interest income sensitivity to changes in interest rates for the twelve months subsequent to December 31, 2017 was less sensitive compared to the sensitivity profile for the twelve months subsequent to December 31, 2016. The decline in sensitivity was partially due to changes in our balance sheet mix, including decreases in federal funds sold, floating rate commercial loans, and a shift from certificates of deposit and other time deposits to noninterest bearing deposits which drove down the Company's cost of funds and interest expense.\nTable 95: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>46 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe measures of equity value at risk indicate the ongoing economic value of the Company by considering the effects of changes in interest rates on all of the Company's cash flows, and by discounting the cash flows to estimate the present value of assets and liabilities. The difference between these discounted values of the assets and liabilities is the economic value of equity ( EVE\u201d), which, in theory, approximates the fair value of the Company's net assets.\nTable 96: <table> <tr> <td>Estimated Changes in Economic Value of Equity (EVE) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Change in Interest Rates: </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>+400 bp </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>+300 bp </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>+200 bp </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>+100 bp </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>-100 bp </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>-200 bp </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Policy Limit </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>25.00 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>20.00 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>15.00 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>10.00 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(20.00 </td> <td>)% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(35.00 </td> <td>)% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>December 31, 2017 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(1.7 </td> <td>)% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(0.7 </td> <td>)% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.4 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.6 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(6.1 </td> <td>)% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(17.1 </td> <td>)% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>December 31, 2016 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(0.5 </td> <td>)% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.3 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.9 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1.1 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(7.0 </td> <td>)% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(17.3 </td> <td>)% </td> </tr>\n</table>\nBased on our EVE simulation as of December 31, 2017, equity is expected to increase as interest rates rise in all scenarios other than the 300bp and 400bp increase and will decline as interest rates decrease. The results of the simulation are well within the policy limits adopted by the Company. The decrease in the EVE at risk from December 31, 2016 to December 31, 2017 primarily resulted from significant loan growth for the Bank which experienced increased rates on the new loan volume, while deposit rates remained unchanged at historically low levels. This resulted in a lower EVE as loans became less valuable and deposits became more valuable.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nIn the normal course of business, to meet the financing needs of its customers, the Bank is party to financial instruments with off-balance sheet risk. These financial instruments include commitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit. The Bank's exposure to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by the other party to these financial instruments is represented by the contractual amount of the instruments. The Bank uses the same credit policies in making commitments and conditional obligations as they use for on-balance sheet instruments. The Bank generally requires collateral or other security to support the financial instruments with credit risk. The amount of collateral or other security is determined based on management's credit evaluation of the counterparty. The Bank evaluates each customer's creditworthiness on a case-by-case basis.\nCommitments to extend credit are agreements to lend to a customer as long as there is no violation of any condition established in the contract. Letters of credit are conditional commitments issued by the Bank to guarantee the performance of a customer to a third party. Letters of credit and other commitments generally have fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses and may require payment of a fee. Because many of the letters of credit and commitments are expected to expire without being drawn upon, the total commitment amount does not necessarily represent future cash requirements. Further information about these arrangements is provided in Note 22 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nManagement does not believe that any of the foregoing arrangements have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that is material to investors.\nLiquidity Management\nLiquidity describes our ability to meet financial obligations that arise during the normal course of business. Liquidity is primarily needed to meet the borrowing and deposit withdrawal requirements of customers and to fund current and planned expenditures. Liquidity is derived through increased customer deposits, maturities in the investment portfolio, loan repayments and income from earning assets. To the extent that deposits are not adequate to fund customer loan demand, liquidity needs can be met in the short-term funds markets. We have arrangements with correspondent banks whereby we have $15 million available in federal funds lines of credit and a reverse repurchase agreement available to meet any short-term needs which may not otherwise be funded by the Banks' portfolio of readily marketable investments that can be converted to cash. The Bank is also a member of the FHLB, which provides another source of liquidity, and had credit availability of approximately $205.6 million from the FHLB as of December 31, 2017.\nAt December 31, 2017, our loan to deposit ratio was approximately 90.9%, higher than the 87.4% at year-end 2016. Investment securities available for sale totaling $197.0 million at the end of 2017 were available for the management of liquidity and interest rate risk. The comparable amount was $163.8 million at December 31, 2016. Cash and cash equivalents were $31.8 million at December 31, 2017, a decrease of $44.1 million, or 58.1%, compared to the $75.9 million at year-end 2016, which reflects the utilization of liquidity for funding loan growth in 2017. Management is not aware of any demands, commitments, events or uncertainties that will materially affect our ability to maintain liquidity at satisfactory levels.\nWe have various financial obligations, including contractual obligations and commitments that may require future cash payments. The following table presents significant fixed and determinable contractual obligations to third parties by payment date as of December 31, 2017.\nTable 97: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Within </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>One to </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Three to </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Over </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>(Dollars in thousands) </td> <td> </td> <td>one year </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>three years </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>five years </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>five years </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Total </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Deposits without a stated maturity </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>939,966 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>939,966 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Time deposits </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>142,880 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>70,285 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>48,579 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,071 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>262,815 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Operating leases </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>43 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,151 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>865 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,130 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4,189 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Purchase obligations </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,863 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,771 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>109 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>916 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5,659 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Total </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,085,752 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>73,207 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>49,553 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>4,117 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,212,629 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 98: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>47 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 99: <table> <tr> <td>", "item_7_truncated": "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nThe following discussion compares the Company's financial condition at December 31, 2017 to its financial condition at December 31, 2016 and the results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016, and 2015. This discussion should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements and the Notes thereto appearing in Item 8 of Part II of this annual report.\nPERFORMANCE OVERVIEW\nThe Company recorded net income of $11.26 million for 2017, net income of $9.64 million for 2016, and net income of $7.11 million for 2015. The basic and diluted income per share was $0.89 for 2017, $0.76 for 2016, and $0.56 for 2015. When comparing 2017 to 2016 and 2015, earnings were significantly improved due to increases in net interest income and noninterest income, partially offset by increase in provision for credit losses and noninterest expenses.\nTotal assets were $1.394 billion at December 31, 2017, a $233.6 million, or 20.1%, increase when compared to the $1.160 billion at December 31, 2016. The primary factor contributing to the increase was the acquisition of three branches in the second quarter of 2017 which contributed $192.7 million of assets at December 31, 2017. Absent the branch acquisition, total assets have increased $40.9 million since December 31, 2016 which primarily resulted from increases in both gross loans of $113.9 million and investment securities of $33.2 million.\nTotal deposits increased $205.3 million, or 20.6%, to $1.203 billion at December 31, 2017. The increase was the direct result of the deposits acquired in the branch purchase which had a balance of $187.0 million at December 31, 2017. Excluding the acquisition, deposits increased $18.3 million. Total stockholders' equity increased $9.5 million, or 6.1%, to $163.7 million, or 11.75% of total assets at December 31, 2017.\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES\nThe Company's consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with GAAP and follow general practices within the industries in which it operates. Application of these principles requires management to make estimates, assumptions, and judgments that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes. These estimates, assumptions, and judgments are based on information available as of the date of the financial statements; accordingly, as this information changes, the financial statements could reflect different estimates, assumptions, and judgments. Certain policies inherently have a greater reliance on the use of estimates, assumptions, and judgments and as such have a greater possibility of producing results that could be materially different than originally reported. Estimates, assumptions, and judgments are necessary when assets and liabilities are required to be recorded at fair value, when a decline in the value of an asset not carried on the financial statements at fair value warrants an impairment write-down or valuation reserve to be established, or when an asset or liability needs to be recorded contingent upon a future event. Carrying assets and liabilities at fair value inherently results in more financial statement volatility. The fair values and the information used to record valuation adjustments for certain assets and liabilities are based on quoted market prices, collateral value or are provided by other third-party sources, when available.\nThe most significant accounting policies that the Company follows are presented in Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. These policies, along with the disclosures presented in the notes to the financial statements and in this discussion, provide information on how significant assets and liabilities are valued in the financial statements and how those values are determined. Based on the valuation techniques used and the sensitivity of financial statement amounts to the methods, assumptions, and estimates underlying those amounts, management has determined that the accounting policies with respect to the allowance for credit losses, goodwill and other intangible assets, deferred tax assets, and fair value are critical accounting policies. These policies are considered critical because they relate to accounting areas that require the most subjective or complex judgments, and, as such, could be most subject to revision as new information becomes available.\nThe allowance for credit losses represents management's estimate of credit losses inherent in the loan portfolio as of the balance sheet date. Determining the amount of the allowance for credit losses is considered a critical accounting estimate because it requires significant judgment and the use of estimates related to the amount and timing of expected future cash flows on impaired loans, estimated losses on pools of homogeneous loans based on historical loss experience, and consideration of current economic trends and conditions, all of which may be susceptible to significant change. The loan portfolio also represents the largest asset type on the consolidated balance sheets. Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements describes the methodology used to determine the allowance for credit losses. A discussion of the factors driving changes in the amount of the allowance for credit losses is included in the Asset Quality - Provision for Credit Losses and Risk Management section below.\nGoodwill represents the excess of the cost of an acquisition over the fair value of the net assets acquired. Other intangible assets represent purchased assets that also lack physical substance but can be distinguished from goodwill because of contractual or other legal rights or because the asset is capable of being sold or exchanged either on its own or in combination with a related contract, asset or liability. Goodwill and other intangible assets are required to be recorded at fair value at inception. Determining fair value is subjective, requiring the use of estimates, assumptions and management judgment. Goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives are tested at least annually for impairment, usually during the third quarter, or on an interim basis if circumstances dictate. Intangible assets that have finite lives are amortized over their estimated useful lives and also are subject to impairment testing. Impairment testing requires that the fair value of each of the Company's reporting units be compared to the carrying amount of its net assets, including goodwill. The Company's reporting units were identified based on an analysis of each of its individual operating segments (i.e., the Bank and Insurance Subsidiaries). If the fair value of a reporting unit is less than book value, an expense may be required to write down the related goodwill or purchased intangibles to record an impairment loss.\n 32 \nDeferred tax assets and liabilities are determined by applying the applicable federal and state income tax rates to cumulative temporary differences. These temporary differences represent differences between financial statement carrying amounts and the corresponding tax bases of certain assets and liabilities. Deferred taxes result from such temporary differences. A valuation allowance, if needed, reduces deferred tax assets to the expected amount most likely to be realized. Realization of deferred tax assets is dependent on the generation of a sufficient level of future taxable income, recoverable taxes paid in prior years and tax planning strategies. The Company evaluates all positive and negative evidence before determining if a valuation allowance is deemed necessary regarding the realization of deferred tax assets.\nThe Company measures certain financial assets and liabilities at fair value, with the measurements made on a recurring or nonrecurring basis. Significant financial instruments measured at fair value on a recurring basis are investment securities. Impaired loans and other real estate owned are significant financial instruments measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis. Fair value is defined as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. In determining fair value, the Company is required to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs, reducing subjectivity.\nRECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS AND DEVELOPMENTS\nNote 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements discusses new accounting policies that the Company adopted during 2017 and the expected impact of accounting policies recently issued or proposed but not yet required to be adopted. To the extent the adoption of new accounting standards materially affects our financial condition, results of operations or liquidity, the impacts are discussed in the applicable section(s) of this discussion and Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nNet Interest Income and Net Interest Margin\nNet interest income remains the most significant factor affecting our results of operations. Net interest income represents the excess of interest and fees earned on total average earning assets (loans, investment securities, federal funds sold and interest-bearing deposits with other banks) over interest owed on average interest-bearing liabilities (deposits and borrowings). Tax-equivalent net interest income is net interest income adjusted for the tax-favored status of income from certain loans and investments. As shown in the table below, tax-equivalent net interest income for 2017 was $45.8 million. This represented a $7.3 million, or 19.0%, increase from 2016, and net interest income increased $2.8 million, or 8.0%, for 2016 when compared to 2015. The increase in net interest income when comparing 2017 to 2016 was primarily the result of higher average balances on loans and lower rates paid on time deposits. Although the yields on loans declined compared to 2016, the funding of loan growth with lower yielding assets, coupled with higher yielding investment securities resulted in a higher overall yield on earning assets. The increase when comparing 2016 to 2015 was due to significant loan growth, which was funded by lower yielding assets and lower cost liabilities. When comparing 2017 to 2016, interest income increased $7.2 million while interest expense decreased $130 thousand. When comparing 2016 to 2015, interest income increased $1.9 million while interest expense decreased $943 thousand.\nOur net interest margin (i.e., tax-equivalent net interest income divided by average earning assets) represents the net yield on earning assets minus the cost of liabilities. The net interest margin is managed through loan and deposit pricing and asset/liability strategies. The net interest margin was 3.76% for 2017, 3.56% for 2016, and 3.43% for 2015. The net interest margin increased when comparing 2017 to 2016 due to the significant increase in the average balance of loans, higher yields on investment securities and a decrease in rates paid on interest bearing deposits. The net interest margin increased when comparing 2016 to 2015 due to an increase in the average balance of loans and lower rates paid on interest-bearing deposits. The net interest spread, which is the difference between the average yield on earning assets and the rate paid for interest-bearing liabilities, was 3.67% for 2017, 3.46% for 2016 and 3.31% for 2015.\n 33 \nThe following table sets forth the major components of net interest income, on a tax-equivalent basis, for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016, and 2015.\nTable 67: <table> <tr> <td>

using the statutory federal income tax rate of 35%, exclusive of the alternative minimum tax rate and nondeductible interest expense. The tax-equivalent adjustment amounts used in the above table to compute yields aggregated $242 thousand in 2017, $198 thousand in 2016 and $80 thousand in 2015.\n(2) Average loan balances include nonaccrual loans.\n(3) Interest income on loans includes amortized loan fees, net of costs, and all are included in the yield calculations.\nOn a tax-equivalent basis, total interest income was $48.0 million for 2017 compared to $40.9 million for 2016. The increase in interest income for 2017 compared to 2016 was primarily due to the increase in the average balance of loans coupled with a higher yield on taxable investment securities. Interest income on taxable investment securities increased $652 thousand or 20.4% in 2017 compared to 2016. In addition, interest-bearing deposits increased due to three fed fund rate hikes of 25bps during 2017. For 2017 compared to 2016, average loans increased $158.0 million and the yield earned on loans decreased 6 basis points. The increased volume of loans and the higher yield on loans purchased in the branch acquisition during the second quarter of 2017, outweighed the decline in the yield on originated loans resulting in an increase in tax-equivalent interest income of $6.5 million. Also impacting interest income is the accretion of acquisition accounting adjustments from the branch acquisition for loans of $420 thousand which is accounted for using a level yield method. In addition, the accretion on certificates of deposits acquired from the branch purchase, decreased interest expense by $86 thousand. Excluding average nonaccrual loans, the yield on loans would have been 4.49%, 4.59% and 4.79% for 2017, 2016, and 2015, respectively.\n 34 \nOn a tax-equivalent basis, total interest income was $40.9 million for 2016 compared to $39.0 million for 2015. The increase in interest income for 2016 compared to 2015 was primarily due to the increase in the average balance of loans coupled with an increase in the fed funds rate at the end of 2016 of 25bps. Interest income on taxable securities decreased $407 thousand or 11.3% in 2016 compared to 2015 due to a decrease in the average balance of $35.9 million which was used to fund loan growth. For 2016 compared to 2015, average loans increased $77.4 million and the yield earned on loans decreased 19 basis points. The increased volume of loans outweighed the decline in the yield resulting in an increase in interest income of $2.1 million.\nAs a percentage of total average earning assets, loans, investment securities, and interest-bearing deposits were 80.9%, 16.6%, and 2.5%, respectively, for 2017 which reflected an increase in higher-yielding earning assets when compared to 2016. The comparable percentages for 2016 were 76.4%, 18.2%, and 5.4%, respectively, and for 2015 were 72.2%, 22.4%, and 5.4%, respectively. When comparing 2017 to 2016, the overall increase in average balances of earning assets produced $7.1 million more in interest income and the decrease in yields on loans were offset by higher yields on taxable investment securities and interest-bearing deposits which produced $129 thousand more in interest income, as seen in the Rate/Volume Variance Analysis below. When comparing 2016 to 2015, the overall increase in average balances of earning assets produced $3.0 million more in interest income and the decrease in yields on earning assets produced $1.1 million less in interest income, as seen in the Rate/Volume Variance Analysis below.\nThe following table sets forth the average balance of the components of average earning assets as a percentage of total average earning assets for the year ended December 31.\nTable 69: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2017 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2016 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2015 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2014 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2013 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Loans </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>80.9 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>76.4 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>72.2 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>71.1 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>76.0 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Loans held for sale </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.4 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Investment securities </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>16.6 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>18.2 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>22.4 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>20.0 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>13.8 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Federal funds sold </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.2 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.3 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.2 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.4 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Interest-bearing deposits with other banks </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2.5 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5.2 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5.1 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>8.7 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>9.4 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>100.0 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>100.0 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>100.0 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>100.0 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>100.0 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table>\nInterest expense was $2.3 million for 2017 compared to $2.4 million for 2016. The decline in interest expense for 2017 was primarily due to lower expense on certificates of deposit and other time deposits. Interest expense on certificates of deposit and other time deposits declined $398 thousand in 2017 when compared to 2016, the result of a decrease of $4.5 million in average balances and a decline of 13 basis points on rates paid on these deposits. The decrease in average certificates of deposits and other time deposits reflected the lower rates due to the Bank not increasing these rates in conjunction with a rising interest rate environment. The decrease in average certificates of deposit and other time deposits was mostly transitioned to non-interest bearing and money market and savings deposits which reflected average increases of $54.9 million and $74.6 million, respectively.\nInterest expense was $2.4 million for 2016 compared to $3.3 million for 2015. The decline in interest expense for 2016 was primarily due to lower expense on certificates of deposit and other time deposits. Interest expense on certificates of deposit and other time deposits declined $959 thousand in 2016 when compared to 2015, the result of a decrease of $37.3 million in average balances and a decline of 23 basis points on rates paid on these deposits. The decrease in average certificates of deposit and other time deposits reflected the lower rates due to current market conditions. The decrease in average certificates of deposit and other time deposits was mostly transitioned to non-interest bearing and money market and savings deposits which reflected average increases of $30.2 million and $21.6 million, respectively.\nDuring 2017, lower rates on interest-bearing liabilities produced $218 thousand less in interest expense and increased volume produced $88 thousand more in interest expense, as shown in the table below. In 2016, lower rates on interest-bearing liabilities produced $690 thousand less in interest expense and decreased volume produced $253 thousand less in interest expense.\n 35 \nThe following Rate/Volume Variance Analysis identifies the portion of the changes in tax-equivalent net interest income attributable to changes in volume of average balances or to changes in the yield on earning assets and rates paid on interest-bearing liabilities. The rate and volume variance for each category has been allocated on a consistent basis between rate and volume variances, based on a percentage of rate, or volume, variance to the sum of the absolute two variances.\nTable 71: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2017 over (under) 2016 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2016 over (under) 2015 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td>

The increase in noninterest income in 2017 when compared to 2016 was primarily due to increases in service charges on deposit accounts of $163 thousand, other fees on bank services of $381 thousand included in other noninterest income, insurance agency commissions of $286 thousand, a premium on an insurance investment of $387 thousand and trust and investment fee income of $90 thousand. These increases were partially offset by the absence of the sale of the credit card portfolio of $198 thousand in 2016.\nThe increase in noninterest income in 2016 when compared to 2015 was primarily due to increases in service charges on deposit accounts of $598 thousand, insurance agency commissions of $277 thousand, bank service and loan fees of $207 thousand and a gain on sale of the Bank's credit card portfolio of $198 thousand. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in trust and investment fee income of $185 thousand.\nThe following table summarizes our noninterest income for the years ended December 31.\nTable 72: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Years Ended </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Change from Prior Year </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2017/ 16 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2016/ 15 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>(Dollars in thousands) </td> <td> </td> <td>2017 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2016 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2015 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Amount </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Percent </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Amount </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Percent </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Service charges on deposit accounts </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>3,628 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>3,465 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2,867 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>163 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4.7 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>598 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>20.9 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Trust and investment fee income </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,532 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,442 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,627 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>90 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6.2 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(185 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(11.4 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Gains on sales and calls of investment securities </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>30 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(25 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(83.3 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>30 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>100.0 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Insurance agency commissions income </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>8,837 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>8,551 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>8,274 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>286 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3.3 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>277 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3.3 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Other noninterest income </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3,748 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3,157 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,648 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>591 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>18.7 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>509 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>19.2 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Total </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>17,750 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>16,645 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>15,416 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,105 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6.6 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,229 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>8.0 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\n 36 \nNoninterest Expense\nNoninterest expense increased $4.1 million, or 10.9%, in 2017 when compared to 2016 and decreased $203 thousand, or 0.5%, in 2016 when compared to 2015. The increase in noninterest expense in 2017 when compared to 2016 was primarily due to the branch purchase in the second quarter of 2017 which resulted in acquisition costs of $977 thousand and the cost of operating those branches for seven months. The operation of the additional purchased branches as well as the opening of a loan production office in Ocean City, MD in April of 2017 and a branch in Onley, VA in September of 2017 had an impact on nearly all noninterest expense accounts but had the most significant impact on salaries/wages and employee benefits of $693 thousand and $167 thousand, respectively. The most significant increases absent the operational costs from the additional branches were $1.7 million in salaries and wages due to accrued bonuses, incentive equity programs and a full year of pay increases from 2016 and $485 thousand in higher employer benefits due to more full-time employees and increased health care premiums.\nThe decrease in noninterest expense in 2016 when compared to 2015 was primarily due to a decline in legal and professional fees of $505 thousand and reduced FDIC insurance premiums of $518 thousand, partially offset by consolidation expenses for the former bank subsidiaries of $507 thousand and increases in write-downs on other real estate owned of $115 thousand and employee salaries/wages and employee benefits of $174 thousand. The increased legal and professional fees in 2016 were the direct result of management outsourcing its internal audit function which resulted in significant implementation costs. In addition, the lower FDIC insurance premiums over the prior period are the direct result of the upgraded regulatory status and financial performance of the former Talbot Bank in the second quarter of 2015 and an adjustment of the annual assessment in the third quarter of 2016.\nThe Company had 327 full-time equivalent employees at December 31, 2017, 287 full-time equivalent employees at

expense of $4.4 million for 2015. The effective tax rate was 43.1% for 2017, 39.4% for 2016 and 38.3% for 2015. The Company's income tax expense and its effective tax rate increased for 2017 from 2016 and 2015 primarily due to higher pretax income and the enactment of the Tax Act. Please refer to Note 16 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further information. The Company's future effective tax rate will be affected by the Tax Act. Effective in 2018, the Tax Act reduces the U.S. statutory corporate tax rate from 35% to 21% and creates new taxes on certain foreign-sourced earnings and certain related-party payments, which are referred to as the global intangible low-taxes income tax and the base erosion tax, respectively.\nREVIEW OF FINANCIAL CONDITION\nAsset and liability composition, capital resources, asset quality, market risk, interest sensitivity and liquidity are all factors that affect our financial condition. The following sections discuss each of these factors.\nAssets\nInterest-Bearing Deposits with Other Banks and Federal Funds Sold\nThe Company invests excess cash balances (i.e., the excess cash remaining after funding loans and investing in securities with deposits and borrowings) in interest-bearing accounts and federal funds sold offered by our correspondent banks. These liquid investments are maintained at a level that management believes is necessary to meet current liquidity needs. Total interest-bearing deposits with other banks and federal funds sold decreased $51.1 million from $61.3 million at December 31, 2016 to $10.3 million at December 31, 2017. This significant decrease was the direct result of funding a significant volume of new loans which closed late in the fourth quarter. Average interest-bearing deposits with other banks and federal funds sold decreased $27.4 million in 2017 and increased $1.8 million in 2016. The decrease in 2017 was due to higher period-end and average balances on loans which absorbed the excess liquidity in both average interest-bearing deposits with other banks and average balances on deposits. The increase in 2016 was due to higher period-end and average balances on deposits which resulted in excess liquidity for funding future loan growth.\n 37 \nInvestment Securities\nThe investment portfolio is structured to provide us with liquidity and also plays an important role in the overall management of interest rate risk. Investment securities available for sale are stated at estimated fair value based on quoted prices and may be sold as part of the asset/liability management strategy or which may be sold in response to changing interest rates. Net unrealized holding gains and losses on these securities are reported net of related income taxes as accumulated other comprehensive income, a separate component of stockholders' equity. Investment securities in the held to maturity category are stated at cost adjusted for amortization of premiums and accretion of discounts. We have the intent and current ability to hold such securities until maturity. At December 31, 2017, 97% of the portfolio was classified as available for sale and 3% as held to maturity, similar to the 96% and 4%, respectively, at December 31, 2016. The percentage of securities designated as available for sale reflects the amount that management believes is needed to support our anticipated growth and liquidity needs. With the exception of municipal securities, our general practice is to classify all newly-purchased securities as available for sale. On December 15, 2016, the Company bought $3.0 million in subordinated notes from a local regional bank which it intends to hold to maturity of December 30, 2026. We do not typically invest in derivative securities and held no such investments at December 31, 2017 or December 31, 2016. Total investment securities increased $32.6 million from $170.6 million at December 31, 2016 to $203.2 million at December 31, 2017. Average investment securities increased $5.6 million in 2017 due to receiving $81.2 million in cash from the branch acquisition in the second quarter of 2017 which was also utilized to fund our significant loan growth in the third and fourth quarters of 2017. The decrease in average investment securities of $36.1 million in 2016 from 2015 was due to funding new loan growth during 2016.\nInvestment securities available for sale were $197.0 million at the end of 2017 and $163.8 million at the end of 2016. Investment activity for 2017 included purchases of $53.5 million in mortgage-backed securities and $31.0 million in U.S. Government agencies, while investment activity for 2016 included purchases of $9.1 million in mortgage-backed securities and $9.0 million in U.S. Government agencies. At year-end 2017, 22.3% of the securities in the portfolio were U.S. Government agencies and 74.3% of the securities were mortgage-backed securities, compared to 20.9% and 78.7%, respectively, at year-end 2016. As seen in the table below, 38% of the available-for-sale portfolio will mature in over one through five years and 57% will mature in over ten years based on contractual maturities. The comparable amounts for 2016 were 10% and 73%, respectively. Our investments in mortgage-backed securities are issued or guaranteed by U.S. Government agencies or government-sponsored agencies.\nInvestment securities held to maturity totaled $6.2 million at December 31, 2017. The comparable amount was $6.8 million at December 31, 2016.\nThe following table sets forth the maturities and weighted average yields of the bond investment portfolio as of December 31, 2017.\nTable

federal tax rate of 35%.\nLoans\nThe loan portfolio is the primary source of our income. Loans totaled $1.1 billion at December 31, 2017, an increase of $222.0 million, or 25.5%, from 2016. Loans significantly increased in 2017 when compared to 2016 due to organic loan growth of $113.9 million, or 13.1% and acquired loans from the branch acquisition which contributed $108.1 million, or 12.4% at December 31, 2017. Most of our loans are secured by real estate and are classified as construction, residential or commercial real estate loans. The increase in loans was comprised of increases in commercial real estate loans of $82.2 million, or 21.5%, residential real estate loans of $73.4 million, or 22.5%, construction loans of $41.7 million, or 49.7% and commercial loans, which include financial and agricultural loans, of $24.8 million, or 34.3%. Consumer loans, which consist of a small percentage of the overall loan portfolio, decreased $232 thousand, or 3.5%, at December 31, 2017 compared to December 31, 2016.\n 38 \nAt December 31, 2017, the real estate loan portfolio was comprised of 11.5% construction, 36.5% residential real estate and 42.5% commercial real estate. That compares to 9.6%, 37.4% and 43.9%, respectively, at December 31, 2016. Commercial and consumer loans were 8.9% and 0.6%, respectively, of the portfolio at December 31, 2017 and 8.3% and 0.8%, respectively, at December 31, 2016. At December 31, 2017, 74.2% of the loan portfolio had fixed interest rates and 25.8% had adjustable interest rates, compared to 74.8% and 25.2%, respectively, at December 31, 2016. See the discussion below under the caption Asset Quality - Provision for Credit Losses and Risk Management\u201d and Note 4, Loans and Allowance for Credit Losses\u201d, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. At December 31, 2017 and 2016, the Company did not have any loans held for sale.

securities. Total deposits increased from $997.5 million at December 31, 2016 to $1.2 billion at December 31, 2017. The increase was the direct result of the deposits acquired in the branch purchase which had a balance of $187.0 million at December 31, 2017. Excluding the acquisition, deposits increased $18.3 million. These increases were reflected in noninterest-bearing deposits of $66.7 million as well as an increase in interest-bearing transaction accounts of $136.0 million and an increase in certificates of deposit and other time deposits of $2.6 million. Average interest-bearing deposits increased $90.7 million, or 19.7%, in 2017, compared to an increase of $34.8 million, or 8.2% in 2016. Average certificates of deposit and other time deposits decreased $4.5 million, or 1.6% in 2017, compared to a decrease of $37.3 million, or 11.9% in 2016. Average noninterest-bearing deposits increased $54.9 million, or 22.8%, in 2017, compared to an increase of $30.2 million, or 14.3% in 2016. Deposits provided funding for approximately 91.9%, 90.5% and 91.5% of average earning assets for 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively.\nAverage deposits increased for 2016 primarily in noninterest-bearing deposits and interest-bearing transaction accounts which increased $65.0 million, or 10.2%, partially offset by decreases in certificates of deposit and other time deposits of $37.3 million, or 11.9%. The increase in noninterest-bearing and interest-bearing transaction accounts reflected continued growth in our customer base and a shift from certificates of deposit and other time deposits providing lower yields than in 2015.\n 39 \nThe following table sets forth the average balances of deposits and the percentage of each category to total average deposits for the years ended December 31.\nTable 81: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Average Balances </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>(Dollars in thousands) </td> <td> </td> <td>2017 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2016 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2015 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Noninterest-bearing demand </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>296,283 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>26.5 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>241,357 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>24.7 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>211,171 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>22.2 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Interest-bearing deposits </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Demand </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>210,139 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>18.8 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>194,062 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>19.9 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>180,810 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>19.1 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Money market and savings </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>339,971 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>30.4 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>265,323 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>27.2 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>243,731 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>25.7 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Certificates of deposit, $100,000 to $249,999 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>91,373 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>8.2 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>98,397 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>10.1 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>149,181 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>15.7 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Certificates of deposit, $250,000 or more (1) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>27,350 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2.4 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>29,071 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3.0 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Other time deposits </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>152,959 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>13.7 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>148,671 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>15.2 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>164,239 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>17.3 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Total </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,118,075 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>100.0 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>976,881 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>100.0 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>949,132 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>100.0 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table>\n(1) Disclosure of $250,000 or more for 2015 were not separately reported.\nThe following table sets forth the maturity ranges of certificates of deposit with balances of $250,000 or more as of December 31, 2017.\nTable 82: <table> <tr> <td>(Dollars in thousands) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Three months or less </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>4,556 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Over three through 6 months </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,422 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Over 6 through 12 months </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5,035 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Over 12 months </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>13,019 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Total </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>24,032 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nShort-Term Borrowings\nShort-term borrowings generally consist of securities sold under agreements to repurchase and short-term borrowings from the FHLB. Securities sold under agreements to repurchase are issued in conjunction with cash management services for commercial depositors. We also borrow from the FHLB on a short-term basis and occasionally borrow from correspondent banks under federal fund lines of credit arrangements to meet short-term liquidity needs. At December 31, 2017 short-term borrowings included advances and repurchase agreements. At December 31, 2016 and 2015, short-term borrowings included only repurchase agreements.\nThe average balance of short-term borrowings decreased $1.2 million, or 21.3%, in 2017, while the average balance decreased $473 thousand, or 7.6%, in 2016. In the month of December 2017, the Company borrowed $21.7 million due to significant loan closures late in the month, otherwise there was not a substantial need for short-term borrowings to supplement deposits as a funding source during 2017 and 2016.\nThe following table sets forth our position with respect to short-term borrowings.\nTable 83: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2017 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2016 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2015 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Interest </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Interest </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Interest </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>(Dollars in thousands) </td> <td> </td> <td>Balance </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Rate </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Balance </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Rate </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Balance </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Rate </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Average outstanding for the year </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>4,524 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.68 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>5,753 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.24 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>6,226 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.24 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Outstanding at year end </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>21,734 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1.36 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3,203 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.25 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6,672 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.23 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Maximum outstanding at any month end </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>21,734 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>9,877 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>10,423 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nLong-Term Debt\nWe use long-term borrowings to meet longer term liquidity needs, specifically to fund loan growth when liquidity from deposit growth is not sufficient. The Company had no long-term debt at the end of 2017 and 2016.\nCapital Resources Management\nTotal stockholders' equity for the Company was $163.8 million at December 31, 2017, compared to $154.3 million at December 31, 2016. The increase in stockholders' equity in 2017 was primarily due to net income during the year which was offset by dividends paid to common stockholders. The ratio of period-end equity to total assets was 11.75% for 2017, as compared to 13.30% for 2016. This ratio declined primarily due to the branch acquisition which significantly increased total assets and intangible assets.\n 40 \nWe record unrealized holding gains (losses), net of tax, on investment securities available for sale as accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), a separate component of stockholders' equity. At December 31, 2017, the portion of the investment portfolio designated as available for sale\u201d had net unrealized holding (losses), net of tax, of ($1.3) million compared to net unrealized holding (losses), net of tax, of $(993) thousand at December 31, 2016.\nThe following table compares the Company's capital ratios to the minimum regulatory requirements as of December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015.\nTable 85: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Minimum </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Regulatory </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Requirements </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>(Dollars in thousands) </td> <td> </td> <td>2017 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2016 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2015 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>for 2017 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Common equity Tier 1 capital </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>132,370 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>140,897 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>126,024 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Tier 1 capital </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>132,370 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>140,897 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>126,024 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Tier 2 capital </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>10,082 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>9,027 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>8,619 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Total risk-based capital </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>142,452 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>149,924 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>134,643 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Net risk-weighted assets </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,112,259 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>893,116 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>807,807 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Adjusted average total assets </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,345,876 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,144,968 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,116,692 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Risk-based capital ratios: </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Common equity Tier 1 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>11.90 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>15.78 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>15.60 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5.75 </td> <td>*% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Tier 1 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>11.90 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>15.78 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>15.60 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>7.25 </td> <td>* </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Total capital </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>12.81 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>16.79 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>16.67 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>9.25 </td> <td>* </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Tier 1 leverage ratio </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>9.84 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>12.31 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>11.29 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4.00 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\n* includes phased in capital conservation buffer for 2017 of 1.25%\nSee Note 18 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information about the regulatory capital positions of the Company and the Bank.\nIn July 2013, U.S. federal banking agencies published the Basel III Capital Rules establishing a new comprehensive capital framework for U.S. banking organizations. The Basel III Capital Rules were effective for the Company on January 1, 2015 and will be fully phased in on January 1, 2019. When fully phased in on January 1, 2019, the Basel III Capital Rules will require the Company to maintain (i) a minimum ratio of CET1 to risk-weighted assets of at least 4.5%, plus a 2.5% capital conservation buffer,\u201d (ii) a minimum ratio of Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets of at least 6.0%, plus the capital conservation buffer, (iii) a minimum ratio of Total capital to risk-weighted assets of at least 8.0%, plus the capital conservation buffer and (iv) a minimum leverage ratio of 4%, calculated as the ratio of Tier 1 capital to average assets. The Basel III Capital Rules eliminate the inclusion of certain instruments, such as trust preferred securities, from Tier 1 capital. Instruments issued prior to May 19, 2010 will be grandfathered for companies with consolidated assets of $15 billion or less.\nThe capital conservation buffer is designed to absorb losses during periods of economic stress. Banking institutions with a ratio of CET1 to risk-weighted assets above the minimum but below the conservation buffer will face constraints on dividends, equity repurchases and compensation based on the amount of the shortfall. The implementation of the capital conservation buffer began on January 1, 2016 at 0.625% and will be phased in over a four-year period, increasing by that amount on each January 1, until it reaches 2.5% on January 1, 2019.\nThe Basel III Capital Rules also revise the prompt corrective action\u201d regulations by (i) introducing a CET1 ratio requirement at each level (other than critically undercapitalized), with the required CET1 ratio being 6.5% for well-capitalized status and (ii) increasing the minimum Tier 1 capital ratio requirement for each category (other than critically undercapitalized), with the minimum Tier 1 capital ratio for well-capitalized status being 8% (as compared to the prior 6%). The Basel III Capital Rules do not change the total risk-based capital requirement for any prompt corrective action category.\nThe Company currently meets all capital adequacy requirements under the Basel III Capital Rules as they became effective for the Company on January 1, 2015. For additional information regarding the Basel III Capital Rules, see Business - Supervision and Regulation - Capital Requirements.\u201d\n 41 \nAsset Quality - Provision for Credit Losses and Risk Management\nOriginating loans involves a degree of risk that credit losses will occur in varying amounts according to, among other factors, the types of loans being made, the credit-worthiness of the borrowers over the terms of the loans, the quality of the collateral for the loans, if any, as well as general economic conditions. Through the Company's and the Bank's Asset/Liability Management Committees, the Company's Audit Committee and the Company's Board actively reviews critical risk positions, including credit, market, liquidity and operational risk. The Company's goal in managing risk is to reduce earnings volatility, control exposure to unnecessary risk, and ensure appropriate returns for risk assumed. Senior members of management actively manage risk at the product level, supplemented with corporate level oversight through the Asset/Liability Management Committee and internal audit function. The risk management structure is designed to identify risk through a systematic process, enabling timely and appropriate action to avoid and mitigate risk.\nCredit risk is mitigated through loan portfolio diversification, limiting exposure to any single industry or customer, collateral protection, and prudent lending policies and underwriting criteria. The following discussion provides information and statistics on the overall quality of the Company's loan portfolio. Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements describes the accounting policies related to nonperforming loans (nonaccrual and delinquent 90 days or more), TDRs and loan charge-offs and describes the methodologies used to develop the allowance for credit losses, including the specific, formula and unallocated components (also discussed below). Management believes the policies governing nonperforming loans, TDRs and charge-offs are consistent with regulatory standards. The amount of the allowance for credit losses and the resulting provision are reviewed monthly by senior members of management and approved quarterly by the Board of Directors.\nThe allowance is increased by provisions for credit losses charged to expense and recoveries of loans previously charged off. It is decreased by loans charged off in the current period. Loans, or portions thereof, are charged off when considered uncollectible by management. Provisions for credit losses are made to bring the allowance for credit losses within the range of balances that are considered appropriate.\nThe adequacy of the allowance for credit losses is determined based on management's estimate of the inherent risks associated with lending activities, estimated fair value of collateral, past experience and present indicators such as loan delinquency trends, nonaccrual loans and current market conditions. Management believes the current allowance is adequate to provide for probable losses inherent in our loan portfolio; however, future changes in the composition of the loan portfolio and financial condition of borrowers may result in additions to the allowance. Examination of the portfolio and allowance by various regulatory agencies and consultants engaged by the Company may result in the need for additional provisions based on information available at the time of the examination. The Bank maintains a separate allowance for credit losses, which is only available to absorb losses from their respective loan portfolios. The allowance set by the Bank is subject to regulatory examination and determination as to its adequacy.\nThe allowance for credit losses is comprised of three parts: (i) the specific allowance; (ii) the historical formula allowance; and (iii) the qualitative formula allowance. The specific allowance is established against impaired loans until charge offs are made. Loans are considered impaired (i.e., nonaccrual loans and accruing TDRs) when it is probable that the Company will not collect all principal and interest payments according to the loan's contractual terms. The qualitative formula allowance is determined based on management's assessment of industry trends and economic factors in the markets in which we operate. The determination of the formula allowance involves a higher risk of uncertainty and considers current risk factors that may not have yet manifested themselves in our historical loss factors.\nThe specific allowance is used to individually allocate an allowance to loans identified as impaired. An impaired loan may involve deficiencies in the borrower's overall financial condition, payment history, support available from financial guarantors and/or the fair market value of collateral. If it is determined that there is a loss associated with an impaired loan, a specific allowance is established until a charge off is made. Impaired loans, or portions thereof, are charged off when deemed uncollectible.\nThe historical formula allowance is used to estimate the loss on internally risk-rated loans, exclusive of those identified as impaired. Loans are grouped by type (construction, residential real estate, commercial real estate, commercial or consumer). Each loan type is assigned allowance factors based on management's estimate of the risk, complexity and size of individual loans within a particular category using average historical charge-offs by segment over the last 16 quarters. Loans that are identified as pass-watch, special mention, substandard and doubtful are considered to have elevated credit risk.\nThe qualitative formula allowance is used to estimate the loss on loans stemming from more global factors such as delinquencies, loss history, trends in volume and terms of loans, effects of changes in lending policy, the experience and depth of management, national and local economic trends, concentrations of credit, the quality of the loan review system and the effect of external factors such as competition and regulatory requirements. These loans are assigned higher allowance factors than favorably rated loans due to management's concerns regarding collectability or management's knowledge of particular elements regarding the borrower.\nBecause most of our loans are secured by real estate, the lack of a meaningful upturn in real estate related activities in our local real estate market and construction industry and slow improvement in general economic conditions had a material adverse effect on the performance of our loan portfolio and the value of the collateral securing that portfolio between 2009 and 2013. Factors impeding our loan performance and overall financial performance included our levels of loan charge-offs and provisions for credit losses. However, we believe that the proactive measures we took in 2011, 2012 and 2013 to critically review our loan portfolio, take the necessary charge-offs, provide prudent reserves and engage in difficult but timely asset sales allowed us to focus on loan growth and improved earnings beginning in 2014.\n 42 \nOn May 19, 2017, the Bank purchased three branches which resulted in $122.9 million in loans being added to the Bank's portfolio. Management evaluated expected cash flows, prepayment speeds and estimated loss factors to measure fair values for the loans acquired. The Bank only acquired loans which were deemed to be performing loans with no signs of credit deterioration. The Bank re-evaluated these acquired loans during the fourth quarter of 2017 noting they remained in performing condition, therefore no allowance has been recorded as of December 31, 2017.\nAs seen in the table below, the provision for credit losses was $2.3 million for 2017, $1.8 million for 2016 and $2.1 million for 2015. The increase in the level of provision for credit losses in 2017 was primarily due to the significant growth in loans as compared to 2016. Net loan charge-offs totaled $1.2 million in 2017, $1.4 million in 2016 and $1.5 million in 2015. Real estate loans were 44%, 75% and 83% of total loans charged off during 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively and also due to the change in allowance methodology disclosed in Note 4 of the consolidated financial statements. Management deemed the change in methodology necessary due to the increase in loans migrating to the pass-watch risk rating category and due to the amount of unseasoned growth in the originated portfolio experienced in 2016 and 2017. The change in methodology resulted in $1.4 million in additional provision for credit losses.\nThe allowance for credit losses was $9.8 million, or 0.99% of average outstanding loans at December 31, 2017, compared to an allowance of $8.7 million, or 1.06% of average outstanding loans at December 31, 2016. The higher allowance at the end of 2017 when compared to the end of 2016 was the result of significant growth in the loan portfolio and the above referenced change in methodology. At December 31, 2015, the allowance for credit losses was $8.3 million, or 1.11% of average outstanding loans. The ratio of net charge-offs to average loans was 0.13% in 2017, 0.17% in 2016 and 0.19% in 2015.\nThe overall credit quality improved in 2017 compared to 2016 primarily due to continued workout efforts on outstanding problem loans many of which were TDRs and nonperforming assets. Management will continue to monitor and charge off nonperforming assets as rapidly as possible, and focus on the generation of healthy loan growth and new business development opportunities.\nThe following table sets forth a summary of our loan loss experience for the years ended December 31.\nTable 88: <table> <tr> <td>(Dollars in thousands) </td> <td> </td> <td>2017 </td> <td> </td> <td>

Similarly, accruing TDRs were $13.3 million at December 31, 2017, an increase of $326 thousand, or 2.5%, when compared to December 31, 2016. At December 31, 2017, the ratio of nonaccrual loans to total assets was 0.36%, improving from 0.77% at December 31, 2016. Likewise, the ratio of accruing TDRs to total assets at December 31, 2017 was 0.96%, decreasing from 1.12% at December 31, 2016. When comparing December 31, 2017 to December 31, 2016, the positive trend in nonperforming assets, as well as the corresponding asset quality ratios, was due to continued work-out efforts and loan charge-offs. The slight increase in accruing TDRs from December 31, 2016 to December 31, 2017, was due to legacy nonaccrual TDRs transferring to accruing TDRs which also represented improving credit quality.\nThe Company continues to focus on the resolution of its nonperforming and problem loans. The efforts to accomplish this goal include frequently contacting borrowers until the delinquency is cured or until an acceptable payment plan has been agreed upon; obtaining updated appraisals; provisioning for credit losses; charging off loans; transferring loans to other real estate owned; aggressively marketing other real estate owned; and selling loans. The reduction of nonperforming and problem loans is and will continue to be a high priority for the Company.\nSelected Quarterly Consolidated Financial Data\nPlease refer to Note 26 of the Notes to

</tr>\n</table>\n 45 \nMarket Risk Management and Interest Sensitivity\nThe Company's net income is largely dependent on its net interest income. Net interest income is susceptible to interest rate risk to the extent that interest-bearing liabilities mature or re-price on a different basis than interest-earning assets. When interest-bearing liabilities mature or re-price more quickly than interest-earning assets in a given period, a significant increase in market rates of interest could adversely affect net interest income. Similarly, when interest-earning assets mature or re-price more quickly than interest-bearing liabilities, falling interest rates could result in a decrease in net interest income. Net interest income is also affected by changes in the portion of interest-earning assets that are funded by interest-bearing liabilities rather than by other sources of funds, such as noninterest-bearing deposits and stockholders' equity.\nThe Company's interest rate risk management goals are (1) to increase net interest income at a growth rate consistent with the growth rate of total assets, and (2) to minimize fluctuations in net interest margin as a percentage of interest-earning assets. Management attempts to achieve these goals by balancing, within policy limits, the volume of floating-rate liabilities with a similar volume of floating-rate assets; by keeping the average maturity of fixed-rate asset and liability contracts reasonably matched; by maintaining a pool of administered core deposits; and by adjusting pricing rates to market conditions on a continuing basis.\nThe Company's Board of Directors has established a comprehensive asset liability management policy, which is administered by management's Asset Liability Management Committee ( ALCO\u201d). The policy establishes limits on risk, which are quantitative measures of the percentage change in net interest income (a measure of net interest income at risk) and the fair value of equity capital (a measure of economic value of equity or EVE\u201d at risk) resulting from a hypothetical change in the yield curve of U.S. Treasury interest rates for maturities from one day to thirty years. The Company evaluates the potential adverse impacts that changing interest rates may have on its short-term earnings, long-term value, and liquidity by outsourcing simulation analysis through the use of computer modeling. The simulation model captures optionality factors such as call features and interest rate caps and floors imbedded in investment and loan portfolio contracts. As with any method of gauging interest rate risk, there are certain shortcomings inherent in the interest rate modeling methodology used by the Company. When interest rates change, actual movements in different categories of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities, loan prepayments, and withdrawals of time and other deposits, may deviate significantly from assumptions used in the model. As an example, certain money market deposit accounts are assumed to reprice at 50% of the interest rate change in each of the up rate shock scenarios even though this is not a contractual requirement. As a practical matter, management would likely lag the impact of any upward movement in market rates on these accounts as a mechanism to manage the Company's net interest margin. Finally, the methodology does not measure or reflect the impact that higher rates may have on adjustable-rate loan customers' ability to service their debts, or the impact of rate changes on demand for loan, lease, and deposit products.\nThe Company presents a current base case and several alternative simulations at least once a quarter and reports the analysis to the Board of Directors. In addition, more frequent forecasts could be produced when interest rates are particularly uncertain or when other business conditions so dictate.\nThe statement of condition is subject to quarterly testing for six alternative interest rate shock possibilities to indicate the inherent interest rate risk. Average interest rates are shocked by +/- 100, 200, 300 and 400 basis points ( bp\u201d), although the Company may elect not to use particular scenarios that it determines are impractical in a current rate environment. It is management's goal to structure the balance sheet so that net interest earnings at risk over a twelve-month period and the economic value of equity at risk do not exceed policy guidelines at the various interest rate shock levels.\nMeasures of net interest income at risk produced by simulation analysis are indicators of an institution's short-term performance in alternative rate environments. These measures are typically based upon a relatively brief period, usually one year. They do not necessarily indicate the long-term prospects or economic value of the institution.\nTable 94: <table> <tr> <td>Estimated Changes in Net Interest Income </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Change in Interest Rates: </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>+400 bp </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>+300 bp </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>+200 bp </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>+100 bp </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>-100 bp </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>-200 bp </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Policy Limit </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>40.00 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>30.00 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>20.00 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>10.00 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(10.00 </td> <td>)% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(20.00 </td> <td>)% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>December 31, 2017 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3.2 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2.5 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1.8 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.9 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(6.9 </td> <td>)% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(12.8 </td> <td>)% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>December 31, 2016 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5.4 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4.1 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2.8 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1.5 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(6.2 </td> <td>)% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(10.6 </td> <td>)% </td> </tr>\n</table>\nBased on our net interest income simulation as of December 31, 2017, net interest income is expected to increase as interest rates rise. The results of the simulation are well within the policy limits adopted by the Company. This is due in part to our strategy to maintain short investment portfolio durations. In addition, rising interest rates would drive higher rates on loans, and subsequently increase funding costs. However, lower interest rates would likely cause a decline in net interest income as lower rates would lead to lower yields on loans and investment securities. Since deposit costs are already at low levels, lower interest rates are unlikely to significantly impact our funding costs. Based on our net interest income simulation as of December 31, 2017, net interest income sensitivity to changes in interest rates for the twelve months subsequent to December 31, 2017 was less sensitive compared to the sensitivity profile for the twelve months subsequent to December 31, 2016. The decline in sensitivity was partially due to changes in our balance sheet mix, including decreases in federal funds sold, floating rate commercial loans, and a shift from certificates of deposit and other time deposits to noninterest bearing deposits which drove down the Company's cost of funds and interest expense.\n 46 \nThe measures of equity value at risk indicate the ongoing economic value of the Company by considering the effects of changes in interest rates on all of the Company's cash flows, and by discounting the cash flows to estimate the present value of assets and liabilities. The difference between these discounted values of the assets and liabilities is the economic value of equity ( EVE\u201d), which, in theory, approximates the fair value of the Company's net assets.\nTable 96: <table> <tr> <td>Estimated Changes in Economic Value of Equity (EVE) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Change in Interest Rates: </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>+400 bp </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>+300 bp </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>+200 bp </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>+100 bp </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>-100 bp </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>-200 bp </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Policy Limit </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>25.00 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>20.00 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>15.00 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>10.00 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(20.00 </td> <td>)% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(35.00 </td> <td>)% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>December 31, 2017 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(1.7 </td> <td>)% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(0.7 </td> <td>)% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.4 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.6 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(6.1 </td> <td>)% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(17.1 </td> <td>)% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>December 31, 2016 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(0.5 </td> <td>)% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.3 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.9 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1.1 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(7.0 </td> <td>)% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(17.3 </td> <td>)% </td> </tr>\n</table>\nBased on our EVE simulation as of December 31, 2017, equity is expected to increase as interest rates rise in all scenarios other than the 300bp and 400bp increase and will decline as interest rates decrease. The results of the simulation are well within the policy limits adopted by the Company. The decrease in the EVE at risk from December 31, 2016 to December 31, 2017 primarily resulted from significant loan growth for the Bank which experienced increased rates on the new loan volume, while deposit rates remained unchanged at historically low levels. This resulted in a lower EVE as loans became less valuable and deposits became more valuable.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nIn the normal course of business, to meet the financing needs of its customers, the Bank is party to financial instruments with off-balance sheet risk. These financial instruments include commitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit. The Bank's exposure to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by the other party to these financial instruments is represented by the contractual amount of the instruments. The Bank uses the same credit policies in making commitments and conditional obligations as they use for on-balance sheet instruments. The Bank generally requires collateral or other security to support the financial instruments with credit risk. The amount of collateral or other security is determined based on management's credit evaluation of the counterparty. The Bank evaluates each customer's creditworthiness on a case-by-case basis.\nCommitments to extend credit are agreements to lend to a customer as long as there is no violation of any condition established in the contract. Letters of credit are conditional commitments issued by the Bank to guarantee the performance of a customer to a third party. Letters of credit and other commitments generally have fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses and may require payment of a fee. Because many of the letters of credit and commitments are expected to expire without being drawn upon, the total commitment amount does not necessarily represent future cash requirements. Further information about these arrangements is provided in Note 22 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nManagement does not believe that any of the foregoing arrangements have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that is material to investors.\nLiquidity Management\nLiquidity describes our ability to meet financial obligations that arise during the normal course of business. Liquidity is primarily needed to meet the borrowing and deposit withdrawal requirements of customers and to fund current and planned expenditures. Liquidity is derived through increased customer deposits, maturities in the investment portfolio, loan repayments and income from earning assets. To the extent that deposits are not adequate to fund customer loan demand, liquidity needs can be met in the short-term funds markets. We have arrangements with correspondent banks whereby we have $15 million available in federal funds lines of credit and a reverse repurchase agreement available to meet any short-term needs which may not otherwise be funded by the Banks' portfolio of readily marketable investments that can be converted to cash. The Bank is also a member of the FHLB, which provides another source of liquidity, and had credit availability of approximately $205.6 million from the FHLB as of December 31, 2017.\nAt December 31, 2017, our loan to deposit ratio was approximately 90.9%, higher than the 87.4% at year-end 2016. Investment securities available for sale totaling $197.0 million at the end of 2017 were available for the management of liquidity and interest rate risk. The comparable amount was $163.8 million at December 31, 2016. Cash and cash equivalents were $31.8 million at December 31, 2017, a decrease of $44.1 million, or 58.1%, compared to the $75.9 million at year-end 2016, which reflects the utilization of liquidity for funding loan growth in 2017. Management is not aware of any demands, commitments, events or uncertainties that will materially affect our ability to maintain liquidity at satisfactory levels.\nWe have various financial obligations, including contractual obligations and commitments that may require future cash payments. The following table presents significant fixed and determinable contractual obligations to third parties by payment date as of December 31, 2017.\nTable 97: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Within </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>One to </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Three to </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Over </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>(Dollars in thousands) </td> <td> </td> <td>one year </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>three years </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>five years </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>five years </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Total </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Deposits without a stated maturity </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>939,966 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>939,966 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Time deposits </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>142,880 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>70,285 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>48,579 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,071 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>262,815 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Operating leases </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>43 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,151 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>865 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,130 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4,189 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Purchase obligations </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,863 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,771 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>109 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>916 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5,659 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Total </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,085,752 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>73,207 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>49,553 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>4,117 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,212,629 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\n 47 \n ", "item_7_text": "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nThe following discussion compares the Company's financial condition at December 31, 2017 to its financial condition at December 31, 2016 and the results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016, and 2015. This discussion should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements and the Notes thereto appearing in Item 8 of Part II of this annual report.\nPERFORMANCE OVERVIEW\nThe Company recorded net income of $11.26 million for 2017, net income of $9.64 million for 2016, and net income of $7.11 million for 2015. The basic and diluted income per share was $0.89 for 2017, $0.76 for 2016, and $0.56 for 2015. When comparing 2017 to 2016 and 2015, earnings were significantly improved due to increases in net interest income and noninterest income, partially offset by increase in provision for credit losses and noninterest expenses.\nTotal assets were $1.394 billion at December 31, 2017, a $233.6 million, or 20.1%, increase when compared to the $1.160 billion at December 31, 2016. The primary factor contributing to the increase was the acquisition of three branches in the second quarter of 2017 which contributed $192.7 million of assets at December 31, 2017. Absent the branch acquisition, total assets have increased $40.9 million since December 31, 2016 which primarily resulted from increases in both gross loans of $113.9 million and investment securities of $33.2 million.\nTotal deposits increased $205.3 million, or 20.6%, to $1.203 billion at December 31, 2017. The increase was the direct result of the deposits acquired in the branch purchase which had a balance of $187.0 million at December 31, 2017. Excluding the acquisition, deposits increased $18.3 million. Total stockholders' equity increased $9.5 million, or 6.1%, to $163.7 million, or 11.75% of total assets at December 31, 2017.\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES\nThe Company's consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with GAAP and follow general practices within the industries in which it operates. Application of these principles requires management to make estimates, assumptions, and judgments that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes. These estimates, assumptions, and judgments are based on information available as of the date of the financial statements; accordingly, as this information changes, the financial statements could reflect different estimates, assumptions, and judgments. Certain policies inherently have a greater reliance on the use of estimates, assumptions, and judgments and as such have a greater possibility of producing results that could be materially different than originally reported. Estimates, assumptions, and judgments are necessary when assets and liabilities are required to be recorded at fair value, when a decline in the value of an asset not carried on the financial statements at fair value warrants an impairment write-down or valuation reserve to be established, or when an asset or liability needs to be recorded contingent upon a future event. Carrying assets and liabilities at fair value inherently results in more financial statement volatility. The fair values and the information used to record valuation adjustments for certain assets and liabilities are based on quoted market prices, collateral value or are provided by other third-party sources, when available.\nThe most significant accounting policies that the Company follows are presented in Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. These policies, along with the disclosures presented in the notes to the financial statements and in this discussion, provide information on how significant assets and liabilities are valued in the financial statements and how those values are determined. Based on the valuation techniques used and the sensitivity of financial statement amounts to the methods, assumptions, and estimates underlying those amounts, management has determined that the accounting policies with respect to the allowance for credit losses, goodwill and other intangible assets, deferred tax assets, and fair value are critical accounting policies. These policies are considered critical because they relate to accounting areas that require the most subjective or complex judgments, and, as such, could be most subject to revision as new information becomes available.\nThe allowance for credit losses represents management's estimate of credit losses inherent in the loan portfolio as of the balance sheet date. Determining the amount of the allowance for credit losses is considered a critical accounting estimate because it requires significant judgment and the use of estimates related to the amount and timing of expected future cash flows on impaired loans, estimated losses on pools of homogeneous loans based on historical loss experience, and consideration of current economic trends and conditions, all of which may be susceptible to significant change. The loan portfolio also represents the largest asset type on the consolidated balance sheets. Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements describes the methodology used to determine the allowance for credit losses. A discussion of the factors driving changes in the amount of the allowance for credit losses is included in the Asset Quality - Provision for Credit Losses and Risk Management section below.\nGoodwill represents the excess of the cost of an acquisition over the fair value of the net assets acquired. Other intangible assets represent purchased assets that also lack physical substance but can be distinguished from goodwill because of contractual or other legal rights or because the asset is capable of being sold or exchanged either on its own or in combination with a related contract, asset or liability. Goodwill and other intangible assets are required to be recorded at fair value at inception. Determining fair value is subjective, requiring the use of estimates, assumptions and management judgment. Goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives are tested at least annually for impairment, usually during the third quarter, or on an interim basis if circumstances dictate. Intangible assets that have finite lives are amortized over their estimated useful lives and also are subject to impairment testing. Impairment testing requires that the fair value of each of the Company's reporting units be compared to the carrying amount of its net assets, including goodwill. The Company's reporting units were identified based on an analysis of each of its individual operating segments (i.e., the Bank and Insurance Subsidiaries). If the fair value of a reporting unit is less than book value, an expense may be required to write down the related goodwill or purchased intangibles to record an impairment loss.\n 32 \nDeferred tax assets and liabilities are determined by applying the applicable federal and state income tax rates to cumulative temporary differences. These temporary differences represent differences between financial statement carrying amounts and the corresponding tax bases of certain assets and liabilities. Deferred taxes result from such temporary differences. A valuation allowance, if needed, reduces deferred tax assets to the expected amount most likely to be realized. Realization of deferred tax assets is dependent on the generation of a sufficient level of future taxable income, recoverable taxes paid in prior years and tax planning strategies. The Company evaluates all positive and negative evidence before determining if a valuation allowance is deemed necessary regarding the realization of deferred tax assets.\nThe Company measures certain financial assets and liabilities at fair value, with the measurements made on a recurring or nonrecurring basis. Significant financial instruments measured at fair value on a recurring basis are investment securities. Impaired loans and other real estate owned are significant financial instruments measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis. Fair value is defined as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. In determining fair value, the Company is required to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs, reducing subjectivity.\nRECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS AND DEVELOPMENTS\nNote 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements discusses new accounting policies that the Company adopted during 2017 and the expected impact of accounting policies recently issued or proposed but not yet required to be adopted. To the extent the adoption of new accounting standards materially affects our financial condition, results of operations or liquidity, the impacts are discussed in the applicable section(s) of this discussion and Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nNet Interest Income and Net Interest Margin\nNet interest income remains the most significant factor affecting our results of operations. Net interest income represents the excess of interest and fees earned on total average earning assets (loans, investment securities, federal funds sold and interest-bearing deposits with other banks) over interest owed on average interest-bearing liabilities (deposits and borrowings). Tax-equivalent net interest income is net interest income adjusted for the tax-favored status of income from certain loans and investments. As shown in the table below, tax-equivalent net interest income for 2017 was $45.8 million. This represented a $7.3 million, or 19.0%, increase from 2016, and net interest income increased $2.8 million, or 8.0%, for 2016 when compared to 2015. The increase in net interest income when comparing 2017 to 2016 was primarily the result of higher average balances on loans and lower rates paid on time deposits. Although the yields on loans declined compared to 2016, the funding of loan growth with lower yielding assets, coupled with higher yielding investment securities resulted in a higher overall yield on earning assets. The increase when comparing 2016 to 2015 was due to significant loan growth, which was funded by lower yielding assets and lower cost liabilities. When comparing 2017 to 2016, interest income increased $7.2 million while interest expense decreased $130 thousand. When comparing 2016 to 2015, interest income increased $1.9 million while interest expense decreased $943 thousand.\nOur net interest margin (i.e., tax-equivalent net interest income divided by average earning assets) represents the net yield on earning assets minus the cost of liabilities. The net interest margin is managed through loan and deposit pricing and asset/liability strategies. The net interest margin was 3.76% for 2017, 3.56% for 2016, and 3.43% for 2015. The net interest margin increased when comparing 2017 to 2016 due to the significant increase in the average balance of loans, higher yields on investment securities and a decrease in rates paid on interest bearing deposits. The net interest margin increased when comparing 2016 to 2015 due to an increase in the average balance of loans and lower rates paid on interest-bearing deposits. The net interest spread, which is the difference between the average yield on earning assets and the rate paid for interest-bearing liabilities, was 3.67% for 2017, 3.46% for 2016 and 3.31% for 2015.\n 33 \nThe following table sets forth the major components of net interest income, on a tax-equivalent basis, for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016, and 2015.\n\n(1) All amounts are reported on a tax-equivalent basis computed using the statutory federal income tax rate of 35%, exclusive of the alternative minimum tax rate and nondeductible interest expense. The tax-equivalent adjustment amounts used in the above table to compute yields aggregated $242 thousand in 2017, $198 thousand in 2016 and $80 thousand in 2015.\n(2) Average loan balances include nonaccrual loans.\n(3) Interest income on loans includes amortized loan fees, net of costs, and all are included in the yield calculations.\nOn a tax-equivalent basis, total interest income was $48.0 million for 2017 compared to $40.9 million for 2016. The increase in interest income for 2017 compared to 2016 was primarily due to the increase in the average balance of loans coupled with a higher yield on taxable investment securities. Interest income on taxable investment securities increased $652 thousand or 20.4% in 2017 compared to 2016. In addition, interest-bearing deposits increased due to three fed fund rate hikes of 25bps during 2017. For 2017 compared to 2016, average loans increased $158.0 million and the yield earned on loans decreased 6 basis points. The increased volume of loans and the higher yield on loans purchased in the branch acquisition during the second quarter of 2017, outweighed the decline in the yield on originated loans resulting in an increase in tax-equivalent interest income of $6.5 million. Also impacting interest income is the accretion of acquisition accounting adjustments from the branch acquisition for loans of $420 thousand which is accounted for using a level yield method. In addition, the accretion on certificates of deposits acquired from the branch purchase, decreased interest expense by $86 thousand. Excluding average nonaccrual loans, the yield on loans would have been 4.49%, 4.59% and 4.79% for 2017, 2016, and 2015, respectively.\n 34 \nOn a tax-equivalent basis, total interest income was $40.9 million for 2016 compared to $39.0 million for 2015. The increase in interest income for 2016 compared to 2015 was primarily due to the increase in the average balance of loans coupled with an increase in the fed funds rate at the end of 2016 of 25bps. Interest income on taxable securities decreased $407 thousand or 11.3% in 2016 compared to 2015 due to a decrease in the average balance of $35.9 million which was used to fund loan growth. For 2016 compared to 2015, average loans increased $77.4 million and the yield earned on loans decreased 19 basis points. The increased volume of loans outweighed the decline in the yield resulting in an increase in interest income of $2.1 million.\nAs a percentage of total average earning assets, loans, investment securities, and interest-bearing deposits were 80.9%, 16.6%, and 2.5%, respectively, for 2017 which reflected an increase in higher-yielding earning assets when compared to 2016. The comparable percentages for 2016 were 76.4%, 18.2%, and 5.4%, respectively, and for 2015 were 72.2%, 22.4%, and 5.4%, respectively. When comparing 2017 to 2016, the overall increase in average balances of earning assets produced $7.1 million more in interest income and the decrease in yields on loans were offset by higher yields on taxable investment securities and interest-bearing deposits which produced $129 thousand more in interest income, as seen in the Rate/Volume Variance Analysis below. When comparing 2016 to 2015, the overall increase in average balances of earning assets produced $3.0 million more in interest income and the decrease in yields on earning assets produced $1.1 million less in interest income, as seen in the Rate/Volume Variance Analysis below.\nThe following table sets forth the average balance of the components of average earning assets as a percentage of total average earning assets for the year ended December 31.\n\nInterest expense was $2.3 million for 2017 compared to $2.4 million for 2016. The decline in interest expense for 2017 was primarily due to lower expense on certificates of deposit and other time deposits. Interest expense on certificates of deposit and other time deposits declined $398 thousand in 2017 when compared to 2016, the result of a decrease of $4.5 million in average balances and a decline of 13 basis points on rates paid on these deposits. The decrease in average certificates of deposits and other time deposits reflected the lower rates due to the Bank not increasing these rates in conjunction with a rising interest rate environment. The decrease in average certificates of deposit and other time deposits was mostly transitioned to non-interest bearing and money market and savings deposits which reflected average increases of $54.9 million and $74.6 million, respectively.\nInterest expense was $2.4 million for 2016 compared to $3.3 million for 2015. The decline in interest expense for 2016 was primarily due to lower expense on certificates of deposit and other time deposits. Interest expense on certificates of deposit and other time deposits declined $959 thousand in 2016 when compared to 2015, the result of a decrease of $37.3 million in average balances and a decline of 23 basis points on rates paid on these deposits. The decrease in average certificates of deposit and other time deposits reflected the lower rates due to current market conditions. The decrease in average certificates of deposit and other time deposits was mostly transitioned to non-interest bearing and money market and savings deposits which reflected average increases of $30.2 million and $21.6 million, respectively.\nDuring 2017, lower rates on interest-bearing liabilities produced $218 thousand less in interest expense and increased volume produced $88 thousand more in interest expense, as shown in the table below. In 2016, lower rates on interest-bearing liabilities produced $690 thousand less in interest expense and decreased volume produced $253 thousand less in interest expense.\n 35 \nThe following Rate/Volume Variance Analysis identifies the portion of the changes in tax-equivalent net interest income attributable to changes in volume of average balances or to changes in the yield on earning assets and rates paid on interest-bearing liabilities. The rate and volume variance for each category has been allocated on a consistent basis between rate and volume variances, based on a percentage of rate, or volume, variance to the sum of the absolute two variances.\n\nNoninterest Income\nNoninterest income increased $1.1 million, or 6.6%, in 2017 when compared to 2016 and increased $1.2 million, or 8.0%, in 2016 when compared to 2015. The increase in noninterest income in 2017 when compared to 2016 was primarily due to increases in service charges on deposit accounts of $163 thousand, other fees on bank services of $381 thousand included in other noninterest income, insurance agency commissions of $286 thousand, a premium on an insurance investment of $387 thousand and trust and investment fee income of $90 thousand. These increases were partially offset by the absence of the sale of the credit card portfolio of $198 thousand in 2016.\nThe increase in noninterest income in 2016 when compared to 2015 was primarily due to increases in service charges on deposit accounts of $598 thousand, insurance agency commissions of $277 thousand, bank service and loan fees of $207 thousand and a gain on sale of the Bank's credit card portfolio of $198 thousand. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in trust and investment fee income of $185 thousand.\nThe following table summarizes our noninterest income for the years ended December 31.\n\n 36 \nNoninterest Expense\nNoninterest expense increased $4.1 million, or 10.9%, in 2017 when compared to 2016 and decreased $203 thousand, or 0.5%, in 2016 when compared to 2015. The increase in noninterest expense in 2017 when compared to 2016 was primarily due to the branch purchase in the second quarter of 2017 which resulted in acquisition costs of $977 thousand and the cost of operating those branches for seven months. The operation of the additional purchased branches as well as the opening of a loan production office in Ocean City, MD in April of 2017 and a branch in Onley, VA in September of 2017 had an impact on nearly all noninterest expense accounts but had the most significant impact on salaries/wages and employee benefits of $693 thousand and $167 thousand, respectively. The most significant increases absent the operational costs from the additional branches were $1.7 million in salaries and wages due to accrued bonuses, incentive equity programs and a full year of pay increases from 2016 and $485 thousand in higher employer benefits due to more full-time employees and increased health care premiums.\nThe decrease in noninterest expense in 2016 when compared to 2015 was primarily due to a decline in legal and professional fees of $505 thousand and reduced FDIC insurance premiums of $518 thousand, partially offset by consolidation expenses for the former bank subsidiaries of $507 thousand and increases in write-downs on other real estate owned of $115 thousand and employee salaries/wages and employee benefits of $174 thousand. The increased legal and professional fees in 2016 were the direct result of management outsourcing its internal audit function which resulted in significant implementation costs. In addition, the lower FDIC insurance premiums over the prior period are the direct result of the upgraded regulatory status and financial performance of the former Talbot Bank in the second quarter of 2015 and an adjustment of the annual assessment in the third quarter of 2016.\nThe Company had 327 full-time equivalent employees at December 31, 2017, 287 full-time equivalent employees at December 31, 2016 and 283 full-time equivalent employees at December 31, 2015.\nThe following table summarizes our noninterest expense for the years ended December 31.\n\nIncome Taxes\nThe Company reported an income tax expense of $8.5 million for 2017, compared to an income tax expense of $6.3 million for 2016 and an income tax expense of $4.4 million for 2015. The effective tax rate was 43.1% for 2017, 39.4% for 2016 and 38.3% for 2015. The Company's income tax expense and its effective tax rate increased for 2017 from 2016 and 2015 primarily due to higher pretax income and the enactment of the Tax Act. Please refer to Note 16 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further information. The Company's future effective tax rate will be affected by the Tax Act. Effective in 2018, the Tax Act reduces the U.S. statutory corporate tax rate from 35% to 21% and creates new taxes on certain foreign-sourced earnings and certain related-party payments, which are referred to as the global intangible low-taxes income tax and the base erosion tax, respectively.\nREVIEW OF FINANCIAL CONDITION\nAsset and liability composition, capital resources, asset quality, market risk, interest sensitivity and liquidity are all factors that affect our financial condition. The following sections discuss each of these factors.\nAssets\nInterest-Bearing Deposits with Other Banks and Federal Funds Sold\nThe Company invests excess cash balances (i.e., the excess cash remaining after funding loans and investing in securities with deposits and borrowings) in interest-bearing accounts and federal funds sold offered by our correspondent banks. These liquid investments are maintained at a level that management believes is necessary to meet current liquidity needs. Total interest-bearing deposits with other banks and federal funds sold decreased $51.1 million from $61.3 million at December 31, 2016 to $10.3 million at December 31, 2017. This significant decrease was the direct result of funding a significant volume of new loans which closed late in the fourth quarter. Average interest-bearing deposits with other banks and federal funds sold decreased $27.4 million in 2017 and increased $1.8 million in 2016. The decrease in 2017 was due to higher period-end and average balances on loans which absorbed the excess liquidity in both average interest-bearing deposits with other banks and average balances on deposits. The increase in 2016 was due to higher period-end and average balances on deposits which resulted in excess liquidity for funding future loan growth.\n 37 \nInvestment Securities\nThe investment portfolio is structured to provide us with liquidity and also plays an important role in the overall management of interest rate risk. Investment securities available for sale are stated at estimated fair value based on quoted prices and may be sold as part of the asset/liability management strategy or which may be sold in response to changing interest rates. Net unrealized holding gains and losses on these securities are reported net of related income taxes as accumulated other comprehensive income, a separate component of stockholders' equity. Investment securities in the held to maturity category are stated at cost adjusted for amortization of premiums and accretion of discounts. We have the intent and current ability to hold such securities until maturity. At December 31, 2017, 97% of the portfolio was classified as available for sale and 3% as held to maturity, similar to the 96% and 4%, respectively, at December 31, 2016. The percentage of securities designated as available for sale reflects the amount that management believes is needed to support our anticipated growth and liquidity needs. With the exception of municipal securities, our general practice is to classify all newly-purchased securities as available for sale. On December 15, 2016, the Company bought $3.0 million in subordinated notes from a local regional bank which it intends to hold to maturity of December 30, 2026. We do not typically invest in derivative securities and held no such investments at December 31, 2017 or December 31, 2016. Total investment securities increased $32.6 million from $170.6 million at December 31, 2016 to $203.2 million at December 31, 2017. Average investment securities increased $5.6 million in 2017 due to receiving $81.2 million in cash from the branch acquisition in the second quarter of 2017 which was also utilized to fund our significant loan growth in the third and fourth quarters of 2017. The decrease in average investment securities of $36.1 million in 2016 from 2015 was due to funding new loan growth during 2016.\nInvestment securities available for sale were $197.0 million at the end of 2017 and $163.8 million at the end of 2016. Investment activity for 2017 included purchases of $53.5 million in mortgage-backed securities and $31.0 million in U.S. Government agencies, while investment activity for 2016 included purchases of $9.1 million in mortgage-backed securities and $9.0 million in U.S. Government agencies. At year-end 2017, 22.3% of the securities in the portfolio were U.S. Government agencies and 74.3% of the securities were mortgage-backed securities, compared to 20.9% and 78.7%, respectively, at year-end 2016. As seen in the table below, 38% of the available-for-sale portfolio will mature in over one through five years and 57% will mature in over ten years based on contractual maturities. The comparable amounts for 2016 were 10% and 73%, respectively. Our investments in mortgage-backed securities are issued or guaranteed by U.S. Government agencies or government-sponsored agencies.\nInvestment securities held to maturity totaled $6.2 million at December 31, 2017. The comparable amount was $6.8 million at December 31, 2016.\nThe following table sets forth the maturities and weighted average yields of the bond investment portfolio as of December 31, 2017.\n\nYields have been adjusted to reflect a tax equivalent basis using the statutory federal tax rate of 35%.\nLoans\nThe loan portfolio is the primary source of our income. Loans totaled $1.1 billion at December 31, 2017, an increase of $222.0 million, or 25.5%, from 2016. Loans significantly increased in 2017 when compared to 2016 due to organic loan growth of $113.9 million, or 13.1% and acquired loans from the branch acquisition which contributed $108.1 million, or 12.4% at December 31, 2017. Most of our loans are secured by real estate and are classified as construction, residential or commercial real estate loans. The increase in loans was comprised of increases in commercial real estate loans of $82.2 million, or 21.5%, residential real estate loans of $73.4 million, or 22.5%, construction loans of $41.7 million, or 49.7% and commercial loans, which include financial and agricultural loans, of $24.8 million, or 34.3%. Consumer loans, which consist of a small percentage of the overall loan portfolio, decreased $232 thousand, or 3.5%, at December 31, 2017 compared to December 31, 2016.\n 38 \nAt December 31, 2017, the real estate loan portfolio was comprised of 11.5% construction, 36.5% residential real estate and 42.5% commercial real estate. That compares to 9.6%, 37.4% and 43.9%, respectively, at December 31, 2016. Commercial and consumer loans were 8.9% and 0.6%, respectively, of the portfolio at December 31, 2017 and 8.3% and 0.8%, respectively, at December 31, 2016. At December 31, 2017, 74.2% of the loan portfolio had fixed interest rates and 25.8% had adjustable interest rates, compared to 74.8% and 25.2%, respectively, at December 31, 2016. See the discussion below under the caption Asset Quality - Provision for Credit Losses and Risk Management\u201d and Note 4, Loans and Allowance for Credit Losses\u201d, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. At December 31, 2017 and 2016, the Company did not have any loans held for sale. We do not engage in foreign or subprime lending activities.\nThe table below sets forth trends in the composition of the loan portfolio over the past five years (including net deferred loan fees/costs).\n\nThe table below sets forth the maturities and interest rate sensitivity of the loan portfolio at December 31, 2017.\n\nLiabilities\nDeposits\nWe use deposits primarily to fund loans and to purchase investment securities. Total deposits increased from $997.5 million at December 31, 2016 to $1.2 billion at December 31, 2017. The increase was the direct result of the deposits acquired in the branch purchase which had a balance of $187.0 million at December 31, 2017. Excluding the acquisition, deposits increased $18.3 million. These increases were reflected in noninterest-bearing deposits of $66.7 million as well as an increase in interest-bearing transaction accounts of $136.0 million and an increase in certificates of deposit and other time deposits of $2.6 million. Average interest-bearing deposits increased $90.7 million, or 19.7%, in 2017, compared to an increase of $34.8 million, or 8.2% in 2016. Average certificates of deposit and other time deposits decreased $4.5 million, or 1.6% in 2017, compared to a decrease of $37.3 million, or 11.9% in 2016. Average noninterest-bearing deposits increased $54.9 million, or 22.8%, in 2017, compared to an increase of $30.2 million, or 14.3% in 2016. Deposits provided funding for approximately 91.9%, 90.5% and 91.5% of average earning assets for 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively.\nAverage deposits increased for 2016 primarily in noninterest-bearing deposits and interest-bearing transaction accounts which increased $65.0 million, or 10.2%, partially offset by decreases in certificates of deposit and other time deposits of $37.3 million, or 11.9%. The increase in noninterest-bearing and interest-bearing transaction accounts reflected continued growth in our customer base and a shift from certificates of deposit and other time deposits providing lower yields than in 2015.\n 39 \nThe following table sets forth the average balances of deposits and the percentage of each category to total average deposits for the years ended December 31.\n\n(1) Disclosure of $250,000 or more for 2015 were not separately reported.\nThe following table sets forth the maturity ranges of certificates of deposit with balances of $250,000 or more as of December 31, 2017.\n\nShort-Term Borrowings\nShort-term borrowings generally consist of securities sold under agreements to repurchase and short-term borrowings from the FHLB. Securities sold under agreements to repurchase are issued in conjunction with cash management services for commercial depositors. We also borrow from the FHLB on a short-term basis and occasionally borrow from correspondent banks under federal fund lines of credit arrangements to meet short-term liquidity needs. At December 31, 2017 short-term borrowings included advances and repurchase agreements. At December 31, 2016 and 2015, short-term borrowings included only repurchase agreements.\nThe average balance of short-term borrowings decreased $1.2 million, or 21.3%, in 2017, while the average balance decreased $473 thousand, or 7.6%, in 2016. In the month of December 2017, the Company borrowed $21.7 million due to significant loan closures late in the month, otherwise there was not a substantial need for short-term borrowings to supplement deposits as a funding source during 2017 and 2016.\nThe following table sets forth our position with respect to short-term borrowings.\n\nLong-Term Debt\nWe use long-term borrowings to meet longer term liquidity needs, specifically to fund loan growth when liquidity from deposit growth is not sufficient. The Company had no long-term debt at the end of 2017 and 2016.\nCapital Resources Management\nTotal stockholders' equity for the Company was $163.8 million at December 31, 2017, compared to $154.3 million at December 31, 2016. The increase in stockholders' equity in 2017 was primarily due to net income during the year which was offset by dividends paid to common stockholders. The ratio of period-end equity to total assets was 11.75% for 2017, as compared to 13.30% for 2016. This ratio declined primarily due to the branch acquisition which significantly increased total assets and intangible assets.\n 40 \nWe record unrealized holding gains (losses), net of tax, on investment securities available for sale as accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), a separate component of stockholders' equity. At December 31, 2017, the portion of the investment portfolio designated as available for sale\u201d had net unrealized holding (losses), net of tax, of ($1.3) million compared to net unrealized holding (losses), net of tax, of $(993) thousand at December 31, 2016.\nThe following table compares the Company's capital ratios to the minimum regulatory requirements as of December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015.\n\n* includes phased in capital conservation buffer for 2017 of 1.25%\nSee Note 18 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information about the regulatory capital positions of the Company and the Bank.\nIn July 2013, U.S. federal banking agencies published the Basel III Capital Rules establishing a new comprehensive capital framework for U.S. banking organizations. The Basel III Capital Rules were effective for the Company on January 1, 2015 and will be fully phased in on January 1, 2019. When fully phased in on January 1, 2019, the Basel III Capital Rules will require the Company to maintain (i) a minimum ratio of CET1 to risk-weighted assets of at least 4.5%, plus a 2.5% capital conservation buffer,\u201d (ii) a minimum ratio of Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets of at least 6.0%, plus the capital conservation buffer, (iii) a minimum ratio of Total capital to risk-weighted assets of at least 8.0%, plus the capital conservation buffer and (iv) a minimum leverage ratio of 4%, calculated as the ratio of Tier 1 capital to average assets. The Basel III Capital Rules eliminate the inclusion of certain instruments, such as trust preferred securities, from Tier 1 capital. Instruments issued prior to May 19, 2010 will be grandfathered for companies with consolidated assets of $15 billion or less.\nThe capital conservation buffer is designed to absorb losses during periods of economic stress. Banking institutions with a ratio of CET1 to risk-weighted assets above the minimum but below the conservation buffer will face constraints on dividends, equity repurchases and compensation based on the amount of the shortfall. The implementation of the capital conservation buffer began on January 1, 2016 at 0.625% and will be phased in over a four-year period, increasing by that amount on each January 1, until it reaches 2.5% on January 1, 2019.\nThe Basel III Capital Rules also revise the prompt corrective action\u201d regulations by (i) introducing a CET1 ratio requirement at each level (other than critically undercapitalized), with the required CET1 ratio being 6.5% for well-capitalized status and (ii) increasing the minimum Tier 1 capital ratio requirement for each category (other than critically undercapitalized), with the minimum Tier 1 capital ratio for well-capitalized status being 8% (as compared to the prior 6%). The Basel III Capital Rules do not change the total risk-based capital requirement for any prompt corrective action category.\nThe Company currently meets all capital adequacy requirements under the Basel III Capital Rules as they became effective for the Company on January 1, 2015. For additional information regarding the Basel III Capital Rules, see Business - Supervision and Regulation - Capital Requirements.\u201d\n 41 \nAsset Quality - Provision for Credit Losses and Risk Management\nOriginating loans involves a degree of risk that credit losses will occur in varying amounts according to, among other factors, the types of loans being made, the credit-worthiness of the borrowers over the terms of the loans, the quality of the collateral for the loans, if any, as well as general economic conditions. Through the Company's and the Bank's Asset/Liability Management Committees, the Company's Audit Committee and the Company's Board actively reviews critical risk positions, including credit, market, liquidity and operational risk. The Company's goal in managing risk is to reduce earnings volatility, control exposure to unnecessary risk, and ensure appropriate returns for risk assumed. Senior members of management actively manage risk at the product level, supplemented with corporate level oversight through the Asset/Liability Management Committee and internal audit function. The risk management structure is designed to identify risk through a systematic process, enabling timely and appropriate action to avoid and mitigate risk.\nCredit risk is mitigated through loan portfolio diversification, limiting exposure to any single industry or customer, collateral protection, and prudent lending policies and underwriting criteria. The following discussion provides information and statistics on the overall quality of the Company's loan portfolio. Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements describes the accounting policies related to nonperforming loans (nonaccrual and delinquent 90 days or more), TDRs and loan charge-offs and describes the methodologies used to develop the allowance for credit losses, including the specific, formula and unallocated components (also discussed below). Management believes the policies governing nonperforming loans, TDRs and charge-offs are consistent with regulatory standards. The amount of the allowance for credit losses and the resulting provision are reviewed monthly by senior members of management and approved quarterly by the Board of Directors.\nThe allowance is increased by provisions for credit losses charged to expense and recoveries of loans previously charged off. It is decreased by loans charged off in the current period. Loans, or portions thereof, are charged off when considered uncollectible by management. Provisions for credit losses are made to bring the allowance for credit losses within the range of balances that are considered appropriate.\nThe adequacy of the allowance for credit losses is determined based on management's estimate of the inherent risks associated with lending activities, estimated fair value of collateral, past experience and present indicators such as loan delinquency trends, nonaccrual loans and current market conditions. Management believes the current allowance is adequate to provide for probable losses inherent in our loan portfolio; however, future changes in the composition of the loan portfolio and financial condition of borrowers may result in additions to the allowance. Examination of the portfolio and allowance by various regulatory agencies and consultants engaged by the Company may result in the need for additional provisions based on information available at the time of the examination. The Bank maintains a separate allowance for credit losses, which is only available to absorb losses from their respective loan portfolios. The allowance set by the Bank is subject to regulatory examination and determination as to its adequacy.\nThe allowance for credit losses is comprised of three parts: (i) the specific allowance; (ii) the historical formula allowance; and (iii) the qualitative formula allowance. The specific allowance is established against impaired loans until charge offs are made. Loans are considered impaired (i.e., nonaccrual loans and accruing TDRs) when it is probable that the Company will not collect all principal and interest payments according to the loan's contractual terms. The qualitative formula allowance is determined based on management's assessment of industry trends and economic factors in the markets in which we operate. The determination of the formula allowance involves a higher risk of uncertainty and considers current risk factors that may not have yet manifested themselves in our historical loss factors.\nThe specific allowance is used to individually allocate an allowance to loans identified as impaired. An impaired loan may involve deficiencies in the borrower's overall financial condition, payment history, support available from financial guarantors and/or the fair market value of collateral. If it is determined that there is a loss associated with an impaired loan, a specific allowance is established until a charge off is made. Impaired loans, or portions thereof, are charged off when deemed uncollectible.\nThe historical formula allowance is used to estimate the loss on internally risk-rated loans, exclusive of those identified as impaired. Loans are grouped by type (construction, residential real estate, commercial real estate, commercial or consumer). Each loan type is assigned allowance factors based on management's estimate of the risk, complexity and size of individual loans within a particular category using average historical charge-offs by segment over the last 16 quarters. Loans that are identified as pass-watch, special mention, substandard and doubtful are considered to have elevated credit risk.\nThe qualitative formula allowance is used to estimate the loss on loans stemming from more global factors such as delinquencies, loss history, trends in volume and terms of loans, effects of changes in lending policy, the experience and depth of management, national and local economic trends, concentrations of credit, the quality of the loan review system and the effect of external factors such as competition and regulatory requirements. These loans are assigned higher allowance factors than favorably rated loans due to management's concerns regarding collectability or management's knowledge of particular elements regarding the borrower.\nBecause most of our loans are secured by real estate, the lack of a meaningful upturn in real estate related activities in our local real estate market and construction industry and slow improvement in general economic conditions had a material adverse effect on the performance of our loan portfolio and the value of the collateral securing that portfolio between 2009 and 2013. Factors impeding our loan performance and overall financial performance included our levels of loan charge-offs and provisions for credit losses. However, we believe that the proactive measures we took in 2011, 2012 and 2013 to critically review our loan portfolio, take the necessary charge-offs, provide prudent reserves and engage in difficult but timely asset sales allowed us to focus on loan growth and improved earnings beginning in 2014.\n 42 \nOn May 19, 2017, the Bank purchased three branches which resulted in $122.9 million in loans being added to the Bank's portfolio. Management evaluated expected cash flows, prepayment speeds and estimated loss factors to measure fair values for the loans acquired. The Bank only acquired loans which were deemed to be performing loans with no signs of credit deterioration. The Bank re-evaluated these acquired loans during the fourth quarter of 2017 noting they remained in performing condition, therefore no allowance has been recorded as of December 31, 2017.\nAs seen in the table below, the provision for credit losses was $2.3 million for 2017, $1.8 million for 2016 and $2.1 million for 2015. The increase in the level of provision for credit losses in 2017 was primarily due to the significant growth in loans as compared to 2016. Net loan charge-offs totaled $1.2 million in 2017, $1.4 million in 2016 and $1.5 million in 2015. Real estate loans were 44%, 75% and 83% of total loans charged off during 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively and also due to the change in allowance methodology disclosed in Note 4 of the consolidated financial statements. Management deemed the change in methodology necessary due to the increase in loans migrating to the pass-watch risk rating category and due to the amount of unseasoned growth in the originated portfolio experienced in 2016 and 2017. The change in methodology resulted in $1.4 million in additional provision for credit losses.\nThe allowance for credit losses was $9.8 million, or 0.99% of average outstanding loans at December 31, 2017, compared to an allowance of $8.7 million, or 1.06% of average outstanding loans at December 31, 2016. The higher allowance at the end of 2017 when compared to the end of 2016 was the result of significant growth in the loan portfolio and the above referenced change in methodology. At December 31, 2015, the allowance for credit losses was $8.3 million, or 1.11% of average outstanding loans. The ratio of net charge-offs to average loans was 0.13% in 2017, 0.17% in 2016 and 0.19% in 2015.\nThe overall credit quality improved in 2017 compared to 2016 primarily due to continued workout efforts on outstanding problem loans many of which were TDRs and nonperforming assets. Management will continue to monitor and charge off nonperforming assets as rapidly as possible, and focus on the generation of healthy loan growth and new business development opportunities.\nThe following table sets forth a summary of our loan loss experience for the years ended December 31.\n\n 43 \nThe following table sets forth the allocation of the allowance for credit losses and the percentage of loans in each category to total loans for the years ended December 31.\n\nAt December 31, 2017, nonperforming assets were $7.4 million, a decrease of $4.1 million, or 35.4%, when compared to December 31, 2016. Similarly, accruing TDRs were $13.3 million at December 31, 2017, an increase of $326 thousand, or 2.5%, when compared to December 31, 2016. At December 31, 2017, the ratio of nonaccrual loans to total assets was 0.36%, improving from 0.77% at December 31, 2016. Likewise, the ratio of accruing TDRs to total assets at December 31, 2017 was 0.96%, decreasing from 1.12% at December 31, 2016. When comparing December 31, 2017 to December 31, 2016, the positive trend in nonperforming assets, as well as the corresponding asset quality ratios, was due to continued work-out efforts and loan charge-offs. The slight increase in accruing TDRs from December 31, 2016 to December 31, 2017, was due to legacy nonaccrual TDRs transferring to accruing TDRs which also represented improving credit quality.\nThe Company continues to focus on the resolution of its nonperforming and problem loans. The efforts to accomplish this goal include frequently contacting borrowers until the delinquency is cured or until an acceptable payment plan has been agreed upon; obtaining updated appraisals; provisioning for credit losses; charging off loans; transferring loans to other real estate owned; aggressively marketing other real estate owned; and selling loans. The reduction of nonperforming and problem loans is and will continue to be a high priority for the Company.\nSelected Quarterly Consolidated Financial Data\nPlease refer to Note 26 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further information.\n 44 \nThe following table summarizes our nonperforming assets and accruing TDRs as of December 31.\n\n 45 \nMarket Risk Management and Interest Sensitivity\nThe Company's net income is largely dependent on its net interest income. Net interest income is susceptible to interest rate risk to the extent that interest-bearing liabilities mature or re-price on a different basis than interest-earning assets. When interest-bearing liabilities mature or re-price more quickly than interest-earning assets in a given period, a significant increase in market rates of interest could adversely affect net interest income. Similarly, when interest-earning assets mature or re-price more quickly than interest-bearing liabilities, falling interest rates could result in a decrease in net interest income. Net interest income is also affected by changes in the portion of interest-earning assets that are funded by interest-bearing liabilities rather than by other sources of funds, such as noninterest-bearing deposits and stockholders' equity.\nThe Company's interest rate risk management goals are (1) to increase net interest income at a growth rate consistent with the growth rate of total assets, and (2) to minimize fluctuations in net interest margin as a percentage of interest-earning assets. Management attempts to achieve these goals by balancing, within policy limits, the volume of floating-rate liabilities with a similar volume of floating-rate assets; by keeping the average maturity of fixed-rate asset and liability contracts reasonably matched; by maintaining a pool of administered core deposits; and by adjusting pricing rates to market conditions on a continuing basis.\nThe Company's Board of Directors has established a comprehensive asset liability management policy, which is administered by management's Asset Liability Management Committee ( ALCO\u201d). The policy establishes limits on risk, which are quantitative measures of the percentage change in net interest income (a measure of net interest income at risk) and the fair value of equity capital (a measure of economic value of equity or EVE\u201d at risk) resulting from a hypothetical change in the yield curve of U.S. Treasury interest rates for maturities from one day to thirty years. The Company evaluates the potential adverse impacts that changing interest rates may have on its short-term earnings, long-term value, and liquidity by outsourcing simulation analysis through the use of computer modeling. The simulation model captures optionality factors such as call features and interest rate caps and floors imbedded in investment and loan portfolio contracts. As with any method of gauging interest rate risk, there are certain shortcomings inherent in the interest rate modeling methodology used by the Company. When interest rates change, actual movements in different categories of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities, loan prepayments, and withdrawals of time and other deposits, may deviate significantly from assumptions used in the model. As an example, certain money market deposit accounts are assumed to reprice at 50% of the interest rate change in each of the up rate shock scenarios even though this is not a contractual requirement. As a practical matter, management would likely lag the impact of any upward movement in market rates on these accounts as a mechanism to manage the Company's net interest margin. Finally, the methodology does not measure or reflect the impact that higher rates may have on adjustable-rate loan customers' ability to service their debts, or the impact of rate changes on demand for loan, lease, and deposit products.\nThe Company presents a current base case and several alternative simulations at least once a quarter and reports the analysis to the Board of Directors. In addition, more frequent forecasts could be produced when interest rates are particularly uncertain or when other business conditions so dictate.\nThe statement of condition is subject to quarterly testing for six alternative interest rate shock possibilities to indicate the inherent interest rate risk. Average interest rates are shocked by +/- 100, 200, 300 and 400 basis points ( bp\u201d), although the Company may elect not to use particular scenarios that it determines are impractical in a current rate environment. It is management's goal to structure the balance sheet so that net interest earnings at risk over a twelve-month period and the economic value of equity at risk do not exceed policy guidelines at the various interest rate shock levels.\nMeasures of net interest income at risk produced by simulation analysis are indicators of an institution's short-term performance in alternative rate environments. These measures are typically based upon a relatively brief period, usually one year. They do not necessarily indicate the long-term prospects or economic value of the institution.\n\nBased on our net interest income simulation as of December 31, 2017, net interest income is expected to increase as interest rates rise. The results of the simulation are well within the policy limits adopted by the Company. This is due in part to our strategy to maintain short investment portfolio durations. In addition, rising interest rates would drive higher rates on loans, and subsequently increase funding costs. However, lower interest rates would likely cause a decline in net interest income as lower rates would lead to lower yields on loans and investment securities. Since deposit costs are already at low levels, lower interest rates are unlikely to significantly impact our funding costs. Based on our net interest income simulation as of December 31, 2017, net interest income sensitivity to changes in interest rates for the twelve months subsequent to December 31, 2017 was less sensitive compared to the sensitivity profile for the twelve months subsequent to December 31, 2016. The decline in sensitivity was partially due to changes in our balance sheet mix, including decreases in federal funds sold, floating rate commercial loans, and a shift from certificates of deposit and other time deposits to noninterest bearing deposits which drove down the Company's cost of funds and interest expense.\n 46 \nThe measures of equity value at risk indicate the ongoing economic value of the Company by considering the effects of changes in interest rates on all of the Company's cash flows, and by discounting the cash flows to estimate the present value of assets and liabilities. The difference between these discounted values of the assets and liabilities is the economic value of equity ( EVE\u201d), which, in theory, approximates the fair value of the Company's net assets.\n\nBased on our EVE simulation as of December 31, 2017, equity is expected to increase as interest rates rise in all scenarios other than the 300bp and 400bp increase and will decline as interest rates decrease. The results of the simulation are well within the policy limits adopted by the Company. The decrease in the EVE at risk from December 31, 2016 to December 31, 2017 primarily resulted from significant loan growth for the Bank which experienced increased rates on the new loan volume, while deposit rates remained unchanged at historically low levels. This resulted in a lower EVE as loans became less valuable and deposits became more valuable.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nIn the normal course of business, to meet the financing needs of its customers, the Bank is party to financial instruments with off-balance sheet risk. These financial instruments include commitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit. The Bank's exposure to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by the other party to these financial instruments is represented by the contractual amount of the instruments. The Bank uses the same credit policies in making commitments and conditional obligations as they use for on-balance sheet instruments. The Bank generally requires collateral or other security to support the financial instruments with credit risk. The amount of collateral or other security is determined based on management's credit evaluation of the counterparty. The Bank evaluates each customer's creditworthiness on a case-by-case basis.\nCommitments to extend credit are agreements to lend to a customer as long as there is no violation of any condition established in the contract. Letters of credit are conditional commitments issued by the Bank to guarantee the performance of a customer to a third party. Letters of credit and other commitments generally have fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses and may require payment of a fee. Because many of the letters of credit and commitments are expected to expire without being drawn upon, the total commitment amount does not necessarily represent future cash requirements. Further information about these arrangements is provided in Note 22 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nManagement does not believe that any of the foregoing arrangements have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that is material to investors.\nLiquidity Management\nLiquidity describes our ability to meet financial obligations that arise during the normal course of business. Liquidity is primarily needed to meet the borrowing and deposit withdrawal requirements of customers and to fund current and planned expenditures. Liquidity is derived through increased customer deposits, maturities in the investment portfolio, loan repayments and income from earning assets. To the extent that deposits are not adequate to fund customer loan demand, liquidity needs can be met in the short-term funds markets. We have arrangements with correspondent banks whereby we have $15 million available in federal funds lines of credit and a reverse repurchase agreement available to meet any short-term needs which may not otherwise be funded by the Banks' portfolio of readily marketable investments that can be converted to cash. The Bank is also a member of the FHLB, which provides another source of liquidity, and had credit availability of approximately $205.6 million from the FHLB as of December 31, 2017.\nAt December 31, 2017, our loan to deposit ratio was approximately 90.9%, higher than the 87.4% at year-end 2016. Investment securities available for sale totaling $197.0 million at the end of 2017 were available for the management of liquidity and interest rate risk. The comparable amount was $163.8 million at December 31, 2016. Cash and cash equivalents were $31.8 million at December 31, 2017, a decrease of $44.1 million, or 58.1%, compared to the $75.9 million at year-end 2016, which reflects the utilization of liquidity for funding loan growth in 2017. Management is not aware of any demands, commitments, events or uncertainties that will materially affect our ability to maintain liquidity at satisfactory levels.\nWe have various financial obligations, including contractual obligations and commitments that may require future cash payments. The following table presents significant fixed and determinable contractual obligations to third parties by payment date as of December 31, 2017.\n\n 47 \n ", "item_7_tables": "Table 67: <table> <tr>

points from the MD&A report:\n\n- Net income increased to $11.26 million in 2017 from $9.64 million in 2016, due to increases in net interest income and noninterest income. \n\n- Total assets grew 20.1% to $1.394 billion in 2017, primarily due to the acquisition of 3 branches in Q2 2017.\n\n- Loans grew 25.5% to $1.093 billion in 2017, driven by organic growth and loans acquired from the branch purchase. \n\n- The loan portfolio is mostly comprised of real estate loans - construction, residential and commercial real estate. \n\n- Deposits increased 20.6% to $1.203 billion in 2017, also largely due to the branch acquisition.\n\n- Noninterest income rose 6.6% in 2017 compared to 2016, primarily due to increases in service charges, insurance commissions and other fees.\n\n- Noninterest expense increased 10.9% in 2017, mainly attributable to costs from the branch acquisition. \n\n- Credit quality improved, with nonperforming assets decreasing 35.4% from 2016. \n\n- Net interest margin increased in 2017 due to loan growth, higher investment yields and lower deposit rates. \n\n- Liquidity remains stable, though the loan to deposit ratio rose slightly. The company has various sources available to meet liquidity needs if required.\n\n- The company is well-capitalized under regulatory requirements.\n\nIn summary, the company showed improved financial performance in 2017 driven by loan growth, stable credit quality, higher revenues and the impact of a branch acquisition."}
