Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operation\nThe following discussion and analysis provides information on AWR's consolidated operations and assets, and, where necessary, includes specific references to AWR's individual segments and/or its subsidiaries: GSWC and ASUS and its subsidiaries. Included in the following analysis is a discussion of water and electric gross margins. Water and electric gross margins are computed by subtracting total supply costs from total revenues. Registrant uses these gross margins as important measures in evaluating its operating results. Registrant believes these measures are useful internal benchmarks in evaluating the performance of GSWC.\nThe discussions and tables included in the following analysis also present Registrant's operations in terms of earnings per share by business segment. Registrant believes that the disclosure of earnings per share by business segment provides investors with clarity surrounding the performance of its different services. Registrant reviews these measurements regularly and compares them to historical periods and to its operating budget. Furthermore, the discussion refers to a non-core business activity related to gains and losses on Registrant's investments held to fund a retirement benefit plan, which is excluded when communicating earnings results to help facilitate comparisons of the Company's performance from period to period. However, all of these measures, which are not presented in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles ( GAAP\u201d), may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other enterprises and should not be considered as an alternative to operating income or earnings per share, which are determined in accordance with GAAP. A reconciliation of water and electric gross margins to the most directly comparable GAAP measures is included in the table under the section titled Operating Expenses: Supply Costs.\u201d Reconciliations to AWR's diluted earnings per share are included in the discussions under the sections titled Summary Results by Segment.\u201d\nOverview\nFactors affecting our financial performance are summarized under Forward-Looking Information.\nWater and Electric Segments:\nGSWC's revenues, operating income and cash flows are earned primarily through delivering potable water to homes and businesses in California and the delivery of electricity in the Big Bear area of San Bernardino County, California. Rates charged to GSWC customers are determined by the CPUC. These rates are intended to allow recovery of operating costs and a reasonable rate of return on capital. GSWC plans to continue to seek additional rate increases in future years from the CPUC to recover operating and supply costs and receive reasonable returns on invested capital. Capital expenditures in future years at GSWC are expected to remain at higher levels than depreciation expense. When necessary, GSWC obtains funds from external sources in the capital markets and through bank borrowings.\nPending General Rate Case Filings:\nWater Segment:\nIn July 2017, GSWC filed a general rate case application for its water regions and the general office. The general rate case will determine new water rates for the years 2019 through 2021. On August 15, 2018, GSWC and the CPUC's Public Advocates Office, formerly the Office of Ratepayer Advocates, filed a joint motion to adopt a settlement agreement between GSWC and the Public Advocates Office in connection with the general rate case. If approved by the CPUC, the settlement would resolve all of the issues in the general rate case application and authorize GSWC to invest approximately $334.5 million in capital infrastructure over the three-year rate cycle. The $334.5 million of infrastructure investment, as settled, includes $20.4 million of capital projects to be filed for revenue recovery through advice letters when those projects are completed.\nExcluding the advice-letter-project revenues, the water gross margin for 2019 in the settlement filing is expected to increase by approximately $6.0 million as compared to the 2018 adopted water gross margin. The 2019 water revenue requirement, as settled, has been reduced to reflect a decrease of approximately $7.0 million in depreciation expense, compared to the adopted 2018 depreciation expense, due to a reduction in the overall composite depreciation rates based on a revised study filed in the general rate case. The decrease in depreciation expense lowers the water gross margin, and is offset by a corresponding decrease in depreciation expense, resulting in no impact to net earnings. In addition, the 2019 water revenue requirement, as settled, includes a decrease of approximately $2.2 million for excess deferred tax refunds as a result of the Tax Act, which has a corresponding decrease in income tax expense and also results in no impact to net earnings. Had depreciation expense, as settled, remained the same as the 2018 adopted amount and there was no excess deferred tax refund that lowered the 2019 revenue requirement, the water gross margin for 2019 would have increased by approximately $15.2 million. The settlement also allows for potential additional water revenue increases in 2020 and 2021 of approximately $10.0 million and $12.0 million, respectively, subject to the results of an earnings test and changes to the forecasted inflationary index values.\nGSWC and the Public Advocates Office informed the assigned Administrative Law Judge (\"ALJ\u201d) that hearings would not be needed in light of the settlement agreement. Subsequently, the ALJ issued a ruling requesting additional information on\na number of items in the general rate case. GSWC has provided the additional information requested by the ALJ and believes it has satisfied all of the questions raised. Both the ALJ's request and GSWC's response are public information. GSWC is awaiting a proposed decision by the ALJ, which is expected during the first quarter of 2019, with a final decision by the CPUC expected later in 2019. When approved, the new rates will be retroactive to January 1, 2019.\nElectric Segment:\nIn May 2017, GSWC filed its electric general rate case application with the CPUC to determine new electric rates for the years 2018 through 2021. In November 2018, GSWC and the Public Advocates Office filed a joint motion to adopt a settlement agreement between the two parties resolving all issues in connection with the general rate case. Among other things, the settlement incorporates a previous stipulation in the case, which authorizes a new return on equity for GSWC's electric segment of 9.60%, as compared to its previously authorized return of 9.95%. The stipulation also included a capital structure and debt cost similar to those approved by the CPUC in March 2018 in connection with GSWC's water segment cost of capital proceeding, as discussed below. Because of the delay in finalizing the electric general rate case, billed electric revenues in 2018 were based on 2017 adopted rates, pending a final decision by the CPUC in this rate case application. Had the new rates in the settlement agreement been approved by the CPUC prior to December 31, 2018, the electric segment's gross margin would have increased by approximately $2.0 million, or $0.04 per share, for the year ended December 31, 2018. A decision in this case is expected in 2019, and when approved by the CPUC, the new rates will be retroactive to January 1, 2018. Accordingly, Registrant will record the 2018 increase to earnings in the period in which a CPUC decision is received.\nCost of Capital Proceeding for GSWC's Water Segment:\nIn March 2018, the CPUC issued a final decision in the cost of capital proceeding for GSWC and three other investor-owned water utilities that serve California. Among other things, the final decision adopts for GSWC (i) a return on equity of 8.90%, (ii) a cost of debt of 6.6%, (iii) a capital structure with 57% equity and 43% debt, (iv) a return on rate base of 7.91%, and (v) the continuation of the water cost of capital adjustment mechanism. GSWC's prior authorized return on equity and equity ratio for its water segment were 9.43% and 55%, respectively, with a return on rate base of 8.34%. The newly authorized return on rate base of 7.91% reflects a true-up of GSWC's embedded debt cost from 6.99% to 6.60%. The reduced debt costs contributed approximately 18 basis points to the 43-basis-point drop in the authorized return on rate base. The lower return on rate base beginning in 2018 decreased GSWC's 2018 adopted annual revenue requirement by approximately $3.6 million, or $0.07 per share.\nContracted Services Segment:\nASUS's revenues, operating income and cash flows are earned by providing water and/or wastewater services, including operation and maintenance services and construction of facilities at the water and/or wastewater systems at various military installations, pursuant to 50-year firm fixed-price contracts. The contract price for each of these 50-year contracts is subject to annual economic price adjustments. Additional revenues generated by contract operations are primarily dependent on new construction activities under contract modifications with the U.S. government or agreements with other third-party prime contractors.\nFort Riley:\nOn July 1, 2018, ASUS assumed the operation, maintenance and construction management of the water distribution and wastewater collection and treatment facilities at Fort Riley, a United States Army installation located in Kansas, after completing a transition period and a detailed inventory study. The contract was awarded by the U.S. government in September 2017 with a value of $681 million over a 50-year period. The 50-year contract is also subject to annual economic price adjustments.\nEglin Air Force Base ( Eglin AFB\u201d):\nOn June 15, 2017, ASUS assumed operations of the water and wastewater systems at Eglin AFB in Florida after completing a transition period and a detailed joint inventory study. The value of the 50-year contract is approximately $702.4 million. The contract is subject to annual economic price adjustments.\nWith the addition of Fort Riley and Eglin AFB, ASUS serves 11 military bases in the United Sates, including four of the largest military installations: Fort Bragg, Fort Bliss, Eglin AFB and Fort Riley.\nU.S. Government Shutdown:\nFrom December 22, 2018 until January 25, 2019, the U.S. government shutdown impacted non-essential government employees due to the lack of an approved appropriations bill to fund the operations of the federal government for fiscal year 2019. However, the shutdown did not have an impact on ASUS due to the fact that funding for military operations (including military bases) is provided by the Department of Defense, which is fully funded for fiscal 2019 and was not part of the government shutdown.\nTax Cuts and Jobs Act:\nOn December 22, 2017, the Tax Act was signed into federal law. The provisions of this major tax reform were generally effective January 1, 2018. The most significant provisions of the Tax Act impacting GSWC are the reduction of the federal corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21% and the elimination of bonus depreciation for regulated utilities. As a result, for the year ended December 31, 2018, the water-revenue requirement was lower by approximately $12.5 million as compared to 2017 as a result of the Tax Act, which was largely offset by a decrease in income tax expense, resulting in no material impact to net earnings. The CPUC also ordered GSWC to update its pending electric general rate case filing to reflect the lower federal corporate income tax rate. For the year ended December 31, 2018, GSWC reduced electric revenues by approximately $1.2 million, which was also largely offset by a corresponding decrease in income tax expense, resulting in no material impact to net earnings. In 2017, the Tax Act did have a negative impact on net earnings at the water segment as a result of remeasuring deferred tax balances to reflect the lower federal tax rate; however, that was mostly offset by an increase in net earnings at AWR (parent) and, to a lesser extent, at the other two business segments.\nIn addition to lowering customer rates, GSWC expects the Tax Act to reduce property-related deferred tax liabilities. Property-related deferred tax liabilities reduce GSWC's rate base. As new plant is placed in service, the lower federal corporate tax rate will result in lower deferred tax liabilities. As a result of the lower federal tax rate and elimination of bonus depreciation by the Tax Act, GSWC expects that its rate base and earnings will increase for the same level of expected capital expenditures. This increase is expected to be partially offset by higher financing costs arising from a greater need to fund capital expenditures through the issuance of debt and/or equity due to lower cash flows from operating activities.\nDuring the second and third quarter of 2018, the U.S. government issued contract modifications for the majority of ASUS's 50-year contracts addressing the impacts of the Tax Act. The modifications did not result in a material impact to ASUS's results for the year ended December 31, 2018.\nSummary Results by Segment\nThe table below sets forth diluted earnings per share by business segment for AWR's operations:\nTable 92: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Diluted Earnings per Share\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>12/31/2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12/31/2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>CHANGE\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Water, excluding one-time gain on sale of Ojai water system\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1.19\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1.22\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(0.03\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Electric\n</td> <td>0.11\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.11\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Contracted services\n</td> <td>0.42\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.37\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.05\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>AWR (parent)\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.05\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(0.05\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Consolidated diluted earnings per share, adjusted\n</td> <td>1.72\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.75\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(0.03\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gain on sale of Ojai water system\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.13\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(0.13\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Totals from operations, as reported\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1.72\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1.88\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(0.16\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nWater Segment:\nIncluded in the results for the year ended December 31, 2017 were (i) the recognition of a pretax gain of $8.3 million, or $0.13 per share, on the sale of GSWC's Ojai water system in June of 2017, with no similar gain in 2018, and (ii) the recovery in February 2017 of incremental costs approved by the CPUC related to California's drought state of emergency that were previously expensed, and which resulted in an increase to pretax earnings in 2017 of $1.5 million, or $0.02 per share (approximately $1.2 million was reflected as a reduction to other operation expenses and approximately $260,000 was reflected as additional revenue). Furthermore, affecting the results and comparability between the two periods were losses incurred during 2018, as a result of market conditions, on Registrant's investments held to fund a retirement benefit plan as compared to gains recorded in 2017. This non-core business item decreased the water segment's earnings on a relative basis by approximately $0.05 per share.\nExcluding the impact of the items discussed above, diluted earnings from the water segment for 2018 increased by $0.04 per share as compared to 2017 due to the following items:\nTable 93: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>An overall increase in the water gross margin of $0.03 per share, largely due to revenues generated from CPUC-approved third-year rate increases effective January 1, 2018, partially offset by the effect of the cessation of the Ojai operations in June of 2017 and the revenue impact from the lower authorized return on rate base in the cost of capital proceeding approved by the CPUC and effective in 2018. The lower return on rate base decreased GSWC's 2018 adopted annual water revenue requirement by approximately $3.6 million, or $0.07 per share.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 94: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>An increase in operating expenses (excluding supply costs) decreased earnings by approximately $0.04 per share due, in large part, to a reduction in legal costs of $1.8 million, or $0.03 per share, recorded in December 2017 for amounts received from the City of Claremont pursuant to a settlement agreement, with no similar item in the fourth quarter of 2018. Excluding this item, overall recurring operating expenses increased by approximately $0.01 per share due mostly to higher depreciation and property tax expenses, both of which are due to plant additions.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 95: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Excluding gains and losses from investments, there was an increase in interest and other income (net of interest expense), which increased earnings by approximately $0.01 per share due, in part, to interest income related to a federal tax refund recorded during the fourth quarter of 2018, partially offset by an increase in interest expense resulting from higher short-term borrowings to fund operations and a portion of GSWC's capital expenditures.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 96: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>An overall decrease in the water segment's effective income tax rate (\"ETR\"), which positively impacted earnings by approximately $0.04 per share. The decrease in the ETR was due, in large part, to the unfavorable remeasurement adjustment recorded in December 2017 at the water segment related to certain non-rate-regulated deferred tax assets (primarily compensation- and benefit-related items) in connection with the Tax Act. The one-time remeasurement negatively impacted water net earnings in 2017 by approximately $0.03 per share. There was no similar adjustment in 2018. In addition, the water ETR was favorably impacted in 2018 by changes in flow-through adjustments recorded in accordance with regulatory requirements (primarily related to plant and compensation-related items).\n</td> </tr>\n</table> The comparison between the two periods discussed above also excluded the reductions in water revenue in 2018 resulting from the Tax Act and billed surcharges, both of which had no material impact to earnings.\nElectric Segment:\nFor each of the years ended December 31, 2018, and 2017, diluted earnings from the electric segment were $0.11 per share. Due to the delay in the electric general rate case, billed revenues in 2018 were based on 2017 adopted rates, pending a final CPUC decision on the electric general rate case. In November 2018, GSWC and the CPUC's Public Advocates Office filed a joint motion to adopt a settlement agreement between the two parties resolving all issues in connection with the general rate case. A decision in this case is expected in 2019 and when approved by the CPUC, the new rates will be retroactive to January 1, 2018. Had the new rates in the settlement agreement been approved by the CPUC prior to December 31, 2018, the electric segment's gross margin would have been higher by approximately $2.0 million, or $0.04 per share, for the year ended December 31, 2018.\nContracted Services Segment:\nFor the year ended December 31, 2018, diluted earnings from contracted services were $0.42 per share, compared to $0.37 per share for the same period in 2017. Included in the results for 2017 were retroactive revenues resulting from the approval of the third price redetermination at Fort Bragg, which totaled approximately $1.0 million, or $0.02 per share, related to periods prior to 2017. Excluding this retroactive amount, diluted earnings per share from the contracted services segment increased $0.07 per share as compared to 2017, due largely to the commencement of operations at Eglin AFB and Fort Riley in June 2017 and July 2018, respectively. There was also an increase in management fee revenues at the other military bases resulting from the successful resolution of various price adjustments during 2017 and 2018. These increases were partially offset by lower construction activities at the military bases other than Eglin AFB and Fort Riley.\nAWR (parent):\nFor the year ended December 31, 2018, diluted earnings from AWR (parent) decreased $0.05 per share compared to 2017. Included in the results for 2017 was the one-time benefit from the remeasurement of the AWR (parent) deferred tax balances as a result of the Tax Act. This one-time remeasurement was based on the Tax Act's lower federal corporate tax rate of 21%, which increased earnings at AWR (parent) by approximately $0.03 per share during 2017. There was no similar adjustment in 2018. In addition, there were higher state unitary taxes recorded at the parent level during 2018 as compared to the same period in 2017.\nThe following discussion and analysis for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016 provides information on AWR's consolidated operations and assets and, where necessary, includes specific references to AWR's individual segments and subsidiaries: GSWC and ASUS and its subsidiaries.\nConsolidated Results of Operations - Years Ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 (amounts in thousands, except per share amounts): Table 97: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>

January 1, 2018, Registrant changed the financial statement presentation for the costs of its defined benefit pension plans and other retirement benefits. The components of net periodic benefits cost, other than the service cost component, have been included in the line item Other, net\u201d in Registrant's income statements. Amounts for 2017 have been reclassified on the income statements to conform to the current-period presentation.\nOperating Revenues\nGeneral\nRegistrant relies upon approvals by the CPUC of rate increases to recover operating expenses and to provide for a return on invested and borrowed capital used to fund utility plant for GSWC. Registrant relies on economic price adjustments and equitable adjustments by the U.S. government in order to recover operating expenses and provide a profit margin for ASUS. If adequate rate relief or adjustments are not granted in a timely manner, current operating revenues and earnings can be negatively impacted. ASUS's earnings are also impacted by the level of additional construction projects at the Military Utility Privatization Subsidiaries, which may or may not continue at current levels in future periods.\nWater\nFor the year ended December 31, 2018, revenues from water operations decreased by $11.1 million to $295.3 million, compared to $306.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. This decrease was primarily due to: (i) downward adjustments to water revenue which were largely offset by lower income tax expense, thus no material impact to earnings, as a result of the Tax Act, (ii) a lower authorized rate of return approved by the CPUC in the March 2018 final decision on the water cost of capital application, and (iii) decreases related to the expiration of various surcharges that were in place to recover previously incurred costs. These decreases in surcharge revenues were offset by a corresponding decrease in operating expenses (primarily administrative and general), resulting in no impact to earnings. These decreases in water revenue were partially offset by CPUC-approved third-year rate increases effective January 1, 2018. There were also CPUC-approved rate increases to cover increases in supply costs experienced in most ratemaking areas, which were largely offset by a corresponding increase in supply costs, resulting in an immaterial impact to earnings.\nBilled water consumption for the year ended December 31, 2018 increased approximately 3% as compared to 2017. In general, changes in consumption do not have a significant impact on recorded revenues due to the CPUC-approved WRAM accounts in place in the majority of GSWC's rate-making areas. GSWC records the difference between what it bills its water customers and that which is authorized by the CPUC in the WRAM accounts as regulatory assets or liabilities.\nElectric\nFor the year ended December 31, 2018, revenues from electric operations were $34.4 million as compared to $34.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. This slight increase was primarily due to rate increases generated from advice letter projects approved by the CPUC in 2017 and 2018. Due to the delay in the electric general rate case, 2018 billed revenues have been based on 2017 adopted rates, pending a final CPUC decision which is expected later in 2019.\nBilled electric usage for the year ended December 31, 2018 increased slightly as compared to the same period in 2017. Due to the CPUC-approved base revenue requirement adjustment mechanism (\"BRRAM\"), which adjusts base revenues to adopted levels authorized by the CPUC, changes in usage do not have a significant impact on earnings.\nContracted Services\nRevenues from contracted services are composed of construction revenues (including renewal and replacements) and management fees for operating and maintaining the water and/or wastewater systems at various military bases. For the year ended December 31, 2018, revenues from contracted services were $107.2 million as compared to $100.3 million for 2017. Included in revenues for 2017 was approximately $1.0 million in retroactive management fees related to periods prior to 2017. The increase in revenues was due to the commencement of operations at Eglin AFB in June 2017 and at Fort Riley in July 2018.\nASUS's subsidiaries continue to enter into U.S. government-awarded contract modifications and agreements with third-party prime contractors for new construction projects at the military bases served. During 2018, ASUS was awarded approximately $24 million in new construction projects, the majority of which are expected to be completed during 2019. Earnings and cash flows from modifications to the original 50-year contracts with the U.S. government and agreements with third-party prime contractors for additional construction projects may or may not continue in future periods.\nOperating Expenses:\nSupply Costs\nSupply costs for the water segment consist of purchased water, purchased power for pumping, groundwater production assessments and changes in the water supply cost balancing accounts. Supply costs for the electric segment consist of purchased power for resale, the cost of natural gas used by BVES's generating unit, the cost of renewable energy credits and changes in the electric supply cost balancing account. Water and electric gross margins are computed by subtracting total supply costs from total revenues. Registrant uses these gross margins and related percentages as an important measure in evaluating its operating results. Registrant believes these measures are useful internal benchmarks in evaluating the utility business performance within its water and electric segments. Registrant reviews these measurements regularly and compares them to historical periods and to its operating budget. However, these measures, which are not presented in accordance with GAAP, may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other enterprises and should not be considered as an alternative to operating income, which is determined in accordance with GAAP.\nTotal supply costs comprise the largest segment of total operating expenses. Supply costs accounted for 27.8% and 28.1% of total operating expenses for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. The table below provides the amounts (in thousands) of increases (decreases) and percent changes in water and electric revenues, supply costs and gross margins during the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017. As previously discussed, water and electric revenues for the year ended December 31, 2018 were $12.5 million and $1.2 million lower, respectively, as compared to 2017 due to the effects of the Tax Act, but had no significant impact to earnings due to a corresponding decrease in water and electric income tax expense. Furthermore, there was a decrease in surcharges of $3.7 million recorded in water revenues to recover previously incurred costs, which also did not impact water earnings. Surcharges to recover previously incurred costs are recorded to revenues when billed to customers and are offset by a corresponding amount in operating expenses (primarily administrative and general), resulting in no impact to earnings.\nTable 98: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>12/31/2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12/31/2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>CHANGE\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>CHANGE\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>WATER OPERATING REVENUES (1)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>295,258\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>306,332\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(11,074\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-3.6\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>WATER SUPPLY COSTS:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Water purchased (1)\n</td> <td>68,904\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>68,302\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>602\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.9\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Power purchased for pumping (1)\n</td> <td>8,971\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8,518\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>453\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5.3\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Groundwater production assessment (1)\n</td> <td>19,440\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>18,638\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>802\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.3\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Water supply cost balancing accounts (1)\n</td> <td>(17,116\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(20,289\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,173\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-15.6\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>TOTAL WATER SUPPLY COSTS\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>80,199\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>75,169\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>5,030\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6.7\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>WATER GROSS MARGIN (2)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>215,059\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>231,163\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(16,104\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-7.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>ELECTRIC OPERATING REVENUES (1)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>34,350\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>33,969\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>381\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.1\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>ELECTRIC SUPPLY COSTS:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Power purchased for resale (1)\n</td> <td>11,590\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10,720\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>870\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8.1\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Electric supply cost balancing accounts (1)\n</td> <td>1,467\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,350\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(883\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-37.6\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>TOTAL ELECTRIC SUPPLY COSTS\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>13,057\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>13,070\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(13\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-0.1\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>ELECTRIC GROSS MARGIN (2)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>21,293\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>20,899\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>394\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.9\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 99: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n(1) As reported on AWR's Consolidated Statements of Income, except for supply-cost-balancing accounts. The sums of water and electric supply-cost balancing accounts in the table above are shown on AWR's Consolidated Statements of Income and totaled $(15.6) million and $(17.9) million for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. Revenues include surcharges that have no net earnings impact because they increase both revenues and operating expenses by corresponding amounts.\n(2) Water and electric gross margins do not include depreciation and amortization, maintenance, administrative and general, property and other taxes, and other operation expenses.\nTwo of the principal factors affecting water supply costs are the amount of water produced and the source of the water. Generally, the variable cost of producing water from wells is less than the cost of water purchased from wholesale suppliers. Under the CPUC-approved Modified Cost Balancing Account (\"MCBA\"), GSWC tracks adopted and actual expense levels for\npurchased water, power purchased for pumping and pump taxes. GSWC records the variances (which include the effects of changes in both rate and volume) between adopted and actual purchased water, purchased power and pump tax expenses. GSWC recovers from or refunds to customers the amount of such variances. GSWC tracks these variances individually for each water ratemaking area.\nThe overall actual percentages for purchased water for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 were 41% and 42%, respectively, as compared to the adopted percentages of 28% for both 2018 and 2017. The higher actual percentages of purchased water as compared to adopted percentages resulted primarily from several wells being out of service. Purchased water costs for the year ended December 31, 2018 increased to $68.9 million as compared to $68.3 million for the same period in 2017 primarily due to an increase in customer usage, as well as an increase in wholesale water costs as compared to the year ended December 31, 2017.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2018, the cost of power purchased for pumping increased to $9.0 million as compared to $8.5 million for the same period in 2017 primarily due to an increase in customer usage as well increases in electric rates.\nGroundwater production assessments were $19.4 million in 2018 as compared to $18.6 million in 2017 due to an increase in pump tax rates during 2018 as compared to 2017.\nThe under-collection in the water supply cost balancing account decreased $3.2 million during the year ended December 31, 2018 as compared to the same period in 2017 due to the CPUC-approved rate increases to cover increases in supply costs experienced in most ratemaking areas. This increase to revenues was largely offset by a corresponding increase in supply costs, which reduces the under-collection in the water supply cost balancing account.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2018, the cost of power purchased for resale to BVES's customers was $11.6 million as compared to $10.7 million for the same period in 2017. The average price per megawatt-hour (\"MWh\"), including fixed costs, increased to $79.90 per MWh in 2018 from $73.03 per MWh for the year ended December 31, 2017.\nOther Operation\nThe primary components of other operation expenses for GSWC include payroll, materials and supplies, chemicals and water-treatment costs, and outside service costs of operating the regulated water and electric systems, including the costs associated with transmission and distribution, pumping, water quality, meter reading, billing, and operations of district offices. Registrant's contracted services operations incur many of the same types of expenses.

There was no similar reduction recorded in 2018. Excluding the impact of this recovery, as well as changes in billed surcharges which have no impact to earnings, other operation expenses at the water segment decreased overall by approximately $459,000 due, in large part, to lower conservation costs incurred compared to 2017.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2018, total other operation expenses at the electric segment increased mainly due to higher labor-related costs.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2018, total other operation expenses for the contracted services segment increased mainly due to the commencement of operations at Fort Riley on July 1, 2018, including transition costs.\nAdministrative and General\nAdministrative and general expenses include payroll related to administrative and general functions, the related employee benefits, insurance expenses, outside legal and consulting fees, regulatory utility commission expenses, expenses associated with being a public company and general corporate expenses charged to expense accounts.

This decrease was offset by a corresponding decrease in administrative and general expense to reflect the recovery of these costs, resulting in no impact to earnings. Excluding the decrease in billed surcharges, administrative and general expenses at the water segment increased by $1.7 million due primarily to the receipt of $1.8 million in December 2017 for reimbursement of litigation costs pursuant to a settlement agreement, which were reflected as a reduction to legal expenses in 2017. There was no similar reduction recorded in 2018. Overall, other administrative and general expenses remained relatively flat compared to 2017.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2018, administrative and general expenses for the electric segment increased by $1.0 million as compared to 2017 due to an increase in regulatory, legal and outside services costs.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2018, administrative and general expenses for contracted services increased by $1.3 million due primarily to the commencement of operations at Eglin AFB and at Fort Riley in 2017 and 2018, respectively, as well as an increase in labor-related costs.\nDepreciation and Amortization\nFor the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, depreciation and amortization expense by segment consisted of the following amounts (in thousands):\nTable 102: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year\nEnded\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Year\nEnded\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>12/31/2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12/31/2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>CHANGE\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>CHANGE\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Water Services\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>36,137\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>35,706\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>431\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.2\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Electric Services\n</td> <td>2,258\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,146\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>112\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5.2\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Contracted Services\n</td> <td>2,030\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,179\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>851\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>72.2\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total depreciation and amortization\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>40,425\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>39,031\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,394\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.6\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nFor the year ended December 31, 2018, depreciation and amortization expense increased due to fixed asset additions for all business segments during 2018.

The increase in interest income at the contracted services segment was due to Registrant's adoption of ASC Topic 606 (Revenues from Contracts with Customers) on January 1, 2018 using the modified retrospective approach. As a result of this adoption, certain funds received by the contracted services segment from the U.S. government during 2018 have been recorded as interest income. Prior to the adoption of ASC Topic 606, these funds were recorded as revenues.\nOther, net\nFor the year ended December 31, 2018, other income decreased by $1.3 million primarily due to losses recorded on investments held for a retirement benefit plan resulting from unfavorable market conditions in 2018, as compared to gains recorded in 2017. This was partially offset by a decrease in the non-service cost components of net periodic benefit costs related to Registrant's defined benefit pension plans and other retirement benefits. However, as a result of GSWC's pension balancing account authorized by the CPUC, changes in net periodic benefit costs are mostly offset by corresponding changes in revenues, having no material impact to earnings.\nIncome Tax Expense\nFor the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, income tax expense by segment, including AWR (parent), consisted of the following amounts (in thousands):\nTable 107: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year\nEnded\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Year\nEnded\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>12/31/2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12/31/2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>CHANGE\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>CHANGE\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Water Services\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>12,391\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>32,212\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(19,821\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-61.5\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Electric Services\n</td> <td>1,212\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,847\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(635\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-34.4\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Contracted Services\n</td> <td>4,939\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7,136\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(2,197\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-30.8\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>AWR (parent)\n</td> <td>(525\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(2,221\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,696\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-76.4\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total income tax expense\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>18,017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>38,974\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(20,957\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-53.8\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nConsolidated income tax expense for the year ended December 31, 2018 decreased by $21.0 million primarily due to a lower effective income tax rate (\"ETR\") from the Tax Act.

For all segments, the lower income tax expense resulting from the Tax Act was due primarily to the reduction in the federal corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21%, which was largely offset by

Previously reported amounts for 2017 and 2016 have been reclassified on the income statements to conform to the current-period presentation.\nSummary Results by Segment\nThe table below sets forth diluted earnings per share by business segment for AWR's operations:\nTable 109: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Diluted Earnings per Share\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>12/31/2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12/31/2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>CHANGE\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Water, excluding one-time gain on sale of Ojai water system\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1.22\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1.17\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>0.05\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Electric\n</td> <td>0.11\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.10\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.01\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Contracted services\n</td> <td>0.37\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.33\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.04\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>AWR (parent)\n</td> <td>0.05\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.02\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.03\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Consolidated diluted earnings per share, adjusted\n</td> <td>1.75\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.62\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.13\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gain on sale of Ojai water system\n</td> <td>0.13\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.13\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Totals from operations, as reported\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1.88\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1.62\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>0.26\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nWater Segment:\nFor the year ended December 31, 2017, fully diluted earnings per share for the water segment increased by $0.18 per share to $1.35 per share, as compared to $1.17 per share for 2016 due, in large part, to the one-time $0.13 per share pretax gain on the sale of Ojai assets in June 2017. In addition, in February 2017, the CPUC approved recovery of incremental costs related to California's drought state of emergency, which were previously expensed. As a result of this approval, during the first quarter of 2017, GSWC recorded a regulatory asset and a corresponding increase to pretax earnings of $1.5 million, or $0.02 per share, of which $1.2 million was reflected as a reduction to other operation expenses and approximately $260,000 was reflected as additional revenue. Furthermore, affecting the results and comparability between the two periods were higher gains recorded in 2017 on Registrant's investments held to fund a retirement benefit plan as compared to 2016. This non-core business item increased the water segment's earnings on a relative basis by approximately $0.02 per share.\nExcluding the impact of the items discussed above and an increase in billed surcharges which have no impact to earnings, diluted earnings from the water segment for 2017 increased by $0.01 per share as compared to 2016 due to the following items, which impacted the comparability between the two periods:\nTable 110: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>A decrease in operating expenses (excluding supply costs) increased earnings by approximately $0.05 per share due, in large part, to a reduction in legal costs of $1.8 million, or $0.03 per share, recorded in December 2017 for amounts received from the City of Claremont pursuant to a settlement agreement. Excluding this item, overall operating expenses decreased by $0.02 per share due mostly to lower maintenance costs, and incurring only a partial year of Ojai-related operating expenses as a result of the sale. These decreases were partially offset by higher medical insurance costs, conservation costs, general rate-case-related expenses and property and other taxes, as well as an $800,000 reduction in operating expenses recorded in the fourth quarter of 2016 as a result of the CPUC's water general rate case decision, which granted recovery of previously incurred costs tracked in memorandum accounts.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 111: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Excluding gains and losses on investments, there was an increase in interest and other income (net of interest expense), which increased earnings by approximately $0.01 per share, due primarily to (i) higher interest income on GSWC's regulatory assets resulting mostly from an increase in the 90-day commercial paper rate, and (ii) amounts collected from developers on certain outstanding balances owed to GSWC.\n</td> </tr>\n</table> The increase in diluted earnings from the water segment discussed above were partially offset by the following:\nTable 112: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>An overall decrease in the water gross margin of $2.3 million, or $0.03 per share, largely due to the cessation of Ojai operations in June 2017.

The increase in the ETR was due, in large part, to the remeasurement of certain non-rate-regulated deferred tax assets (primarily compensation- and benefit-related items) in connection with the Tax Act, which negatively impacted water earnings by approximately $0.03 per share. This was partially offset by changes in flow-through and permanent items at the water segment.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nElectric Segment:\nFor the year ended December 31, 2017, diluted earnings from the electric segment increased by $0.01 per share as compared to the same period in 2016. Operating expenses (other than supply costs) decreased by $1.2 million primarily due to additional costs incurred in 2016 in response to power outages caused by severe winter storms experienced in January 2016, lower regulatory costs, and lower costs associated with energy efficiency and solar power programs approved by the CPUC. There was also a decrease in the effective income tax rate for the electric segment as compared to the same period in 2016 resulting primarily from changes in flow-through items. These increases to earnings were partially offset by a lower electric gross margin, which was due mostly to a downward adjustment in the electric revenue requirement to reflect updated allocations from the general office as a result of the decision in the water general rate case.\nContracted Services Segment:\nFor the year ended December 31, 2017, diluted earnings from contracted services were $0.37 per share, compared to $0.33 per share for the same period in 2016. There was an increase in management fee revenues from the successful resolution of various price adjustments and asset transfers received during 2016 and 2017. This includes approximately $1.0 million, or $0.02 per share, of retroactive management fees recorded in 2017 which related to periods prior to 2017, as compared to $421,000, or $0.01 per share, of retroactive management fees recorded in 2016 which related to periods prior to 2016. There was also an increase in management fees and construction revenues generated from the operations at Eglin Air Force Base (\"Eglin AFB\"), which began in June 2017. These increases to earnings were partially offset by higher operating costs due to transition activities and joint inventory study at Eglin AFB, as well as increases in labor and outside services costs related to business development and compliance.\nAWR (parent):\nFor the year ended December 31, 2017, diluted earnings from AWR (parent) increased $0.03 per share compared to 2016 due to the remeasurement of deferred tax balances recorded at the parent level. The one-time remeasurement was based on the Tax Act's lower federal corporate tax rate of 21% as compared to 35%, which increased earnings at AWR (parent) by approximately $0.03 per share during 2017.\nThe following discussion and analysis for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 provides information on AWR's consolidated operations and assets and, where necessary, includes specific references to AWR's individual segments and subsidiaries: GSWC and ASUS and its subsidiaries.\nOperating Revenues\nWater\nFor the year ended December 31, 2017, revenues from water operations increased by $3.4 million to $306.3 million, compared to $302.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase was primarily due to second-year rate increases effective January 1, 2017, and rate increases to specifically cover increases in supply costs experienced in certain rate-making areas. The rate changes related to supply costs are largely offset by a corresponding increase in supply costs, resulting in an insignificant change to the water gross margin. There were also new surcharges implemented during 2017 to recover previously incurred costs, which were offset by a corresponding increase in operating expenses (primarily administrative and general) totaling $3.6 million, resulting in no impact to earnings. These increases in revenues were partially offset by lower revenues due to the cessation of Ojai operations in June 2017.\nBilled water consumption for the year ended December 31, 2017 increased approximately 4% as compared to 2016. In general, changes in consumption do not have a significant impact on recorded revenues due to the CPUC-approved WRAM accounts in place in the majority of GSWC's rate-making areas. GSWC records the difference between what it bills its water customers and that which is authorized by the CPUC in the WRAM accounts as regulatory assets or liabilities.\nElectric\nIn 2016, the CPUC granted BVES's request to defer the filing of its next electric general rate case to 2017, setting new rates for the years 2018 through 2021. As a result, adopted base revenues for 2017 were based on 2016 adopted base revenues, adjusted for the change in the general office allocation approved by the CPUC in the water general rate case. For the year ended December 31, 2017, revenues from electric operations were $34.0 million as compared to $35.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. This decrease was primarily due to the reduction in the adopted revenue requirement for electric to reflect a decrease in the general office allocation. In May 2017, BVES filed its general rate case application with the CPUC. A final decision is expected in 2019.\nBilled electric usage for the year ended December 31, 2017 decreased slightly as compared to the same period in 2016. Due to the CPUC-approved base revenue requirement adjustment mechanism (\"BRRAM\"), which adjusts base revenues to adopted levels authorized by the CPUC, changes in usage do not have a significant impact on earnings.\nContracted Services\nRevenues from contracted services are composed of construction revenues (including renewal and replacements) and management fees for operating and maintaining the water and/or wastewater systems at various military bases. For the year ended December 31, 2017, revenues from contracted services were $100.3 million as compared to $97.4 million for 2016. There was an increase in ongoing operations and maintenance management fees due to the successful resolution of various price adjustments and asset transfers during 2016 and 2017, as well as the commencement of operations at Eglin AFB in June 2017. Included in management fees for 2017 was approximately $1.0 million in retroactive revenues related to periods prior to 2017, as compared to $421,000 of retroactive management fees recorded in 2016 which related to periods prior to 2016. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in construction activity in 2017 as compared to 2016.\nDuring 2017, ASUS was awarded approximately $20.2 million in new construction projects, the majority of which were completed during 2018.\nOperating Expenses:\nSupply Costs\nTotal supply costs comprise the largest segment of total operating expenses. Supply costs accounted for 28.1% and 26.8% of total operating expenses for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. The table below provides the amounts (in thousands) of increases (decreases) and percent changes in water and electric revenues, supply costs and gross margins during the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016:\nTable 114: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>12/31/2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12/31/2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>CHANGE\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>CHANGE\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>WATER OPERATING REVENUES (1)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>306,332\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>302,931\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,401\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.1\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>WATER SUPPLY COSTS:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Water purchased (1)\n</td> <td>68,302\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>64,442\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,860\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Power purchased for pumping (1)\n</td> <td>8,518\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8,663\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(145\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-1.7\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Groundwater production assessment (1)\n</td> <td>18,638\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>14,993\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,645\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>24.3\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Water supply cost balancing accounts (1)\n</td> <td>(20,289\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(14,813\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(5,476\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>37.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>TOTAL WATER SUPPLY COSTS\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>75,169\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>73,285\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,884\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.6\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>WATER GROSS MARGIN (2)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>231,163\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>229,646\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,517\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.7\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>ELECTRIC OPERATING REVENUES (1)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>33,969\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>35,771\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(1,802\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-5.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>ELECTRIC SUPPLY COSTS:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Power purchased for resale (1)\n</td> <td>10,720\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10,387\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>333\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.2\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Electric supply cost balancing accounts (1)\n</td> <td>2,350\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,607\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(257\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-9.9\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>TOTAL ELECTRIC SUPPLY COSTS\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>13,070\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>12,994\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>76\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.6\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>ELECTRIC GROSS MARGIN (2)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>20,899\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>22,777\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(1,878\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-8.2\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 115: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n(1) As reported on AWR's Consolidated Statements of Income, except for supply-cost-balancing accounts. The sums of water and electric supply-cost balancing accounts in the table above are shown on AWR's Consolidated Statements of Income and totaled $(17.9) million and $(12.2) million for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Revenues include surcharges, which increase both revenues and operating expenses by corresponding amounts, thus having no net earnings impact.\n(2) Water and electric gross margins do not include depreciation and amortization, maintenance, administrative and general, property and other taxes, and other operation expenses.\nThe overall actual percentages for purchased water for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 were 42% and 40%, respectively, as compared to the adopted percentages of 28% and 29% for 2017 and 2016, respectively. The higher actual percentages of purchased water as compared to adopted percentages resulted primarily from several wells being out of service.\nPurchased water costs for the year ended December 31, 2017 increased to $68.3 million as compared to $64.4 million for the same period in 2016 primarily due to an increase of purchased water in the supply mix as a result of several wells being out of service, as well as an increase in wholesale water costs as compared to the year ended December 31, 2016.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2017, the cost of power purchased for pumping decreased slightly to $8.5 million as compared to $8.7 million for the same period in 2016 primarily due to decreases in pumped water. Groundwater production assessments were $18.6 million in 2017 as compared to $15.0 million in 2016 due to an increase in pump tax rates and pump taxes paid for water storage rights during 2017 as compared to 2016.\nThe under-collection in the water supply cost balancing account increased $5.5 million during the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to the same period in 2016 due to the higher purchased water costs as well as higher groundwater production assessments as compared to adopted water supply costs.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2017, the cost of power purchased for resale to BVES's customers was $10.7 million as compared to $10.4 million for the same period in 2016. The average price per megawatt-hour (\"MWh\"), including fixed costs, increased to $73.03 per MWh in 2017 from $69.54 per MWh for the year ended December 31, 2016.\nOther Operation\nFor the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, other operation expenses by business segment consisted of the following amounts (in thousands):\nTable 116: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year\nEnded\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Year\nEnded\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>12/31/2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12/31/2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>CHANGE\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>CHANGE\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Water Services\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>22,189\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>21,649\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>540\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.5\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Electric Services\n</td> <td>2,688\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,122\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(434\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-13.9\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Contracted Services\n</td> <td>5,117\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,486\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,631\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>46.8\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total other operation\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>29,994\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>28,257\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,737\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6.1\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nDuring 2017, there was a $433,000 increase in surcharges billed to customers to recover previously incurred other operation expenses approved by the CPUC as part of the final decision on the water general rate case. These surcharges increased revenues and water gross margin with a corresponding increase in other operation expenses, resulting in no impact to earnings. Furthermore, in February 2017, the CPUC approved the recovery of incremental drought-related costs incurred in 2015 and 2016 during the drought state of emergency in California. As a result of the CPUC's approval, GSWC recorded a $1.2 million regulatory asset with a corresponding reduction in other operation expenses during the first quarter of 2017. Excluding the impact of surcharges and the recovery of drought-related costs, other operation expenses at the water segment increased by $1.3 million during the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to the same period in 2016. The increase was due primarily to higher conservation costs, labor and bad debt expense.\nThe decrease in other operation expenses at the electric segment was due to outside services costs and labor costs incurred in response to power outages caused by severe winter storms experienced in January 2016. There were no similar events in 2017.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2017, total other operation expenses for the contracted services segment increased mainly due to transition costs incurred at Eglin AFB, including a joint inventory study conducted with the U.S. government for the water and wastewater system infrastructure. ASUS assumed operations at Eglin AFB in June 2017, which further increased other operation expenses in 2017 as compared to 2016. ASUS assumed the operations at Fort Riley in July 2018.\nAdministrative and General\nFor the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, administrative and general expenses by business segment, including AWR (parent), consisted of the following amounts (in thousands):\nTable 117: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year\nEnded\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Year\nEnded\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>12/31/2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12/31/2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>CHANGE\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>CHANGE\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Water Services\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>55,471\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>56,745\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(1,274\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-2.2\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Electric Services\n</td> <td>6,937\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7,953\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1,016\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-12.8\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Contracted Services\n</td> <td>19,139\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>16,801\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,338\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>13.9\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>AWR (parent)\n</td> <td>96\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>19\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>77\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>405.3\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total administrative and general\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>81,643\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>81,518\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>125\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.2\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nSurcharges were implemented in 2017 to recover previously incurred administrative and general costs approved by the CPUC as part of the final decision on the water general rate case issued in March 2017. A $3.3 million increase in revenues and water gross margin from these surcharges was offset by a corresponding increase in administrative and general expense to reflect the recovery of these costs, resulting in no impact to earnings. Excluding the increase in billed surcharges, administrative and general expenses at the water segment decreased by $4.6 million due primarily to lower legal expenses related to condemnation matters as compared to 2016. In addition, the Claremont settlement payment received in December 2017 included reimbursement of approximately $1.8 million in litigation costs, which was reflected as a reduction to legal expenses in 2017. These decreases were partially offset by higher medical insurance costs and general-rate-case-related expenses, as well as an $800,000 reduction to administrative and general expenses recorded in 2016 to reflect the CPUC's approval for recovery of previously incurred costs that were being tracked in CPUC-authorized memorandum accounts.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2017, administrative and general expenses for the electric segment decreased by $1.0 million as compared to 2016 due to lower regulatory costs, as well as decreases in costs associated with the energy-efficiency and solar-initiative programs approved by the CPUC.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2017, administrative and general expenses for contracted services increased by $2.3 million due primarily to (i) an increase in labor-related costs, (ii) the start of operations at Eglin AFB in June 2017, which increased administrative and general expenses in 2017 as compared to 2016, and (iii) an increase in outside services costs related to new business development and compliance.\nDepreciation and Amortization\nFor the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, depreciation and amortization expense by segment consisted of the following amounts (in thousands):\nTable 118: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year\nEnded\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Year\nEnded\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>12/31/2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12/31/2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>CHANGE\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>CHANGE\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Water Services\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>35,706\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>35,777\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(71\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-0.2\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Electric Services\n</td> <td>2,146\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,027\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>119\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5.9\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Contracted Services\n</td> <td>1,179\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,046\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>133\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12.7\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total depreciation and amortization\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>39,031\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>38,850\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>181\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.5\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nFor the year ended December 31, 2017, depreciation and amortization expense at the water segment decreased due primarily to retirements recorded during 2017 and 2016, as well as the sale of the Ojai utility assets in June 2017.

AWR's effective income tax rate (\"ETR\") was 36.0% and 36.8% for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. The ETR for GSWC was 38.8% for 2017 as compared to 37.9% for 2016 due, in part, to the remeasurement of non rate-regulated deferred tax assets as a result of the Tax Act, which reduced the federal corporate tax rate from 35% to 21%. The earnings impact of this increase in GSWC's ETR was largely offset by a reduction in deferred tax liabilities at AWR (parent), due also to the remeasurement of federal deferred tax liabilities associated with the California state unitary deferred tax balance.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nCritical accounting policies and estimates are those that are important to the portrayal of AWR's financial condition, results of operations and cash flows, and require the most difficult, subjective or complex judgments of AWR's management. The need to make estimates about the effect of items that are uncertain is what makes these judgments difficult, subjective and/or complex. Management makes subjective judgments about the accounting and regulatory treatment of many items. The following are accounting policies that are critical to the financial statements of AWR. For more information regarding the significant accounting policies of Registrant, see Note 1 of Notes to Financial Statements\u201d included in Part II, Item 8, in Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\nAccounting for Rate Regulation - Because GSWC operates extensively in a regulated business, it is subject to the authoritative guidance for accounting for the effects of certain types of regulation. Application of this guidance requires accounting for certain transactions in accordance with regulations adopted by the regulatory commissions of the states in which rate-regulated operations are conducted. Utility companies defer costs and credits on the balance sheet as regulatory assets and liabilities when it is probable that those costs and credits will be recognized in the ratemaking process in a period different from the period in which they would have been reflected in income by an unregulated company. These deferred regulatory assets and liabilities are then reflected in the income statement in the period in which the same amounts are reflected in the rates charged for service.\nRegulation and the effects of regulatory accounting have the most significant impact on the financial statements of GSWC. When GSWC files for adjustments to rates, the capital assets, operating costs and other matters are subject to review, and disallowances may occur. In the event that a portion of the GSWC's operations is no longer subject to the accounting guidance for the effects of certain types of regulation, GSWC is required to write-off related regulatory assets that are not specifically recoverable and determine if other assets might be impaired. If the CPUC determines that a portion of GSWC's assets are not recoverable in customer rates, GSWC is required to determine if it has suffered an asset impairment that would require a write-down in the asset valuation. Management continually evaluates the anticipated recovery, settlement or refund of regulatory assets, liabilities, and revenues subject to refund and provides for allowances and/or reserves that it believes to be necessary. In the event that GSWC's assessment as to the probability of the inclusion in the ratemaking process is incorrect, the associated regulatory asset or liability will be adjusted to reflect the change in assessment or the impact of regulatory approval of rates. Reviews by the CPUC may also result in additional regulatory liabilities to refund previously collected revenues to customers if the CPUC were to disallow costs included in the ratemaking process.\nRegistrant also reviews its utility plant in-service for possible impairment in accordance with accounting guidance for regulated entities for abandonments and disallowances of plant costs.\nRevenue Recognition - Effective January 1, 2018, Registrant adopted Accounting Standard Update 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606) (\"ASU 2014-09\") issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board. The adoption of this revenue guidance did not have a material impact on how Registrant recognizes revenue.\nGSWC records water and electric utility operating revenues when the service is provided to customers. Operating revenues include unbilled revenues that are earned (i.e., the service has been provided) but not billed by the end of each accounting period. Unbilled revenues are calculated based on the number of days and total usage from each customer's most recent billing record that was billed prior to the end of the accounting period, and is used to estimate unbilled consumption as of the year-end reporting period. Unbilled revenues are recorded for both monthly and bi-monthly customers.\nThe CPUC granted GSWC the authority to implement revenue decoupling mechanisms through the adoption of the WRAM and the BRRAM. With the adoption of these alternative revenue programs, GSWC adjusts revenues in the WRAM and BRRAM for the difference between what is billed to its regulated customers and that which is authorized by the CPUC. Alternative revenue programs such as the WRAM and BRRAM are outside the scope of ASU 2014-09.\nAs required by the accounting guidance for alternative revenue programs, GSWC is required to collect its WRAM and BRRAM balances within 24 months following the year in which they are recorded. The CPUC has set the recovery period for under-collected balances that are up to 15% of adopted annual revenues at 18 months or less. For net WRAM under-collected balances greater than 15%, the recovery period is 19 to 36 months. As a result of the accounting guidance and CPUC-adopted recovery periods, Registrant must estimate if any WRAM and BRRAM revenues will be collected beyond the 24-month period, which can affect the timing of when such revenues are recognized.\nRevenues for ASUS's operations and maintenance contracts are recognized when services have been rendered to the U.S. government pursuant to 50-year contracts. Revenues from construction activities are recognized based on either the\npercentage-of-completion or cost-plus methods of accounting. In accordance with GAAP, revenue recognition under these methods requires management to estimate the progress toward completion on a contract in terms of efforts, such as costs incurred. This approach is used because management considers it to be the best available measure of progress on these contracts. Changes in job performance, job conditions, change orders and estimated profitability, including those arising from any contract penalty provisions, and final contract settlements may result in revisions to costs and income, and are recognized in the period in which the revisions are determined. Unbilled receivables from the U.S. government represent amounts to be billed for construction work completed and/or for services rendered pursuant to the 50-year contracts with the U.S government, which are not presently billable but which will be billed under the terms of the contracts.\nIncome Taxes - Registrant's income tax calculations require estimates due principally to the regulated nature of the operations of GSWC, the multiple states in which Registrant operates, and potential future tax rate changes. Registrant uses the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes under which deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which these temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. Changes in regulatory treatment, or significant changes in tax-related estimates, assumptions or law, could have a material impact on the financial position and results of operations of Registrant.\nAs a regulated utility, GSWC treats certain temporary differences as flow-through adjustments in computing its income tax expense consistent with the income tax approach approved by the CPUC for ratemaking purposes. Flow-through adjustments increase or decrease tax expense in one period, with an offsetting decrease or increase occurring in another period. Giving effect to these temporary differences as flow-through adjustments typically results in a greater variance between the effective tax rate and the statutory federal income tax rate in any given period than would otherwise exist if GSWC were not required to account for its income taxes as a regulated enterprise. As of December 31, 2018, Registrant's total amount of unrecognized tax benefits was zero.\nPension Benefits - Registrant's pension benefit obligations and related costs are calculated using actuarial concepts within the framework of accounting guidance for employers' accounting for pensions and post-retirement benefits other than pensions. Two critical assumptions, the discount rate and the expected return on plan assets, are important elements of expense and/or liability measurement. We evaluate these critical assumptions annually. Other assumptions include employee demographic factors such as retirement patterns, mortality, turnover and rate of compensation increase. The discount rate enables Registrant to state expected future cash payments for benefits as a present value on the measurement date. The guideline for setting this rate is a high-quality, long-term corporate bond rate. Registrant's discount rates were determined by considering the average of pension yield curves constructed using a large population of high-quality corporate bonds. The resulting discount rates reflect the matching of plan liability cash flows to the yield curves. A lower discount rate increases the present value of benefit obligations and increases periodic pension expense. Conversely, a higher discount rate decreases the present value of benefit obligations and decreases periodic pension expense. To determine the expected long-term rate of return on the plan assets, Registrant considers the current and expected asset allocation, as well as historical and expected returns on each plan asset class. A lower expected rate of return on plan assets will increase pension expense. The long-term expected return on the pension plan's assets was 6.50% in both 2018 and 2017.\nFor the pension plan obligation, Registrant increased the discount rate to 4.43% as of December 31, 2018 from 3.76% as of December 31, 2017 to reflect market interest-rate conditions at December 31, 2018. A hypothetical 25-basis point decrease in the assumed discount rate would have increased total net periodic pension expense for 2018 by approximately $855,000, or 27.8%, and would have increased the projected benefit obligation ( PBO\u201d) and accumulated benefit obligation ( ABO\u201d) at December 31, 2018 by a total of $7.0 million, or 3.6%. A 25-basis point further decrease in the long-term return on pension-plan-asset assumption would have increased 2018 pension cost by approximately $430,000, or 14.0%.\nIn addition, changes in the fair value of plan assets will impact future pension cost and the Plan's funded status. Volatile market conditions can affect the value of AWR's trust established to fund its future long-term pension benefits. Any reductions in the value of plan assets will result in increased future expense, an increase in the underfunded position and increased future contributions.\nThe CPUC has authorized GSWC to maintain two-way balancing accounts to track differences between the forecasted annual pension expenses adopted in rates and the actual annual expense to be recorded by GSWC in accordance with the accounting guidance for pension costs. As of December 31, 2018, GSWC has a $3.0 million over-collection in the two-way pension balancing accounts, consisting of a $2.0 million over-collection related to the general office and water regions, and a $1.0 million over-collection related to BVES.\nFunding requirements for qualified defined benefit pension plans are determined by government regulations. In establishing the contribution amount, Registrant has considered the potential impact of funding-rule changes under the Pension Protection Act of 2006. Registrant contributes the minimum required contribution as determined by government regulations or the forecasted annual pension cost authorized by the CPUC and included in customer rates, whichever is higher. In accordance with this funding policy, for 2019 the pension contribution is expected to be approximately $3.6 million. Any differences between the forecasted annual pension costs in rates and the actual pension costs are included in the two-way pension balancing accounts.\nAdditionally, our pension plan liabilities are sensitive to changes in interest rates. As interest rates decrease, thereby reducing returns, our liabilities increase, potentially increasing benefit expense and funding requirements. In addition, market factors can affect assumptions we use in determining funding requirements with respect to our pension plan. For example, a relatively modest change in our assumptions regarding discount rates can materially affect our calculation of funding requirements. To the extent that market data compels us to reduce the discount rate used in our assumptions, our benefit obligations could materially increase.\nChanges in demographics, including increased numbers of retirees or increases in life expectancy assumptions may also increase the funding requirements of our obligations related to the pension and other postretirement benefit plans. Mortality assumptions are a critical component of benefit obligation amounts and a key factor in determining the expected length of time for annuity payments. Assuming no changes in actuarial assumptions or plan amendments, the costs over the long term are expected to decrease due to the closure of Registrant's defined benefit pension plan to new employees as of January 1, 2011. Employees hired or rehired after December 31, 2010 are eligible to participate in a defined contribution plan.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nAWR\nRegistrant's regulated business is capital intensive and requires considerable capital resources. A portion of these capital resources is provided by internally generated cash flows from operations. AWR anticipates that interest expense will increase in future periods due to the need for additional external capital to fund its construction program, and as market interest rates increase. AWR believes that costs associated with capital used to fund construction at GSWC will continue to be recovered through water and electric rates charged to customers.\nAWR funds its operating expenses and pays dividends on its outstanding Common Shares primarily through dividends from its wholly owned subsidiaries. The ability of GSWC to pay dividends to AWR is restricted by California law. Under these restrictions, approximately $211.2 million was available for GSWC to pay dividends to AWR on December 31, 2018. Approximately $67.3 million was available for ASUS to pay dividends to AWR as of December 31, 2018 to the extent that the subsidiaries of ASUS are able to pay dividends in that amount to ASUS under applicable state laws.\nWhen necessary, Registrant obtains funds from external sources in the capital markets and through bank borrowings. Access to external financing on reasonable terms depends on the credit ratings of AWR and GSWC and current business conditions, including that of the water utility industry in general, as well as conditions in the debt and equity capital markets. AWR has access to a syndicated credit facility, which expires in May 2023. AWR borrows under this facility and provides funds to its subsidiaries, GSWC and ASUS, in support of their operations. Any amounts owed to AWR by GSWC for borrowings under this facility are included in inter-company payables on GSWC's balance sheet. The interest rate charged to GSWC and ASUS is sufficient to cover AWR's interest cost under the credit facility.\nIn March of 2019, $40 million of GSWC's 6.70% senior notes will mature. GSWC intends to borrow under its intercompany borrowing arrangement with AWR to fund the repayment of this note. As of February 1, 2019 there were $99.5 million of outstanding borrowings under this facility and $940,000 of letters of credit outstanding. As of February 1, 2019, AWR had $49.6 million available to borrow under the credit facility.\nIn July 2018, Standard and Poor's Global Ratings ( S&P\u201d) affirmed an A+ credit rating with a stable outlook on both AWR and GSWC. S&P's debt ratings range from AAA (highest possible) to D (obligation is in default). In January 2019, Moody's Investors Service (\"Moody's\") affirmed its A2 rating with a positive outlook for GSWC. Securities ratings are not recommendations to buy, sell or hold a security and are subject to change or withdrawal at any time by the rating agencies. Registrant believes that AWR's sound capital structure and A+ credit rating, combined with its financial discipline, will enable AWR to access the debt and equity markets. However, unpredictable financial market conditions in the future may limit its access or impact the timing of when to access the market, in which case, Registrant may choose to temporarily reduce its capital spending. If needed, GSWC may issue long-term debt in the future, depending on market conditions. It is anticipated that the proceeds from any such debt issuance would be used to pay down short-term borrowings and fund a portion of capital expenditures.\nAWR's ability to pay cash dividends on its Common Shares outstanding depends primarily upon cash flows from its subsidiaries. AWR intends to continue paying quarterly cash dividends in the future, on or about March 1, June 1, September 1 and December 1, subject to earnings and financial conditions, regulatory requirements and such other factors as the Board of Directors may deem relevant. Registrant has paid dividends on its Common Shares for over 80 consecutive years. On January 29, 2019, AWR's Board of Directors approved a first quarter dividend of $0.275 per share on AWR's Common Shares. Dividends on the Common Shares will be paid on March 1, 2019 to shareholders of record at the close of business on February 15, 2019.\nCash Flows from Operating Activities:\nCash flows from operating activities have generally provided sufficient cash to fund operating requirements, including a portion of construction expenditures at GSWC, construction expenses at ASUS, and dividend payments. Registrant's future cash flows from operating activities are expected to be affected by a number of factors, including utility regulation; changes in tax law and deferred taxes; maintenance expenses; inflation; compliance with environmental, health and safety standards; production costs; customer growth; per-customer usage of water and electricity; weather and seasonality; conservation efforts; compliance with local governmental requirements, including mandatory restrictions on water use; and required cash contributions to pension and post-retirement plans. Future cash flows from contracted services subsidiaries will depend on new business activities, existing operations, the construction of new and/or replacement infrastructure at military bases, timely economic price and equitable adjustment of prices, and timely collection of payments from the U.S. government and other prime contractors operating at the military bases.\nThe lower federal tax rate and the elimination of bonus depreciation brought about by the Tax Act are reducing Registrant's cash flows from operating activities, and are expected to result in higher financing costs arising from an increased need to raise debt and/or equity.\nASUS funds its operating expenses primarily through internal operating sources, which include U.S. government funding under 50-year contracts for operations and maintenance costs and construction activities, as well as investments by, or loans from, AWR. ASUS, in turn, provides funding to its subsidiaries. ASUS's subsidiaries may also from time to time provide funding to ASUS or its subsidiaries.\nCash flows from operating activities are primarily generated by net income, adjusted for non-cash expenses such as depreciation and amortization, and deferred income taxes. Cash generated by operations varies during the year. Net cash provided by operating activities was $136.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 as compared to $144.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, and $96.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The decrease in cash from operating activities during 2018 was due primarily to: (i) significant differences in the timing of income tax payments made and refunds received between the two periods, and (ii) a decrease resulting from the timing of billing of and cash receipts for construction work at military bases during the year ended December 31, 2018. The billings (and cash receipts) for construction work generally occur at completion of the work or in accordance with a billing schedule contractually agreed to with the U.S. government and/or other prime contractors. Thus, cash flow from construction-related activities may fluctuate from period to period with such fluctuations representing timing differences of when the work is being performed and when the cash is received for payment of the work. These decreases in cash from operating activities were partially offset by an overall increase in cash collected from customers related to GSWC's regulatory accounts. The timing of cash receipts and disbursements related to other working capital items also affected the changes in net cash provided by operating activities.\nThe increase in operating cash flow during 2017 as compared to 2016 was due to various CPUC-approved surcharges implemented during 2017 to recover previously incurred costs as well as income tax refunds received in 2017. The increase in operating cash flow was also due to the timing of billing of and cash receipts for construction work at military bases during 2017. Changes in customer accounts receivable were due to higher balances outstanding resulting from CPUC-approved rate increases and surcharges. The timing of cash receipts and disbursements related to other working capital items also affected the change in net cash provided by operating activities.\nCash Flows from Investing Activities:\nNet cash used in investing activities was $128.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 as compared to $80.0 million used in 2017 and $131.2 million used in 2016. Cash used in investing activities during 2017 were partially offset by $34.3 million in cash proceeds generated from the sale of GSWC's Ojai water system in 2017. Cash used for other investments consists primarily of cash invested in a trust for a retirement benefit plan.\nThe decrease in cash used in investing activities in 2017 as compared to 2016 was due to the $34.3 million in cash proceeds generated from the sale of GSWC's Ojai water system.\nRegistrant invests capital to provide essential services to its regulated customer base, and has an opportunity to earn a fair rate of return on investments in infrastructure. Registrant's infrastructure investment plan consists of both infrastructure renewal programs, where infrastructure is replaced, as needed, and major capital investment projects, where new water treatment and delivery facilities are constructed. GSWC may also be required from time to time to relocate existing infrastructure in order to accommodate local infrastructure improvement projects. Projected capital expenditures and other investments are subject to periodic review and revision.\nCash Flows from Financing Activities:\nRegistrant's financing activities include primarily: (i) the sale proceeds from the issuance of Common Shares and stock option exercises and the repurchase of Common Shares; (ii) the issuance and repayment of long-term debt and notes payable to banks; and (iii) the payment of dividends on Common Shares. In order to finance new infrastructure, Registrant also receives customer advances (net of refunds) for, and contributions in aid of, construction. Short-term borrowings are used to fund capital expenditures until long-term financing is arranged.\nNet cash used in financing activities was $1.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 as compared to net cash used of $64.7 million and net cash provided of $30.3 million for the same periods in 2017 and 2016, respectively. The decrease in net cash used in financing activities in 2018 from 2017 was due to the use of the Ojai sale proceeds, as well as cash\ngenerated from operating activities during 2017 to repay a portion of short-term borrowings from Registrant's revolving credit facility.\nNet cash used in financing activities in 2017 as compared to net cash provided by financing activities in 2016 was due to the use of the Ojai sale proceeds.\nGSWC\nGSWC funds its operating expenses, payments on its debt, dividends on its outstanding common shares and a portion of its construction expenditures through internal sources. Internal sources of cash flow are provided primarily by retention of a portion of earnings from operating activities. Internal cash generation is influenced by factors such as weather patterns, conservation efforts, environmental regulation, litigation, changes in tax law and deferred taxes, changes in supply costs and regulatory decisions affecting GSWC's ability to recover these supply costs, timing of rate relief, increases in maintenance expenses and capital expenditures, surcharges authorized by the CPUC to enable GSWC to recover expenses previously incurred from customers, and CPUC requirements to refund amounts previously charged to customers.\nGSWC may, at times, utilize external sources, including equity investments and short-term borrowings from AWR, and long-term debt to help fund a portion of its construction expenditures. On November 29, 2018, the Board of Directors approved the issuance of nineteen additional GSWC common shares to AWR for $47.5 million. GSWC used the proceeds from the issuance to pay down intercompany borrowings owed to AWR.\nIn addition, GSWC receives advances and contributions from customers, homebuilders and real estate developers to fund construction necessary to extend service to new areas. Advances for construction are generally refundable at a rate of 2.5% in equal annual installments over 40 years. Amounts that are no longer subject to refund are reclassified to contributions in aid of construction. Utility plant funded by advances and contributions is excluded from rate base. Generally, GSWC amortizes contributions in aid of construction at the same composite rate of depreciation for the related property.\nAs is often the case with public utilities, GSWC's current liabilities may at times exceed its current assets. Management believes that internally generated funds, along with the proceeds from the issuance of long-term debt, borrowings from AWR, and common share issuances to AWR, will be adequate to provide sufficient capital to enable GSWC to maintain normal operations and to meet its capital and financing requirements pending recovery of costs in rates.\nIn March of 2019, $40 million of GSWC's 6.70% senior note will mature. GSWC intends to borrow under its intercompany borrowing arrangement with AWR to fund the repayment of this note.\nCash Flows from Operating Activities:\nNet cash provided by operating activities was $120.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 as compared to $129.6 million and $101.3 million for the same periods in 2017 and 2016, respectively. This decrease was primarily due to significant differences in the timing of income tax payments made and refunds received between the two periods, partially offset by an overall increase in cash collected from customers related to GSWC's regulatory accounts. The timing of cash receipts and disbursements related to other working capital items also affected net cash provided by operating activities.\nThe increase in cash from operations in 2017 as compared to 2016 was due to various CPUC-approved surcharges implemented during 2017 to recover previously incurred costs, as well as income tax refunds received in 2017. Changes in customer accounts receivable were due to higher balances outstanding resulting from CPUC-approved rate increases and surcharges. The timing of cash receipts and disbursements related to other working capital items also affected net cash provided by operating activities.\nCash Flows from Investing Activities:\nNet cash used in investing activities was $117.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 as compared to $77.4 million and $129.3 million for the same periods in 2017 and 2016, respectively. Cash used for capital expenditures in 2017 was partially offset by cash proceeds received from the sale of GSWC's Ojai water system.\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, cash paid for capital expenditures was $116.4 million, $110.5 million and $127.9 million, respectively. Capital expenditures incurred in 2018, 2017 and 2016 were consistent with GSWC's capital investment program. GSWC expects 2019 company-funded capital expenditures to be between $115 and $125 million.\nCash Flows from Financing Activities:\nNet cash provided by financing activities was $1.4 million for 2018 as compared to net cash used of $52.2 million and net cash provided of $25.7 million for 2017 and 2016, respectively. The increase in net cash provided by financing activities during 2018 was due to the issuance of additional Common Shares to AWR for $47.5 million in cash proceeds, as well as an increase in intercompany borrowings as compared to 2017. These increases were partially offset by an increase in dividends paid to AWR.\nThe change in net cash used in financing activities in 2017 of $52.2 million, as compared to net cash provided by financing activities of $25.7 million in 2016, was due to repayments made during 2017 on intercompany borrowings using the Ojai sale proceeds and cash generated from operating activities, as compared to net borrowings made from AWR in 2016.\nContractual Obligations, Commitments and Off-Balance-Sheet Arrangements\nRegistrant has various contractual obligations which are recorded as liabilities in the consolidated financial statements. Other items, such as certain purchase commitments and operating leases, are not recognized as liabilities in the consolidated financial statements, but are required to be disclosed. In addition to contractual maturities, Registrant has certain debt instruments that contain annual sinking funds or other principal payments. Registrant believes that it will be able to refinance debt instruments at their maturity through public issuance, or private placement, of debt or equity. Annual payments to service debt are generally made from cash flows from operations.\nThe following table reflects Registrant's contractual obligations and commitments to make future payments pursuant to contracts as of December 31, 2018. All obligations and commitments are obligations and commitments of GSWC unless otherwise noted.

facility fees.\n(2) The notes and debentures have been issued by GSWC under an Indenture dated September 1, 1993, as amended in December 2008. The notes and debentures do not contain any financial covenants that Registrant believes to be material or any cross-default provisions.\n(3) GSWC issued private placement notes in 1991 in the amount of $28 million pursuant to the terms of note purchase agreements with substantially similar terms. These agreements contain restrictions on the payment of dividends, minimum interest coverage requirements, a maximum debt-to-capitalization ratio, and a negative pledge. Pursuant to the terms of these agreements, GSWC must maintain a minimum interest coverage ratio of two times interest expense. In addition, two senior notes in the amount of $40 million each were issued by GSWC in October 2005 and in March 2009 to CoBank, ACB. A\nsenior note in the amount of $15 million was issued to The Prudential Insurance Company of America in December 2014. Under the terms of these senior notes, GSWC may not incur any additional debt or pay any distributions to its shareholders if, after giving effect thereto, it would have a debt to capitalization ratio in excess of 0.6667-to-1 or a debt to earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization ratio of more than 8-to-1. GSWC is in compliance with these covenant provisions as of December 31, 2018. GSWC does not currently have any outstanding mortgages or other liens on indebtedness on its properties.\n(4) Consists of obligations at GSWC related to (i) a loan agreement supporting $7.7 million in outstanding debt issued by the California Pollution Control Financing Authority, and (ii) $3.7 million of obligations with respect to GSWC's 500 acre-foot entitlement to water from the State Water Project ( SWP\u201d). These obligations do not contain any financial covenants believed to be material to Registrant or any cross-default provisions. In regard to its SWP entitlement, GSWC has entered into agreements with various developers for a portion of its 500 acre-foot entitlement to water from the SWP.\n(5) Consists of $3.6 million outstanding representing the debt portion of funds received under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act for reimbursements of capital costs related to the installation of meters for conversion of non-metered service to metered service in GSWC's Arden-Cordova District.\n(6) Consists of expected interest expense payments based on the assumption that GSWC's long-term debt remains outstanding until maturity.\n(7) Advances for construction represent annual contract refunds by GSWC to developers for the cost of water systems paid for by the developers. The advances are generally refundable in equal annual installments over 40-year periods.\n(8) Consists of an agreement by GSWC to purchase renewable energy credits through 2023. These renewable energy credits are used by GSWC's electric division to meet California's renewables portfolio standard.\n(9) Consists primarily of a fixed-cost purchased power contract effective January 1, 2015 between BVES and Shell Energy North America (US), L.P. and EDF Trading North America, LLC.\n(10) Consists primarily of capital expenditures estimated to be required under signed contracts at GSWC as of December 31, 2018. In addition, on February 4, 2019 BVES entered into a purchase agreement with General Electric International, Inc. in which General Electric International, Inc. will construct and then sell to BVES a solar power generating facility for $11.8 million. This project is subject to CPUC approval.\n(11) Water purchase agreements consist of (i) a remaining amount of $2.2 million under an agreement expiring in 2028 to use water rights from a third party, and (ii) an aggregate amount of $2.2 million of other water purchase commitments with other third parties, which expire through 2038.\n(12) Reflects future minimum payments under noncancelable operating leases for both GSWC and ASUS.\n(13) Consists of expected contributions to Registrant's defined benefit pension plan for the years 2019 through 2021. Contribution to the pension plan are expected to be the higher of the minimum required contribution under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act ( ERISA\u201d) or the amounts that are recovered in customer rates and approved by the CPUC. These amounts are estimates and are subject to change based on, among other things, the limits established for federal tax deductibility (pension plan) and the significant impact that returns on plan assets and changes in discount rates have on such amounts.\n(14) Other commitments consist primarily of (i) a $150 million revolving credit facility, of which $95.5 million was outstanding as of December 31, 2018; (ii) a $5.2 million asset retirement obligation of GSWC that reflects the retirement of wells by GSWC, which by law need to be properly capped at the time of removal; (iii) an irrevocable letter of credit in the amount of $340,000 for the deductible in Registrant's business automobile insurance policy; (iv) an irrevocable letter of credit issued on behalf of GSWC in the amount of $585,000 as security for the purchase of power by BVES under an energy scheduling agreement with Automated Power Exchange; and (v) a $15,000 irrevocable letter of credit issued on behalf of GSWC pursuant to a franchise agreement with the City of Rancho Cordova. All of the letters of credit are issued pursuant to the revolving credit facility. The revolving credit facility contains restrictions on prepayments, disposition of property, mergers, liens and negative pledges, indebtedness and guaranty obligations, transactions with affiliates, minimum interest coverage requirements, a maximum debt-to-capitalization ratio, and a minimum debt rating. Pursuant to the credit agreement, AWR must maintain a minimum interest coverage ratio of 3.25 times interest expense, a maximum total funded debt ratio of 0.65-to-1.00 and a minimum debt rating from Moody's or S&P of Baa3 or BBB-, respectively. As of December 31, 2018, AWR was in compliance with these covenants with an interest coverage ratio of 6.23 times interest expense, a debt ratio of 0.43-to-1.00 and debt ratings of A+ and A2.\nOff-Balance-Sheet Arrangements\nRegistrant has various contractual obligations that are recorded as liabilities in the consolidated financial statements. Other items, such as certain purchase commitments and operating leases, are not recognized as liabilities in the consolidated financial statements, but are required to be disclosed. Except for those disclosed above in the table, Registrant does not have any other off-balance-sheet arrangements.\nEffects of Inflation\nThe rates of GSWC are established to provide recovery of costs and a fair return on shareholders' investment. Recovery of the effects of inflation through higher water rates is dependent upon receiving adequate and timely rate increases; however, authorized rates charged to customers are usually based on a forecast of expenses and capital costs for GSWC. Rates may lag increases in costs caused by unanticipated inflation. During periods of moderate to low inflation, as has been experienced for the last several years, the effects of inflation on operating results have not been significant. Furthermore, the CPUC approves projections for a future test year in general rate cases which reduces the impact of inflation to the extent that GSWC's inflation forecasts are accurate.\nFor the Military Utility Privatization Subsidiaries, under the terms of the contracts with the U.S. government, the contract price is subject to an economic price adjustment on an annual basis. ASUS has experienced delays in some of its economic price adjustments. However, when adjustments are finalized, they are implemented retroactively to the effective date of the economic price adjustment.\nClimate Change\nWater - GSWC considers the potential impacts of climate change in its water supply portfolio planning and its overall infrastructure replacement plans. In addition, GSWC considers the impacts of greenhouse gas emissions and other environmental concerns in its operations and infrastructure investments.\nElectric - California has established a cap-and-trade program applicable to greenhouse gas emissions. While BVES's power-plant emissions are below the reporting threshold, as a Covered Entity\u201d BVES has an obligation to file a report in June of each year under the Greenhouse Gas Mandatory Reporting Regulation.\nThe State of California and the CPUC have also established renewable energy procurement targets. BVES has entered into a CPUC-approved ten-year contract for renewable energy credits. Because of this agreement, BVES believes it will comply through at least 2023 with California's renewable energy statutes that address this issue. However, in addition to an anticipated increase in sales, one senate bill includes extending and increasing the renewable energy procurement requirements beyond 2020. As a result, BVES is examining its renewable supply quantities to ensure continued compliance.\nBVES is also required to comply with the CPUC's greenhouse gas emission performance standards. Under these standards, BVES must file an annual attestation with the CPUC stating that BVES is in compliance. Specifically, BVES must attest to having no new ownership investment in generation facilities exceeding the emission performance standards and no long-term commitments for generation exceeding the standards. In February 2019, BVES filed an attestation that BVES complied with the standards for 2018.\nAt this time, management cannot estimate the impact, if any, that these regulations may have on the cost of BVES's power plant operations or the cost of BVES's purchased power from third party providers.\nBVES Power-Supply Arrangements\nBVES began taking power effective January 1, 2015 at a fixed cost over three-and five-year terms depending on the amount of power and period during which the power is purchased under contracts approved by the CPUC in December 2014. The three-year contract expired on December 31, 2017. Registrant intends to enter into new purchased power contracts, subject to CPUC approval, once the five-year-term contract expires in November 2019. In addition to the purchased power contracts, BVES buys additional energy to meet peak demand as needed and sells surplus power when necessary. The average cost of power purchased, including fixed costs and the transactions in the spot market, was approximately $79.90 per MWh for the year ended December 31, 2018 as compared to $73.03 per MWh for the same period of 2017. BVES's average energy costs are impacted by pricing fluctuations on the spot market. However, BVES has implemented an electric-supply-cost balancing account, as approved by the CPUC, to alleviate any impacts to earnings.\nConstruction Program\nGSWC maintains an ongoing water distribution main replacement program throughout its customer service areas based on the age and type of distribution-system materials, priority of leaks detected, remaining productive life of the distribution system and an underlying replacement schedule. In addition, GSWC upgrades its electric and water supply facilities in accordance with industry standards, and local and CPUC requirements. As of December 31, 2018, GSWC has unconditional purchase obligations for capital projects of approximately $73.4 million. During the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, GSWC had capital expenditures of $125.1 million, $115.3 million and $126.0 million, respectively. A portion of these capital expenditures was funded by developers through refundable advances, or contributions in aid of construction, which are not required to be repaid. During the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, capital expenditures funded by developers were $4.1 million, $3.5 million and $5.3 million, respectively. During 2019, GSWC's company-funded capital expenditures are estimated to be approximately $115 - $125 million.\nContracted Services\nUnder the terms of the current and future utility privatization contracts with the U.S. government, each contract's price is subject to an economic price adjustment ( EPA\u201d) on an annual basis. In the event that ASUS (i) is managing more assets at specific military bases than were included in the U.S. government's request for proposal, (ii) is managing assets that are in substandard condition as compared to what was disclosed in the request for proposal, (iii) prudently incurs costs not contemplated under the terms of the utility privatization contract, and/or (iv) becomes subject to new regulatory requirements, such as more stringent water-quality standards, ASUS is permitted to file, and has filed, requests for equitable adjustment ( REA\u201d). The timely filing for and receipt of EPAs and/or REAs continues to be critical in order for the Military Utility Privatization Subsidiaries to recover increasing costs of operating and maintaining, and renewing and replacing the water and/or wastewater systems at the military bases it serves.\nUnder the Budget Control Act of 2011 (the 2011 Act\u201d), substantial automatic spending cuts, known as \"sequestration,\" have impacted the expected levels of Department of Defense budgeting. The Military Utility Privatization Subsidiaries have not experienced any earnings impact to their existing operations and maintenance and renewal and replacement services, as utility privatization contracts are an \"excepted service\" within the 2011 Act. While the ongoing effects of sequestration have been mitigated through the passage of the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018 for fiscal years 2018 and 2019, similar issues may arise as part of fiscal uncertainty and/or future debt-ceiling limits imposed by Congress. However, any future impact on ASUS and its operations through the Military Utility Privatization Subsidiaries will likely be limited to (a) the timing of funding to pay for services rendered, (b) delays in the processing of EPAs and/or REAs, (c) the timing of the issuance of contract modifications for new construction work not already funded by the U.S. government, and/or (d) delays in the solicitation for and/or awarding of new contracts under the Department of Defense utility privatization program. Furthermore, from December 22, 2018 until January 25, 2019, the U.S. government shutdown impacted non-essential government employees due to the lack of an approved appropriations bill to fund the operations of the federal government for fiscal year 2019. However, the shutdown did not have an impact on ASUS due to the fact that funding for military operations (including military bases) is provided by the Department of Defense, which is fully funded for fiscal 2019 and was not part of the government shutdown.\nAt times, the DCAA and/or the DCMA may, at the request of a contracting officer, perform audits/reviews of contractors for compliance with certain government guidance and regulations, such as the Federal Acquisition Regulations and Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplements. Certain audit/review findings, such as system deficiencies for government-contract-business-system requirements, may result in delays in the timing of resolution of filings submitted to and/or the ability to file new proposals with the U.S. government.\nBelow is a summary of current and projected EPA filings for price adjustments to operations and maintenance fees and renewal and replacement fees for the Military Utility Privatization Subsidiaries.\nTable 126: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Military Base\n</td> <td>EPA period\n</td> <td>Filing Date\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Fort Bliss (FBWS)\n</td> <td>October 2018 - September 2019\n</td> <td>Third Quarter 2018\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Andrews Air Force Base (TUS)\n</td> <td>February 2019 - January 2020\n</td> <td>Fourth Quarter 2018\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Fort Lee (ODUS)\n</td> <td>February 2019 - January 2020\n</td> <td>Fourth Quarter 2018\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Joint Base Langley Eustis and Joint Expeditionary Base Little Creek Fort Story (ODUS)\n</td> <td>April 2019 - March 2020\n</td> <td>First Quarter of 2019\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Fort Jackson (PSUS)\n</td> <td>February 2019 - January 2020\n</td> <td>Fourth Quarter 2018\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Fort Bragg (ONUS)\n</td> <td>March 2019 - February 2020\n</td> <td>Fourth Quarter 2018\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Eglin Air Force Base (ECUS)\n</td> <td>June 2019 - May 2020\n</td> <td>Second Quarter 2019\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Fort Riley (FRUS)\n</td> <td>July 2019 - June 2020\n</td> <td>Second Quarter 2019\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nASUS assumed the operation of the water distribution and wastewater collection and treatment facilities at Fort Riley on July 1, 2018. The value of this contract is approximately $681.0 million over its 50-year term, subject to annual economic price adjustments.\nRegulatory Matters\nCertificates of Public Convenience and Necessity\nGSWC holds Certificates of Public Convenience and Necessity ( CPCN\u201d) granted by the CPUC in each of the ratemaking areas it serves. ASUS is regulated, if applicable, by the state in which it primarily conducts water and/or wastewater operations. FBWS holds a CPCN from the Public Utilities Commission of Texas. The Virginia State Corporation Commission exercises jurisdiction over ODUS as a public service company. The Maryland Public Service Commission approved the right of TUS to operate as a water and wastewater utility at Joint Base Andrews, Maryland, based on certain conditions. The South Carolina Public Service Commission exercises jurisdiction over PSUS as a public service company. ONUS is regulated by the North Carolina Public Service Commission. ECUS and FRUS are not subject to regulation by their respective states' utility commissions.\nRate Regulation\nGSWC is subject to regulation by the CPUC, which has broad authority over service and facilities, rates, classification of accounts, valuation of properties, the purchase, disposition and mortgaging of properties necessary or useful in rendering public utility service, the issuance of securities, the granting of certificates of public convenience and necessity as to the extension of services and facilities and various other matters.\nRates that GSWC is authorized to charge are determined by the CPUC in general rate cases and are derived using rate base, cost of service and cost of capital, as projected for a future test year. Rates charged to customers vary according to customer class and rate jurisdiction and are generally set at levels allowing for recovery of prudently incurred costs, including a fair return on rate base. Rate base generally consists of the original cost of utility plant in service, plus certain other assets, such as working capital and inventory, less accumulated depreciation on utility plant in service, deferred income tax liabilities and certain other deductions.\nGSWC is required to file a water general rate case application every three years according to a schedule established by the CPUC. General rate cases typically include an increase in the first test year with inflation-rate adjustments for expenses for the second and third years of the rate case cycle. For capital projects, there are two test years. Rates are based on a forecast of expenses and capital costs for each test year. Electric general rate cases are typically filed every four years.\nRates may also be increased by offsets for certain expense increases, including, but not limited to, supply-cost offset and balancing-account amortization, advice letter filings related to certain plant additions and other operating cost increases.\nNeither the operations nor rates of AWR and ASUS are directly regulated by the CPUC. The CPUC does, however, regulate certain transactions between GSWC and ASUS and between GSWC and AWR.\nPending General Rate Case Filings:\nWater Segment:\nIn July 2017, GSWC filed a general rate case application for its water regions and the general office. The general rate case will determine new water rates for the years 2019 through 2021. On August 15, 2018, GSWC and the CPUC's Public Advocates Office, formerly the Office of Ratepayer Advocates, filed a joint motion to adopt a settlement agreement between GSWC and the Public Advocates Office in connection with the general rate case. If approved by the CPUC, the settlement would resolve all of the issues in the general rate case application and authorize GSWC to invest approximately $334.5 million in capital infrastructure over the three-year rate cycle. The $334.5 million of infrastructure investment, as settled, includes $20.4 million of capital projects to be filed for revenue recovery through advice letters when those projects are completed.\nExcluding the advice-letter-project revenues, the water gross margin for 2019 in the settlement filing is expected to increase by approximately $6.0 million as compared to the 2018 adopted water gross margin. The 2019 water revenue requirement, as settled, has been reduced to reflect a decrease of approximately $7.0 million in depreciation expense, compared to the adopted 2018 depreciation expense, due to a reduction in the overall composite depreciation rates based on a revised study filed in the general rate case. The decrease in depreciation expense lowers the water gross margin, and is offset by a corresponding decrease in depreciation expense, resulting in no impact to net earnings. In addition, the 2019 water revenue requirement, as settled, includes a decrease of approximately $2.2 million for excess deferred tax refunds as a result of the Tax Act, which has a corresponding decrease in income tax expense and also results in no impact to net earnings. Had depreciation expense, as settled, remained the same as the 2018 adopted amount and there was no excess deferred tax refund that lowered the 2019 revenue requirement, the water gross margin for 2019 would have increased by approximately $15.2 million. The settlement also allows for potential additional water revenue increases in 2020 and 2021 of approximately $10.0 million and $12.0 million, respectively, subject to the results of an earnings test and changes to the forecasted inflationary index values.\nGSWC and the Public Advocates Office informed the assigned Administrative Law Judge (\"ALJ\u201d) that hearings would not be needed in light of the settlement agreement. Subsequently, the ALJ issued a ruling requesting additional information on\na number of items in the general rate case. GSWC has provided the additional information requested by the ALJ and believes it has satisfied all of the questions raised. Both the ALJ's request and GSWC's response are public information. GSWC is awaiting a proposed decision by the ALJ, which is expected during the first quarter of 2019, with a final decision by the CPUC expected later in 2019. When approved, the new rates will be retroactive to January 1, 2019.\nElectric Segment:\nIn May 2017, GSWC filed its electric general rate case application with the CPUC to determine new electric rates for the years 2018 through 2021. In November 2018, GSWC and the Public Advocates Office filed a joint motion to adopt a settlement agreement between the two parties resolving all issues in connection with the general rate case. Among other things, the settlement incorporates a previous stipulation in the case, which authorizes a new return on equity for GSWC's electric segment of 9.60%, as compared to its previously authorized return of 9.95%. The stipulation also included a capital structure and debt cost similar to those approved by the CPUC in March 2018 in connection with GSWC's water segment cost of capital proceeding. Because of the delay in finalizing the electric general rate case, billed electric revenues in 2018 were based on 2017 adopted rates, pending a final decision by the CPUC in this rate case application. Had the new rates in the settlement agreement been approved by the CPUC prior to December 31, 2018, the electric segment's gross margin would have increased by approximately $2.0 million, or $0.04 per share, for the year ended December 31, 2018. A decision in this case is expected in 2019 and when approved by the CPUC, the new rates will be retroactive to January 1, 2018. Accordingly, Registrant will record the 2018 increase to earnings in the period in which a CPUC decision is received.\nCost of Capital Proceeding for GSWC's Water Segment:\nIn March 2018, the CPUC issued a final decision in the cost of capital proceeding for GSWC and three other investor-owned water utilities that serve California. Among other things, the final decision adopts for GSWC (i) a return on equity of 8.90%, (ii) a cost of debt of 6.6%, (iii) a capital structure with 57% equity and 43% debt, (iv) a return on rate base of 7.91%, and (v) the continuation of the water cost of capital adjustment mechanism. GSWC's prior authorized return on equity and equity ratio for its water segment were 9.43% and 55%, respectively, with a return on rate base of 8.34%. The newly authorized return on rate base of 7.91% reflects a true-up of GSWC's embedded debt cost from 6.99% to 6.60%. The reduced debt costs contributed approximately 18 basis points to the 43-basis-point drop in the authorized return on rate base.\nTax Cuts and Jobs Act (\"Tax Act\"):\nOn December 22, 2017, the Tax Act was signed into federal law. The provisions of this major tax reform were generally effective January 1, 2018. The most significant provisions of the Tax Act impacting GSWC are the reduction of the federal corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21% and the elimination of bonus depreciation for regulated utilities. As a result, for the year ended December 31, 2018, the water-revenue requirement was reduced by approximately $12.5 million as compared to 2017 as a result of the Tax Act, which was largely offset by a decrease in income tax expense, resulting in no material impact to earnings. Pursuant to a CPUC directive, the 2018 impact of the Tax Act on the water adopted revenue requirement was tracked in a memorandum account effective January 1, 2018. On July 1, 2018, new lower water rates, which incorporate the new federal income tax rate, were implemented for all water ratemaking areas. As of December 31, 2018, GSWC had an over-collection of $7.1 million related to the water segment tracked and recorded as a regulatory liability.\nThe CPUC also ordered GSWC to update its pending electric general rate case filing, which will determine new electric rates for the years 2018 - 2021, to reflect the lower federal corporate income tax rate. For the year ended December 31, 2018, GSWC reduced electric revenues by approximately $1.2 million, which was also largely offset by a corresponding decrease in income tax expense, resulting in no material impact to earnings.\nOther Regulatory Matters\nApplication to Transfer Electric Utility Operations to New Subsidiary:\nOn December 14, 2018, GSWC filed an application with the CPUC to effectuate a reorganization plan that would transfer BVES from a division of GSWC to Bear Valley Electric Service, Inc. ( BVES Inc.\u201d), a newly created separate legal entity and stand-alone subsidiary of AWR. Due to the differences in operations, regulations and risks, management believes a separate electric legal entity and stand-alone subsidiary of AWR is in the best interests of customers, employees, and the communities served. This reorganization plan is subject to CPUC approval and, if approved, is not expected to result in a substantive change to Registrant's operations and business segments. In February 2019, the City of Big Bear Lake filed a protest to the application, to which GSWC filed reply comments with the CPUC. The CPUC has not established a timeline for its review of the application.\nFor more information regarding significant regulatory matters, see Note 3 of Notes to Financial Statements\u201d included in Part II, Item 8, in Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\nEnvironmental Matters\nAWR's subsidiaries are subject to stringent environmental regulations, including the 1996 amendments to the Federal Safe Drinking Water Act. GSWC is required to comply with the safe drinking water standards established by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency ( U.S. EPA\u201d) and the Division of Drinking Water (\"DDW\"), under the State Water Resources Control Board (\"SWRCB\"). The U.S. EPA regulates contaminants that may have adverse health effects that are known or likely to occur at levels of public health concern, and the regulation of which will provide a meaningful opportunity for health risk reduction. The DDW, acting on behalf of the U.S. EPA, administers the U.S. EPA's program in California. Similar state agencies administer these rules in the other states in which Registrant operates.\nGSWC currently tests its water supplies and water systems according to, among other things, requirements listed in the Federal Safe Drinking Water Act ( SDWA\u201d). GSWC works proactively with third parties and governmental agencies to address issues relating to known contamination threatening GSWC water sources. GSWC also incurs operating costs for testing to determine the levels, if any, of the constituents in its sources of supply and additional expense to treat contaminants in order to meet the federal and state maximum contaminant level standards and consumer demands. GSWC expects to incur additional capital costs as well as increased operating costs to maintain or improve the quality of water delivered to its customers in light of anticipated stress on water resources associated with watershed and aquifer pollution, as well as to meet future water quality standards and consumer expectations. The CPUC ratemaking process provides GSWC with the opportunity to recover prudently incurred capital and operating costs in future filings associated with achieving water quality standards. Management believes that such incurred and expected future costs should be authorized for recovery by the CPUC.\nMatters Relating to Environmental Cleanup\nGSWC has been involved in environmental remediation and cleanup at a plant site ( Chadron Plant\u201d) that contained an underground storage tank that was used to store gasoline for its vehicles. This tank was removed from the ground in July 1990 along with the dispenser and ancillary piping. Since then, GSWC has been involved in various remediation activities at this site.\nAs of December 31, 2018, the total spent to cleanup and remediate GSWC's plant facility was approximately $5.9 million, of which $1.5 million has been paid by the State of California Underground Storage Tank Fund. Amounts paid by GSWC have been included in rate base and approved by the CPUC for recovery. As of December 31, 2018, GSWC has a regulatory asset and an accrued liability for the estimated additional cost of $1.3 million to complete the cleanup at the site. The estimate includes costs for continued activities of groundwater cleanup and monitoring, future soil treatment, and site closure related activities. The ultimate cost may vary as there are many unknowns in remediation of underground gasoline spills and this is an estimate based on currently available information. Management also believes it is probable that the estimated additional costs will be approved for inclusion in rate base by the CPUC.\nLead Testing in Schools\nIn January 2017, California State Water Resources Control Board - Division of Drinking Water (DDW) issued a permit amendment that required all community water systems to test the schools in their service area for lead, if sampling is requested in writing by the institution's officials. In addition, the Governor of California signed an assembly bill, which requires all community water systems that serve a school site of a local educational agency with a building constructed before January 1, 2010, to test for lead in the potable water system of the school site on or before July 1, 2019. GSWC has been working extensively with the schools in its service areas for the last several months. As a result of concerted outreach to the schools, GSWC has completed lead sampling at approximately 88 percent of the schools in its service area as of December 31, 2018, as compared to the State average of 35 percent. GSWC will continue to work with the remaining schools in its service area to meet the July 1, 2019 deadline. Management cannot predict if all schools will cooperate and complete the testing, and as a result cannot predict complete compliance with this regulation by the deadline.\nMatters Relating to Military Privatization Contracts\nEach of the Military Utility Privatization Subsidiaries is responsible for testing the water and wastewater systems on the military bases on which it operates in accordance with applicable law.\nEach of the Military Utility Privatization Subsidiaries has the right to seek an equitable adjustment to its contract in the event that there are changes in environmental laws, a change in the quality of water used in providing water service or wastewater discharged by the U.S. government, or contamination of the air or soil not caused by the fault or negligence of the Military Utility Privatization Subsidiary. These changes can impact operations and maintenance and renewal and replacement costs under the contracts. The U.S. government is responsible for environmental contamination due to its fault or negligence and for environmental contamination that occurred prior to the execution of a contract.\nSecurity Issues\nGSWC has security systems and infrastructure in place intended to prevent unlawful intrusion, service disruption and cyber-attacks. GSWC utilizes a variety of physical security measures to protect its facilities. GSWC also considers advances in security and emergency preparedness technology and relevant industry developments in developing its capital-improvement plans. GSWC intends to seek approval of the CPUC to recover any additional costs that it incurs in enhancing the security, reliability and resiliency of its water and electric systems.\nThe Military Utility Privatization Subsidiaries operate facilities within the boundaries of military bases which provide limited access to the general public. To further enhance security, in prior years, certain upgrades were completed at various military bases through contract modifications funded by the U.S. government.\nRegistrant has evaluated its cyber-security systems and continues to address identified areas of improvement with respect to U.S. government regulations regarding cyber-security of government contractors. These improvements include the physical security at all of the office and employee facilities it operates. Registrant believes it is in compliance with these regulations.\nDespite its efforts, Registrant cannot guarantee that intrusions, cyber-attacks or other attacks will not cause water or electric system problems, disrupt service to customers, compromise important data or systems, or result in unintended release of customer or employee information.\nDrought Impact\nIn May 2018, the California Legislature passed two bills that provide a framework for long-term water-use efficiency standards and drought planning and resiliency. The initial steps in implementation of this legislation has been laid out in a summary document by the California Department of Water Resources (\"DWR\") and State Water Resources Control Board (\"SWQCB\"). Over the next several years, State agencies, water suppliers and other entities will be working to meet the requirements and timelines of plan implementation. A notable milestone is the establishment of indoor water use standard of 55 gallons per capita per day (gpcd) until 2025 at which time the standard may be reduced to 52.5 gpcd or a new standard as recommend by DWR.\nCalifornia's recent period of multi-year drought resulted in reduced recharge to the state's groundwater basins. GSWC utilizes groundwater from numerous groundwater basins throughout the state. Several of these basins, especially smaller basins, experienced lower groundwater levels because of the drought. Several of GSWC's service areas rely on groundwater as their only source of supply. Given the critical nature of the groundwater levels in California's Central Coast area, GSWC implemented mandatory water restrictions in certain service areas, in accordance with CPUC procedures. In the event of water supply shortages beyond the locally available supply, GSWC would need to transport additional water from other areas, increasing the cost of water supply.\nThe 2017-2018 water year was a dry year, with rainfall in northern California being below normal levels. However, precipitation to date in 2019 has been at or above normal levels with statewide snowpack at above 100% of average.\nAs of February 19, 2019, the U.S. Drought Monitor estimated less than 2 percent of California in the rank of Severe Drought\u201d while approximately 4 percent continued in the rank of Moderate Drought.\u201d This is in comparison to February 20, 2018 when approximately 20 percent of the State was considered in a Severe Drought\u201d and 48 percent was considered in \"Moderate Drought\". If dry conditions return, the SWQCB or other regulatory agencies may impose emergency drought actions.\nGSWC's Water Supply\nDuring 2018, GSWC delivered approximately 63.3 million hundred cubic feet ( ccf\u201d) of water to its customers, which is an average of about 398 acre-feet per day (an acre-foot is approximately 435.6 ccf or 326,000 gallons). Approximately 56% of GSWC's supply came from groundwater production wells situated throughout GSWC's service areas. GSWC supplemented its groundwater production with wholesale purchases from Metropolitan Water District (\"MWD\") member agencies and regional water suppliers (roughly 41% of total demand) and with authorized diversions from rivers (roughly 3%) under contracts with the United States Bureau of Reclamation ( Bureau\u201d) and the Sacramento Municipal Utility District ( SMUD\u201d). GSWC also utilizes recycled water supplies to serve recycled water customers in several service areas. During 2017, GSWC supplied 62.2 million ccf of water, approximately 55% of which was produced from groundwater sources and 45% was purchased from regional wholesalers and surface water diversions under contracts with the Bureau and SMUD. GSWC continually assesses its water rights and groundwater storage assets.\nGroundwater\nOver the years, population growth in GSWC's service areas and increases in the amount of groundwater used have resulted in both cooperative and judicially enforced regimes for owning water rights and managing groundwater basins for\nlong-term sustainability. GSWC management actively participates in efforts to protect groundwater basins from over-use and from contamination and to protect its water rights. In some periods, these efforts require reductions in groundwater pumping and increased reliance on alternative water resources.\nGSWC has a diverse water supply portfolio which includes approximately 73,400 acre-feet of adjudicated groundwater rights, surface water rights, and a number of unadjudicated water rights to help meet supply requirements. The productivity of GSWC's groundwater resources varies from year to year depending upon a variety of factors, including the amount, duration, length and location of rainfall, the availability of imported replenishment water, the amount of water previously stored in groundwater basins, the amount and seasonality of water use by GSWC's customers and others, evolving challenges to water quality, and a variety of legal limitations on use if a groundwater basin is, or may be, in an overdrafted condition.\nOn September 16, 2014, the Governor of California signed a package of three bills, which taken together are known as the Sustainable Groundwater Management Act.\u201d The purpose of the act is to provide local agencies with tools and authority to manage groundwater basins in a sustainable manner over the long term. Local Groundwater Sustainability Agencies\u201d are to be formed for each defined groundwater basin, and Groundwater Sustainability Plans must be completed for those basins by the year 2022 (by 2020 for those considered in critical overdraft). The act contains numerous provisions to protect existing water rights, and is not anticipated to infringe upon or otherwise alter existing surface water or groundwater rights under current law. GSWC intends to cooperate to the fullest extent allowed in the development of these Groundwater Sustainability Agencies and resulting Groundwater Sustainability Plans to protect its interests in proper management of these groundwater basins.\nMetropolitan Water District /State Water Project\nWater supplies available to the MWD through the State Water Project (\"SWP\") vary from year to year based on several factors. Historically, weather was the primary factor in determining annual deliveries. However, biological opinions issued in late 2007 have limited water diversions through the Sacramento/San Joaquin Delta ( Delta\u201d) resulting in pumping restrictions on the SWP. Even with variable SWP deliveries, MWD has been able to provide sufficient quantities of water to satisfy the needs of its member agencies and their customers. Under its Integrated Resources Plan, MWD estimates that it can meet its member agencies' demands over at least the next 20 years.\nEvery year, the California Department of Water Resources (\"DWR\") establishes the SWP allocation for water deliveries to the state water contractors. The SWP is a major source of water for the MWD. DWR generally establishes a percentage allocation of delivery requests based on a number of factors, including weather patterns, snow-pack levels, reservoir levels and biological diversion restrictions. In February 2019, DWR set an initial SWP delivery allocation at 35% of requests for the 2019 calendar year. This allocation will likely change depending on rain and snowfall received this winter.\nImported Water\nGSWC also manages a portfolio of water supply arrangements with water wholesalers who may import water from outside the immediate service area. For example, GSWC has contracts with various governmental entities (principally MWD member agencies) and other parties to purchase water through a total of 61 connections for distribution to customers, in addition to numerous emergency connections. MWD is a public agency organized and managed to provide a supplemental, imported supply to its member public agencies. There are 26 such member agencies, consisting of 14 cities, 11 municipal water districts and one county water authority. GSWC has 45 connections to MWD's water distribution facilities and those of member agencies. GSWC purchases MWD water through six separate member agencies aggregating 49,807 acre-feet annually. MWD's principal source of water is the SWP and the Colorado River via the Colorado River Aqueduct.\nGSWC has contracts to purchase water or water rights for an aggregate amount of $4.4 million as of December 31, 2018. Included in the $4.4 million is a remaining commitment of $2.2 million under an agreement with the City of Claremont ( the City\u201d) to lease water rights that were ascribed to the City as part of the Six Basins adjudication. The initial term of the agreement expires in 2028. GSWC may exercise an option to renew this agreement for 10 additional years. The remaining $2.2 million is for commitments for purchased water with other third parties, which expire through 2038.\nMilitary Utility Privatization Subsidiaries\nThe U.S. government is responsible for providing the source of supply for all water on each of the bases served by the Military Utility Privatization Subsidiaries at no cost to the Military Utility Privatization Subsidiaries. Once received from the U.S. government, ASUS is responsible for ensuring the continued compliance of the provided source of supply with all federal, state and local regulations.\nNew Accounting Pronouncements\nRegistrant is subject to newly issued requirements as well as changes in existing requirements issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board. See Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.", "item_7_truncated": "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operation\nThe following discussion and analysis provides information on AWR's consolidated operations and assets, and, where necessary, includes specific references to AWR's individual segments and/or its subsidiaries: GSWC and ASUS and its subsidiaries. Included in the following analysis is a discussion of water and electric gross margins. Water and electric gross margins are computed by subtracting total supply costs from total revenues. Registrant uses these gross margins as important measures in evaluating its operating results. Registrant believes these measures are useful internal benchmarks in evaluating the performance of GSWC.\nThe discussions and tables included in the following analysis also present Registrant's operations in terms of earnings per share by business segment. Registrant believes that the disclosure of earnings per share by business segment provides investors with clarity surrounding the performance of its different services. Registrant reviews these measurements regularly and compares them to historical periods and to its operating budget. Furthermore, the discussion refers to a non-core business activity related to gains and losses on Registrant's investments held to fund a retirement benefit plan, which is excluded when communicating earnings results to help facilitate comparisons of the Company's performance from period to period. However, all of these measures, which are not presented in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles ( GAAP\u201d), may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other enterprises and should not be considered as an alternative to operating income or earnings per share, which are determined in accordance with GAAP. A reconciliation of water and electric gross margins to the most directly comparable GAAP measures is included in the table under the section titled Operating Expenses: Supply Costs.\u201d Reconciliations to AWR's diluted earnings per share are included in the discussions under the sections titled Summary Results by Segment.\u201d\nOverview\nFactors affecting our financial performance are summarized under Forward-Looking Information.\nWater and Electric Segments:\nGSWC's revenues, operating income and cash flows are earned primarily through delivering potable water to homes and businesses in California and the delivery of electricity in the Big Bear area of San Bernardino County, California. Rates charged to GSWC customers are determined by the CPUC. These rates are intended to allow recovery of operating costs and a reasonable rate of return on capital. GSWC plans to continue to seek additional rate increases in future years from the CPUC to recover operating and supply costs and receive reasonable returns on invested capital. Capital expenditures in future years at GSWC are expected to remain at higher levels than depreciation expense. When necessary, GSWC obtains funds from external sources in the capital markets and through bank borrowings.\nPending General Rate Case Filings:\nWater Segment:\nIn July 2017, GSWC filed a general rate case application for its water regions and the general office. The general rate case will determine new water rates for the years 2019 through 2021. On August 15, 2018, GSWC and the CPUC's Public Advocates Office, formerly the Office of Ratepayer Advocates, filed a joint motion to adopt a settlement agreement between GSWC and the Public Advocates Office in connection with the general rate case. If approved by the CPUC, the settlement would resolve all of the issues in the general rate case application and authorize GSWC to invest approximately $334.5 million in capital infrastructure over the three-year rate cycle. The $334.5 million of infrastructure investment, as settled, includes $20.4 million of capital projects to be filed for revenue recovery through advice letters when those projects are completed.\nExcluding the advice-letter-project revenues, the water gross margin for 2019 in the settlement filing is expected to increase by approximately $6.0 million as compared to the 2018 adopted water gross margin. The 2019 water revenue requirement, as settled, has been reduced to reflect a decrease of approximately $7.0 million in depreciation expense, compared to the adopted 2018 depreciation expense, due to a reduction in the overall composite depreciation rates based on a revised study filed in the general rate case. The decrease in depreciation expense lowers the water gross margin, and is offset by a corresponding decrease in depreciation expense, resulting in no impact to net earnings. In addition, the 2019 water revenue requirement, as settled, includes a decrease of approximately $2.2 million for excess deferred tax refunds as a result of the Tax Act, which has a corresponding decrease in income tax expense and also results in no impact to net earnings. Had depreciation expense, as settled, remained the same as the 2018 adopted amount and there was no excess deferred tax refund that lowered the 2019 revenue requirement, the water gross margin for 2019 would have increased by approximately $15.2 million. The settlement also allows for potential additional water revenue increases in 2020 and 2021 of approximately $10.0 million and $12.0 million, respectively, subject to the results of an earnings test and changes to the forecasted inflationary index values.\nGSWC and the Public Advocates Office informed the assigned Administrative Law Judge (\"ALJ\u201d) that hearings would not be needed in light of the settlement agreement. Subsequently, the ALJ issued a ruling requesting additional information on\na number of items in the general rate case. GSWC has provided the additional information requested by the ALJ and believes it has satisfied all of the questions raised. Both the ALJ's request and GSWC's response are public information. GSWC is awaiting a proposed decision by the ALJ, which is expected during the first quarter of 2019, with a final decision by the CPUC expected later in 2019. When approved, the new rates will be retroactive to January 1, 2019.\nElectric Segment:\nIn May 2017, GSWC filed its electric general rate case application with the CPUC to determine new electric rates for the years 2018 through 2021. In November 2018, GSWC and the Public Advocates Office filed a joint motion to adopt a settlement agreement between the two parties resolving all issues in connection with the general rate case. Among other things, the settlement incorporates a previous stipulation in the case, which authorizes a new return on equity for GSWC's electric segment of 9.60%, as compared to its previously authorized return of 9.95%. The stipulation also included a capital structure and debt cost similar to those approved by the CPUC in March 2018 in connection with GSWC's water segment cost of capital proceeding, as discussed below. Because of the delay in finalizing the electric general rate case, billed electric revenues in 2018 were based on 2017 adopted rates, pending a final decision by the CPUC in this rate case application. Had the new rates in the settlement agreement been approved by the CPUC prior to December 31, 2018, the electric segment's gross margin would have increased by approximately $2.0 million, or $0.04 per share, for the year ended December 31, 2018. A decision in this case is expected in 2019, and when approved by the CPUC, the new rates will be retroactive to January 1, 2018. Accordingly, Registrant will record the 2018 increase to earnings in the period in which a CPUC decision is received.\nCost of Capital Proceeding for GSWC's Water Segment:\nIn March 2018, the CPUC issued a final decision in the cost of capital proceeding for GSWC and three other investor-owned water utilities that serve California. Among other things, the final decision adopts for GSWC (i) a return on equity of 8.90%, (ii) a cost of debt of 6.6%, (iii) a capital structure with 57% equity and 43% debt, (iv) a return on rate base of 7.91%, and (v) the continuation of the water cost of capital adjustment mechanism. GSWC's prior authorized return on equity and equity ratio for its water segment were 9.43% and 55%, respectively, with a return on rate base of 8.34%. The newly authorized return on rate base of 7.91% reflects a true-up of GSWC's embedded debt cost from 6.99% to 6.60%. The reduced debt costs contributed approximately 18 basis points to the 43-basis-point drop in the authorized return on rate base. The lower return on rate base beginning in 2018 decreased GSWC's 2018 adopted annual revenue requirement by approximately $3.6 million, or $0.07 per share.\nContracted Services Segment:\nASUS's revenues, operating income and cash flows are earned by providing water and/or wastewater services, including operation and maintenance services and construction of facilities at the water and/or wastewater systems at various military installations, pursuant to 50-year firm fixed-price contracts. The contract price for each of these 50-year contracts is subject to annual economic price adjustments. Additional revenues generated by contract operations are primarily dependent on new construction activities under contract modifications with the U.S. government or agreements with other third-party prime contractors.\nFort Riley:\nOn July 1, 2018, ASUS assumed the operation, maintenance and construction management of the water distribution and wastewater collection and treatment facilities at Fort Riley, a United States Army installation located in Kansas, after completing a transition period and a detailed inventory study. The contract was awarded by the U.S. government in September 2017 with a value of $681 million over a 50-year period. The 50-year contract is also subject to annual economic price adjustments.\nEglin Air Force Base ( Eglin AFB\u201d):\nOn June 15, 2017, ASUS assumed operations of the water and wastewater systems at Eglin AFB in Florida after completing a transition period and a detailed joint inventory study. The value of the 50-year contract is approximately $702.4 million. The contract is subject to annual economic price adjustments.\nWith the addition of Fort Riley and Eglin AFB, ASUS serves 11 military bases in the United Sates, including four of the largest military installations: Fort Bragg, Fort Bliss, Eglin AFB and Fort Riley.\nU.S. Government Shutdown:\nFrom December 22, 2018 until January 25, 2019, the U.S. government shutdown impacted non-essential government employees due to the lack of an approved appropriations bill to fund the operations of the federal government for fiscal year 2019. However, the shutdown did not have an impact on ASUS due to the fact that funding for military operations (including military bases) is provided by the Department of Defense, which is fully funded for fiscal 2019 and was not part of the government shutdown.\nTax Cuts and Jobs Act:\nOn December 22, 2017, the Tax Act was signed into federal law. The provisions of this major tax reform were generally effective January 1, 2018. The most significant provisions of the Tax Act impacting GSWC are the reduction of the federal corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21% and the elimination of bonus depreciation for regulated utilities. As a result, for the year ended December 31, 2018, the water-revenue requirement was lower by approximately $12.5 million as compared to 2017 as a result of the Tax Act, which was largely offset by a decrease in income tax expense, resulting in no material impact to net earnings. The CPUC also ordered GSWC to update its pending electric general rate case filing to reflect the lower federal corporate income tax rate. For the year ended December 31, 2018, GSWC reduced electric revenues by approximately $1.2 million, which was also largely offset by a corresponding decrease in income tax expense, resulting in no material impact to net earnings. In 2017, the Tax Act did have a negative impact on net earnings at the water segment as a result of remeasuring deferred tax balances to reflect the lower federal tax rate; however, that was mostly offset by an increase in net earnings at AWR (parent) and, to a lesser extent, at the other two business segments.\nIn addition to lowering customer rates, GSWC expects the Tax Act to reduce property-related deferred tax liabilities. Property-related deferred tax liabilities reduce GSWC's rate base. As new plant is placed in service, the lower federal corporate tax rate will result in lower deferred tax liabilities. As a result of the lower federal tax rate and elimination of bonus depreciation by the Tax Act, GSWC expects that its rate base and earnings will increase for the same level of expected capital expenditures. This increase is expected to be partially offset by higher financing costs arising from a greater need to fund capital expenditures through the issuance of debt and/or equity due to lower cash flows from operating activities.\nDuring the second and third quarter of 2018, the U.S. government issued contract modifications for the majority of ASUS's 50-year contracts addressing the impacts of the Tax Act. The modifications did not result in a material impact to ASUS's results for the year ended December 31, 2018.\nSummary Results by Segment\nThe table below sets forth diluted earnings per share by business segment for AWR's operations:\nTable 92: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Diluted Earnings per Share\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>12/31/2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12/31/2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>CHANGE\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Water, excluding one-time gain on sale of Ojai water system\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1.19\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1.22\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(0.03\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Electric\n</td> <td>0.11\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.11\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Contracted services\n</td> <td>0.42\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.37\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.05\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>AWR (parent)\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.05\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(0.05\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Consolidated diluted earnings per share, adjusted\n</td> <td>1.72\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.75\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(0.03\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gain on sale of Ojai water system\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.13\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(0.13\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Totals from operations, as reported\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1.72\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1.88\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(0.16\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nWater Segment:\nIncluded in the results for the year ended December 31, 2017 were (i) the recognition of a pretax gain of $8.3 million, or $0.13 per share, on the sale of GSWC's Ojai water system in June of 2017, with no similar gain in 2018, and (ii) the recovery in February 2017 of incremental costs approved by the CPUC related to California's drought state of emergency that were previously expensed, and which resulted in an increase to pretax earnings in 2017 of $1.5 million, or $0.02 per share (approximately $1.2 million was reflected as a reduction to other operation expenses and approximately $260,000 was reflected as additional revenue). Furthermore, affecting the results and comparability between the two periods were losses incurred during 2018, as a result of market conditions, on Registrant's investments held to fund a retirement benefit plan as compared to gains recorded in 2017. This non-core business item decreased the water segment's earnings on a relative basis by approximately $0.05 per share.\nExcluding the impact of the items discussed above, diluted earnings from the water segment for 2018 increased by $0.04 per share as compared to 2017 due to the following items:\n \u2022 An overall increase in the water gross margin of $0.03 per share, largely due to revenues generated from CPUC-approved third-year rate increases effective January 1, 2018, partially offset by the effect of the cessation of the Ojai operations in June of 2017 and the revenue impact from the lower authorized return on rate base in the cost of capital proceeding approved by the CPUC and effective in 2018. The lower return on rate base decreased GSWC's 2018 adopted annual water revenue requirement by approximately $3.6 million, or $0.07 per share. \n \u2022 An increase in operating expenses (excluding supply costs) decreased earnings by approximately $0.04 per share due, in large part, to a reduction in legal costs of $1.8 million, or $0.03 per share, recorded in December 2017 for amounts received from the City of Claremont pursuant to a settlement agreement, with no similar item in the fourth quarter of 2018. Excluding this item, overall recurring operating expenses increased by approximately $0.01 per share due mostly to higher depreciation and property tax expenses, both of which are due to plant additions. \n \u2022 Excluding gains and losses from investments, there was an increase in interest and other income (net of interest expense), which increased earnings by approximately $0.01 per share due, in part, to interest income related to a federal tax refund recorded during the fourth quarter of 2018, partially offset by an increase in interest expense resulting from higher short-term borrowings to fund operations and a portion of GSWC's capital expenditures. \n \u2022 An overall decrease in the water segment's effective income tax rate (\"ETR\"), which positively impacted earnings by approximately $0.04 per share. The decrease in the ETR was due, in large part, to the unfavorable remeasurement adjustment recorded in December 2017 at the water segment related to certain non-rate-regulated deferred tax assets (primarily compensation- and benefit-related items) in connection with the Tax Act. The one-time remeasurement negatively impacted water net earnings in 2017 by approximately $0.03 per share. There was no similar adjustment in 2018. In addition, the water ETR was favorably impacted in 2018 by changes in flow-through adjustments recorded in accordance with regulatory requirements (primarily related to plant and compensation-related items).  The comparison between the two periods discussed above also excluded the reductions in water revenue in 2018 resulting from the Tax Act and billed surcharges, both of which had no material impact to earnings.\nElectric Segment:\nFor each of the years ended December 31, 2018, and 2017, diluted earnings from the electric segment were $0.11 per share. Due to the delay in the electric general rate case, billed revenues in 2018 were based on 2017 adopted rates, pending a final CPUC decision on the electric general rate case. In November 2018, GSWC and the CPUC's Public Advocates Office filed a joint motion to adopt a settlement agreement between the two parties resolving all issues in connection with the general rate case. A decision in this case is expected in 2019 and when approved by the CPUC, the new rates will be retroactive to January 1, 2018. Had the new rates in the settlement agreement been approved by the CPUC prior to December 31, 2018, the electric segment's gross margin would have been higher by approximately $2.0 million, or $0.04 per share, for the year ended December 31, 2018.\nContracted Services Segment:\nFor the year ended December 31, 2018, diluted earnings from contracted services were $0.42 per share, compared to $0.37 per share for the same period in 2017. Included in the results for 2017 were retroactive revenues resulting from the approval of the third price redetermination at Fort Bragg, which totaled approximately $1.0 million, or $0.02 per share, related to periods prior to 2017. Excluding this retroactive amount, diluted earnings per share from the contracted services segment increased $0.07 per share as compared to 2017, due largely to the commencement of operations at Eglin AFB and Fort Riley in June 2017 and July 2018, respectively. There was also an increase in management fee revenues at the other military bases resulting from the successful resolution of various price adjustments during 2017 and 2018. These increases were partially offset by lower construction activities at the military bases other than Eglin AFB and Fort Riley.\nAWR (parent):\nFor the year ended December 31, 2018, diluted earnings from AWR (parent) decreased $0.05 per share compared to 2017. Included in the results for 2017 was the one-time benefit from the remeasurement of the AWR (parent) deferred tax balances as a result of the Tax Act. This one-time remeasurement was based on the Tax Act's lower federal corporate tax rate of 21%, which increased earnings at AWR (parent) by approximately $0.03 per share during 2017. There was no similar adjustment in 2018. In addition, there were higher state unitary taxes recorded at the parent level during 2018 as compared to the same period in 2017.\nThe following discussion and analysis for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016 provides information on AWR's consolidated operations and assets and, where necessary, includes specific references to AWR's individual segments and subsidiaries: GSWC and ASUS and its subsidiaries.\nConsolidated Results of Operations - Years Ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 (amounts in thousands, except per share amounts): Table 97: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>

January 1, 2018, Registrant changed the financial statement presentation for the costs of its defined benefit pension plans and other retirement benefits. The components of net periodic benefits cost, other than the service cost component, have been included in the line item Other, net\u201d in Registrant's income statements. Amounts for 2017 have been reclassified on the income statements to conform to the current-period presentation.\nOperating Revenues\nGeneral\nRegistrant relies upon approvals by the CPUC of rate increases to recover operating expenses and to provide for a return on invested and borrowed capital used to fund utility plant for GSWC. Registrant relies on economic price adjustments and equitable adjustments by the U.S. government in order to recover operating expenses and provide a profit margin for ASUS. If adequate rate relief or adjustments are not granted in a timely manner, current operating revenues and earnings can be negatively impacted. ASUS's earnings are also impacted by the level of additional construction projects at the Military Utility Privatization Subsidiaries, which may or may not continue at current levels in future periods.\nWater\nFor the year ended December 31, 2018, revenues from water operations decreased by $11.1 million to $295.3 million, compared to $306.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. This decrease was primarily due to: (i) downward adjustments to water revenue which were largely offset by lower income tax expense, thus no material impact to earnings, as a result of the Tax Act, (ii) a lower authorized rate of return approved by the CPUC in the March 2018 final decision on the water cost of capital application, and (iii) decreases related to the expiration of various surcharges that were in place to recover previously incurred costs. These decreases in surcharge revenues were offset by a corresponding decrease in operating expenses (primarily administrative and general), resulting in no impact to earnings. These decreases in water revenue were partially offset by CPUC-approved third-year rate increases effective January 1, 2018. There were also CPUC-approved rate increases to cover increases in supply costs experienced in most ratemaking areas, which were largely offset by a corresponding increase in supply costs, resulting in an immaterial impact to earnings.\nBilled water consumption for the year ended December 31, 2018 increased approximately 3% as compared to 2017. In general, changes in consumption do not have a significant impact on recorded revenues due to the CPUC-approved WRAM accounts in place in the majority of GSWC's rate-making areas. GSWC records the difference between what it bills its water customers and that which is authorized by the CPUC in the WRAM accounts as regulatory assets or liabilities.\nElectric\nFor the year ended December 31, 2018, revenues from electric operations were $34.4 million as compared to $34.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. This slight increase was primarily due to rate increases generated from advice letter projects approved by the CPUC in 2017 and 2018. Due to the delay in the electric general rate case, 2018 billed revenues have been based on 2017 adopted rates, pending a final CPUC decision which is expected later in 2019.\nBilled electric usage for the year ended December 31, 2018 increased slightly as compared to the same period in 2017. Due to the CPUC-approved base revenue requirement adjustment mechanism (\"BRRAM\"), which adjusts base revenues to adopted levels authorized by the CPUC, changes in usage do not have a significant impact on earnings.\nContracted Services\nRevenues from contracted services are composed of construction revenues (including renewal and replacements) and management fees for operating and maintaining the water and/or wastewater systems at various military bases. For the year ended December 31, 2018, revenues from contracted services were $107.2 million as compared to $100.3 million for 2017. Included in revenues for 2017 was approximately $1.0 million in retroactive management fees related to periods prior to 2017. The increase in revenues was due to the commencement of operations at Eglin AFB in June 2017 and at Fort Riley in July 2018.\nASUS's subsidiaries continue to enter into U.S. government-awarded contract modifications and agreements with third-party prime contractors for new construction projects at the military bases served. During 2018, ASUS was awarded approximately $24 million in new construction projects, the majority of which are expected to be completed during 2019. Earnings and cash flows from modifications to the original 50-year contracts with the U.S. government and agreements with third-party prime contractors for additional construction projects may or may not continue in future periods.\nOperating Expenses:\nSupply Costs\nSupply costs for the water segment consist of purchased water, purchased power for pumping, groundwater production assessments and changes in the water supply cost balancing accounts. Supply costs for the electric segment consist of purchased power for resale, the cost of natural gas used by BVES's generating unit, the cost of renewable energy credits and changes in the electric supply cost balancing account. Water and electric gross margins are computed by subtracting total supply costs from total revenues. Registrant uses these gross margins and related percentages as an important measure in evaluating its operating results. Registrant believes these measures are useful internal benchmarks in evaluating the utility business performance within its water and electric segments. Registrant reviews these measurements regularly and compares them to historical periods and to its operating budget. However, these measures, which are not presented in accordance with GAAP, may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other enterprises and should not be considered as an alternative to operating income, which is determined in accordance with GAAP.\nTotal supply costs comprise the largest segment of total operating expenses. Supply costs accounted for 27.8% and 28.1% of total operating expenses for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. The table below provides the amounts (in thousands) of increases (decreases) and percent changes in water and electric revenues, supply costs and gross margins during the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017. As previously discussed, water and electric revenues for the year ended December 31, 2018 were $12.5 million and $1.2 million lower, respectively, as compared to 2017 due to the effects of the Tax Act, but had no significant impact to earnings due to a corresponding decrease in water and electric income tax expense. Furthermore, there was a decrease in surcharges of $3.7 million recorded in water revenues to recover previously incurred costs, which also did not impact water earnings. Surcharges to recover previously incurred costs are recorded to revenues when billed to customers and are offset by a corresponding amount in operating expenses (primarily administrative and general), resulting in no impact to earnings.\nTable 98: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>12/31/2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12/31/2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>CHANGE\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>CHANGE\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>WATER OPERATING REVENUES (1)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>295,258\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>306,332\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(11,074\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-3.6\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>WATER SUPPLY COSTS:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Water purchased (1)\n</td> <td>68,904\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>68,302\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>602\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.9\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Power purchased for pumping (1)\n</td> <td>8,971\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8,518\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>453\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5.3\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Groundwater production assessment (1)\n</td> <td>19,440\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>18,638\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>802\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.3\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Water supply cost balancing accounts (1)\n</td> <td>(17,116\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(20,289\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,173\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-15.6\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>TOTAL WATER SUPPLY COSTS\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>80,199\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>75,169\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>5,030\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6.7\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>WATER GROSS MARGIN (2)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>215,059\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>231,163\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(16,104\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-7.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>ELECTRIC OPERATING REVENUES (1)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>34,350\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>33,969\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>381\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.1\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>ELECTRIC SUPPLY COSTS:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Power purchased for resale (1)\n</td> <td>11,590\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10,720\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>870\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8.1\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Electric supply cost balancing accounts (1)\n</td> <td>1,467\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,350\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(883\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-37.6\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>TOTAL ELECTRIC SUPPLY COSTS\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>13,057\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>13,070\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(13\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-0.1\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>ELECTRIC GROSS MARGIN (2)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>21,293\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>20,899\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>394\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.9\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n \n(1) As reported on AWR's Consolidated Statements of Income, except for supply-cost-balancing accounts. The sums of water and electric supply-cost balancing accounts in the table above are shown on AWR's Consolidated Statements of Income and totaled $(15.6) million and $(17.9) million for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. Revenues include surcharges that have no net earnings impact because they increase both revenues and operating expenses by corresponding amounts.\n(2) Water and electric gross margins do not include depreciation and amortization, maintenance, administrative and general, property and other taxes, and other operation expenses.\nTwo of the principal factors affecting water supply costs are the amount of water produced and the source of the water. Generally, the variable cost of producing water from wells is less than the cost of water purchased from wholesale suppliers. Under the CPUC-approved Modified Cost Balancing Account (\"MCBA\"), GSWC tracks adopted and actual expense levels for\npurchased water, power purchased for pumping and pump taxes. GSWC records the variances (which include the effects of changes in both rate and volume) between adopted and actual purchased water, purchased power and pump tax expenses. GSWC recovers from or refunds to customers the amount of such variances. GSWC tracks these variances individually for each water ratemaking area.\nThe overall actual percentages for purchased water for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 were 41% and 42%, respectively, as compared to the adopted percentages of 28% for both 2018 and 2017. The higher actual percentages of purchased water as compared to adopted percentages resulted primarily from several wells being out of service. Purchased water costs for the year ended December 31, 2018 increased to $68.9 million as compared to $68.3 million for the same period in 2017 primarily due to an increase in customer usage, as well as an increase in wholesale water costs as compared to the year ended December 31, 2017.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2018, the cost of power purchased for pumping increased to $9.0 million as compared to $8.5 million for the same period in 2017 primarily due to an increase in customer usage as well increases in electric rates.\nGroundwater production assessments were $19.4 million in 2018 as compared to $18.6 million in 2017 due to an increase in pump tax rates during 2018 as compared to 2017.\nThe under-collection in the water supply cost balancing account decreased $3.2 million during the year ended December 31, 2018 as compared to the same period in 2017 due to the CPUC-approved rate increases to cover increases in supply costs experienced in most ratemaking areas. This increase to revenues was largely offset by a corresponding increase in supply costs, which reduces the under-collection in the water supply cost balancing account.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2018, the cost of power purchased for resale to BVES's customers was $11.6 million as compared to $10.7 million for the same period in 2017. The average price per megawatt-hour (\"MWh\"), including fixed costs, increased to $79.90 per MWh in 2018 from $73.03 per MWh for the year ended December 31, 2017.\nOther Operation\nThe primary components of other operation expenses for GSWC include payroll, materials and supplies, chemicals and water-treatment costs, and outside service costs of operating the regulated water and electric systems, including the costs associated with transmission and distribution, pumping, water quality, meter reading, billing, and operations of district offices. Registrant's contracted services operations incur many of the same types of expenses.

There was no similar reduction recorded in 2018. Excluding the impact of this recovery, as well as changes in billed surcharges which have no impact to earnings, other operation expenses at the water segment decreased overall by approximately $459,000 due, in large part, to lower conservation costs incurred compared to 2017.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2018, total other operation expenses at the electric segment increased mainly due to higher labor-related costs.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2018, total other operation expenses for the contracted services segment increased mainly due to the commencement of operations at Fort Riley on July 1, 2018, including transition costs.\nAdministrative and General\nAdministrative and general expenses include payroll related to administrative and general functions, the related employee benefits, insurance expenses, outside legal and consulting fees, regulatory utility commission expenses, expenses associated with being a public company and general corporate expenses charged to expense accounts.

This decrease was offset by a corresponding decrease in administrative and general expense to reflect the recovery of these costs, resulting in no impact to earnings. Excluding the decrease in billed surcharges, administrative and general expenses at the water segment increased by $1.7 million due primarily to the receipt of $1.8 million in December 2017 for reimbursement of litigation costs pursuant to a settlement agreement, which were reflected as a reduction to legal expenses in 2017. There was no similar reduction recorded in 2018. Overall, other administrative and general expenses remained relatively flat compared to 2017.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2018, administrative and general expenses for the electric segment increased by $1.0 million as compared to 2017 due to an increase in regulatory, legal and outside services costs.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2018, administrative and general expenses for contracted services increased by $1.3 million due primarily to the commencement of operations at Eglin AFB and at Fort Riley in 2017 and 2018, respectively, as well as an increase in labor-related costs.\nDepreciation and Amortization\nFor the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, depreciation and amortization expense by segment consisted of the following amounts (in thousands):\nTable 102: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year\nEnded\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Year\nEnded\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>12/31/2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12/31/2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>CHANGE\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>CHANGE\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Water Services\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>36,137\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>35,706\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>431\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.2\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Electric Services\n</td> <td>2,258\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,146\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>112\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5.2\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Contracted Services\n</td> <td>2,030\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,179\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>851\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>72.2\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total depreciation and amortization\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>40,425\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>39,031\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,394\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.6\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nFor the year ended December 31, 2018, depreciation and amortization expense increased due to fixed asset additions for all business segments during 2018.

The increase in interest income at the contracted services segment was due to Registrant's adoption of ASC Topic 606 (Revenues from Contracts with Customers) on January 1, 2018 using the modified retrospective approach. As a result of this adoption, certain funds received by the contracted services segment from the U.S. government during 2018 have been recorded as interest income. Prior to the adoption of ASC Topic 606, these funds were recorded as revenues.\nOther, net\nFor the year ended December 31, 2018, other income decreased by $1.3 million primarily due to losses recorded on investments held for a retirement benefit plan resulting from unfavorable market conditions in 2018, as compared to gains recorded in 2017. This was partially offset by a decrease in the non-service cost components of net periodic benefit costs related to Registrant's defined benefit pension plans and other retirement benefits. However, as a result of GSWC's pension balancing account authorized by the CPUC, changes in net periodic benefit costs are mostly offset by corresponding changes in revenues, having no material impact to earnings.\nIncome Tax Expense\nFor the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, income tax expense by segment, including AWR (parent), consisted of the following amounts (in thousands):\nTable 107: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year\nEnded\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Year\nEnded\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>12/31/2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12/31/2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>CHANGE\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>CHANGE\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Water Services\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>12,391\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>32,212\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(19,821\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-61.5\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Electric Services\n</td> <td>1,212\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,847\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(635\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-34.4\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Contracted Services\n</td> <td>4,939\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7,136\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(2,197\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-30.8\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>AWR (parent)\n</td> <td>(525\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(2,221\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,696\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-76.4\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total income tax expense\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>18,017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>38,974\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(20,957\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-53.8\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nConsolidated income tax expense for the year ended December 31, 2018 decreased by $21.0 million primarily due to a lower effective income tax rate (\"ETR\") from the Tax Act.

For all segments, the lower income tax expense resulting from the Tax Act was due primarily to the reduction in the federal corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21%, which was largely offset by

In addition, in February 2017, the CPUC approved recovery of incremental costs related to California's drought state of emergency, which were previously expensed. As a result of this approval, during the first quarter of 2017, GSWC recorded a regulatory asset and a corresponding increase to pretax earnings of $1.5 million, or $0.02 per share, of which $1.2 million was reflected as a reduction to other operation expenses and approximately $260,000 was reflected as additional revenue. Furthermore, affecting the results and comparability between the two periods were higher gains recorded in 2017 on Registrant's investments held to fund a retirement benefit plan as compared to 2016. This non-core business item increased the water segment's earnings on a relative basis by approximately $0.02 per share.\nExcluding the impact of the items discussed above and an increase in billed surcharges which have no impact to earnings, diluted earnings from the water segment for 2017 increased by $0.01 per share as compared to 2016 due to the following items, which impacted the comparability between the two periods:\n \u2022 A decrease in operating expenses (excluding supply costs) increased earnings by approximately $0.05 per share due, in large part, to a reduction in legal costs of $1.8 million, or $0.03 per share, recorded in December 2017 for amounts received from the City of Claremont pursuant to a settlement agreement. Excluding this item, overall operating expenses decreased by $0.02 per share due mostly to lower maintenance costs, and incurring only a partial year of Ojai-related operating expenses as a result of the sale. These decreases were partially offset by higher medical insurance costs, conservation costs, general rate-case-related expenses and property and other taxes, as well as an $800,000 reduction in operating expenses recorded in the fourth quarter of 2016 as a result of the CPUC's water general rate case decision, which granted recovery of previously incurred costs tracked in memorandum accounts. \n \u2022 Excluding gains and losses on investments, there was an increase in interest and other income (net of interest expense), which increased earnings by approximately $0.01 per share, due primarily to (i) higher interest income on GSWC's regulatory assets resulting mostly from an increase in the 90-day commercial paper rate, and (ii) amounts collected from developers on certain outstanding balances owed to GSWC.  The increase in diluted earnings from the water segment discussed above were partially offset by the following:\n \u2022 An overall decrease in the water gross margin of $2.3 million, or $0.03 per share, largely due to the cessation of Ojai operations in June 2017. This was partially offset by revenues generated from CPUC-approved second-year rate increases effective January 1, 2017. \n \u2022 An overall increase in the water segment's effective income tax rate (\"ETR\"), which negatively impacted water earnings by approximately $0.02 per share. The increase in the ETR was due, in large part, to the remeasurement of certain non-rate-regulated deferred tax assets (primarily compensation- and benefit-related items) in connection with the Tax Act, which negatively impacted water earnings by approximately $0.03 per share. This was partially offset by changes in flow-through and permanent items at the water segment. \nElectric Segment:\nFor the year ended December 31, 2017, diluted earnings from the electric segment increased by $0.01 per share as compared to the same period in 2016. Operating expenses (other than supply costs) decreased by $1.2 million primarily due to additional costs incurred in 2016 in response to power outages caused by severe winter storms experienced in January 2016, lower regulatory costs, and lower costs associated with energy efficiency and solar power programs approved by the CPUC. There was also a decrease in the effective income tax rate for the electric segment as compared to the same period in 2016 resulting primarily from changes in flow-through items. These increases to earnings were partially offset by a lower electric gross margin, which was due mostly to a downward adjustment in the electric revenue requirement to reflect updated allocations from the general office as a result of the decision in the water general rate case.\nContracted Services Segment:\nFor the year ended December 31, 2017, diluted earnings from contracted services were $0.37 per share, compared to $0.33 per share for the same period in 2016. There was an increase in management fee revenues from the successful resolution of various price adjustments and asset transfers received during 2016 and 2017. This includes approximately $1.0 million, or $0.02 per share, of retroactive management fees recorded in 2017 which related to periods prior to 2017, as compared to $421,000, or $0.01 per share, of retroactive management fees recorded in 2016 which related to periods prior to 2016. There was also an increase in management fees and construction revenues generated from the operations at Eglin Air Force Base (\"Eglin AFB\"), which began in June 2017. These increases to earnings were partially offset by higher operating costs due to transition activities and joint inventory study at Eglin AFB, as well as increases in labor and outside services costs related to business development and compliance.\nAWR (parent):\nFor the year ended December 31, 2017, diluted earnings from AWR (parent) increased $0.03 per share compared to 2016 due to the remeasurement of deferred tax balances recorded at the parent level. The one-time remeasurement was based on the Tax Act's lower federal corporate tax rate of 21% as compared to 35%, which increased earnings at AWR (parent) by approximately $0.03 per share during 2017.\nThe following discussion and analysis for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 provides information on AWR's consolidated operations and assets and, where necessary, includes specific references to AWR's individual segments and subsidiaries: GSWC and ASUS and its subsidiaries.\nOperating Revenues\nWater\nFor the year ended December 31, 2017, revenues from water operations increased by $3.4 million to $306.3 million, compared to $302.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase was primarily due to second-year rate increases effective January 1, 2017, and rate increases to specifically cover increases in supply costs experienced in certain rate-making areas. The rate changes related to supply costs are largely offset by a corresponding increase in supply costs, resulting in an insignificant change to the water gross margin. There were also new surcharges implemented during 2017 to recover previously incurred costs, which were offset by a corresponding increase in operating expenses (primarily administrative and general) totaling $3.6 million, resulting in no impact to earnings. These increases in revenues were partially offset by lower revenues due to the cessation of Ojai operations in June 2017.\nBilled water consumption for the year ended December 31, 2017 increased approximately 4% as compared to 2016. In general, changes in consumption do not have a significant impact on recorded revenues due to the CPUC-approved WRAM accounts in place in the majority of GSWC's rate-making areas. GSWC records the difference between what it bills its water customers and that which is authorized by the CPUC in the WRAM accounts as regulatory assets or liabilities.\nElectric\nIn 2016, the CPUC granted BVES's request to defer the filing of its next electric general rate case to 2017, setting new rates for the years 2018 through 2021. As a result, adopted base revenues for 2017 were based on 2016 adopted base revenues, adjusted for the change in the general office allocation approved by the CPUC in the water general rate case. For the year ended December 31, 2017, revenues from electric operations were $34.0 million as compared to $35.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. This decrease was primarily due to the reduction in the adopted revenue requirement for electric to reflect a decrease in the general office allocation. In May 2017, BVES filed its general rate case application with the CPUC. A final decision is expected in 2019.\nBilled electric usage for the year ended December 31, 2017 decreased slightly as compared to the same period in 2016. Due to the CPUC-approved base revenue requirement adjustment mechanism (\"BRRAM\"), which adjusts base revenues to adopted levels authorized by the CPUC, changes in usage do not have a significant impact on earnings.\nContracted Services\nRevenues from contracted services are composed of construction revenues (including renewal and replacements) and management fees for operating and maintaining the water and/or wastewater systems at various military bases. For the year ended December 31, 2017, revenues from contracted services were $100.3 million as compared to $97.4 million for 2016. There was an increase in ongoing operations and maintenance management fees due to the successful resolution of various price adjustments and asset transfers during 2016 and 2017, as well as the commencement of operations at Eglin AFB in June 2017. Included in management fees for 2017 was approximately $1.0 million in retroactive revenues related to periods prior to 2017, as compared to $421,000 of retroactive management fees recorded in 2016 which related to periods prior to 2016. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in construction activity in 2017 as compared to 2016.\nDuring 2017, ASUS was awarded approximately $20.2 million in new construction projects, the majority of which were completed during 2018.\nOperating Expenses:\nSupply Costs\nTotal supply costs comprise the largest segment of total operating expenses. Supply costs accounted for 28.1% and 26.8% of total operating expenses for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. The table below provides the amounts (in thousands) of increases (decreases) and percent changes in water and electric revenues, supply costs and gross margins during the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016:\nTable 114: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>12/31/2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12/31/2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>CHANGE\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>CHANGE\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>WATER OPERATING REVENUES (1)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>306,332\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>302,931\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,401\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.1\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>WATER SUPPLY COSTS:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Water purchased (1)\n</td> <td>68,302\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>64,442\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,860\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Power purchased for pumping (1)\n</td> <td>8,518\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8,663\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(145\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-1.7\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Groundwater production assessment (1)\n</td> <td>18,638\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>14,993\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,645\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>24.3\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Water supply cost balancing accounts (1)\n</td> <td>(20,289\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(14,813\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(5,476\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>37.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>TOTAL WATER SUPPLY COSTS\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>75,169\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>73,285\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,884\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.6\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>WATER GROSS MARGIN (2)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>231,163\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>229,646\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,517\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.7\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>ELECTRIC OPERATING REVENUES (1)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>33,969\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>35,771\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(1,802\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-5.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>ELECTRIC SUPPLY COSTS:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Power purchased for resale (1)\n</td> <td>10,720\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10,387\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>333\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.2\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Electric supply cost balancing accounts (1)\n</td> <td>2,350\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,607\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(257\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-9.9\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>TOTAL ELECTRIC SUPPLY COSTS\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>13,070\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>12,994\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>76\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.6\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>ELECTRIC GROSS MARGIN (2)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>20,899\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>22,777\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(1,878\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-8.2\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n \n(1) As reported on AWR's Consolidated Statements of Income, except for supply-cost-balancing accounts. The sums of water and electric supply-cost balancing accounts in the table above are shown on AWR's Consolidated Statements of Income and totaled $(17.9) million and $(12.2) million for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Revenues include surcharges, which increase both revenues and operating expenses by corresponding amounts, thus having no net earnings impact.\n(2) Water and electric gross margins do not include depreciation and amortization, maintenance, administrative and general, property and other taxes, and other operation expenses.\nThe overall actual percentages for purchased water for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 were 42% and 40%, respectively, as compared to the adopted percentages of 28% and 29% for 2017 and 2016, respectively. The higher actual percentages of purchased water as compared to adopted percentages resulted primarily from several wells being out of service.\nPurchased water costs for the year ended December 31, 2017 increased to $68.3 million as compared to $64.4 million for the same period in 2016 primarily due to an increase of purchased water in the supply mix as a result of several wells being out of service, as well as an increase in wholesale water costs as compared to the year ended December 31, 2016.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2017, the cost of power purchased for pumping decreased slightly to $8.5 million as compared to $8.7 million for the same period in 2016 primarily due to decreases in pumped water. Groundwater production assessments were $18.6 million in 2017 as compared to $15.0 million in 2016 due to an increase in pump tax rates and pump taxes paid for water storage rights during 2017 as compared to 2016.\nThe under-collection in the water supply cost balancing account increased $5.5 million during the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to the same period in 2016 due to the higher purchased water costs as well as higher groundwater production assessments as compared to adopted water supply costs.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2017, the cost of power purchased for resale to BVES's customers was $10.7 million as compared to $10.4 million for the same period in 2016. The average price per megawatt-hour (\"MWh\"), including fixed costs, increased to $73.03 per MWh in 2017 from $69.54 per MWh for the year ended December 31, 2016.\nOther Operation\nFor the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, other operation expenses by business segment consisted of the following amounts (in thousands):\nTable 116: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year\nEnded\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Year\nEnded\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>12/31/2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12/31/2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>CHANGE\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>CHANGE\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Water Services\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>22,189\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>21,649\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>540\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.5\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Electric Services\n</td> <td>2,688\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,122\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(434\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-13.9\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Contracted Services\n</td> <td>5,117\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,486\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,631\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>46.8\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total other operation\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>29,994\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>28,257\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,737\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6.1\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nDuring 2017, there was a $433,000 increase in surcharges billed to customers to recover previously incurred other operation expenses approved by the CPUC as part of the final decision on the water general rate case. These surcharges increased revenues and water gross margin with a corresponding increase in other operation expenses, resulting in no impact to earnings. Furthermore, in February 2017, the CPUC approved the recovery of incremental drought-related costs incurred in 2015 and 2016 during the drought state of emergency in California. As a result of the CPUC's approval, GSWC recorded a $1.2 million regulatory asset with a corresponding reduction in other operation expenses during the first quarter of 2017. Excluding the impact of surcharges and the recovery of drought-related costs, other operation expenses at the water segment increased by $1.3 million during the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to the same period in 2016. The increase was due primarily to higher conservation costs, labor and bad debt expense.\nThe decrease in other operation expenses at the electric segment was due to outside services costs and labor costs incurred in response to power outages caused by severe winter storms experienced in January 2016. There were no similar events in 2017.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2017, total other operation expenses for the contracted services segment increased mainly due to transition costs incurred at Eglin AFB, including a joint inventory study conducted with the U.S. government for the water and wastewater system infrastructure. ASUS assumed operations at Eglin AFB in June 2017, which further increased other operation expenses in 2017 as compared to 2016. ASUS assumed the operations at Fort Riley in July 2018.\nAdministrative and General\nFor the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, administrative and general expenses by business segment, including AWR (parent), consisted of the following amounts (in thousands):\nTable 117: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year\nEnded\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Year\nEnded\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>12/31/2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12/31/2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>CHANGE\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>CHANGE\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Water Services\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>55,471\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>56,745\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(1,274\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-2.2\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Electric Services\n</td> <td>6,937\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7,953\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1,016\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-12.8\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Contracted Services\n</td> <td>19,139\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>16,801\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,338\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>13.9\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>AWR (parent)\n</td> <td>96\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>19\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>77\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>405.3\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total administrative and general\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>81,643\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>81,518\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>125\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.2\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nSurcharges were implemented in 2017 to recover previously incurred administrative and general costs approved by the CPUC as part of the final decision on the water general rate case issued in March 2017. A $3.3 million increase in revenues and water gross margin from these surcharges was offset by a corresponding increase in administrative and general expense to reflect the recovery of these costs, resulting in no impact to earnings. Excluding the increase in billed surcharges, administrative and general expenses at the water segment decreased by $4.6 million due primarily to lower legal expenses related to condemnation matters as compared to 2016. In addition, the Claremont settlement payment received in December 2017 included reimbursement of approximately $1.8 million in litigation costs, which was reflected as a reduction to legal expenses in 2017. These decreases were partially offset by higher medical insurance costs and general-rate-case-related expenses, as well as an $800,000 reduction to administrative and general expenses recorded in 2016 to reflect the CPUC's approval for recovery of previously incurred costs that were being tracked in CPUC-authorized memorandum accounts.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2017, administrative and general expenses for the electric segment decreased by $1.0 million as compared to 2016 due to lower regulatory costs, as well as decreases in costs associated with the energy-efficiency and solar-initiative programs approved by the CPUC.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2017, administrative and general expenses for contracted services increased by $2.3 million due primarily to (i) an increase in labor-related costs, (ii) the start of operations at Eglin AFB in June 2017, which increased administrative and general expenses in 2017 as compared to 2016, and (iii) an increase in outside services costs related to new business development and compliance.\nDepreciation and Amortization\nFor the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, depreciation and amortization expense by segment consisted of the following amounts (in thousands):\nTable 118: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year\nEnded\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Year\nEnded\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>12/31/2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12/31/2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>CHANGE\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>CHANGE\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Water Services\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>35,706\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>35,777\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(71\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-0.2\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Electric Services\n</td> <td>2,146\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,027\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>119\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5.9\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Contracted Services\n</td> <td>1,179\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,046\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>133\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12.7\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total depreciation and amortization\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>39,031\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>38,850\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>181\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.5\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nFor the year ended December 31, 2017, depreciation and amortization expense at the water segment decreased due primarily to retirements recorded during 2017 and 2016, as well as the sale of the Ojai utility assets in June 2017.

AWR's effective income tax rate (\"ETR\") was 36.0% and 36.8% for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. The ETR for GSWC was 38.8% for 2017 as compared to 37.9% for 2016 due, in part, to the remeasurement of non rate-regulated deferred tax assets as a result of the Tax Act, which reduced the federal corporate tax rate from 35% to 21%. The earnings impact of this increase in GSWC's ETR was largely offset by a reduction in deferred tax liabilities at AWR (parent), due also to the remeasurement of federal deferred tax liabilities associated with the California state unitary deferred tax balance.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nCritical accounting policies and estimates are those that are important to the portrayal of AWR's financial condition, results of operations and cash flows, and require the most difficult, subjective or complex judgments of AWR's management. The need to make estimates about the effect of items that are uncertain is what makes these judgments difficult, subjective and/or complex. Management makes subjective judgments about the accounting and regulatory treatment of many items. The following are accounting policies that are critical to the financial statements of AWR. For more information regarding the significant accounting policies of Registrant, see Note 1 of Notes to Financial Statements\u201d included in Part II, Item 8, in Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\nAccounting for Rate Regulation - Because GSWC operates extensively in a regulated business, it is subject to the authoritative guidance for accounting for the effects of certain types of regulation. Application of this guidance requires accounting for certain transactions in accordance with regulations adopted by the regulatory commissions of the states in which rate-regulated operations are conducted. Utility companies defer costs and credits on the balance sheet as regulatory assets and liabilities when it is probable that those costs and credits will be recognized in the ratemaking process in a period different from the period in which they would have been reflected in income by an unregulated company. These deferred regulatory assets and liabilities are then reflected in the income statement in the period in which the same amounts are reflected in the rates charged for service.\nRegulation and the effects of regulatory accounting have the most significant impact on the financial statements of GSWC. When GSWC files for adjustments to rates, the capital assets, operating costs and other matters are subject to review, and disallowances may occur. In the event that a portion of the GSWC's operations is no longer subject to the accounting guidance for the effects of certain types of regulation, GSWC is required to write-off related regulatory assets that are not specifically recoverable and determine if other assets might be impaired. If the CPUC determines that a portion of GSWC's assets are not recoverable in customer rates, GSWC is required to determine if it has suffered an asset impairment that would require a write-down in the asset valuation. Management continually evaluates the anticipated recovery, settlement or refund of regulatory assets, liabilities, and revenues subject to refund and provides for allowances and/or reserves that it believes to be necessary. In the event that GSWC's assessment as to the probability of the inclusion in the ratemaking process is incorrect, the associated regulatory asset or liability will be adjusted to reflect the change in assessment or the impact of regulatory approval of rates. Reviews by the CPUC may also result in additional regulatory liabilities to refund previously collected revenues to customers if the CPUC were to disallow costs included in the ratemaking process.\nRegistrant also reviews its utility plant in-service for possible impairment in accordance with accounting guidance for regulated entities for abandonments and disallowances of plant costs.\nRevenue Recognition - Effective January 1, 2018, Registrant adopted Accounting Standard Update 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606) (\"ASU 2014-09\") issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board. The adoption of this revenue guidance did not have a material impact on how Registrant recognizes revenue.\nGSWC records water and electric utility operating revenues when the service is provided to customers. Operating revenues include unbilled revenues that are earned (i.e., the service has been provided) but not billed by the end of each accounting period. Unbilled revenues are calculated based on the number of days and total usage from each customer's most recent billing record that was billed prior to the end of the accounting period, and is used to estimate unbilled consumption as of the year-end reporting period. Unbilled revenues are recorded for both monthly and bi-monthly customers.\nThe CPUC granted GSWC the authority to implement revenue decoupling mechanisms through the adoption of the WRAM and the BRRAM. With the adoption of these alternative revenue programs, GSWC adjusts revenues in the WRAM and BRRAM for the difference between what is billed to its regulated customers and that which is authorized by the CPUC. Alternative revenue programs such as the WRAM and BRRAM are outside the scope of ASU 2014-09.\nAs required by the accounting guidance for alternative revenue programs, GSWC is required to collect its WRAM and BRRAM balances within 24 months following the year in which they are recorded. The CPUC has set the recovery period for under-collected balances that are up to 15% of adopted annual revenues at 18 months or less. For net WRAM under-collected balances greater than 15%, the recovery period is 19 to 36 months. As a result of the accounting guidance and CPUC-adopted recovery periods, Registrant must estimate if any WRAM and BRRAM revenues will be collected beyond the 24-month period, which can affect the timing of when such revenues are recognized.\nRevenues for ASUS's operations and maintenance contracts are recognized when services have been rendered to the U.S. government pursuant to 50-year contracts. Revenues from construction activities are recognized based on either the\npercentage-of-completion or cost-plus methods of accounting. In accordance with GAAP, revenue recognition under these methods requires management to estimate the progress toward completion on a contract in terms of efforts, such as costs incurred. This approach is used because management considers it to be the best available measure of progress on these contracts. Changes in job performance, job conditions, change orders and estimated profitability, including those arising from any contract penalty provisions, and final contract settlements may result in revisions to costs and income, and are recognized in the period in which the revisions are determined. Unbilled receivables from the U.S. government represent amounts to be billed for construction work completed and/or for services rendered pursuant to the 50-year contracts with the U.S government, which are not presently billable but which will be billed under the terms of the contracts.\nIncome Taxes - Registrant's income tax calculations require estimates due principally to the regulated nature of the operations of GSWC, the multiple states in which Registrant operates, and potential future tax rate changes. Registrant uses the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes under which deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which these temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. Changes in regulatory treatment, or significant changes in tax-related estimates, assumptions or law, could have a material impact on the financial position and results of operations of Registrant.\nAs a regulated utility, GSWC treats certain temporary differences as flow-through adjustments in computing its income tax expense consistent with the income tax approach approved by the CPUC for ratemaking purposes. Flow-through adjustments increase or decrease tax expense in one period, with an offsetting decrease or increase occurring in another period. Giving effect to these temporary differences as flow-through adjustments typically results in a greater variance between the effective tax rate and the statutory federal income tax rate in any given period than would otherwise exist if GSWC were not required to account for its income taxes as a regulated enterprise. As of December 31, 2018, Registrant's total amount of unrecognized tax benefits was zero.\nPension Benefits - Registrant's pension benefit obligations and related costs are calculated using actuarial concepts within the framework of accounting guidance for employers' accounting for pensions and post-retirement benefits other than pensions. Two critical assumptions, the discount rate and the expected return on plan assets, are important elements of expense and/or liability measurement. We evaluate these critical assumptions annually. Other assumptions include employee demographic factors such as retirement patterns, mortality, turnover and rate of compensation increase. The discount rate enables Registrant to state expected future cash payments for benefits as a present value on the measurement date. The guideline for setting this rate is a high-quality, long-term corporate bond rate. Registrant's discount rates were determined by considering the average of pension yield curves constructed using a large population of high-quality corporate bonds. The resulting discount rates reflect the matching of plan liability cash flows to the yield curves. A lower discount rate increases the present value of benefit obligations and increases periodic pension expense. Conversely, a higher discount rate decreases the present value of benefit obligations and decreases periodic pension expense. To determine the expected long-term rate of return on the plan assets, Registrant considers the current and expected asset allocation, as well as historical and expected returns on each plan asset class. A lower expected rate of return on plan assets will increase pension expense. The long-term expected return on the pension plan's assets was 6.50% in both 2018 and 2017.\nFor the pension plan obligation, Registrant increased the discount rate to 4.43% as of December 31, 2018 from 3.76% as of December 31, 2017 to reflect market interest-rate conditions at December 31, 2018. A hypothetical 25-basis point decrease in the assumed discount rate would have increased total net periodic pension expense for 2018 by approximately $855,000, or 27.8%, and would have increased the projected benefit obligation ( PBO\u201d) and accumulated benefit obligation ( ABO\u201d) at December 31, 2018 by a total of $7.0 million, or 3.6%. A 25-basis point further decrease in the long-term return on pension-plan-asset assumption would have increased 2018 pension cost by approximately $430,000, or 14.0%.\nIn addition, changes in the fair value of plan assets will impact future pension cost and the Plan's funded status. Volatile market conditions can affect the value of AWR's trust established to fund its future long-term pension benefits. Any reductions in the value of plan assets will result in increased future expense, an increase in the underfunded position and increased future contributions.\nThe CPUC has authorized GSWC to maintain two-way balancing accounts to track differences between the forecasted annual pension expenses adopted in rates and the actual annual expense to be recorded by GSWC in accordance with the accounting guidance for pension costs. As of December 31, 2018, GSWC has a $3.0 million over-collection in the two-way pension balancing accounts, consisting of a $2.0 million over-collection related to the general office and water regions, and a $1.0 million over-collection related to BVES.\nFunding requirements for qualified defined benefit pension plans are determined by government regulations. In establishing the contribution amount, Registrant has considered the potential impact of funding-rule changes under the Pension Protection Act of 2006. Registrant contributes the minimum required contribution as determined by government regulations or the forecasted annual pension cost authorized by the CPUC and included in customer rates, whichever is higher. In accordance with this funding policy, for 2019 the pension contribution is expected to be approximately $3.6 million. Any differences between the forecasted annual pension costs in rates and the actual pension costs are included in the two-way pension balancing accounts.\nAdditionally, our pension plan liabilities are sensitive to changes in interest rates. As interest rates decrease, thereby reducing returns, our liabilities increase, potentially increasing benefit expense and funding requirements. In addition, market factors can affect assumptions we use in determining funding requirements with respect to our pension plan. For example, a relatively modest change in our assumptions regarding discount rates can materially affect our calculation of funding requirements. To the extent that market data compels us to reduce the discount rate used in our assumptions, our benefit obligations could materially increase.\nChanges in demographics, including increased numbers of retirees or increases in life expectancy assumptions may also increase the funding requirements of our obligations related to the pension and other postretirement benefit plans. Mortality assumptions are a critical component of benefit obligation amounts and a key factor in determining the expected length of time for annuity payments. Assuming no changes in actuarial assumptions or plan amendments, the costs over the long term are expected to decrease due to the closure of Registrant's defined benefit pension plan to new employees as of January 1, 2011. Employees hired or rehired after December 31, 2010 are eligible to participate in a defined contribution plan.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nAWR\nRegistrant's regulated business is capital intensive and requires considerable capital resources. A portion of these capital resources is provided by internally generated cash flows from operations. AWR anticipates that interest expense will increase in future periods due to the need for additional external capital to fund its construction program, and as market interest rates increase. AWR believes that costs associated with capital used to fund construction at GSWC will continue to be recovered through water and electric rates charged to customers.\nAWR funds its operating expenses and pays dividends on its outstanding Common Shares primarily through dividends from its wholly owned subsidiaries. The ability of GSWC to pay dividends to AWR is restricted by California law. Under these restrictions, approximately $211.2 million was available for GSWC to pay dividends to AWR on December 31, 2018. Approximately $67.3 million was available for ASUS to pay dividends to AWR as of December 31, 2018 to the extent that the subsidiaries of ASUS are able to pay dividends in that amount to ASUS under applicable state laws.\nWhen necessary, Registrant obtains funds from external sources in the capital markets and through bank borrowings. Access to external financing on reasonable terms depends on the credit ratings of AWR and GSWC and current business conditions, including that of the water utility industry in general, as well as conditions in the debt and equity capital markets. AWR has access to a syndicated credit facility, which expires in May 2023. AWR borrows under this facility and provides funds to its subsidiaries, GSWC and ASUS, in support of their operations. Any amounts owed to AWR by GSWC for borrowings under this facility are included in inter-company payables on GSWC's balance sheet. The interest rate charged to GSWC and ASUS is sufficient to cover AWR's interest cost under the credit facility.\nIn March of 2019, $40 million of GSWC's 6.70% senior notes will mature. GSWC intends to borrow under its intercompany borrowing arrangement with AWR to fund the repayment of this note. As of February 1, 2019 there were $99.5 million of outstanding borrowings under this facility and $940,000 of letters of credit outstanding. As of February 1, 2019, AWR had $49.6 million available to borrow under the credit facility.\nIn July 2018, Standard and Poor's Global Ratings ( S&P\u201d) affirmed an A+ credit rating with a stable outlook on both AWR and GSWC. S&P's debt ratings range from AAA (highest possible) to D (obligation is in default). In January 2019, Moody's Investors Service (\"Moody's\") affirmed its A2 rating with a positive outlook for GSWC. Securities ratings are not recommendations to buy, sell or hold a security and are subject to change or withdrawal at any time by the rating agencies. Registrant believes that AWR's sound capital structure and A+ credit rating, combined with its financial discipline, will enable AWR to access the debt and equity markets. However, unpredictable financial market conditions in the future may limit its access or impact the timing of when to access the market, in which case, Registrant may choose to temporarily reduce its capital spending. If needed, GSWC may issue long-term debt in the future, depending on market conditions. It is anticipated that the proceeds from any such debt issuance would be used to pay down short-term borrowings and fund a portion of capital expenditures.\nAWR's ability to pay cash dividends on its Common Shares outstanding depends primarily upon cash flows from its subsidiaries. AWR intends to continue paying quarterly cash dividends in the future, on or about March 1, June 1, September 1 and December 1, subject to earnings and financial conditions, regulatory requirements and such other factors as the Board of Directors may deem relevant. Registrant has paid dividends on its Common Shares for over 80 consecutive years. On January 29, 2019, AWR's Board of Directors approved a first quarter dividend of $0.275 per share on AWR's Common Shares. Dividends on the Common Shares will be paid on March 1, 2019 to shareholders of record at the close of business on February 15, 2019.\nCash Flows from Operating Activities:\nCash flows from operating activities have generally provided sufficient cash to fund operating requirements, including a portion of construction expenditures at GSWC, construction expenses at ASUS, and dividend payments. Registrant's future cash flows from operating activities are expected to be affected by a number of factors, including utility regulation; changes in tax law and deferred taxes; maintenance expenses; inflation; compliance with environmental, health and safety standards; production costs; customer growth; per-customer usage of water and electricity; weather and seasonality; conservation efforts; compliance with local governmental requirements, including mandatory restrictions on water use; and required cash contributions to pension and post-retirement plans. Future cash flows from contracted services subsidiaries will depend on new business activities, existing operations, the construction of new and/or replacement infrastructure at military bases, timely economic price and equitable adjustment of prices, and timely collection of payments from the U.S. government and other prime contractors operating at the military bases.\nThe lower federal tax rate and the elimination of bonus depreciation brought about by the Tax Act are reducing Registrant's cash flows from operating activities, and are expected to result in higher financing costs arising from an increased need to raise debt and/or equity.\nASUS funds its operating expenses primarily through internal operating sources, which include U.S. government funding under 50-year contracts for operations and maintenance costs and construction activities, as well as investments by, or loans from, AWR. ASUS, in turn, provides funding to its subsidiaries. ASUS's subsidiaries may also from time to time provide funding to ASUS or its subsidiaries.\nCash flows from operating activities are primarily generated by net income, adjusted for non-cash expenses such as depreciation and amortization, and deferred income taxes. Cash generated by operations varies during the year. Net cash provided by operating activities was $136.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 as compared to $144.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, and $96.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The decrease in cash from operating activities during 2018 was due primarily to: (i) significant differences in the timing of income tax payments made and refunds received between the two periods, and (ii) a decrease resulting from the timing of billing of and cash receipts for construction work at military bases during the year ended December 31, 2018. The billings (and cash receipts) for construction work generally occur at completion of the work or in accordance with a billing schedule contractually agreed to with the U.S. government and/or other prime contractors. Thus, cash flow from construction-related activities may fluctuate from period to period with such fluctuations representing timing differences of when the work is being performed and when the cash is received for payment of the work. These decreases in cash from operating activities were partially offset by an overall increase in cash collected from customers related to GSWC's regulatory accounts. The timing of cash receipts and disbursements related to other working capital items also affected the changes in net cash provided by operating activities.\nThe increase in operating cash flow during 2017 as compared to 2016 was due to various CPUC-approved surcharges implemented during 2017 to recover previously incurred costs as well as income tax refunds received in 2017. The increase in operating cash flow was also due to the timing of billing of and cash receipts for construction work at military bases during 2017. Changes in customer accounts receivable were due to higher balances outstanding resulting from CPUC-approved rate increases and surcharges. The timing of cash receipts and disbursements related to other working capital items also affected the change in net cash provided by operating activities.\nCash Flows from Investing Activities:\nNet cash used in investing activities was $128.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 as compared to $80.0 million used in 2017 and $131.2 million used in 2016. Cash used in investing activities during 2017 were partially offset by $34.3 million in cash proceeds generated from the sale of GSWC's Ojai water system in 2017. Cash used for other investments consists primarily of cash invested in a trust for a retirement benefit plan.\nThe decrease in cash used in investing activities in 2017 as compared to 2016 was due to the $34.3 million in cash proceeds generated from the sale of GSWC's Ojai water system.\nRegistrant invests capital to provide essential services to its regulated customer base, and has an opportunity to earn a fair rate of return on investments in infrastructure. Registrant's infrastructure investment plan consists of both infrastructure renewal programs, where infrastructure is replaced, as needed, and major capital investment projects, where new water treatment and delivery facilities are constructed. GSWC may also be required from time to time to relocate existing infrastructure in order to accommodate local infrastructure improvement projects. Projected capital expenditures and other investments are subject to periodic review and revision.\nCash Flows from Financing Activities:\nRegistrant's financing activities include primarily: (i) the sale proceeds from the issuance of Common Shares and stock option exercises and the repurchase of Common Shares; (ii) the issuance and repayment of long-term debt and notes payable to banks; and (iii) the payment of dividends on Common Shares. In order to finance new infrastructure, Registrant also receives customer advances (net of refunds) for, and contributions in aid of, construction. Short-term borrowings are used to fund capital expenditures until long-term financing is arranged.\nNet cash used in financing activities was $1.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 as compared to net cash used of $64.7 million and net cash provided of $30.3 million for the same periods in 2017 and 2016, respectively. The decrease in net cash used in financing activities in 2018 from 2017 was due to the use of the Ojai sale proceeds, as well as cash\ngenerated from operating activities during 2017 to repay a portion of short-term borrowings from Registrant's revolving credit facility.\nNet cash used in financing activities in 2017 as compared to net cash provided by financing activities in 2016 was due to the use of the Ojai sale proceeds.\nGSWC\nGSWC funds its operating expenses, payments on its debt, dividends on its outstanding common shares and a portion of its construction expenditures through internal sources. Internal sources of cash flow are provided primarily by retention of a portion of earnings from operating activities. Internal cash generation is influenced by factors such as weather patterns, conservation efforts, environmental regulation, litigation, changes in tax law and deferred taxes, changes in supply costs and regulatory decisions affecting GSWC's ability to recover these supply costs, timing of rate relief, increases in maintenance expenses and capital expenditures, surcharges authorized by the CPUC to enable GSWC to recover expenses previously incurred from customers, and CPUC requirements to refund amounts previously charged to customers.\nGSWC may, at times, utilize external sources, including equity investments and short-term borrowings from AWR, and long-term debt to help fund a portion of its construction expenditures. On November 29, 2018, the Board of Directors approved the issuance of nineteen additional GSWC common shares to AWR for $47.5 million. GSWC used the proceeds from the issuance to pay down intercompany borrowings owed to AWR.\nIn addition, GSWC receives advances and contributions from customers, homebuilders and real estate developers to fund construction necessary to extend service to new areas. Advances for construction are generally refundable at a rate of 2.5% in equal annual installments over 40 years. Amounts that are no longer subject to refund are reclassified to contributions in aid of construction. Utility plant funded by advances and contributions is excluded from rate base. Generally, GSWC amortizes contributions in aid of construction at the same composite rate of depreciation for the related property.\nAs is often the case with public utilities, GSWC's current liabilities may at times exceed its current assets. Management believes that internally generated funds, along with the proceeds from the issuance of long-term debt, borrowings from AWR, and common share issuances to AWR, will be adequate to provide sufficient capital to enable GSWC to maintain normal operations and to meet its capital and financing requirements pending recovery of costs in rates.\nIn March of 2019, $40 million of GSWC's 6.70% senior note will mature. GSWC intends to borrow under its intercompany borrowing arrangement with AWR to fund the repayment of this note.\nCash Flows from Operating Activities:\nNet cash provided by operating activities was $120.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 as compared to $129.6 million and $101.3 million for the same periods in 2017 and 2016, respectively. This decrease was primarily due to significant differences in the timing of income tax payments made and refunds received between the two periods, partially offset by an overall increase in cash collected from customers related to GSWC's regulatory accounts. The timing of cash receipts and disbursements related to other working capital items also affected net cash provided by operating activities.\nThe increase in cash from operations in 2017 as compared to 2016 was due to various CPUC-approved surcharges implemented during 2017 to recover previously incurred costs, as well as income tax refunds received in 2017. Changes in customer accounts receivable were due to higher balances outstanding resulting from CPUC-approved rate increases and surcharges. The timing of cash receipts and disbursements related to other working capital items also affected net cash provided by operating activities.\nCash Flows from Investing Activities:\nNet cash used in investing activities was $117.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 as compared to $77.4 million and $129.3 million for the same periods in 2017 and 2016, respectively. Cash used for capital expenditures in 2017 was partially offset by cash proceeds received from the sale of GSWC's Ojai water system.\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, cash paid for capital expenditures was $116.4 million, $110.5 million and $127.9 million, respectively. Capital expenditures incurred in 2018, 2017 and 2016 were consistent with GSWC's capital investment program. GSWC expects 2019 company-funded capital expenditures to be between $115 and $125 million.\nCash Flows from Financing Activities:\nNet cash provided by financing activities was $1.4 million for 2018 as compared to net cash used of $52.2 million and net cash provided of $25.7 million for 2017 and 2016, respectively. The increase in net cash provided by financing activities during 2018 was due to the issuance of additional Common Shares to AWR for $47.5 million in cash proceeds, as well as an increase in intercompany borrowings as compared to 2017. These increases were partially offset by an increase in dividends paid to AWR.\nThe change in net cash used in financing activities in 2017 of $52.2 million, as compared to net cash provided by financing activities of $25.7 million in 2016, was due to repayments made during 2017 on intercompany borrowings using the Ojai sale proceeds and cash generated from operating activities, as compared to net borrowings made from AWR in 2016.\nContractual Obligations, Commitments and Off-Balance-Sheet Arrangements\nRegistrant has various contractual obligations which are recorded as liabilities in the consolidated financial statements. Other items, such as certain purchase commitments and operating leases, are not recognized as liabilities in the consolidated financial statements, but are required to be disclosed. In addition to contractual maturities, Registrant has certain debt instruments that contain annual sinking funds or other principal payments. Registrant believes that it will be able to refinance debt instruments at their maturity through public issuance, or private placement, of debt or equity. Annual payments to service debt are generally made from cash flows from operations.\nThe following table reflects Registrant's contractual obligations and commitments to make future payments pursuant to contracts as of December 31, 2018. All obligations and commitments are obligations and commitments of GSWC unless otherwise noted.

dated September 1, 1993, as amended in December 2008. The notes and debentures do not contain any financial covenants that Registrant believes to be material or any cross-default provisions.\n(3) GSWC issued private placement notes in 1991 in the amount of $28 million pursuant to the terms of note purchase agreements with substantially similar terms. These agreements contain restrictions on the payment of dividends, minimum interest coverage requirements, a maximum debt-to-capitalization ratio, and a negative pledge. Pursuant to the terms of these agreements, GSWC must maintain a minimum interest coverage ratio of two times interest expense. In addition, two senior notes in the amount of $40 million each were issued by GSWC in October 2005 and in March 2009 to CoBank, ACB. A\nsenior note in the amount of $15 million was issued to The Prudential Insurance Company of America in December 2014. Under the terms of these senior notes, GSWC may not incur any additional debt or pay any distributions to its shareholders if, after giving effect thereto, it would have a debt to capitalization ratio in excess of 0.6667-to-1 or a debt to earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization ratio of more than 8-to-1. GSWC is in compliance with these covenant provisions as of December 31, 2018. GSWC does not currently have any outstanding mortgages or other liens on indebtedness on its properties.\n(4) Consists of obligations at GSWC related to (i) a loan agreement supporting $7.7 million in outstanding debt issued by the California Pollution Control Financing Authority, and (ii) $3.7 million of obligations with respect to GSWC's 500 acre-foot entitlement to water from the State Water Project ( SWP\u201d). These obligations do not contain any financial covenants believed to be material to Registrant or any cross-default provisions. In regard to its SWP entitlement, GSWC has entered into agreements with various developers for a portion of its 500 acre-foot entitlement to water from the SWP.\n(5) Consists of $3.6 million outstanding representing the debt portion of funds received under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act for reimbursements of capital costs related to the installation of meters for conversion of non-metered service to metered service in GSWC's Arden-Cordova District.\n(6) Consists of expected interest expense payments based on the assumption that GSWC's long-term debt remains outstanding until maturity.\n(7) Advances for construction represent annual contract refunds by GSWC to developers for the cost of water systems paid for by the developers. The advances are generally refundable in equal annual installments over 40-year periods.\n(8) Consists of an agreement by GSWC to purchase renewable energy credits through 2023. These renewable energy credits are used by GSWC's electric division to meet California's renewables portfolio standard.\n(9) Consists primarily of a fixed-cost purchased power contract effective January 1, 2015 between BVES and Shell Energy North America (US), L.P. and EDF Trading North America, LLC.\n(10) Consists primarily of capital expenditures estimated to be required under signed contracts at GSWC as of December 31, 2018. In addition, on February 4, 2019 BVES entered into a purchase agreement with General Electric International, Inc. in which General Electric International, Inc. will construct and then sell to BVES a solar power generating facility for $11.8 million. This project is subject to CPUC approval.\n(11) Water purchase agreements consist of (i) a remaining amount of $2.2 million under an agreement expiring in 2028 to use water rights from a third party, and (ii) an aggregate amount of $2.2 million of other water purchase commitments with other third parties, which expire through 2038.\n(12) Reflects future minimum payments under noncancelable operating leases for both GSWC and ASUS.\n(13) Consists of expected contributions to Registrant's defined benefit pension plan for the years 2019 through 2021. Contribution to the pension plan are expected to be the higher of the minimum required contribution under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act ( ERISA\u201d) or the amounts that are recovered in customer rates and approved by the CPUC. These amounts are estimates and are subject to change based on, among other things, the limits established for federal tax deductibility (pension plan) and the significant impact that returns on plan assets and changes in discount rates have on such amounts.\n(14) Other commitments consist primarily of (i) a $150 million revolving credit facility, of which $95.5 million was outstanding as of December 31, 2018; (ii) a $5.2 million asset retirement obligation of GSWC that reflects the retirement of wells by GSWC, which by law need to be properly capped at the time of removal; (iii) an irrevocable letter of credit in the amount of $340,000 for the deductible in Registrant's business automobile insurance policy; (iv) an irrevocable letter of credit issued on behalf of GSWC in the amount of $585,000 as security for the purchase of power by BVES under an energy scheduling agreement with Automated Power Exchange; and (v) a $15,000 irrevocable letter of credit issued on behalf of GSWC pursuant to a franchise agreement with the City of Rancho Cordova. All of the letters of credit are issued pursuant to the revolving credit facility. The revolving credit facility contains restrictions on prepayments, disposition of property, mergers, liens and negative pledges, indebtedness and guaranty obligations, transactions with affiliates, minimum interest coverage requirements, a maximum debt-to-capitalization ratio, and a minimum debt rating. Pursuant to the credit agreement, AWR must maintain a minimum interest coverage ratio of 3.25 times interest expense, a maximum total funded debt ratio of 0.65-to-1.00 and a minimum debt rating from Moody's or S&P of Baa3 or BBB-, respectively. As of December 31, 2018, AWR was in compliance with these covenants with an interest coverage ratio of 6.23 times interest expense, a debt ratio of 0.43-to-1.00 and debt ratings of A+ and A2.\nOff-Balance-Sheet Arrangements\nRegistrant has various contractual obligations that are recorded as liabilities in the consolidated financial statements. Other items, such as certain purchase commitments and operating leases, are not recognized as liabilities in the consolidated financial statements, but are required to be disclosed. Except for those disclosed above in the table, Registrant does not have any other off-balance-sheet arrangements.\nEffects of Inflation\nThe rates of GSWC are established to provide recovery of costs and a fair return on shareholders' investment. Recovery of the effects of inflation through higher water rates is dependent upon receiving adequate and timely rate increases; however, authorized rates charged to customers are usually based on a forecast of expenses and capital costs for GSWC. Rates may lag increases in costs caused by unanticipated inflation. During periods of moderate to low inflation, as has been experienced for the last several years, the effects of inflation on operating results have not been significant. Furthermore, the CPUC approves projections for a future test year in general rate cases which reduces the impact of inflation to the extent that GSWC's inflation forecasts are accurate.\nFor the Military Utility Privatization Subsidiaries, under the terms of the contracts with the U.S. government, the contract price is subject to an economic price adjustment on an annual basis. ASUS has experienced delays in some of its economic price adjustments. However, when adjustments are finalized, they are implemented retroactively to the effective date of the economic price adjustment.\nClimate Change\nWater - GSWC considers the potential impacts of climate change in its water supply portfolio planning and its overall infrastructure replacement plans. In addition, GSWC considers the impacts of greenhouse gas emissions and other environmental concerns in its operations and infrastructure investments.\nElectric - California has established a cap-and-trade program applicable to greenhouse gas emissions. While BVES's power-plant emissions are below the reporting threshold, as a Covered Entity\u201d BVES has an obligation to file a report in June of each year under the Greenhouse Gas Mandatory Reporting Regulation.\nThe State of California and the CPUC have also established renewable energy procurement targets. BVES has entered into a CPUC-approved ten-year contract for renewable energy credits. Because of this agreement, BVES believes it will comply through at least 2023 with California's renewable energy statutes that address this issue. However, in addition to an anticipated increase in sales, one senate bill includes extending and increasing the renewable energy procurement requirements beyond 2020. As a result, BVES is examining its renewable supply quantities to ensure continued compliance.\nBVES is also required to comply with the CPUC's greenhouse gas emission performance standards. Under these standards, BVES must file an annual attestation with the CPUC stating that BVES is in compliance. Specifically, BVES must attest to having no new ownership investment in generation facilities exceeding the emission performance standards and no long-term commitments for generation exceeding the standards. In February 2019, BVES filed an attestation that BVES complied with the standards for 2018.\nAt this time, management cannot estimate the impact, if any, that these regulations may have on the cost of BVES's power plant operations or the cost of BVES's purchased power from third party providers.\nBVES Power-Supply Arrangements\nBVES began taking power effective January 1, 2015 at a fixed cost over three-and five-year terms depending on the amount of power and period during which the power is purchased under contracts approved by the CPUC in December 2014. The three-year contract expired on December 31, 2017. Registrant intends to enter into new purchased power contracts, subject to CPUC approval, once the five-year-term contract expires in November 2019. In addition to the purchased power contracts, BVES buys additional energy to meet peak demand as needed and sells surplus power when necessary. The average cost of power purchased, including fixed costs and the transactions in the spot market, was approximately $79.90 per MWh for the year ended December 31, 2018 as compared to $73.03 per MWh for the same period of 2017. BVES's average energy costs are impacted by pricing fluctuations on the spot market. However, BVES has implemented an electric-supply-cost balancing account, as approved by the CPUC, to alleviate any impacts to earnings.\nConstruction Program\nGSWC maintains an ongoing water distribution main replacement program throughout its customer service areas based on the age and type of distribution-system materials, priority of leaks detected, remaining productive life of the distribution system and an underlying replacement schedule. In addition, GSWC upgrades its electric and water supply facilities in accordance with industry standards, and local and CPUC requirements. As of December 31, 2018, GSWC has unconditional purchase obligations for capital projects of approximately $73.4 million. During the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, GSWC had capital expenditures of $125.1 million, $115.3 million and $126.0 million, respectively. A portion of these capital expenditures was funded by developers through refundable advances, or contributions in aid of construction, which are not required to be repaid. During the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, capital expenditures funded by developers were $4.1 million, $3.5 million and $5.3 million, respectively. During 2019, GSWC's company-funded capital expenditures are estimated to be approximately $115 - $125 million.\nContracted Services\nUnder the terms of the current and future utility privatization contracts with the U.S. government, each contract's price is subject to an economic price adjustment ( EPA\u201d) on an annual basis. In the event that ASUS (i) is managing more assets at specific military bases than were included in the U.S. government's request for proposal, (ii) is managing assets that are in substandard condition as compared to what was disclosed in the request for proposal, (iii) prudently incurs costs not contemplated under the terms of the utility privatization contract, and/or (iv) becomes subject to new regulatory requirements, such as more stringent water-quality standards, ASUS is permitted to file, and has filed, requests for equitable adjustment ( REA\u201d). The timely filing for and receipt of EPAs and/or REAs continues to be critical in order for the Military Utility Privatization Subsidiaries to recover increasing costs of operating and maintaining, and renewing and replacing the water and/or wastewater systems at the military bases it serves.\nUnder the Budget Control Act of 2011 (the 2011 Act\u201d), substantial automatic spending cuts, known as \"sequestration,\" have impacted the expected levels of Department of Defense budgeting. The Military Utility Privatization Subsidiaries have not experienced any earnings impact to their existing operations and maintenance and renewal and replacement services, as utility privatization contracts are an \"excepted service\" within the 2011 Act. While the ongoing effects of sequestration have been mitigated through the passage of the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018 for fiscal years 2018 and 2019, similar issues may arise as part of fiscal uncertainty and/or future debt-ceiling limits imposed by Congress. However, any future impact on ASUS and its operations through the Military Utility Privatization Subsidiaries will likely be limited to (a) the timing of funding to pay for services rendered, (b) delays in the processing of EPAs and/or REAs, (c) the timing of the issuance of contract modifications for new construction work not already funded by the U.S. government, and/or (d) delays in the solicitation for and/or awarding of new contracts under the Department of Defense utility privatization program. Furthermore, from December 22, 2018 until January 25, 2019, the U.S. government shutdown impacted non-essential government employees due to the lack of an approved appropriations bill to fund the operations of the federal government for fiscal year 2019. However, the shutdown did not have an impact on ASUS due to the fact that funding for military operations (including military bases) is provided by the Department of Defense, which is fully funded for fiscal 2019 and was not part of the government shutdown.\nAt times, the DCAA and/or the DCMA may, at the request of a contracting officer, perform audits/reviews of contractors for compliance with certain government guidance and regulations, such as the Federal Acquisition Regulations and Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplements. Certain audit/review findings, such as system deficiencies for government-contract-business-system requirements, may result in delays in the timing of resolution of filings submitted to and/or the ability to file new proposals with the U.S. government.\nBelow is a summary of current and projected EPA filings for price adjustments to operations and maintenance fees and renewal and replacement fees for the Military Utility Privatization Subsidiaries.\nTable 126: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Military Base\n</td> <td>EPA period\n</td> <td>Filing Date\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Fort Bliss (FBWS)\n</td> <td>October 2018 - September 2019\n</td> <td>Third Quarter 2018\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Andrews Air Force Base (TUS)\n</td> <td>February 2019 - January 2020\n</td> <td>Fourth Quarter 2018\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Fort Lee (ODUS)\n</td> <td>February 2019 - January 2020\n</td> <td>Fourth Quarter 2018\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Joint Base Langley Eustis and Joint Expeditionary Base Little Creek Fort Story (ODUS)\n</td> <td>April 2019 - March 2020\n</td> <td>First Quarter of 2019\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Fort Jackson (PSUS)\n</td> <td>February 2019 - January 2020\n</td> <td>Fourth Quarter 2018\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Fort Bragg (ONUS)\n</td> <td>March 2019 - February 2020\n</td> <td>Fourth Quarter 2018\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Eglin Air Force Base (ECUS)\n</td> <td>June 2019 - May 2020\n</td> <td>Second Quarter 2019\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Fort Riley (FRUS)\n</td> <td>July 2019 - June 2020\n</td> <td>Second Quarter 2019\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nASUS assumed the operation of the water distribution and wastewater collection and treatment facilities at Fort Riley on July 1, 2018. The value of this contract is approximately $681.0 million over its 50-year term, subject to annual economic price adjustments.\nRegulatory Matters\nCertificates of Public Convenience and Necessity\nGSWC holds Certificates of Public Convenience and Necessity ( CPCN\u201d) granted by the CPUC in each of the ratemaking areas it serves. ASUS is regulated, if applicable, by the state in which it primarily conducts water and/or wastewater operations. FBWS holds a CPCN from the Public Utilities Commission of Texas. The Virginia State Corporation Commission exercises jurisdiction over ODUS as a public service company. The Maryland Public Service Commission approved the right of TUS to operate as a water and wastewater utility at Joint Base Andrews, Maryland, based on certain conditions. The South Carolina Public Service Commission exercises jurisdiction over PSUS as a public service company. ONUS is regulated by the North Carolina Public Service Commission. ECUS and FRUS are not subject to regulation by their respective states' utility commissions.\nRate Regulation\nGSWC is subject to regulation by the CPUC, which has broad authority over service and facilities, rates, classification of accounts, valuation of properties, the purchase, disposition and mortgaging of properties necessary or useful in rendering public utility service, the issuance of securities, the granting of certificates of public convenience and necessity as to the extension of services and facilities and various other matters.\nRates that GSWC is authorized to charge are determined by the CPUC in general rate cases and are derived using rate base, cost of service and cost of capital, as projected for a future test year. Rates charged to customers vary according to customer class and rate jurisdiction and are generally set at levels allowing for recovery of prudently incurred costs, including a fair return on rate base. Rate base generally consists of the original cost of utility plant in service, plus certain other assets, such as working capital and inventory, less accumulated depreciation on utility plant in service, deferred income tax liabilities and certain other deductions.\nGSWC is required to file a water general rate case application every three years according to a schedule established by the CPUC. General rate cases typically include an increase in the first test year with inflation-rate adjustments for expenses for the second and third years of the rate case cycle. For capital projects, there are two test years. Rates are based on a forecast of expenses and capital costs for each test year. Electric general rate cases are typically filed every four years.\nRates may also be increased by offsets for certain expense increases, including, but not limited to, supply-cost offset and balancing-account amortization, advice letter filings related to certain plant additions and other operating cost increases.\nNeither the operations nor rates of AWR and ASUS are directly regulated by the CPUC. The CPUC does, however, regulate certain transactions between GSWC and ASUS and between GSWC and AWR.\nPending General Rate Case Filings:\nWater Segment:\nIn July 2017, GSWC filed a general rate case application for its water regions and the general office. The general rate case will determine new water rates for the years 2019 through 2021. On August 15, 2018, GSWC and the CPUC's Public Advocates Office, formerly the Office of Ratepayer Advocates, filed a joint motion to adopt a settlement agreement between GSWC and the Public Advocates Office in connection with the general rate case. If approved by the CPUC, the settlement would resolve all of the issues in the general rate case application and authorize GSWC to invest approximately $334.5 million in capital infrastructure over the three-year rate cycle. The $334.5 million of infrastructure investment, as settled, includes $20.4 million of capital projects to be filed for revenue recovery through advice letters when those projects are completed.\nExcluding the advice-letter-project revenues, the water gross margin for 2019 in the settlement filing is expected to increase by approximately $6.0 million as compared to the 2018 adopted water gross margin. The 2019 water revenue requirement, as settled, has been reduced to reflect a decrease of approximately $7.0 million in depreciation expense, compared to the adopted 2018 depreciation expense, due to a reduction in the overall composite depreciation rates based on a revised study filed in the general rate case. The decrease in depreciation expense lowers the water gross margin, and is offset by a corresponding decrease in depreciation expense, resulting in no impact to net earnings. In addition, the 2019 water revenue requirement, as settled, includes a decrease of approximately $2.2 million for excess deferred tax refunds as a result of the Tax Act, which has a corresponding decrease in income tax expense and also results in no impact to net earnings. Had depreciation expense, as settled, remained the same as the 2018 adopted amount and there was no excess deferred tax refund that lowered the 2019 revenue requirement, the water gross margin for 2019 would have increased by approximately $15.2 million. The settlement also allows for potential additional water revenue increases in 2020 and 2021 of approximately $10.0 million and $12.0 million, respectively, subject to the results of an earnings test and changes to the forecasted inflationary index values.\nGSWC and the Public Advocates Office informed the assigned Administrative Law Judge (\"ALJ\u201d) that hearings would not be needed in light of the settlement agreement. Subsequently, the ALJ issued a ruling requesting additional information on\na number of items in the general rate case. GSWC has provided the additional information requested by the ALJ and believes it has satisfied all of the questions raised. Both the ALJ's request and GSWC's response are public information. GSWC is awaiting a proposed decision by the ALJ, which is expected during the first quarter of 2019, with a final decision by the CPUC expected later in 2019. When approved, the new rates will be retroactive to January 1, 2019.\nElectric Segment:\nIn May 2017, GSWC filed its electric general rate case application with the CPUC to determine new electric rates for the years 2018 through 2021. In November 2018, GSWC and the Public Advocates Office filed a joint motion to adopt a settlement agreement between the two parties resolving all issues in connection with the general rate case. Among other things, the settlement incorporates a previous stipulation in the case, which authorizes a new return on equity for GSWC's electric segment of 9.60%, as compared to its previously authorized return of 9.95%. The stipulation also included a capital structure and debt cost similar to those approved by the CPUC in March 2018 in connection with GSWC's water segment cost of capital proceeding. Because of the delay in finalizing the electric general rate case, billed electric revenues in 2018 were based on 2017 adopted rates, pending a final decision by the CPUC in this rate case application. Had the new rates in the settlement agreement been approved by the CPUC prior to December 31, 2018, the electric segment's gross margin would have increased by approximately $2.0 million, or $0.04 per share, for the year ended December 31, 2018. A decision in this case is expected in 2019 and when approved by the CPUC, the new rates will be retroactive to January 1, 2018. Accordingly, Registrant will record the 2018 increase to earnings in the period in which a CPUC decision is received.\nCost of Capital Proceeding for GSWC's Water Segment:\nIn March 2018, the CPUC issued a final decision in the cost of capital proceeding for GSWC and three other investor-owned water utilities that serve California. Among other things, the final decision adopts for GSWC (i) a return on equity of 8.90%, (ii) a cost of debt of 6.6%, (iii) a capital structure with 57% equity and 43% debt, (iv) a return on rate base of 7.91%, and (v) the continuation of the water cost of capital adjustment mechanism. GSWC's prior authorized return on equity and equity ratio for its water segment were 9.43% and 55%, respectively, with a return on rate base of 8.34%. The newly authorized return on rate base of 7.91% reflects a true-up of GSWC's embedded debt cost from 6.99% to 6.60%. The reduced debt costs contributed approximately 18 basis points to the 43-basis-point drop in the authorized return on rate base.\nTax Cuts and Jobs Act (\"Tax Act\"):\nOn December 22, 2017, the Tax Act was signed into federal law. The provisions of this major tax reform were generally effective January 1, 2018. The most significant provisions of the Tax Act impacting GSWC are the reduction of the federal corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21% and the elimination of bonus depreciation for regulated utilities. As a result, for the year ended December 31, 2018, the water-revenue requirement was reduced by approximately $12.5 million as compared to 2017 as a result of the Tax Act, which was largely offset by a decrease in income tax expense, resulting in no material impact to earnings. Pursuant to a CPUC directive, the 2018 impact of the Tax Act on the water adopted revenue requirement was tracked in a memorandum account effective January 1, 2018. On July 1, 2018, new lower water rates, which incorporate the new federal income tax rate, were implemented for all water ratemaking areas. As of December 31, 2018, GSWC had an over-collection of $7.1 million related to the water segment tracked and recorded as a regulatory liability.\nThe CPUC also ordered GSWC to update its pending electric general rate case filing, which will determine new electric rates for the years 2018 - 2021, to reflect the lower federal corporate income tax rate. For the year ended December 31, 2018, GSWC reduced electric revenues by approximately $1.2 million, which was also largely offset by a corresponding decrease in income tax expense, resulting in no material impact to earnings.\nOther Regulatory Matters\nApplication to Transfer Electric Utility Operations to New Subsidiary:\nOn December 14, 2018, GSWC filed an application with the CPUC to effectuate a reorganization plan that would transfer BVES from a division of GSWC to Bear Valley Electric Service, Inc. ( BVES Inc.\u201d), a newly created separate legal entity and stand-alone subsidiary of AWR. Due to the differences in operations, regulations and risks, management believes a separate electric legal entity and stand-alone subsidiary of AWR is in the best interests of customers, employees, and the communities served. This reorganization plan is subject to CPUC approval and, if approved, is not expected to result in a substantive change to Registrant's operations and business segments. In February 2019, the City of Big Bear Lake filed a protest to the application, to which GSWC filed reply comments with the CPUC. The CPUC has not established a timeline for its review of the application.\nFor more information regarding significant regulatory matters, see Note 3 of Notes to Financial Statements\u201d included in Part II, Item 8, in Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\nEnvironmental Matters\nAWR's subsidiaries are subject to stringent environmental regulations, including the 1996 amendments to the Federal Safe Drinking Water Act. GSWC is required to comply with the safe drinking water standards established by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency ( U.S. EPA\u201d) and the Division of Drinking Water (\"DDW\"), under the State Water Resources Control Board (\"SWRCB\"). The U.S. EPA regulates contaminants that may have adverse health effects that are known or likely to occur at levels of public health concern, and the regulation of which will provide a meaningful opportunity for health risk reduction. The DDW, acting on behalf of the U.S. EPA, administers the U.S. EPA's program in California. Similar state agencies administer these rules in the other states in which Registrant operates.\nGSWC currently tests its water supplies and water systems according to, among other things, requirements listed in the Federal Safe Drinking Water Act ( SDWA\u201d). GSWC works proactively with third parties and governmental agencies to address issues relating to known contamination threatening GSWC water sources. GSWC also incurs operating costs for testing to determine the levels, if any, of the constituents in its sources of supply and additional expense to treat contaminants in order to meet the federal and state maximum contaminant level standards and consumer demands. GSWC expects to incur additional capital costs as well as increased operating costs to maintain or improve the quality of water delivered to its customers in light of anticipated stress on water resources associated with watershed and aquifer pollution, as well as to meet future water quality standards and consumer expectations. The CPUC ratemaking process provides GSWC with the opportunity to recover prudently incurred capital and operating costs in future filings associated with achieving water quality standards. Management believes that such incurred and expected future costs should be authorized for recovery by the CPUC.\nMatters Relating to Environmental Cleanup\nGSWC has been involved in environmental remediation and cleanup at a plant site ( Chadron Plant\u201d) that contained an underground storage tank that was used to store gasoline for its vehicles. This tank was removed from the ground in July 1990 along with the dispenser and ancillary piping. Since then, GSWC has been involved in various remediation activities at this site.\nAs of December 31, 2018, the total spent to cleanup and remediate GSWC's plant facility was approximately $5.9 million, of which $1.5 million has been paid by the State of California Underground Storage Tank Fund. Amounts paid by GSWC have been included in rate base and approved by the CPUC for recovery. As of December 31, 2018, GSWC has a regulatory asset and an accrued liability for the estimated additional cost of $1.3 million to complete the cleanup at the site. The estimate includes costs for continued activities of groundwater cleanup and monitoring, future soil treatment, and site closure related activities. The ultimate cost may vary as there are many unknowns in remediation of underground gasoline spills and this is an estimate based on currently available information. Management also believes it is probable that the estimated additional costs will be approved for inclusion in rate base by the CPUC.\nLead Testing in Schools\nIn January 2017, California State Water Resources Control Board - Division of Drinking Water (DDW) issued a permit amendment that required all community water systems to test the schools in their service area for lead, if sampling is requested in writing by the institution's officials. In addition, the Governor of California signed an assembly bill, which requires all community water systems that serve a school site of a local educational agency with a building constructed before January 1, 2010, to test for lead in the potable water system of the school site on or before July 1, 2019. GSWC has been working extensively with the schools in its service areas for the last several months. As a result of concerted outreach to the schools, GSWC has completed lead sampling at approximately 88 percent of the schools in its service area as of December 31, 2018, as compared to the State average of 35 percent. GSWC will continue to work with the remaining schools in its service area to meet the July 1, 2019 deadline. Management cannot predict if all schools will cooperate and complete the testing, and as a result cannot predict complete compliance with this regulation by the deadline.\nMatters Relating to Military Privatization Contracts\nEach of the Military Utility Privatization Subsidiaries is responsible for testing the water and wastewater systems on the military bases on which it operates in accordance with applicable law.\nEach of the Military Utility Privatization Subsidiaries has the right to seek an equitable adjustment to its contract in the event that there are changes in environmental laws, a change in the quality of water used in providing water service or wastewater discharged by the U.S. government, or contamination of the air or soil not caused by the fault or negligence of the Military Utility Privatization Subsidiary. These changes can impact operations and maintenance and renewal and replacement costs under the contracts. The U.S. government is responsible for environmental contamination due to its fault or negligence and for environmental contamination that occurred prior to the execution of a contract.\nSecurity Issues\nGSWC has security systems and infrastructure in place intended to prevent unlawful intrusion, service disruption and cyber-attacks. GSWC utilizes a variety of physical security measures to protect its facilities. GSWC also considers advances in security and emergency preparedness technology and relevant industry developments in developing its capital-improvement plans. GSWC intends to seek approval of the CPUC to recover any additional costs that it incurs in enhancing the security, reliability and resiliency of its water and electric systems.\nThe Military Utility Privatization Subsidiaries operate facilities within the boundaries of military bases which provide limited access to the general public. To further enhance security, in prior years, certain upgrades were completed at various military bases through contract modifications funded by the U.S. government.\nRegistrant has evaluated its cyber-security systems and continues to address identified areas of improvement with respect to U.S. government regulations regarding cyber-security of government contractors. These improvements include the physical security at all of the office and employee facilities it operates. Registrant believes it is in compliance with these regulations.\nDespite its efforts, Registrant cannot guarantee that intrusions, cyber-attacks or other attacks will not cause water or electric system problems, disrupt service to customers, compromise important data or systems, or result in unintended release of customer or employee information.\nDrought Impact\nIn May 2018, the California Legislature passed two bills that provide a framework for long-term water-use efficiency standards and drought planning and resiliency. The initial steps in implementation of this legislation has been laid out in a summary document by the California Department of Water Resources (\"DWR\") and State Water Resources Control Board (\"SWQCB\"). Over the next several years, State agencies, water suppliers and other entities will be working to meet the requirements and timelines of plan implementation. A notable milestone is the establishment of indoor water use standard of 55 gallons per capita per day (gpcd) until 2025 at which time the standard may be reduced to 52.5 gpcd or a new standard as recommend by DWR.\nCalifornia's recent period of multi-year drought resulted in reduced recharge to the state's groundwater basins. GSWC utilizes groundwater from numerous groundwater basins throughout the state. Several of these basins, especially smaller basins, experienced lower groundwater levels because of the drought. Several of GSWC's service areas rely on groundwater as their only source of supply. Given the critical nature of the groundwater levels in California's Central Coast area, GSWC implemented mandatory water restrictions in certain service areas, in accordance with CPUC procedures. In the event of water supply shortages beyond the locally available supply, GSWC would need to transport additional water from other areas, increasing the cost of water supply.\nThe 2017-2018 water year was a dry year, with rainfall in northern California being below normal levels. However, precipitation to date in 2019 has been at or above normal levels with statewide snowpack at above 100% of average.\nAs of February 19, 2019, the U.S. Drought Monitor estimated less than 2 percent of California in the rank of Severe Drought\u201d while approximately 4 percent continued in the rank of Moderate Drought.\u201d This is in comparison to February 20, 2018 when approximately 20 percent of the State was considered in a Severe Drought\u201d and 48 percent was considered in \"Moderate Drought\". If dry conditions return, the SWQCB or other regulatory agencies may impose emergency drought actions.\nGSWC's Water Supply\nDuring 2018, GSWC delivered approximately 63.3 million hundred cubic feet ( ccf\u201d) of water to its customers, which is an average of about 398 acre-feet per day (an acre-foot is approximately 435.6 ccf or 326,000 gallons). Approximately 56% of GSWC's supply came from groundwater production wells situated throughout GSWC's service areas. GSWC supplemented its groundwater production with wholesale purchases from Metropolitan Water District (\"MWD\") member agencies and regional water suppliers (roughly 41% of total demand) and with authorized diversions from rivers (roughly 3%) under contracts with the United States Bureau of Reclamation ( Bureau\u201d) and the Sacramento Municipal Utility District ( SMUD\u201d). GSWC also utilizes recycled water supplies to serve recycled water customers in several service areas. During 2017, GSWC supplied 62.2 million ccf of water, approximately 55% of which was produced from groundwater sources and 45% was purchased from regional wholesalers and surface water diversions under contracts with the Bureau and SMUD. GSWC continually assesses its water rights and groundwater storage assets.\nGroundwater\nOver the years, population growth in GSWC's service areas and increases in the amount of groundwater used have resulted in both cooperative and judicially enforced regimes for owning water rights and managing groundwater basins for\nlong-term sustainability. GSWC management actively participates in efforts to protect groundwater basins from over-use and from contamination and to protect its water rights. In some periods, these efforts require reductions in groundwater pumping and increased reliance on alternative water resources.\nGSWC has a diverse water supply portfolio which includes approximately 73,400 acre-feet of adjudicated groundwater rights, surface water rights, and a number of unadjudicated water rights to help meet supply requirements. The productivity of GSWC's groundwater resources varies from year to year depending upon a variety of factors, including the amount, duration, length and location of rainfall, the availability of imported replenishment water, the amount of water previously stored in groundwater basins, the amount and seasonality of water use by GSWC's customers and others, evolving challenges to water quality, and a variety of legal limitations on use if a groundwater basin is, or may be, in an overdrafted condition.\nOn September 16, 2014, the Governor of California signed a package of three bills, which taken together are known as the Sustainable Groundwater Management Act.\u201d The purpose of the act is to provide local agencies with tools and authority to manage groundwater basins in a sustainable manner over the long term. Local Groundwater Sustainability Agencies\u201d are to be formed for each defined groundwater basin, and Groundwater Sustainability Plans must be completed for those basins by the year 2022 (by 2020 for those considered in critical overdraft). The act contains numerous provisions to protect existing water rights, and is not anticipated to infringe upon or otherwise alter existing surface water or groundwater rights under current law. GSWC intends to cooperate to the fullest extent allowed in the development of these Groundwater Sustainability Agencies and resulting Groundwater Sustainability Plans to protect its interests in proper management of these groundwater basins.\nMetropolitan Water District /State Water Project\nWater supplies available to the MWD through the State Water Project (\"SWP\") vary from year to year based on several factors. Historically, weather was the primary factor in determining annual deliveries. However, biological opinions issued in late 2007 have limited water diversions through the Sacramento/San Joaquin Delta ( Delta\u201d) resulting in pumping restrictions on the SWP. Even with variable SWP deliveries, MWD has been able to provide sufficient quantities of water to satisfy the needs of its member agencies and their customers. Under its Integrated Resources Plan, MWD estimates that it can meet its member agencies' demands over at least the next 20 years.\nEvery year, the California Department of Water Resources (\"DWR\") establishes the SWP allocation for water deliveries to the state water contractors. The SWP is a major source of water for the MWD. DWR generally establishes a percentage allocation of delivery requests based on a number of factors, including weather patterns, snow-pack levels, reservoir levels and biological diversion restrictions. In February 2019, DWR set an initial SWP delivery allocation at 35% of requests for the 2019 calendar year. This allocation will likely change depending on rain and snowfall received this winter.\nImported Water\nGSWC also manages a portfolio of water supply arrangements with water wholesalers who may import water from outside the immediate service area. For example, GSWC has contracts with various governmental entities (principally MWD member agencies) and other parties to purchase water through a total of 61 connections for distribution to customers, in addition to numerous emergency connections. MWD is a public agency organized and managed to provide a supplemental, imported supply to its member public agencies. There are 26 such member agencies, consisting of 14 cities, 11 municipal water districts and one county water authority. GSWC has 45 connections to MWD's water distribution facilities and those of member agencies. GSWC purchases MWD water through six separate member agencies aggregating 49,807 acre-feet annually. MWD's principal source of water is the SWP and the Colorado River via the Colorado River Aqueduct.\nGSWC has contracts to purchase water or water rights for an aggregate amount of $4.4 million as of December 31, 2018. Included in the $4.4 million is a remaining commitment of $2.2 million under an agreement with the City of Claremont ( the City\u201d) to lease water rights that were ascribed to the City as part of the Six Basins adjudication. The initial term of the agreement expires in 2028. GSWC may exercise an option to renew this agreement for 10 additional years. The remaining $2.2 million is for commitments for purchased water with other third parties, which expire through 2038.\nMilitary Utility Privatization Subsidiaries\nThe U.S. government is responsible for providing the source of supply for all water on each of the bases served by the Military Utility Privatization Subsidiaries at no cost to the Military Utility Privatization Subsidiaries. Once received from the U.S. government, ASUS is responsible for ensuring the continued compliance of the provided source of supply with all federal, state and local regulations.\nNew Accounting Pronouncements\nRegistrant is subject to newly issued requirements as well as changes in existing requirements issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board. See Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.", "item_7_text": "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operation\nThe following discussion and analysis provides information on AWR's consolidated operations and assets, and, where necessary, includes specific references to AWR's individual segments and/or its subsidiaries: GSWC and ASUS and its subsidiaries. Included in the following analysis is a discussion of water and electric gross margins. Water and electric gross margins are computed by subtracting total supply costs from total revenues. Registrant uses these gross margins as important measures in evaluating its operating results. Registrant believes these measures are useful internal benchmarks in evaluating the performance of GSWC.\nThe discussions and tables included in the following analysis also present Registrant's operations in terms of earnings per share by business segment. Registrant believes that the disclosure of earnings per share by business segment provides investors with clarity surrounding the performance of its different services. Registrant reviews these measurements regularly and compares them to historical periods and to its operating budget. Furthermore, the discussion refers to a non-core business activity related to gains and losses on Registrant's investments held to fund a retirement benefit plan, which is excluded when communicating earnings results to help facilitate comparisons of the Company's performance from period to period. However, all of these measures, which are not presented in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles ( GAAP\u201d), may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other enterprises and should not be considered as an alternative to operating income or earnings per share, which are determined in accordance with GAAP. A reconciliation of water and electric gross margins to the most directly comparable GAAP measures is included in the table under the section titled Operating Expenses: Supply Costs.\u201d Reconciliations to AWR's diluted earnings per share are included in the discussions under the sections titled Summary Results by Segment.\u201d\nOverview\nFactors affecting our financial performance are summarized under Forward-Looking Information.\nWater and Electric Segments:\nGSWC's revenues, operating income and cash flows are earned primarily through delivering potable water to homes and businesses in California and the delivery of electricity in the Big Bear area of San Bernardino County, California. Rates charged to GSWC customers are determined by the CPUC. These rates are intended to allow recovery of operating costs and a reasonable rate of return on capital. GSWC plans to continue to seek additional rate increases in future years from the CPUC to recover operating and supply costs and receive reasonable returns on invested capital. Capital expenditures in future years at GSWC are expected to remain at higher levels than depreciation expense. When necessary, GSWC obtains funds from external sources in the capital markets and through bank borrowings.\nPending General Rate Case Filings:\nWater Segment:\nIn July 2017, GSWC filed a general rate case application for its water regions and the general office. The general rate case will determine new water rates for the years 2019 through 2021. On August 15, 2018, GSWC and the CPUC's Public Advocates Office, formerly the Office of Ratepayer Advocates, filed a joint motion to adopt a settlement agreement between GSWC and the Public Advocates Office in connection with the general rate case. If approved by the CPUC, the settlement would resolve all of the issues in the general rate case application and authorize GSWC to invest approximately $334.5 million in capital infrastructure over the three-year rate cycle. The $334.5 million of infrastructure investment, as settled, includes $20.4 million of capital projects to be filed for revenue recovery through advice letters when those projects are completed.\nExcluding the advice-letter-project revenues, the water gross margin for 2019 in the settlement filing is expected to increase by approximately $6.0 million as compared to the 2018 adopted water gross margin. The 2019 water revenue requirement, as settled, has been reduced to reflect a decrease of approximately $7.0 million in depreciation expense, compared to the adopted 2018 depreciation expense, due to a reduction in the overall composite depreciation rates based on a revised study filed in the general rate case. The decrease in depreciation expense lowers the water gross margin, and is offset by a corresponding decrease in depreciation expense, resulting in no impact to net earnings. In addition, the 2019 water revenue requirement, as settled, includes a decrease of approximately $2.2 million for excess deferred tax refunds as a result of the Tax Act, which has a corresponding decrease in income tax expense and also results in no impact to net earnings. Had depreciation expense, as settled, remained the same as the 2018 adopted amount and there was no excess deferred tax refund that lowered the 2019 revenue requirement, the water gross margin for 2019 would have increased by approximately $15.2 million. The settlement also allows for potential additional water revenue increases in 2020 and 2021 of approximately $10.0 million and $12.0 million, respectively, subject to the results of an earnings test and changes to the forecasted inflationary index values.\nGSWC and the Public Advocates Office informed the assigned Administrative Law Judge (\"ALJ\u201d) that hearings would not be needed in light of the settlement agreement. Subsequently, the ALJ issued a ruling requesting additional information on\na number of items in the general rate case. GSWC has provided the additional information requested by the ALJ and believes it has satisfied all of the questions raised. Both the ALJ's request and GSWC's response are public information. GSWC is awaiting a proposed decision by the ALJ, which is expected during the first quarter of 2019, with a final decision by the CPUC expected later in 2019. When approved, the new rates will be retroactive to January 1, 2019.\nElectric Segment:\nIn May 2017, GSWC filed its electric general rate case application with the CPUC to determine new electric rates for the years 2018 through 2021. In November 2018, GSWC and the Public Advocates Office filed a joint motion to adopt a settlement agreement between the two parties resolving all issues in connection with the general rate case. Among other things, the settlement incorporates a previous stipulation in the case, which authorizes a new return on equity for GSWC's electric segment of 9.60%, as compared to its previously authorized return of 9.95%. The stipulation also included a capital structure and debt cost similar to those approved by the CPUC in March 2018 in connection with GSWC's water segment cost of capital proceeding, as discussed below. Because of the delay in finalizing the electric general rate case, billed electric revenues in 2018 were based on 2017 adopted rates, pending a final decision by the CPUC in this rate case application. Had the new rates in the settlement agreement been approved by the CPUC prior to December 31, 2018, the electric segment's gross margin would have increased by approximately $2.0 million, or $0.04 per share, for the year ended December 31, 2018. A decision in this case is expected in 2019, and when approved by the CPUC, the new rates will be retroactive to January 1, 2018. Accordingly, Registrant will record the 2018 increase to earnings in the period in which a CPUC decision is received.\nCost of Capital Proceeding for GSWC's Water Segment:\nIn March 2018, the CPUC issued a final decision in the cost of capital proceeding for GSWC and three other investor-owned water utilities that serve California. Among other things, the final decision adopts for GSWC (i) a return on equity of 8.90%, (ii) a cost of debt of 6.6%, (iii) a capital structure with 57% equity and 43% debt, (iv) a return on rate base of 7.91%, and (v) the continuation of the water cost of capital adjustment mechanism. GSWC's prior authorized return on equity and equity ratio for its water segment were 9.43% and 55%, respectively, with a return on rate base of 8.34%. The newly authorized return on rate base of 7.91% reflects a true-up of GSWC's embedded debt cost from 6.99% to 6.60%. The reduced debt costs contributed approximately 18 basis points to the 43-basis-point drop in the authorized return on rate base. The lower return on rate base beginning in 2018 decreased GSWC's 2018 adopted annual revenue requirement by approximately $3.6 million, or $0.07 per share.\nContracted Services Segment:\nASUS's revenues, operating income and cash flows are earned by providing water and/or wastewater services, including operation and maintenance services and construction of facilities at the water and/or wastewater systems at various military installations, pursuant to 50-year firm fixed-price contracts. The contract price for each of these 50-year contracts is subject to annual economic price adjustments. Additional revenues generated by contract operations are primarily dependent on new construction activities under contract modifications with the U.S. government or agreements with other third-party prime contractors.\nFort Riley:\nOn July 1, 2018, ASUS assumed the operation, maintenance and construction management of the water distribution and wastewater collection and treatment facilities at Fort Riley, a United States Army installation located in Kansas, after completing a transition period and a detailed inventory study. The contract was awarded by the U.S. government in September 2017 with a value of $681 million over a 50-year period. The 50-year contract is also subject to annual economic price adjustments.\nEglin Air Force Base ( Eglin AFB\u201d):\nOn June 15, 2017, ASUS assumed operations of the water and wastewater systems at Eglin AFB in Florida after completing a transition period and a detailed joint inventory study. The value of the 50-year contract is approximately $702.4 million. The contract is subject to annual economic price adjustments.\nWith the addition of Fort Riley and Eglin AFB, ASUS serves 11 military bases in the United Sates, including four of the largest military installations: Fort Bragg, Fort Bliss, Eglin AFB and Fort Riley.\nU.S. Government Shutdown:\nFrom December 22, 2018 until January 25, 2019, the U.S. government shutdown impacted non-essential government employees due to the lack of an approved appropriations bill to fund the operations of the federal government for fiscal year 2019. However, the shutdown did not have an impact on ASUS due to the fact that funding for military operations (including military bases) is provided by the Department of Defense, which is fully funded for fiscal 2019 and was not part of the government shutdown.\nTax Cuts and Jobs Act:\nOn December 22, 2017, the Tax Act was signed into federal law. The provisions of this major tax reform were generally effective January 1, 2018. The most significant provisions of the Tax Act impacting GSWC are the reduction of the federal corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21% and the elimination of bonus depreciation for regulated utilities. As a result, for the year ended December 31, 2018, the water-revenue requirement was lower by approximately $12.5 million as compared to 2017 as a result of the Tax Act, which was largely offset by a decrease in income tax expense, resulting in no material impact to net earnings. The CPUC also ordered GSWC to update its pending electric general rate case filing to reflect the lower federal corporate income tax rate. For the year ended December 31, 2018, GSWC reduced electric revenues by approximately $1.2 million, which was also largely offset by a corresponding decrease in income tax expense, resulting in no material impact to net earnings. In 2017, the Tax Act did have a negative impact on net earnings at the water segment as a result of remeasuring deferred tax balances to reflect the lower federal tax rate; however, that was mostly offset by an increase in net earnings at AWR (parent) and, to a lesser extent, at the other two business segments.\nIn addition to lowering customer rates, GSWC expects the Tax Act to reduce property-related deferred tax liabilities. Property-related deferred tax liabilities reduce GSWC's rate base. As new plant is placed in service, the lower federal corporate tax rate will result in lower deferred tax liabilities. As a result of the lower federal tax rate and elimination of bonus depreciation by the Tax Act, GSWC expects that its rate base and earnings will increase for the same level of expected capital expenditures. This increase is expected to be partially offset by higher financing costs arising from a greater need to fund capital expenditures through the issuance of debt and/or equity due to lower cash flows from operating activities.\nDuring the second and third quarter of 2018, the U.S. government issued contract modifications for the majority of ASUS's 50-year contracts addressing the impacts of the Tax Act. The modifications did not result in a material impact to ASUS's results for the year ended December 31, 2018.\nSummary Results by Segment\nThe table below sets forth diluted earnings per share by business segment for AWR's operations:\n\nWater Segment:\nIncluded in the results for the year ended December 31, 2017 were (i) the recognition of a pretax gain of $8.3 million, or $0.13 per share, on the sale of GSWC's Ojai water system in June of 2017, with no similar gain in 2018, and (ii) the recovery in February 2017 of incremental costs approved by the CPUC related to California's drought state of emergency that were previously expensed, and which resulted in an increase to pretax earnings in 2017 of $1.5 million, or $0.02 per share (approximately $1.2 million was reflected as a reduction to other operation expenses and approximately $260,000 was reflected as additional revenue). Furthermore, affecting the results and comparability between the two periods were losses incurred during 2018, as a result of market conditions, on Registrant's investments held to fund a retirement benefit plan as compared to gains recorded in 2017. This non-core business item decreased the water segment's earnings on a relative basis by approximately $0.05 per share.\nExcluding the impact of the items discussed above, diluted earnings from the water segment for 2018 increased by $0.04 per share as compared to 2017 due to the following items:\n \u2022 An overall increase in the water gross margin of $0.03 per share, largely due to revenues generated from CPUC-approved third-year rate increases effective January 1, 2018, partially offset by the effect of the cessation of the Ojai operations in June of 2017 and the revenue impact from the lower authorized return on rate base in the cost of capital proceeding approved by the CPUC and effective in 2018. The lower return on rate base decreased GSWC's 2018 adopted annual water revenue requirement by approximately $3.6 million, or $0.07 per share. \n \u2022 An increase in operating expenses (excluding supply costs) decreased earnings by approximately $0.04 per share due, in large part, to a reduction in legal costs of $1.8 million, or $0.03 per share, recorded in December 2017 for amounts received from the City of Claremont pursuant to a settlement agreement, with no similar item in the fourth quarter of 2018. Excluding this item, overall recurring operating expenses increased by approximately $0.01 per share due mostly to higher depreciation and property tax expenses, both of which are due to plant additions. \n \u2022 Excluding gains and losses from investments, there was an increase in interest and other income (net of interest expense), which increased earnings by approximately $0.01 per share due, in part, to interest income related to a federal tax refund recorded during the fourth quarter of 2018, partially offset by an increase in interest expense resulting from higher short-term borrowings to fund operations and a portion of GSWC's capital expenditures. \n \u2022 An overall decrease in the water segment's effective income tax rate (\"ETR\"), which positively impacted earnings by approximately $0.04 per share. The decrease in the ETR was due, in large part, to the unfavorable remeasurement adjustment recorded in December 2017 at the water segment related to certain non-rate-regulated deferred tax assets (primarily compensation- and benefit-related items) in connection with the Tax Act. The one-time remeasurement negatively impacted water net earnings in 2017 by approximately $0.03 per share. There was no similar adjustment in 2018. In addition, the water ETR was favorably impacted in 2018 by changes in flow-through adjustments recorded in accordance with regulatory requirements (primarily related to plant and compensation-related items).  The comparison between the two periods discussed above also excluded the reductions in water revenue in 2018 resulting from the Tax Act and billed surcharges, both of which had no material impact to earnings.\nElectric Segment:\nFor each of the years ended December 31, 2018, and 2017, diluted earnings from the electric segment were $0.11 per share. Due to the delay in the electric general rate case, billed revenues in 2018 were based on 2017 adopted rates, pending a final CPUC decision on the electric general rate case. In November 2018, GSWC and the CPUC's Public Advocates Office filed a joint motion to adopt a settlement agreement between the two parties resolving all issues in connection with the general rate case. A decision in this case is expected in 2019 and when approved by the CPUC, the new rates will be retroactive to January 1, 2018. Had the new rates in the settlement agreement been approved by the CPUC prior to December 31, 2018, the electric segment's gross margin would have been higher by approximately $2.0 million, or $0.04 per share, for the year ended December 31, 2018.\nContracted Services Segment:\nFor the year ended December 31, 2018, diluted earnings from contracted services were $0.42 per share, compared to $0.37 per share for the same period in 2017. Included in the results for 2017 were retroactive revenues resulting from the approval of the third price redetermination at Fort Bragg, which totaled approximately $1.0 million, or $0.02 per share, related to periods prior to 2017. Excluding this retroactive amount, diluted earnings per share from the contracted services segment increased $0.07 per share as compared to 2017, due largely to the commencement of operations at Eglin AFB and Fort Riley in June 2017 and July 2018, respectively. There was also an increase in management fee revenues at the other military bases resulting from the successful resolution of various price adjustments during 2017 and 2018. These increases were partially offset by lower construction activities at the military bases other than Eglin AFB and Fort Riley.\nAWR (parent):\nFor the year ended December 31, 2018, diluted earnings from AWR (parent) decreased $0.05 per share compared to 2017. Included in the results for 2017 was the one-time benefit from the remeasurement of the AWR (parent) deferred tax balances as a result of the Tax Act. This one-time remeasurement was based on the Tax Act's lower federal corporate tax rate of 21%, which increased earnings at AWR (parent) by approximately $0.03 per share during 2017. There was no similar adjustment in 2018. In addition, there were higher state unitary taxes recorded at the parent level during 2018 as compared to the same period in 2017.\nThe following discussion and analysis for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016 provides information on AWR's consolidated operations and assets and, where necessary, includes specific references to AWR's individual segments and subsidiaries: GSWC and ASUS and its subsidiaries.\nConsolidated Results of Operations - Years Ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 (amounts in thousands, except per share amounts): \nIn accordance with new accounting guidance, effective January 1, 2018, Registrant changed the financial statement presentation for the costs of its defined benefit pension plans and other retirement benefits. The components of net periodic benefits cost, other than the service cost component, have been included in the line item Other, net\u201d in Registrant's income statements. Amounts for 2017 have been reclassified on the income statements to conform to the current-period presentation.\nOperating Revenues\nGeneral\nRegistrant relies upon approvals by the CPUC of rate increases to recover operating expenses and to provide for a return on invested and borrowed capital used to fund utility plant for GSWC. Registrant relies on economic price adjustments and equitable adjustments by the U.S. government in order to recover operating expenses and provide a profit margin for ASUS. If adequate rate relief or adjustments are not granted in a timely manner, current operating revenues and earnings can be negatively impacted. ASUS's earnings are also impacted by the level of additional construction projects at the Military Utility Privatization Subsidiaries, which may or may not continue at current levels in future periods.\nWater\nFor the year ended December 31, 2018, revenues from water operations decreased by $11.1 million to $295.3 million, compared to $306.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. This decrease was primarily due to: (i) downward adjustments to water revenue which were largely offset by lower income tax expense, thus no material impact to earnings, as a result of the Tax Act, (ii) a lower authorized rate of return approved by the CPUC in the March 2018 final decision on the water cost of capital application, and (iii) decreases related to the expiration of various surcharges that were in place to recover previously incurred costs. These decreases in surcharge revenues were offset by a corresponding decrease in operating expenses (primarily administrative and general), resulting in no impact to earnings. These decreases in water revenue were partially offset by CPUC-approved third-year rate increases effective January 1, 2018. There were also CPUC-approved rate increases to cover increases in supply costs experienced in most ratemaking areas, which were largely offset by a corresponding increase in supply costs, resulting in an immaterial impact to earnings.\nBilled water consumption for the year ended December 31, 2018 increased approximately 3% as compared to 2017. In general, changes in consumption do not have a significant impact on recorded revenues due to the CPUC-approved WRAM accounts in place in the majority of GSWC's rate-making areas. GSWC records the difference between what it bills its water customers and that which is authorized by the CPUC in the WRAM accounts as regulatory assets or liabilities.\nElectric\nFor the year ended December 31, 2018, revenues from electric operations were $34.4 million as compared to $34.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. This slight increase was primarily due to rate increases generated from advice letter projects approved by the CPUC in 2017 and 2018. Due to the delay in the electric general rate case, 2018 billed revenues have been based on 2017 adopted rates, pending a final CPUC decision which is expected later in 2019.\nBilled electric usage for the year ended December 31, 2018 increased slightly as compared to the same period in 2017. Due to the CPUC-approved base revenue requirement adjustment mechanism (\"BRRAM\"), which adjusts base revenues to adopted levels authorized by the CPUC, changes in usage do not have a significant impact on earnings.\nContracted Services\nRevenues from contracted services are composed of construction revenues (including renewal and replacements) and management fees for operating and maintaining the water and/or wastewater systems at various military bases. For the year ended December 31, 2018, revenues from contracted services were $107.2 million as compared to $100.3 million for 2017. Included in revenues for 2017 was approximately $1.0 million in retroactive management fees related to periods prior to 2017. The increase in revenues was due to the commencement of operations at Eglin AFB in June 2017 and at Fort Riley in July 2018.\nASUS's subsidiaries continue to enter into U.S. government-awarded contract modifications and agreements with third-party prime contractors for new construction projects at the military bases served. During 2018, ASUS was awarded approximately $24 million in new construction projects, the majority of which are expected to be completed during 2019. Earnings and cash flows from modifications to the original 50-year contracts with the U.S. government and agreements with third-party prime contractors for additional construction projects may or may not continue in future periods.\nOperating Expenses:\nSupply Costs\nSupply costs for the water segment consist of purchased water, purchased power for pumping, groundwater production assessments and changes in the water supply cost balancing accounts. Supply costs for the electric segment consist of purchased power for resale, the cost of natural gas used by BVES's generating unit, the cost of renewable energy credits and changes in the electric supply cost balancing account. Water and electric gross margins are computed by subtracting total supply costs from total revenues. Registrant uses these gross margins and related percentages as an important measure in evaluating its operating results. Registrant believes these measures are useful internal benchmarks in evaluating the utility business performance within its water and electric segments. Registrant reviews these measurements regularly and compares them to historical periods and to its operating budget. However, these measures, which are not presented in accordance with GAAP, may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other enterprises and should not be considered as an alternative to operating income, which is determined in accordance with GAAP.\nTotal supply costs comprise the largest segment of total operating expenses. Supply costs accounted for 27.8% and 28.1% of total operating expenses for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. The table below provides the amounts (in thousands) of increases (decreases) and percent changes in water and electric revenues, supply costs and gross margins during the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017. As previously discussed, water and electric revenues for the year ended December 31, 2018 were $12.5 million and $1.2 million lower, respectively, as compared to 2017 due to the effects of the Tax Act, but had no significant impact to earnings due to a corresponding decrease in water and electric income tax expense. Furthermore, there was a decrease in surcharges of $3.7 million recorded in water revenues to recover previously incurred costs, which also did not impact water earnings. Surcharges to recover previously incurred costs are recorded to revenues when billed to customers and are offset by a corresponding amount in operating expenses (primarily administrative and general), resulting in no impact to earnings.\n\n \n(1) As reported on AWR's Consolidated Statements of Income, except for supply-cost-balancing accounts. The sums of water and electric supply-cost balancing accounts in the table above are shown on AWR's Consolidated Statements of Income and totaled $(15.6) million and $(17.9) million for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. Revenues include surcharges that have no net earnings impact because they increase both revenues and operating expenses by corresponding amounts.\n(2) Water and electric gross margins do not include depreciation and amortization, maintenance, administrative and general, property and other taxes, and other operation expenses.\nTwo of the principal factors affecting water supply costs are the amount of water produced and the source of the water. Generally, the variable cost of producing water from wells is less than the cost of water purchased from wholesale suppliers. Under the CPUC-approved Modified Cost Balancing Account (\"MCBA\"), GSWC tracks adopted and actual expense levels for\npurchased water, power purchased for pumping and pump taxes. GSWC records the variances (which include the effects of changes in both rate and volume) between adopted and actual purchased water, purchased power and pump tax expenses. GSWC recovers from or refunds to customers the amount of such variances. GSWC tracks these variances individually for each water ratemaking area.\nThe overall actual percentages for purchased water for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 were 41% and 42%, respectively, as compared to the adopted percentages of 28% for both 2018 and 2017. The higher actual percentages of purchased water as compared to adopted percentages resulted primarily from several wells being out of service. Purchased water costs for the year ended December 31, 2018 increased to $68.9 million as compared to $68.3 million for the same period in 2017 primarily due to an increase in customer usage, as well as an increase in wholesale water costs as compared to the year ended December 31, 2017.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2018, the cost of power purchased for pumping increased to $9.0 million as compared to $8.5 million for the same period in 2017 primarily due to an increase in customer usage as well increases in electric rates.\nGroundwater production assessments were $19.4 million in 2018 as compared to $18.6 million in 2017 due to an increase in pump tax rates during 2018 as compared to 2017.\nThe under-collection in the water supply cost balancing account decreased $3.2 million during the year ended December 31, 2018 as compared to the same period in 2017 due to the CPUC-approved rate increases to cover increases in supply costs experienced in most ratemaking areas. This increase to revenues was largely offset by a corresponding increase in supply costs, which reduces the under-collection in the water supply cost balancing account.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2018, the cost of power purchased for resale to BVES's customers was $11.6 million as compared to $10.7 million for the same period in 2017. The average price per megawatt-hour (\"MWh\"), including fixed costs, increased to $79.90 per MWh in 2018 from $73.03 per MWh for the year ended December 31, 2017.\nOther Operation\nThe primary components of other operation expenses for GSWC include payroll, materials and supplies, chemicals and water-treatment costs, and outside service costs of operating the regulated water and electric systems, including the costs associated with transmission and distribution, pumping, water quality, meter reading, billing, and operations of district offices. Registrant's contracted services operations incur many of the same types of expenses. For the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, other operation expenses by business segment consisted of the following amounts (in thousands):\n\nIn 2017, the CPUC approved the recovery of $1.2 million in incremental drought-related costs, which was recorded during the first quarter of 2017 as a regulatory asset with a corresponding decrease mostly to other operation-related expenses at the water segment. There was no similar reduction recorded in 2018. Excluding the impact of this recovery, as well as changes in billed surcharges which have no impact to earnings, other operation expenses at the water segment decreased overall by approximately $459,000 due, in large part, to lower conservation costs incurred compared to 2017.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2018, total other operation expenses at the electric segment increased mainly due to higher labor-related costs.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2018, total other operation expenses for the contracted services segment increased mainly due to the commencement of operations at Fort Riley on July 1, 2018, including transition costs.\nAdministrative and General\nAdministrative and general expenses include payroll related to administrative and general functions, the related employee benefits, insurance expenses, outside legal and consulting fees, regulatory utility commission expenses, expenses associated with being a public company and general corporate expenses charged to expense accounts. For the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, administrative and general expenses by business segment, including AWR (parent), consisted of the following amounts (in thousands):\n\nFor the year ended December 31, 2018, there was a decrease of $2.9 million in surcharges billed to customers to recover previously incurred administrative and general costs approved by the CPUC. This decrease was offset by a corresponding decrease in administrative and general expense to reflect the recovery of these costs, resulting in no impact to earnings. Excluding the decrease in billed surcharges, administrative and general expenses at the water segment increased by $1.7 million due primarily to the receipt of $1.8 million in December 2017 for reimbursement of litigation costs pursuant to a settlement agreement, which were reflected as a reduction to legal expenses in 2017. There was no similar reduction recorded in 2018. Overall, other administrative and general expenses remained relatively flat compared to 2017.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2018, administrative and general expenses for the electric segment increased by $1.0 million as compared to 2017 due to an increase in regulatory, legal and outside services costs.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2018, administrative and general expenses for contracted services increased by $1.3 million due primarily to the commencement of operations at Eglin AFB and at Fort Riley in 2017 and 2018, respectively, as well as an increase in labor-related costs.\nDepreciation and Amortization\nFor the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, depreciation and amortization expense by segment consisted of the following amounts (in thousands):\n\nFor the year ended December 31, 2018, depreciation and amortization expense increased due to fixed asset additions for all business segments during 2018. The increase in fixed assets for contracted services was due to the purchase of transportation and other equipment.\nMaintenance\nFor the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, maintenance expense by segment consisted of the following amounts (in thousands):\n\nMaintenance expense for the electric segment increased due to higher fire prevention and tree-trimming maintenance work performed in 2018 as compared to 2017.\nMaintenance expense for contracted services increased due primarily to the commencement of operations at Eglin AFB and Fort Riley in 2017 and 2018, respectively.\nProperty and Other Taxes\nFor the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, property and other taxes by segment, consisted of the following amounts (in thousands):\n\nProperty and other taxes increased overall by $499,000 during 2018 as compared to 2017 primarily due to capital additions and the associated higher assessed property values.\nASUS Construction\nFor the year ended December 31, 2018, construction expenses for contracted services were $53.9 million, increasing by $4.1 million compared to the same period in 2017 due to the commencement of operations at Eglin AFB and Fort Riley in 2017 and 2018, respectively.\nGain on Sale of Assets\nIn June 2017, GSWC completed the sale of its Ojai water system to Casitas Municipal Water District for $34.3 million, resulting in a pretax gain of $8.3 million on the sale of the assets.\nInterest Expense\nFor the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, interest expense by segment, including AWR (parent), consisted of the following amounts (in thousands):\n\nOverall, interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2018 increased by $851,000 as compared to the same period in 2017 due largely to higher average borrowings as well as higher interest rates on the revolving credit facility as compared to 2017. The borrowings were used to fund operations and a portion of capital expenditures. There was also an increase in interest expense related to an increase in regulatory liabilities as compared to the same period in 2017.\nInterest Income\nFor the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, interest income by business segment, including AWR (parent), consisted of the following amounts (in thousands): \n* not meaningful\nInterest income increased by $1.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 as compared to the same period in 2017 due primarily to interest income related to a federal tax refund recorded in 2018. The increase in interest income at the contracted services segment was due to Registrant's adoption of ASC Topic 606 (Revenues from Contracts with Customers) on January 1, 2018 using the modified retrospective approach. As a result of this adoption, certain funds received by the contracted services segment from the U.S. government during 2018 have been recorded as interest income. Prior to the adoption of ASC Topic 606, these funds were recorded as revenues.\nOther, net\nFor the year ended December 31, 2018, other income decreased by $1.3 million primarily due to losses recorded on investments held for a retirement benefit plan resulting from unfavorable market conditions in 2018, as compared to gains recorded in 2017. This was partially offset by a decrease in the non-service cost components of net periodic benefit costs related to Registrant's defined benefit pension plans and other retirement benefits. However, as a result of GSWC's pension balancing account authorized by the CPUC, changes in net periodic benefit costs are mostly offset by corresponding changes in revenues, having no material impact to earnings.\nIncome Tax Expense\nFor the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, income tax expense by segment, including AWR (parent), consisted of the following amounts (in thousands):\n\nConsolidated income tax expense for the year ended December 31, 2018 decreased by $21.0 million primarily due to a lower effective income tax rate (\"ETR\") from the Tax Act. AWR's consolidated ETR was 22.0% and 36.0% for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. The ETR for GSWC was 22.1% for 2018 as compared to 38.8% for 2017. For all segments, the lower income tax expense resulting from the Tax Act was due primarily to the reduction in the federal corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21%, which was largely offset by corresponding decreases in revenues, resulting in an immaterial impact to 2018 net earnings.\nConsolidated Results of Operations - Years Ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 (amounts in thousands, except per share amounts): \n* not applicable\nIn accordance with new accounting guidance, effective January 1, 2018, Registrant changed the financial statement presentation for the costs of its defined benefit pension plans and other retirement benefits. The components of net periodic benefits cost, other than the service cost component, have been included in the line item Other, net\u201d in Registrant's income statements. Previously reported amounts for 2017 and 2016 have been reclassified on the income statements to conform to the current-period presentation.\nSummary Results by Segment\nThe table below sets forth diluted earnings per share by business segment for AWR's operations:\n\nWater Segment:\nFor the year ended December 31, 2017, fully diluted earnings per share for the water segment increased by $0.18 per share to $1.35 per share, as compared to $1.17 per share for 2016 due, in large part, to the one-time $0.13 per share pretax gain on the sale of Ojai assets in June 2017. In addition, in February 2017, the CPUC approved recovery of incremental costs related to California's drought state of emergency, which were previously expensed. As a result of this approval, during the first quarter of 2017, GSWC recorded a regulatory asset and a corresponding increase to pretax earnings of $1.5 million, or $0.02 per share, of which $1.2 million was reflected as a reduction to other operation expenses and approximately $260,000 was reflected as additional revenue. Furthermore, affecting the results and comparability between the two periods were higher gains recorded in 2017 on Registrant's investments held to fund a retirement benefit plan as compared to 2016. This non-core business item increased the water segment's earnings on a relative basis by approximately $0.02 per share.\nExcluding the impact of the items discussed above and an increase in billed surcharges which have no impact to earnings, diluted earnings from the water segment for 2017 increased by $0.01 per share as compared to 2016 due to the following items, which impacted the comparability between the two periods:\n \u2022 A decrease in operating expenses (excluding supply costs) increased earnings by approximately $0.05 per share due, in large part, to a reduction in legal costs of $1.8 million, or $0.03 per share, recorded in December 2017 for amounts received from the City of Claremont pursuant to a settlement agreement. Excluding this item, overall operating expenses decreased by $0.02 per share due mostly to lower maintenance costs, and incurring only a partial year of Ojai-related operating expenses as a result of the sale. These decreases were partially offset by higher medical insurance costs, conservation costs, general rate-case-related expenses and property and other taxes, as well as an $800,000 reduction in operating expenses recorded in the fourth quarter of 2016 as a result of the CPUC's water general rate case decision, which granted recovery of previously incurred costs tracked in memorandum accounts. \n \u2022 Excluding gains and losses on investments, there was an increase in interest and other income (net of interest expense), which increased earnings by approximately $0.01 per share, due primarily to (i) higher interest income on GSWC's regulatory assets resulting mostly from an increase in the 90-day commercial paper rate, and (ii) amounts collected from developers on certain outstanding balances owed to GSWC.  The increase in diluted earnings from the water segment discussed above were partially offset by the following:\n \u2022 An overall decrease in the water gross margin of $2.3 million, or $0.03 per share, largely due to the cessation of Ojai operations in June 2017. This was partially offset by revenues generated from CPUC-approved second-year rate increases effective January 1, 2017. \n \u2022 An overall increase in the water segment's effective income tax rate (\"ETR\"), which negatively impacted water earnings by approximately $0.02 per share. The increase in the ETR was due, in large part, to the remeasurement of certain non-rate-regulated deferred tax assets (primarily compensation- and benefit-related items) in connection with the Tax Act, which negatively impacted water earnings by approximately $0.03 per share. This was partially offset by changes in flow-through and permanent items at the water segment. \nElectric Segment:\nFor the year ended December 31, 2017, diluted earnings from the electric segment increased by $0.01 per share as compared to the same period in 2016. Operating expenses (other than supply costs) decreased by $1.2 million primarily due to additional costs incurred in 2016 in response to power outages caused by severe winter storms experienced in January 2016, lower regulatory costs, and lower costs associated with energy efficiency and solar power programs approved by the CPUC. There was also a decrease in the effective income tax rate for the electric segment as compared to the same period in 2016 resulting primarily from changes in flow-through items. These increases to earnings were partially offset by a lower electric gross margin, which was due mostly to a downward adjustment in the electric revenue requirement to reflect updated allocations from the general office as a result of the decision in the water general rate case.\nContracted Services Segment:\nFor the year ended December 31, 2017, diluted earnings from contracted services were $0.37 per share, compared to $0.33 per share for the same period in 2016. There was an increase in management fee revenues from the successful resolution of various price adjustments and asset transfers received during 2016 and 2017. This includes approximately $1.0 million, or $0.02 per share, of retroactive management fees recorded in 2017 which related to periods prior to 2017, as compared to $421,000, or $0.01 per share, of retroactive management fees recorded in 2016 which related to periods prior to 2016. There was also an increase in management fees and construction revenues generated from the operations at Eglin Air Force Base (\"Eglin AFB\"), which began in June 2017. These increases to earnings were partially offset by higher operating costs due to transition activities and joint inventory study at Eglin AFB, as well as increases in labor and outside services costs related to business development and compliance.\nAWR (parent):\nFor the year ended December 31, 2017, diluted earnings from AWR (parent) increased $0.03 per share compared to 2016 due to the remeasurement of deferred tax balances recorded at the parent level. The one-time remeasurement was based on the Tax Act's lower federal corporate tax rate of 21% as compared to 35%, which increased earnings at AWR (parent) by approximately $0.03 per share during 2017.\nThe following discussion and analysis for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 provides information on AWR's consolidated operations and assets and, where necessary, includes specific references to AWR's individual segments and subsidiaries: GSWC and ASUS and its subsidiaries.\nOperating Revenues\nWater\nFor the year ended December 31, 2017, revenues from water operations increased by $3.4 million to $306.3 million, compared to $302.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase was primarily due to second-year rate increases effective January 1, 2017, and rate increases to specifically cover increases in supply costs experienced in certain rate-making areas. The rate changes related to supply costs are largely offset by a corresponding increase in supply costs, resulting in an insignificant change to the water gross margin. There were also new surcharges implemented during 2017 to recover previously incurred costs, which were offset by a corresponding increase in operating expenses (primarily administrative and general) totaling $3.6 million, resulting in no impact to earnings. These increases in revenues were partially offset by lower revenues due to the cessation of Ojai operations in June 2017.\nBilled water consumption for the year ended December 31, 2017 increased approximately 4% as compared to 2016. In general, changes in consumption do not have a significant impact on recorded revenues due to the CPUC-approved WRAM accounts in place in the majority of GSWC's rate-making areas. GSWC records the difference between what it bills its water customers and that which is authorized by the CPUC in the WRAM accounts as regulatory assets or liabilities.\nElectric\nIn 2016, the CPUC granted BVES's request to defer the filing of its next electric general rate case to 2017, setting new rates for the years 2018 through 2021. As a result, adopted base revenues for 2017 were based on 2016 adopted base revenues, adjusted for the change in the general office allocation approved by the CPUC in the water general rate case. For the year ended December 31, 2017, revenues from electric operations were $34.0 million as compared to $35.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. This decrease was primarily due to the reduction in the adopted revenue requirement for electric to reflect a decrease in the general office allocation. In May 2017, BVES filed its general rate case application with the CPUC. A final decision is expected in 2019.\nBilled electric usage for the year ended December 31, 2017 decreased slightly as compared to the same period in 2016. Due to the CPUC-approved base revenue requirement adjustment mechanism (\"BRRAM\"), which adjusts base revenues to adopted levels authorized by the CPUC, changes in usage do not have a significant impact on earnings.\nContracted Services\nRevenues from contracted services are composed of construction revenues (including renewal and replacements) and management fees for operating and maintaining the water and/or wastewater systems at various military bases. For the year ended December 31, 2017, revenues from contracted services were $100.3 million as compared to $97.4 million for 2016. There was an increase in ongoing operations and maintenance management fees due to the successful resolution of various price adjustments and asset transfers during 2016 and 2017, as well as the commencement of operations at Eglin AFB in June 2017. Included in management fees for 2017 was approximately $1.0 million in retroactive revenues related to periods prior to 2017, as compared to $421,000 of retroactive management fees recorded in 2016 which related to periods prior to 2016. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in construction activity in 2017 as compared to 2016.\nDuring 2017, ASUS was awarded approximately $20.2 million in new construction projects, the majority of which were completed during 2018.\nOperating Expenses:\nSupply Costs\nTotal supply costs comprise the largest segment of total operating expenses. Supply costs accounted for 28.1% and 26.8% of total operating expenses for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. The table below provides the amounts (in thousands) of increases (decreases) and percent changes in water and electric revenues, supply costs and gross margins during the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016:\n\n \n(1) As reported on AWR's Consolidated Statements of Income, except for supply-cost-balancing accounts. The sums of water and electric supply-cost balancing accounts in the table above are shown on AWR's Consolidated Statements of Income and totaled $(17.9) million and $(12.2) million for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Revenues include surcharges, which increase both revenues and operating expenses by corresponding amounts, thus having no net earnings impact.\n(2) Water and electric gross margins do not include depreciation and amortization, maintenance, administrative and general, property and other taxes, and other operation expenses.\nThe overall actual percentages for purchased water for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 were 42% and 40%, respectively, as compared to the adopted percentages of 28% and 29% for 2017 and 2016, respectively. The higher actual percentages of purchased water as compared to adopted percentages resulted primarily from several wells being out of service.\nPurchased water costs for the year ended December 31, 2017 increased to $68.3 million as compared to $64.4 million for the same period in 2016 primarily due to an increase of purchased water in the supply mix as a result of several wells being out of service, as well as an increase in wholesale water costs as compared to the year ended December 31, 2016.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2017, the cost of power purchased for pumping decreased slightly to $8.5 million as compared to $8.7 million for the same period in 2016 primarily due to decreases in pumped water. Groundwater production assessments were $18.6 million in 2017 as compared to $15.0 million in 2016 due to an increase in pump tax rates and pump taxes paid for water storage rights during 2017 as compared to 2016.\nThe under-collection in the water supply cost balancing account increased $5.5 million during the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to the same period in 2016 due to the higher purchased water costs as well as higher groundwater production assessments as compared to adopted water supply costs.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2017, the cost of power purchased for resale to BVES's customers was $10.7 million as compared to $10.4 million for the same period in 2016. The average price per megawatt-hour (\"MWh\"), including fixed costs, increased to $73.03 per MWh in 2017 from $69.54 per MWh for the year ended December 31, 2016.\nOther Operation\nFor the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, other operation expenses by business segment consisted of the following amounts (in thousands):\n\nDuring 2017, there was a $433,000 increase in surcharges billed to customers to recover previously incurred other operation expenses approved by the CPUC as part of the final decision on the water general rate case. These surcharges increased revenues and water gross margin with a corresponding increase in other operation expenses, resulting in no impact to earnings. Furthermore, in February 2017, the CPUC approved the recovery of incremental drought-related costs incurred in 2015 and 2016 during the drought state of emergency in California. As a result of the CPUC's approval, GSWC recorded a $1.2 million regulatory asset with a corresponding reduction in other operation expenses during the first quarter of 2017. Excluding the impact of surcharges and the recovery of drought-related costs, other operation expenses at the water segment increased by $1.3 million during the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to the same period in 2016. The increase was due primarily to higher conservation costs, labor and bad debt expense.\nThe decrease in other operation expenses at the electric segment was due to outside services costs and labor costs incurred in response to power outages caused by severe winter storms experienced in January 2016. There were no similar events in 2017.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2017, total other operation expenses for the contracted services segment increased mainly due to transition costs incurred at Eglin AFB, including a joint inventory study conducted with the U.S. government for the water and wastewater system infrastructure. ASUS assumed operations at Eglin AFB in June 2017, which further increased other operation expenses in 2017 as compared to 2016. ASUS assumed the operations at Fort Riley in July 2018.\nAdministrative and General\nFor the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, administrative and general expenses by business segment, including AWR (parent), consisted of the following amounts (in thousands):\n\nSurcharges were implemented in 2017 to recover previously incurred administrative and general costs approved by the CPUC as part of the final decision on the water general rate case issued in March 2017. A $3.3 million increase in revenues and water gross margin from these surcharges was offset by a corresponding increase in administrative and general expense to reflect the recovery of these costs, resulting in no impact to earnings. Excluding the increase in billed surcharges, administrative and general expenses at the water segment decreased by $4.6 million due primarily to lower legal expenses related to condemnation matters as compared to 2016. In addition, the Claremont settlement payment received in December 2017 included reimbursement of approximately $1.8 million in litigation costs, which was reflected as a reduction to legal expenses in 2017. These decreases were partially offset by higher medical insurance costs and general-rate-case-related expenses, as well as an $800,000 reduction to administrative and general expenses recorded in 2016 to reflect the CPUC's approval for recovery of previously incurred costs that were being tracked in CPUC-authorized memorandum accounts.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2017, administrative and general expenses for the electric segment decreased by $1.0 million as compared to 2016 due to lower regulatory costs, as well as decreases in costs associated with the energy-efficiency and solar-initiative programs approved by the CPUC.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2017, administrative and general expenses for contracted services increased by $2.3 million due primarily to (i) an increase in labor-related costs, (ii) the start of operations at Eglin AFB in June 2017, which increased administrative and general expenses in 2017 as compared to 2016, and (iii) an increase in outside services costs related to new business development and compliance.\nDepreciation and Amortization\nFor the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, depreciation and amortization expense by segment consisted of the following amounts (in thousands):\n\nFor the year ended December 31, 2017, depreciation and amortization expense at the water segment decreased due primarily to retirements recorded during 2017 and 2016, as well as the sale of the Ojai utility assets in June 2017. These decreases were largely offset by additions to utility plant during 2017. The increases for the electric and contracted services segments were due primarily to additions to plant in 2017.\nMaintenance\nFor the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, maintenance expense by segment consisted of the following amounts (in thousands):\n\nMaintenance expense for water services decreased by $1.7 million due to an overall lower level of planned and unplanned maintenance in 2017. Maintenance expense for contracted services increased due primarily to the commencement of operations at Eglin AFB in June 2017.\nProperty and Other Taxes\nFor the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, property and other taxes by segment, consisted of the following amounts (in thousands):\n\nProperty and other taxes increased overall by $1.1 million during 2017 as compared to 2016 due primarily to capital additions at the water segment.\nASUS Construction\nFor the year ended December 31, 2017, construction expenses for contracted services were $49.8 million, decreasing by $3.9 million compared to the same period in 2016 due to an overall decrease in construction activity.\nGain on Sale of Assets\nIn June 2017, GSWC completed the sale of its Ojai water system to Casitas Municipal Water District for $34.3 million, resulting in a pretax gain of $8.3 million on the sale of the assets.\nInterest Expense\nFor the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, interest expense by segment, including AWR (parent), consisted of the following amounts (in thousands):\n\nOverall, interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2017 increased by $590,000 as compared to the same period in 2016 due largely to higher average borrowings on the revolving credit facility as compared to 2016. The borrowings were used to fund operations and a portion of capital expenditures. The proceeds received in June 2017 from the completed sale of GSWC's Ojai system were used to repay a portion of these borrowings. Borrowings on the revolving credit facility are expected to continue in 2018 to fund operations and a portion of capital expenditures.\nInterest Income\nFor the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, interest income by business segment, including AWR (parent), consisted of the following amounts (in thousands): \nInterest income increased by $1.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to the same period in 2016 due primarily to (i) the collection of certain amounts from developers previously owed to GSWC, (ii) higher interest income on GSWC's regulatory assets resulting mostly from an increase in the 90-day commercial paper rate, and (iii) interest income related to a settlement payment received in December 2017.\nOther, net\nFor the year ended December 31, 2017, other income increased by $517,000 primarily due to higher gains recorded on investments held for a retirement benefit plan resulting from more favorable market conditions as compared to 2016. This was partially offset by a decrease in the non-service cost components of net periodic benefit costs related to Registrant's defined benefit pension plans and other retirement benefits.\nIncome Tax Expense\nFor the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, income tax expense by segment, including AWR (parent), consisted of the following amounts (in thousands):\n\nConsolidated income tax expense for the year ended December 31, 2017 increased by $4.2 million due primarily to an increase in pretax income. AWR's effective income tax rate (\"ETR\") was 36.0% and 36.8% for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. The ETR for GSWC was 38.8% for 2017 as compared to 37.9% for 2016 due, in part, to the remeasurement of non rate-regulated deferred tax assets as a result of the Tax Act, which reduced the federal corporate tax rate from 35% to 21%. The earnings impact of this increase in GSWC's ETR was largely offset by a reduction in deferred tax liabilities at AWR (parent), due also to the remeasurement of federal deferred tax liabilities associated with the California state unitary deferred tax balance.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nCritical accounting policies and estimates are those that are important to the portrayal of AWR's financial condition, results of operations and cash flows, and require the most difficult, subjective or complex judgments of AWR's management. The need to make estimates about the effect of items that are uncertain is what makes these judgments difficult, subjective and/or complex. Management makes subjective judgments about the accounting and regulatory treatment of many items. The following are accounting policies that are critical to the financial statements of AWR. For more information regarding the significant accounting policies of Registrant, see Note 1 of Notes to Financial Statements\u201d included in Part II, Item 8, in Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\nAccounting for Rate Regulation - Because GSWC operates extensively in a regulated business, it is subject to the authoritative guidance for accounting for the effects of certain types of regulation. Application of this guidance requires accounting for certain transactions in accordance with regulations adopted by the regulatory commissions of the states in which rate-regulated operations are conducted. Utility companies defer costs and credits on the balance sheet as regulatory assets and liabilities when it is probable that those costs and credits will be recognized in the ratemaking process in a period different from the period in which they would have been reflected in income by an unregulated company. These deferred regulatory assets and liabilities are then reflected in the income statement in the period in which the same amounts are reflected in the rates charged for service.\nRegulation and the effects of regulatory accounting have the most significant impact on the financial statements of GSWC. When GSWC files for adjustments to rates, the capital assets, operating costs and other matters are subject to review, and disallowances may occur. In the event that a portion of the GSWC's operations is no longer subject to the accounting guidance for the effects of certain types of regulation, GSWC is required to write-off related regulatory assets that are not specifically recoverable and determine if other assets might be impaired. If the CPUC determines that a portion of GSWC's assets are not recoverable in customer rates, GSWC is required to determine if it has suffered an asset impairment that would require a write-down in the asset valuation. Management continually evaluates the anticipated recovery, settlement or refund of regulatory assets, liabilities, and revenues subject to refund and provides for allowances and/or reserves that it believes to be necessary. In the event that GSWC's assessment as to the probability of the inclusion in the ratemaking process is incorrect, the associated regulatory asset or liability will be adjusted to reflect the change in assessment or the impact of regulatory approval of rates. Reviews by the CPUC may also result in additional regulatory liabilities to refund previously collected revenues to customers if the CPUC were to disallow costs included in the ratemaking process.\nRegistrant also reviews its utility plant in-service for possible impairment in accordance with accounting guidance for regulated entities for abandonments and disallowances of plant costs.\nRevenue Recognition - Effective January 1, 2018, Registrant adopted Accounting Standard Update 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606) (\"ASU 2014-09\") issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board. The adoption of this revenue guidance did not have a material impact on how Registrant recognizes revenue.\nGSWC records water and electric utility operating revenues when the service is provided to customers. Operating revenues include unbilled revenues that are earned (i.e., the service has been provided) but not billed by the end of each accounting period. Unbilled revenues are calculated based on the number of days and total usage from each customer's most recent billing record that was billed prior to the end of the accounting period, and is used to estimate unbilled consumption as of the year-end reporting period. Unbilled revenues are recorded for both monthly and bi-monthly customers.\nThe CPUC granted GSWC the authority to implement revenue decoupling mechanisms through the adoption of the WRAM and the BRRAM. With the adoption of these alternative revenue programs, GSWC adjusts revenues in the WRAM and BRRAM for the difference between what is billed to its regulated customers and that which is authorized by the CPUC. Alternative revenue programs such as the WRAM and BRRAM are outside the scope of ASU 2014-09.\nAs required by the accounting guidance for alternative revenue programs, GSWC is required to collect its WRAM and BRRAM balances within 24 months following the year in which they are recorded. The CPUC has set the recovery period for under-collected balances that are up to 15% of adopted annual revenues at 18 months or less. For net WRAM under-collected balances greater than 15%, the recovery period is 19 to 36 months. As a result of the accounting guidance and CPUC-adopted recovery periods, Registrant must estimate if any WRAM and BRRAM revenues will be collected beyond the 24-month period, which can affect the timing of when such revenues are recognized.\nRevenues for ASUS's operations and maintenance contracts are recognized when services have been rendered to the U.S. government pursuant to 50-year contracts. Revenues from construction activities are recognized based on either the\npercentage-of-completion or cost-plus methods of accounting. In accordance with GAAP, revenue recognition under these methods requires management to estimate the progress toward completion on a contract in terms of efforts, such as costs incurred. This approach is used because management considers it to be the best available measure of progress on these contracts. Changes in job performance, job conditions, change orders and estimated profitability, including those arising from any contract penalty provisions, and final contract settlements may result in revisions to costs and income, and are recognized in the period in which the revisions are determined. Unbilled receivables from the U.S. government represent amounts to be billed for construction work completed and/or for services rendered pursuant to the 50-year contracts with the U.S government, which are not presently billable but which will be billed under the terms of the contracts.\nIncome Taxes - Registrant's income tax calculations require estimates due principally to the regulated nature of the operations of GSWC, the multiple states in which Registrant operates, and potential future tax rate changes. Registrant uses the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes under which deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which these temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. Changes in regulatory treatment, or significant changes in tax-related estimates, assumptions or law, could have a material impact on the financial position and results of operations of Registrant.\nAs a regulated utility, GSWC treats certain temporary differences as flow-through adjustments in computing its income tax expense consistent with the income tax approach approved by the CPUC for ratemaking purposes. Flow-through adjustments increase or decrease tax expense in one period, with an offsetting decrease or increase occurring in another period. Giving effect to these temporary differences as flow-through adjustments typically results in a greater variance between the effective tax rate and the statutory federal income tax rate in any given period than would otherwise exist if GSWC were not required to account for its income taxes as a regulated enterprise. As of December 31, 2018, Registrant's total amount of unrecognized tax benefits was zero.\nPension Benefits - Registrant's pension benefit obligations and related costs are calculated using actuarial concepts within the framework of accounting guidance for employers' accounting for pensions and post-retirement benefits other than pensions. Two critical assumptions, the discount rate and the expected return on plan assets, are important elements of expense and/or liability measurement. We evaluate these critical assumptions annually. Other assumptions include employee demographic factors such as retirement patterns, mortality, turnover and rate of compensation increase. The discount rate enables Registrant to state expected future cash payments for benefits as a present value on the measurement date. The guideline for setting this rate is a high-quality, long-term corporate bond rate. Registrant's discount rates were determined by considering the average of pension yield curves constructed using a large population of high-quality corporate bonds. The resulting discount rates reflect the matching of plan liability cash flows to the yield curves. A lower discount rate increases the present value of benefit obligations and increases periodic pension expense. Conversely, a higher discount rate decreases the present value of benefit obligations and decreases periodic pension expense. To determine the expected long-term rate of return on the plan assets, Registrant considers the current and expected asset allocation, as well as historical and expected returns on each plan asset class. A lower expected rate of return on plan assets will increase pension expense. The long-term expected return on the pension plan's assets was 6.50% in both 2018 and 2017.\nFor the pension plan obligation, Registrant increased the discount rate to 4.43% as of December 31, 2018 from 3.76% as of December 31, 2017 to reflect market interest-rate conditions at December 31, 2018. A hypothetical 25-basis point decrease in the assumed discount rate would have increased total net periodic pension expense for 2018 by approximately $855,000, or 27.8%, and would have increased the projected benefit obligation ( PBO\u201d) and accumulated benefit obligation ( ABO\u201d) at December 31, 2018 by a total of $7.0 million, or 3.6%. A 25-basis point further decrease in the long-term return on pension-plan-asset assumption would have increased 2018 pension cost by approximately $430,000, or 14.0%.\nIn addition, changes in the fair value of plan assets will impact future pension cost and the Plan's funded status. Volatile market conditions can affect the value of AWR's trust established to fund its future long-term pension benefits. Any reductions in the value of plan assets will result in increased future expense, an increase in the underfunded position and increased future contributions.\nThe CPUC has authorized GSWC to maintain two-way balancing accounts to track differences between the forecasted annual pension expenses adopted in rates and the actual annual expense to be recorded by GSWC in accordance with the accounting guidance for pension costs. As of December 31, 2018, GSWC has a $3.0 million over-collection in the two-way pension balancing accounts, consisting of a $2.0 million over-collection related to the general office and water regions, and a $1.0 million over-collection related to BVES.\nFunding requirements for qualified defined benefit pension plans are determined by government regulations. In establishing the contribution amount, Registrant has considered the potential impact of funding-rule changes under the Pension Protection Act of 2006. Registrant contributes the minimum required contribution as determined by government regulations or the forecasted annual pension cost authorized by the CPUC and included in customer rates, whichever is higher. In accordance with this funding policy, for 2019 the pension contribution is expected to be approximately $3.6 million. Any differences between the forecasted annual pension costs in rates and the actual pension costs are included in the two-way pension balancing accounts.\nAdditionally, our pension plan liabilities are sensitive to changes in interest rates. As interest rates decrease, thereby reducing returns, our liabilities increase, potentially increasing benefit expense and funding requirements. In addition, market factors can affect assumptions we use in determining funding requirements with respect to our pension plan. For example, a relatively modest change in our assumptions regarding discount rates can materially affect our calculation of funding requirements. To the extent that market data compels us to reduce the discount rate used in our assumptions, our benefit obligations could materially increase.\nChanges in demographics, including increased numbers of retirees or increases in life expectancy assumptions may also increase the funding requirements of our obligations related to the pension and other postretirement benefit plans. Mortality assumptions are a critical component of benefit obligation amounts and a key factor in determining the expected length of time for annuity payments. Assuming no changes in actuarial assumptions or plan amendments, the costs over the long term are expected to decrease due to the closure of Registrant's defined benefit pension plan to new employees as of January 1, 2011. Employees hired or rehired after December 31, 2010 are eligible to participate in a defined contribution plan.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nAWR\nRegistrant's regulated business is capital intensive and requires considerable capital resources. A portion of these capital resources is provided by internally generated cash flows from operations. AWR anticipates that interest expense will increase in future periods due to the need for additional external capital to fund its construction program, and as market interest rates increase. AWR believes that costs associated with capital used to fund construction at GSWC will continue to be recovered through water and electric rates charged to customers.\nAWR funds its operating expenses and pays dividends on its outstanding Common Shares primarily through dividends from its wholly owned subsidiaries. The ability of GSWC to pay dividends to AWR is restricted by California law. Under these restrictions, approximately $211.2 million was available for GSWC to pay dividends to AWR on December 31, 2018. Approximately $67.3 million was available for ASUS to pay dividends to AWR as of December 31, 2018 to the extent that the subsidiaries of ASUS are able to pay dividends in that amount to ASUS under applicable state laws.\nWhen necessary, Registrant obtains funds from external sources in the capital markets and through bank borrowings. Access to external financing on reasonable terms depends on the credit ratings of AWR and GSWC and current business conditions, including that of the water utility industry in general, as well as conditions in the debt and equity capital markets. AWR has access to a syndicated credit facility, which expires in May 2023. AWR borrows under this facility and provides funds to its subsidiaries, GSWC and ASUS, in support of their operations. Any amounts owed to AWR by GSWC for borrowings under this facility are included in inter-company payables on GSWC's balance sheet. The interest rate charged to GSWC and ASUS is sufficient to cover AWR's interest cost under the credit facility.\nIn March of 2019, $40 million of GSWC's 6.70% senior notes will mature. GSWC intends to borrow under its intercompany borrowing arrangement with AWR to fund the repayment of this note. As of February 1, 2019 there were $99.5 million of outstanding borrowings under this facility and $940,000 of letters of credit outstanding. As of February 1, 2019, AWR had $49.6 million available to borrow under the credit facility.\nIn July 2018, Standard and Poor's Global Ratings ( S&P\u201d) affirmed an A+ credit rating with a stable outlook on both AWR and GSWC. S&P's debt ratings range from AAA (highest possible) to D (obligation is in default). In January 2019, Moody's Investors Service (\"Moody's\") affirmed its A2 rating with a positive outlook for GSWC. Securities ratings are not recommendations to buy, sell or hold a security and are subject to change or withdrawal at any time by the rating agencies. Registrant believes that AWR's sound capital structure and A+ credit rating, combined with its financial discipline, will enable AWR to access the debt and equity markets. However, unpredictable financial market conditions in the future may limit its access or impact the timing of when to access the market, in which case, Registrant may choose to temporarily reduce its capital spending. If needed, GSWC may issue long-term debt in the future, depending on market conditions. It is anticipated that the proceeds from any such debt issuance would be used to pay down short-term borrowings and fund a portion of capital expenditures.\nAWR's ability to pay cash dividends on its Common Shares outstanding depends primarily upon cash flows from its subsidiaries. AWR intends to continue paying quarterly cash dividends in the future, on or about March 1, June 1, September 1 and December 1, subject to earnings and financial conditions, regulatory requirements and such other factors as the Board of Directors may deem relevant. Registrant has paid dividends on its Common Shares for over 80 consecutive years. On January 29, 2019, AWR's Board of Directors approved a first quarter dividend of $0.275 per share on AWR's Common Shares. Dividends on the Common Shares will be paid on March 1, 2019 to shareholders of record at the close of business on February 15, 2019.\nCash Flows from Operating Activities:\nCash flows from operating activities have generally provided sufficient cash to fund operating requirements, including a portion of construction expenditures at GSWC, construction expenses at ASUS, and dividend payments. Registrant's future cash flows from operating activities are expected to be affected by a number of factors, including utility regulation; changes in tax law and deferred taxes; maintenance expenses; inflation; compliance with environmental, health and safety standards; production costs; customer growth; per-customer usage of water and electricity; weather and seasonality; conservation efforts; compliance with local governmental requirements, including mandatory restrictions on water use; and required cash contributions to pension and post-retirement plans. Future cash flows from contracted services subsidiaries will depend on new business activities, existing operations, the construction of new and/or replacement infrastructure at military bases, timely economic price and equitable adjustment of prices, and timely collection of payments from the U.S. government and other prime contractors operating at the military bases.\nThe lower federal tax rate and the elimination of bonus depreciation brought about by the Tax Act are reducing Registrant's cash flows from operating activities, and are expected to result in higher financing costs arising from an increased need to raise debt and/or equity.\nASUS funds its operating expenses primarily through internal operating sources, which include U.S. government funding under 50-year contracts for operations and maintenance costs and construction activities, as well as investments by, or loans from, AWR. ASUS, in turn, provides funding to its subsidiaries. ASUS's subsidiaries may also from time to time provide funding to ASUS or its subsidiaries.\nCash flows from operating activities are primarily generated by net income, adjusted for non-cash expenses such as depreciation and amortization, and deferred income taxes. Cash generated by operations varies during the year. Net cash provided by operating activities was $136.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 as compared to $144.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, and $96.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The decrease in cash from operating activities during 2018 was due primarily to: (i) significant differences in the timing of income tax payments made and refunds received between the two periods, and (ii) a decrease resulting from the timing of billing of and cash receipts for construction work at military bases during the year ended December 31, 2018. The billings (and cash receipts) for construction work generally occur at completion of the work or in accordance with a billing schedule contractually agreed to with the U.S. government and/or other prime contractors. Thus, cash flow from construction-related activities may fluctuate from period to period with such fluctuations representing timing differences of when the work is being performed and when the cash is received for payment of the work. These decreases in cash from operating activities were partially offset by an overall increase in cash collected from customers related to GSWC's regulatory accounts. The timing of cash receipts and disbursements related to other working capital items also affected the changes in net cash provided by operating activities.\nThe increase in operating cash flow during 2017 as compared to 2016 was due to various CPUC-approved surcharges implemented during 2017 to recover previously incurred costs as well as income tax refunds received in 2017. The increase in operating cash flow was also due to the timing of billing of and cash receipts for construction work at military bases during 2017. Changes in customer accounts receivable were due to higher balances outstanding resulting from CPUC-approved rate increases and surcharges. The timing of cash receipts and disbursements related to other working capital items also affected the change in net cash provided by operating activities.\nCash Flows from Investing Activities:\nNet cash used in investing activities was $128.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 as compared to $80.0 million used in 2017 and $131.2 million used in 2016. Cash used in investing activities during 2017 were partially offset by $34.3 million in cash proceeds generated from the sale of GSWC's Ojai water system in 2017. Cash used for other investments consists primarily of cash invested in a trust for a retirement benefit plan.\nThe decrease in cash used in investing activities in 2017 as compared to 2016 was due to the $34.3 million in cash proceeds generated from the sale of GSWC's Ojai water system.\nRegistrant invests capital to provide essential services to its regulated customer base, and has an opportunity to earn a fair rate of return on investments in infrastructure. Registrant's infrastructure investment plan consists of both infrastructure renewal programs, where infrastructure is replaced, as needed, and major capital investment projects, where new water treatment and delivery facilities are constructed. GSWC may also be required from time to time to relocate existing infrastructure in order to accommodate local infrastructure improvement projects. Projected capital expenditures and other investments are subject to periodic review and revision.\nCash Flows from Financing Activities:\nRegistrant's financing activities include primarily: (i) the sale proceeds from the issuance of Common Shares and stock option exercises and the repurchase of Common Shares; (ii) the issuance and repayment of long-term debt and notes payable to banks; and (iii) the payment of dividends on Common Shares. In order to finance new infrastructure, Registrant also receives customer advances (net of refunds) for, and contributions in aid of, construction. Short-term borrowings are used to fund capital expenditures until long-term financing is arranged.\nNet cash used in financing activities was $1.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 as compared to net cash used of $64.7 million and net cash provided of $30.3 million for the same periods in 2017 and 2016, respectively. The decrease in net cash used in financing activities in 2018 from 2017 was due to the use of the Ojai sale proceeds, as well as cash\ngenerated from operating activities during 2017 to repay a portion of short-term borrowings from Registrant's revolving credit facility.\nNet cash used in financing activities in 2017 as compared to net cash provided by financing activities in 2016 was due to the use of the Ojai sale proceeds.\nGSWC\nGSWC funds its operating expenses, payments on its debt, dividends on its outstanding common shares and a portion of its construction expenditures through internal sources. Internal sources of cash flow are provided primarily by retention of a portion of earnings from operating activities. Internal cash generation is influenced by factors such as weather patterns, conservation efforts, environmental regulation, litigation, changes in tax law and deferred taxes, changes in supply costs and regulatory decisions affecting GSWC's ability to recover these supply costs, timing of rate relief, increases in maintenance expenses and capital expenditures, surcharges authorized by the CPUC to enable GSWC to recover expenses previously incurred from customers, and CPUC requirements to refund amounts previously charged to customers.\nGSWC may, at times, utilize external sources, including equity investments and short-term borrowings from AWR, and long-term debt to help fund a portion of its construction expenditures. On November 29, 2018, the Board of Directors approved the issuance of nineteen additional GSWC common shares to AWR for $47.5 million. GSWC used the proceeds from the issuance to pay down intercompany borrowings owed to AWR.\nIn addition, GSWC receives advances and contributions from customers, homebuilders and real estate developers to fund construction necessary to extend service to new areas. Advances for construction are generally refundable at a rate of 2.5% in equal annual installments over 40 years. Amounts that are no longer subject to refund are reclassified to contributions in aid of construction. Utility plant funded by advances and contributions is excluded from rate base. Generally, GSWC amortizes contributions in aid of construction at the same composite rate of depreciation for the related property.\nAs is often the case with public utilities, GSWC's current liabilities may at times exceed its current assets. Management believes that internally generated funds, along with the proceeds from the issuance of long-term debt, borrowings from AWR, and common share issuances to AWR, will be adequate to provide sufficient capital to enable GSWC to maintain normal operations and to meet its capital and financing requirements pending recovery of costs in rates.\nIn March of 2019, $40 million of GSWC's 6.70% senior note will mature. GSWC intends to borrow under its intercompany borrowing arrangement with AWR to fund the repayment of this note.\nCash Flows from Operating Activities:\nNet cash provided by operating activities was $120.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 as compared to $129.6 million and $101.3 million for the same periods in 2017 and 2016, respectively. This decrease was primarily due to significant differences in the timing of income tax payments made and refunds received between the two periods, partially offset by an overall increase in cash collected from customers related to GSWC's regulatory accounts. The timing of cash receipts and disbursements related to other working capital items also affected net cash provided by operating activities.\nThe increase in cash from operations in 2017 as compared to 2016 was due to various CPUC-approved surcharges implemented during 2017 to recover previously incurred costs, as well as income tax refunds received in 2017. Changes in customer accounts receivable were due to higher balances outstanding resulting from CPUC-approved rate increases and surcharges. The timing of cash receipts and disbursements related to other working capital items also affected net cash provided by operating activities.\nCash Flows from Investing Activities:\nNet cash used in investing activities was $117.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 as compared to $77.4 million and $129.3 million for the same periods in 2017 and 2016, respectively. Cash used for capital expenditures in 2017 was partially offset by cash proceeds received from the sale of GSWC's Ojai water system.\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, cash paid for capital expenditures was $116.4 million, $110.5 million and $127.9 million, respectively. Capital expenditures incurred in 2018, 2017 and 2016 were consistent with GSWC's capital investment program. GSWC expects 2019 company-funded capital expenditures to be between $115 and $125 million.\nCash Flows from Financing Activities:\nNet cash provided by financing activities was $1.4 million for 2018 as compared to net cash used of $52.2 million and net cash provided of $25.7 million for 2017 and 2016, respectively. The increase in net cash provided by financing activities during 2018 was due to the issuance of additional Common Shares to AWR for $47.5 million in cash proceeds, as well as an increase in intercompany borrowings as compared to 2017. These increases were partially offset by an increase in dividends paid to AWR.\nThe change in net cash used in financing activities in 2017 of $52.2 million, as compared to net cash provided by financing activities of $25.7 million in 2016, was due to repayments made during 2017 on intercompany borrowings using the Ojai sale proceeds and cash generated from operating activities, as compared to net borrowings made from AWR in 2016.\nContractual Obligations, Commitments and Off-Balance-Sheet Arrangements\nRegistrant has various contractual obligations which are recorded as liabilities in the consolidated financial statements. Other items, such as certain purchase commitments and operating leases, are not recognized as liabilities in the consolidated financial statements, but are required to be disclosed. In addition to contractual maturities, Registrant has certain debt instruments that contain annual sinking funds or other principal payments. Registrant believes that it will be able to refinance debt instruments at their maturity through public issuance, or private placement, of debt or equity. Annual payments to service debt are generally made from cash flows from operations.\nThe following table reflects Registrant's contractual obligations and commitments to make future payments pursuant to contracts as of December 31, 2018. All obligations and commitments are obligations and commitments of GSWC unless otherwise noted. \n \n(1) Excludes dividends and facility fees.\n(2) The notes and debentures have been issued by GSWC under an Indenture dated September 1, 1993, as amended in December 2008. The notes and debentures do not contain any financial covenants that Registrant believes to be material or any cross-default provisions.\n(3) GSWC issued private placement notes in 1991 in the amount of $28 million pursuant to the terms of note purchase agreements with substantially similar terms. These agreements contain restrictions on the payment of dividends, minimum interest coverage requirements, a maximum debt-to-capitalization ratio, and a negative pledge. Pursuant to the terms of these agreements, GSWC must maintain a minimum interest coverage ratio of two times interest expense. In addition, two senior notes in the amount of $40 million each were issued by GSWC in October 2005 and in March 2009 to CoBank, ACB. A\nsenior note in the amount of $15 million was issued to The Prudential Insurance Company of America in December 2014. Under the terms of these senior notes, GSWC may not incur any additional debt or pay any distributions to its shareholders if, after giving effect thereto, it would have a debt to capitalization ratio in excess of 0.6667-to-1 or a debt to earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization ratio of more than 8-to-1. GSWC is in compliance with these covenant provisions as of December 31, 2018. GSWC does not currently have any outstanding mortgages or other liens on indebtedness on its properties.\n(4) Consists of obligations at GSWC related to (i) a loan agreement supporting $7.7 million in outstanding debt issued by the California Pollution Control Financing Authority, and (ii) $3.7 million of obligations with respect to GSWC's 500 acre-foot entitlement to water from the State Water Project ( SWP\u201d). These obligations do not contain any financial covenants believed to be material to Registrant or any cross-default provisions. In regard to its SWP entitlement, GSWC has entered into agreements with various developers for a portion of its 500 acre-foot entitlement to water from the SWP.\n(5) Consists of $3.6 million outstanding representing the debt portion of funds received under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act for reimbursements of capital costs related to the installation of meters for conversion of non-metered service to metered service in GSWC's Arden-Cordova District.\n(6) Consists of expected interest expense payments based on the assumption that GSWC's long-term debt remains outstanding until maturity.\n(7) Advances for construction represent annual contract refunds by GSWC to developers for the cost of water systems paid for by the developers. The advances are generally refundable in equal annual installments over 40-year periods.\n(8) Consists of an agreement by GSWC to purchase renewable energy credits through 2023. These renewable energy credits are used by GSWC's electric division to meet California's renewables portfolio standard.\n(9) Consists primarily of a fixed-cost purchased power contract effective January 1, 2015 between BVES and Shell Energy North America (US), L.P. and EDF Trading North America, LLC.\n(10) Consists primarily of capital expenditures estimated to be required under signed contracts at GSWC as of December 31, 2018. In addition, on February 4, 2019 BVES entered into a purchase agreement with General Electric International, Inc. in which General Electric International, Inc. will construct and then sell to BVES a solar power generating facility for $11.8 million. This project is subject to CPUC approval.\n(11) Water purchase agreements consist of (i) a remaining amount of $2.2 million under an agreement expiring in 2028 to use water rights from a third party, and (ii) an aggregate amount of $2.2 million of other water purchase commitments with other third parties, which expire through 2038.\n(12) Reflects future minimum payments under noncancelable operating leases for both GSWC and ASUS.\n(13) Consists of expected contributions to Registrant's defined benefit pension plan for the years 2019 through 2021. Contribution to the pension plan are expected to be the higher of the minimum required contribution under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act ( ERISA\u201d) or the amounts that are recovered in customer rates and approved by the CPUC. These amounts are estimates and are subject to change based on, among other things, the limits established for federal tax deductibility (pension plan) and the significant impact that returns on plan assets and changes in discount rates have on such amounts.\n(14) Other commitments consist primarily of (i) a $150 million revolving credit facility, of which $95.5 million was outstanding as of December 31, 2018; (ii) a $5.2 million asset retirement obligation of GSWC that reflects the retirement of wells by GSWC, which by law need to be properly capped at the time of removal; (iii) an irrevocable letter of credit in the amount of $340,000 for the deductible in Registrant's business automobile insurance policy; (iv) an irrevocable letter of credit issued on behalf of GSWC in the amount of $585,000 as security for the purchase of power by BVES under an energy scheduling agreement with Automated Power Exchange; and (v) a $15,000 irrevocable letter of credit issued on behalf of GSWC pursuant to a franchise agreement with the City of Rancho Cordova. All of the letters of credit are issued pursuant to the revolving credit facility. The revolving credit facility contains restrictions on prepayments, disposition of property, mergers, liens and negative pledges, indebtedness and guaranty obligations, transactions with affiliates, minimum interest coverage requirements, a maximum debt-to-capitalization ratio, and a minimum debt rating. Pursuant to the credit agreement, AWR must maintain a minimum interest coverage ratio of 3.25 times interest expense, a maximum total funded debt ratio of 0.65-to-1.00 and a minimum debt rating from Moody's or S&P of Baa3 or BBB-, respectively. As of December 31, 2018, AWR was in compliance with these covenants with an interest coverage ratio of 6.23 times interest expense, a debt ratio of 0.43-to-1.00 and debt ratings of A+ and A2.\nOff-Balance-Sheet Arrangements\nRegistrant has various contractual obligations that are recorded as liabilities in the consolidated financial statements. Other items, such as certain purchase commitments and operating leases, are not recognized as liabilities in the consolidated financial statements, but are required to be disclosed. Except for those disclosed above in the table, Registrant does not have any other off-balance-sheet arrangements.\nEffects of Inflation\nThe rates of GSWC are established to provide recovery of costs and a fair return on shareholders' investment. Recovery of the effects of inflation through higher water rates is dependent upon receiving adequate and timely rate increases; however, authorized rates charged to customers are usually based on a forecast of expenses and capital costs for GSWC. Rates may lag increases in costs caused by unanticipated inflation. During periods of moderate to low inflation, as has been experienced for the last several years, the effects of inflation on operating results have not been significant. Furthermore, the CPUC approves projections for a future test year in general rate cases which reduces the impact of inflation to the extent that GSWC's inflation forecasts are accurate.\nFor the Military Utility Privatization Subsidiaries, under the terms of the contracts with the U.S. government, the contract price is subject to an economic price adjustment on an annual basis. ASUS has experienced delays in some of its economic price adjustments. However, when adjustments are finalized, they are implemented retroactively to the effective date of the economic price adjustment.\nClimate Change\nWater - GSWC considers the potential impacts of climate change in its water supply portfolio planning and its overall infrastructure replacement plans. In addition, GSWC considers the impacts of greenhouse gas emissions and other environmental concerns in its operations and infrastructure investments.\nElectric - California has established a cap-and-trade program applicable to greenhouse gas emissions. While BVES's power-plant emissions are below the reporting threshold, as a Covered Entity\u201d BVES has an obligation to file a report in June of each year under the Greenhouse Gas Mandatory Reporting Regulation.\nThe State of California and the CPUC have also established renewable energy procurement targets. BVES has entered into a CPUC-approved ten-year contract for renewable energy credits. Because of this agreement, BVES believes it will comply through at least 2023 with California's renewable energy statutes that address this issue. However, in addition to an anticipated increase in sales, one senate bill includes extending and increasing the renewable energy procurement requirements beyond 2020. As a result, BVES is examining its renewable supply quantities to ensure continued compliance.\nBVES is also required to comply with the CPUC's greenhouse gas emission performance standards. Under these standards, BVES must file an annual attestation with the CPUC stating that BVES is in compliance. Specifically, BVES must attest to having no new ownership investment in generation facilities exceeding the emission performance standards and no long-term commitments for generation exceeding the standards. In February 2019, BVES filed an attestation that BVES complied with the standards for 2018.\nAt this time, management cannot estimate the impact, if any, that these regulations may have on the cost of BVES's power plant operations or the cost of BVES's purchased power from third party providers.\nBVES Power-Supply Arrangements\nBVES began taking power effective January 1, 2015 at a fixed cost over three-and five-year terms depending on the amount of power and period during which the power is purchased under contracts approved by the CPUC in December 2014. The three-year contract expired on December 31, 2017. Registrant intends to enter into new purchased power contracts, subject to CPUC approval, once the five-year-term contract expires in November 2019. In addition to the purchased power contracts, BVES buys additional energy to meet peak demand as needed and sells surplus power when necessary. The average cost of power purchased, including fixed costs and the transactions in the spot market, was approximately $79.90 per MWh for the year ended December 31, 2018 as compared to $73.03 per MWh for the same period of 2017. BVES's average energy costs are impacted by pricing fluctuations on the spot market. However, BVES has implemented an electric-supply-cost balancing account, as approved by the CPUC, to alleviate any impacts to earnings.\nConstruction Program\nGSWC maintains an ongoing water distribution main replacement program throughout its customer service areas based on the age and type of distribution-system materials, priority of leaks detected, remaining productive life of the distribution system and an underlying replacement schedule. In addition, GSWC upgrades its electric and water supply facilities in accordance with industry standards, and local and CPUC requirements. As of December 31, 2018, GSWC has unconditional purchase obligations for capital projects of approximately $73.4 million. During the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, GSWC had capital expenditures of $125.1 million, $115.3 million and $126.0 million, respectively. A portion of these capital expenditures was funded by developers through refundable advances, or contributions in aid of construction, which are not required to be repaid. During the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, capital expenditures funded by developers were $4.1 million, $3.5 million and $5.3 million, respectively. During 2019, GSWC's company-funded capital expenditures are estimated to be approximately $115 - $125 million.\nContracted Services\nUnder the terms of the current and future utility privatization contracts with the U.S. government, each contract's price is subject to an economic price adjustment ( EPA\u201d) on an annual basis. In the event that ASUS (i) is managing more assets at specific military bases than were included in the U.S. government's request for proposal, (ii) is managing assets that are in substandard condition as compared to what was disclosed in the request for proposal, (iii) prudently incurs costs not contemplated under the terms of the utility privatization contract, and/or (iv) becomes subject to new regulatory requirements, such as more stringent water-quality standards, ASUS is permitted to file, and has filed, requests for equitable adjustment ( REA\u201d). The timely filing for and receipt of EPAs and/or REAs continues to be critical in order for the Military Utility Privatization Subsidiaries to recover increasing costs of operating and maintaining, and renewing and replacing the water and/or wastewater systems at the military bases it serves.\nUnder the Budget Control Act of 2011 (the 2011 Act\u201d), substantial automatic spending cuts, known as \"sequestration,\" have impacted the expected levels of Department of Defense budgeting. The Military Utility Privatization Subsidiaries have not experienced any earnings impact to their existing operations and maintenance and renewal and replacement services, as utility privatization contracts are an \"excepted service\" within the 2011 Act. While the ongoing effects of sequestration have been mitigated through the passage of the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018 for fiscal years 2018 and 2019, similar issues may arise as part of fiscal uncertainty and/or future debt-ceiling limits imposed by Congress. However, any future impact on ASUS and its operations through the Military Utility Privatization Subsidiaries will likely be limited to (a) the timing of funding to pay for services rendered, (b) delays in the processing of EPAs and/or REAs, (c) the timing of the issuance of contract modifications for new construction work not already funded by the U.S. government, and/or (d) delays in the solicitation for and/or awarding of new contracts under the Department of Defense utility privatization program. Furthermore, from December 22, 2018 until January 25, 2019, the U.S. government shutdown impacted non-essential government employees due to the lack of an approved appropriations bill to fund the operations of the federal government for fiscal year 2019. However, the shutdown did not have an impact on ASUS due to the fact that funding for military operations (including military bases) is provided by the Department of Defense, which is fully funded for fiscal 2019 and was not part of the government shutdown.\nAt times, the DCAA and/or the DCMA may, at the request of a contracting officer, perform audits/reviews of contractors for compliance with certain government guidance and regulations, such as the Federal Acquisition Regulations and Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplements. Certain audit/review findings, such as system deficiencies for government-contract-business-system requirements, may result in delays in the timing of resolution of filings submitted to and/or the ability to file new proposals with the U.S. government.\nBelow is a summary of current and projected EPA filings for price adjustments to operations and maintenance fees and renewal and replacement fees for the Military Utility Privatization Subsidiaries.\n\nASUS assumed the operation of the water distribution and wastewater collection and treatment facilities at Fort Riley on July 1, 2018. The value of this contract is approximately $681.0 million over its 50-year term, subject to annual economic price adjustments.\nRegulatory Matters\nCertificates of Public Convenience and Necessity\nGSWC holds Certificates of Public Convenience and Necessity ( CPCN\u201d) granted by the CPUC in each of the ratemaking areas it serves. ASUS is regulated, if applicable, by the state in which it primarily conducts water and/or wastewater operations. FBWS holds a CPCN from the Public Utilities Commission of Texas. The Virginia State Corporation Commission exercises jurisdiction over ODUS as a public service company. The Maryland Public Service Commission approved the right of TUS to operate as a water and wastewater utility at Joint Base Andrews, Maryland, based on certain conditions. The South Carolina Public Service Commission exercises jurisdiction over PSUS as a public service company. ONUS is regulated by the North Carolina Public Service Commission. ECUS and FRUS are not subject to regulation by their respective states' utility commissions.\nRate Regulation\nGSWC is subject to regulation by the CPUC, which has broad authority over service and facilities, rates, classification of accounts, valuation of properties, the purchase, disposition and mortgaging of properties necessary or useful in rendering public utility service, the issuance of securities, the granting of certificates of public convenience and necessity as to the extension of services and facilities and various other matters.\nRates that GSWC is authorized to charge are determined by the CPUC in general rate cases and are derived using rate base, cost of service and cost of capital, as projected for a future test year. Rates charged to customers vary according to customer class and rate jurisdiction and are generally set at levels allowing for recovery of prudently incurred costs, including a fair return on rate base. Rate base generally consists of the original cost of utility plant in service, plus certain other assets, such as working capital and inventory, less accumulated depreciation on utility plant in service, deferred income tax liabilities and certain other deductions.\nGSWC is required to file a water general rate case application every three years according to a schedule established by the CPUC. General rate cases typically include an increase in the first test year with inflation-rate adjustments for expenses for the second and third years of the rate case cycle. For capital projects, there are two test years. Rates are based on a forecast of expenses and capital costs for each test year. Electric general rate cases are typically filed every four years.\nRates may also be increased by offsets for certain expense increases, including, but not limited to, supply-cost offset and balancing-account amortization, advice letter filings related to certain plant additions and other operating cost increases.\nNeither the operations nor rates of AWR and ASUS are directly regulated by the CPUC. The CPUC does, however, regulate certain transactions between GSWC and ASUS and between GSWC and AWR.\nPending General Rate Case Filings:\nWater Segment:\nIn July 2017, GSWC filed a general rate case application for its water regions and the general office. The general rate case will determine new water rates for the years 2019 through 2021. On August 15, 2018, GSWC and the CPUC's Public Advocates Office, formerly the Office of Ratepayer Advocates, filed a joint motion to adopt a settlement agreement between GSWC and the Public Advocates Office in connection with the general rate case. If approved by the CPUC, the settlement would resolve all of the issues in the general rate case application and authorize GSWC to invest approximately $334.5 million in capital infrastructure over the three-year rate cycle. The $334.5 million of infrastructure investment, as settled, includes $20.4 million of capital projects to be filed for revenue recovery through advice letters when those projects are completed.\nExcluding the advice-letter-project revenues, the water gross margin for 2019 in the settlement filing is expected to increase by approximately $6.0 million as compared to the 2018 adopted water gross margin. The 2019 water revenue requirement, as settled, has been reduced to reflect a decrease of approximately $7.0 million in depreciation expense, compared to the adopted 2018 depreciation expense, due to a reduction in the overall composite depreciation rates based on a revised study filed in the general rate case. The decrease in depreciation expense lowers the water gross margin, and is offset by a corresponding decrease in depreciation expense, resulting in no impact to net earnings. In addition, the 2019 water revenue requirement, as settled, includes a decrease of approximately $2.2 million for excess deferred tax refunds as a result of the Tax Act, which has a corresponding decrease in income tax expense and also results in no impact to net earnings. Had depreciation expense, as settled, remained the same as the 2018 adopted amount and there was no excess deferred tax refund that lowered the 2019 revenue requirement, the water gross margin for 2019 would have increased by approximately $15.2 million. The settlement also allows for potential additional water revenue increases in 2020 and 2021 of approximately $10.0 million and $12.0 million, respectively, subject to the results of an earnings test and changes to the forecasted inflationary index values.\nGSWC and the Public Advocates Office informed the assigned Administrative Law Judge (\"ALJ\u201d) that hearings would not be needed in light of the settlement agreement. Subsequently, the ALJ issued a ruling requesting additional information on\na number of items in the general rate case. GSWC has provided the additional information requested by the ALJ and believes it has satisfied all of the questions raised. Both the ALJ's request and GSWC's response are public information. GSWC is awaiting a proposed decision by the ALJ, which is expected during the first quarter of 2019, with a final decision by the CPUC expected later in 2019. When approved, the new rates will be retroactive to January 1, 2019.\nElectric Segment:\nIn May 2017, GSWC filed its electric general rate case application with the CPUC to determine new electric rates for the years 2018 through 2021. In November 2018, GSWC and the Public Advocates Office filed a joint motion to adopt a settlement agreement between the two parties resolving all issues in connection with the general rate case. Among other things, the settlement incorporates a previous stipulation in the case, which authorizes a new return on equity for GSWC's electric segment of 9.60%, as compared to its previously authorized return of 9.95%. The stipulation also included a capital structure and debt cost similar to those approved by the CPUC in March 2018 in connection with GSWC's water segment cost of capital proceeding. Because of the delay in finalizing the electric general rate case, billed electric revenues in 2018 were based on 2017 adopted rates, pending a final decision by the CPUC in this rate case application. Had the new rates in the settlement agreement been approved by the CPUC prior to December 31, 2018, the electric segment's gross margin would have increased by approximately $2.0 million, or $0.04 per share, for the year ended December 31, 2018. A decision in this case is expected in 2019 and when approved by the CPUC, the new rates will be retroactive to January 1, 2018. Accordingly, Registrant will record the 2018 increase to earnings in the period in which a CPUC decision is received.\nCost of Capital Proceeding for GSWC's Water Segment:\nIn March 2018, the CPUC issued a final decision in the cost of capital proceeding for GSWC and three other investor-owned water utilities that serve California. Among other things, the final decision adopts for GSWC (i) a return on equity of 8.90%, (ii) a cost of debt of 6.6%, (iii) a capital structure with 57% equity and 43% debt, (iv) a return on rate base of 7.91%, and (v) the continuation of the water cost of capital adjustment mechanism. GSWC's prior authorized return on equity and equity ratio for its water segment were 9.43% and 55%, respectively, with a return on rate base of 8.34%. The newly authorized return on rate base of 7.91% reflects a true-up of GSWC's embedded debt cost from 6.99% to 6.60%. The reduced debt costs contributed approximately 18 basis points to the 43-basis-point drop in the authorized return on rate base.\nTax Cuts and Jobs Act (\"Tax Act\"):\nOn December 22, 2017, the Tax Act was signed into federal law. The provisions of this major tax reform were generally effective January 1, 2018. The most significant provisions of the Tax Act impacting GSWC are the reduction of the federal corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21% and the elimination of bonus depreciation for regulated utilities. As a result, for the year ended December 31, 2018, the water-revenue requirement was reduced by approximately $12.5 million as compared to 2017 as a result of the Tax Act, which was largely offset by a decrease in income tax expense, resulting in no material impact to earnings. Pursuant to a CPUC directive, the 2018 impact of the Tax Act on the water adopted revenue requirement was tracked in a memorandum account effective January 1, 2018. On July 1, 2018, new lower water rates, which incorporate the new federal income tax rate, were implemented for all water ratemaking areas. As of December 31, 2018, GSWC had an over-collection of $7.1 million related to the water segment tracked and recorded as a regulatory liability.\nThe CPUC also ordered GSWC to update its pending electric general rate case filing, which will determine new electric rates for the years 2018 - 2021, to reflect the lower federal corporate income tax rate. For the year ended December 31, 2018, GSWC reduced electric revenues by approximately $1.2 million, which was also largely offset by a corresponding decrease in income tax expense, resulting in no material impact to earnings.\nOther Regulatory Matters\nApplication to Transfer Electric Utility Operations to New Subsidiary:\nOn December 14, 2018, GSWC filed an application with the CPUC to effectuate a reorganization plan that would transfer BVES from a division of GSWC to Bear Valley Electric Service, Inc. ( BVES Inc.\u201d), a newly created separate legal entity and stand-alone subsidiary of AWR. Due to the differences in operations, regulations and risks, management believes a separate electric legal entity and stand-alone subsidiary of AWR is in the best interests of customers, employees, and the communities served. This reorganization plan is subject to CPUC approval and, if approved, is not expected to result in a substantive change to Registrant's operations and business segments. In February 2019, the City of Big Bear Lake filed a protest to the application, to which GSWC filed reply comments with the CPUC. The CPUC has not established a timeline for its review of the application.\nFor more information regarding significant regulatory matters, see Note 3 of Notes to Financial Statements\u201d included in Part II, Item 8, in Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\nEnvironmental Matters\nAWR's subsidiaries are subject to stringent environmental regulations, including the 1996 amendments to the Federal Safe Drinking Water Act. GSWC is required to comply with the safe drinking water standards established by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency ( U.S. EPA\u201d) and the Division of Drinking Water (\"DDW\"), under the State Water Resources Control Board (\"SWRCB\"). The U.S. EPA regulates contaminants that may have adverse health effects that are known or likely to occur at levels of public health concern, and the regulation of which will provide a meaningful opportunity for health risk reduction. The DDW, acting on behalf of the U.S. EPA, administers the U.S. EPA's program in California. Similar state agencies administer these rules in the other states in which Registrant operates.\nGSWC currently tests its water supplies and water systems according to, among other things, requirements listed in the Federal Safe Drinking Water Act ( SDWA\u201d). GSWC works proactively with third parties and governmental agencies to address issues relating to known contamination threatening GSWC water sources. GSWC also incurs operating costs for testing to determine the levels, if any, of the constituents in its sources of supply and additional expense to treat contaminants in order to meet the federal and state maximum contaminant level standards and consumer demands. GSWC expects to incur additional capital costs as well as increased operating costs to maintain or improve the quality of water delivered to its customers in light of anticipated stress on water resources associated with watershed and aquifer pollution, as well as to meet future water quality standards and consumer expectations. The CPUC ratemaking process provides GSWC with the opportunity to recover prudently incurred capital and operating costs in future filings associated with achieving water quality standards. Management believes that such incurred and expected future costs should be authorized for recovery by the CPUC.\nMatters Relating to Environmental Cleanup\nGSWC has been involved in environmental remediation and cleanup at a plant site ( Chadron Plant\u201d) that contained an underground storage tank that was used to store gasoline for its vehicles. This tank was removed from the ground in July 1990 along with the dispenser and ancillary piping. Since then, GSWC has been involved in various remediation activities at this site.\nAs of December 31, 2018, the total spent to cleanup and remediate GSWC's plant facility was approximately $5.9 million, of which $1.5 million has been paid by the State of California Underground Storage Tank Fund. Amounts paid by GSWC have been included in rate base and approved by the CPUC for recovery. As of December 31, 2018, GSWC has a regulatory asset and an accrued liability for the estimated additional cost of $1.3 million to complete the cleanup at the site. The estimate includes costs for continued activities of groundwater cleanup and monitoring, future soil treatment, and site closure related activities. The ultimate cost may vary as there are many unknowns in remediation of underground gasoline spills and this is an estimate based on currently available information. Management also believes it is probable that the estimated additional costs will be approved for inclusion in rate base by the CPUC.\nLead Testing in Schools\nIn January 2017, California State Water Resources Control Board - Division of Drinking Water (DDW) issued a permit amendment that required all community water systems to test the schools in their service area for lead, if sampling is requested in writing by the institution's officials. In addition, the Governor of California signed an assembly bill, which requires all community water systems that serve a school site of a local educational agency with a building constructed before January 1, 2010, to test for lead in the potable water system of the school site on or before July 1, 2019. GSWC has been working extensively with the schools in its service areas for the last several months. As a result of concerted outreach to the schools, GSWC has completed lead sampling at approximately 88 percent of the schools in its service area as of December 31, 2018, as compared to the State average of 35 percent. GSWC will continue to work with the remaining schools in its service area to meet the July 1, 2019 deadline. Management cannot predict if all schools will cooperate and complete the testing, and as a result cannot predict complete compliance with this regulation by the deadline.\nMatters Relating to Military Privatization Contracts\nEach of the Military Utility Privatization Subsidiaries is responsible for testing the water and wastewater systems on the military bases on which it operates in accordance with applicable law.\nEach of the Military Utility Privatization Subsidiaries has the right to seek an equitable adjustment to its contract in the event that there are changes in environmental laws, a change in the quality of water used in providing water service or wastewater discharged by the U.S. government, or contamination of the air or soil not caused by the fault or negligence of the Military Utility Privatization Subsidiary. These changes can impact operations and maintenance and renewal and replacement costs under the contracts. The U.S. government is responsible for environmental contamination due to its fault or negligence and for environmental contamination that occurred prior to the execution of a contract.\nSecurity Issues\nGSWC has security systems and infrastructure in place intended to prevent unlawful intrusion, service disruption and cyber-attacks. GSWC utilizes a variety of physical security measures to protect its facilities. GSWC also considers advances in security and emergency preparedness technology and relevant industry developments in developing its capital-improvement plans. GSWC intends to seek approval of the CPUC to recover any additional costs that it incurs in enhancing the security, reliability and resiliency of its water and electric systems.\nThe Military Utility Privatization Subsidiaries operate facilities within the boundaries of military bases which provide limited access to the general public. To further enhance security, in prior years, certain upgrades were completed at various military bases through contract modifications funded by the U.S. government.\nRegistrant has evaluated its cyber-security systems and continues to address identified areas of improvement with respect to U.S. government regulations regarding cyber-security of government contractors. These improvements include the physical security at all of the office and employee facilities it operates. Registrant believes it is in compliance with these regulations.\nDespite its efforts, Registrant cannot guarantee that intrusions, cyber-attacks or other attacks will not cause water or electric system problems, disrupt service to customers, compromise important data or systems, or result in unintended release of customer or employee information.\nDrought Impact\nIn May 2018, the California Legislature passed two bills that provide a framework for long-term water-use efficiency standards and drought planning and resiliency. The initial steps in implementation of this legislation has been laid out in a summary document by the California Department of Water Resources (\"DWR\") and State Water Resources Control Board (\"SWQCB\"). Over the next several years, State agencies, water suppliers and other entities will be working to meet the requirements and timelines of plan implementation. A notable milestone is the establishment of indoor water use standard of 55 gallons per capita per day (gpcd) until 2025 at which time the standard may be reduced to 52.5 gpcd or a new standard as recommend by DWR.\nCalifornia's recent period of multi-year drought resulted in reduced recharge to the state's groundwater basins. GSWC utilizes groundwater from numerous groundwater basins throughout the state. Several of these basins, especially smaller basins, experienced lower groundwater levels because of the drought. Several of GSWC's service areas rely on groundwater as their only source of supply. Given the critical nature of the groundwater levels in California's Central Coast area, GSWC implemented mandatory water restrictions in certain service areas, in accordance with CPUC procedures. In the event of water supply shortages beyond the locally available supply, GSWC would need to transport additional water from other areas, increasing the cost of water supply.\nThe 2017-2018 water year was a dry year, with rainfall in northern California being below normal levels. However, precipitation to date in 2019 has been at or above normal levels with statewide snowpack at above 100% of average.\nAs of February 19, 2019, the U.S. Drought Monitor estimated less than 2 percent of California in the rank of Severe Drought\u201d while approximately 4 percent continued in the rank of Moderate Drought.\u201d This is in comparison to February 20, 2018 when approximately 20 percent of the State was considered in a Severe Drought\u201d and 48 percent was considered in \"Moderate Drought\". If dry conditions return, the SWQCB or other regulatory agencies may impose emergency drought actions.\nGSWC's Water Supply\nDuring 2018, GSWC delivered approximately 63.3 million hundred cubic feet ( ccf\u201d) of water to its customers, which is an average of about 398 acre-feet per day (an acre-foot is approximately 435.6 ccf or 326,000 gallons). Approximately 56% of GSWC's supply came from groundwater production wells situated throughout GSWC's service areas. GSWC supplemented its groundwater production with wholesale purchases from Metropolitan Water District (\"MWD\") member agencies and regional water suppliers (roughly 41% of total demand) and with authorized diversions from rivers (roughly 3%) under contracts with the United States Bureau of Reclamation ( Bureau\u201d) and the Sacramento Municipal Utility District ( SMUD\u201d). GSWC also utilizes recycled water supplies to serve recycled water customers in several service areas. During 2017, GSWC supplied 62.2 million ccf of water, approximately 55% of which was produced from groundwater sources and 45% was purchased from regional wholesalers and surface water diversions under contracts with the Bureau and SMUD. GSWC continually assesses its water rights and groundwater storage assets.\nGroundwater\nOver the years, population growth in GSWC's service areas and increases in the amount of groundwater used have resulted in both cooperative and judicially enforced regimes for owning water rights and managing groundwater basins for\nlong-term sustainability. GSWC management actively participates in efforts to protect groundwater basins from over-use and from contamination and to protect its water rights. In some periods, these efforts require reductions in groundwater pumping and increased reliance on alternative water resources.\nGSWC has a diverse water supply portfolio which includes approximately 73,400 acre-feet of adjudicated groundwater rights, surface water rights, and a number of unadjudicated water rights to help meet supply requirements. The productivity of GSWC's groundwater resources varies from year to year depending upon a variety of factors, including the amount, duration, length and location of rainfall, the availability of imported replenishment water, the amount of water previously stored in groundwater basins, the amount and seasonality of water use by GSWC's customers and others, evolving challenges to water quality, and a variety of legal limitations on use if a groundwater basin is, or may be, in an overdrafted condition.\nOn September 16, 2014, the Governor of California signed a package of three bills, which taken together are known as the Sustainable Groundwater Management Act.\u201d The purpose of the act is to provide local agencies with tools and authority to manage groundwater basins in a sustainable manner over the long term. Local Groundwater Sustainability Agencies\u201d are to be formed for each defined groundwater basin, and Groundwater Sustainability Plans must be completed for those basins by the year 2022 (by 2020 for those considered in critical overdraft). The act contains numerous provisions to protect existing water rights, and is not anticipated to infringe upon or otherwise alter existing surface water or groundwater rights under current law. GSWC intends to cooperate to the fullest extent allowed in the development of these Groundwater Sustainability Agencies and resulting Groundwater Sustainability Plans to protect its interests in proper management of these groundwater basins.\nMetropolitan Water District /State Water Project\nWater supplies available to the MWD through the State Water Project (\"SWP\") vary from year to year based on several factors. Historically, weather was the primary factor in determining annual deliveries. However, biological opinions issued in late 2007 have limited water diversions through the Sacramento/San Joaquin Delta ( Delta\u201d) resulting in pumping restrictions on the SWP. Even with variable SWP deliveries, MWD has been able to provide sufficient quantities of water to satisfy the needs of its member agencies and their customers. Under its Integrated Resources Plan, MWD estimates that it can meet its member agencies' demands over at least the next 20 years.\nEvery year, the California Department of Water Resources (\"DWR\") establishes the SWP allocation for water deliveries to the state water contractors. The SWP is a major source of water for the MWD. DWR generally establishes a percentage allocation of delivery requests based on a number of factors, including weather patterns, snow-pack levels, reservoir levels and biological diversion restrictions. In February 2019, DWR set an initial SWP delivery allocation at 35% of requests for the 2019 calendar year. This allocation will likely change depending on rain and snowfall received this winter.\nImported Water\nGSWC also manages a portfolio of water supply arrangements with water wholesalers who may import water from outside the immediate service area. For example, GSWC has contracts with various governmental entities (principally MWD member agencies) and other parties to purchase water through a total of 61 connections for distribution to customers, in addition to numerous emergency connections. MWD is a public agency organized and managed to provide a supplemental, imported supply to its member public agencies. There are 26 such member agencies, consisting of 14 cities, 11 municipal water districts and one county water authority. GSWC has 45 connections to MWD's water distribution facilities and those of member agencies. GSWC purchases MWD water through six separate member agencies aggregating 49,807 acre-feet annually. MWD's principal source of water is the SWP and the Colorado River via the Colorado River Aqueduct.\nGSWC has contracts to purchase water or water rights for an aggregate amount of $4.4 million as of December 31, 2018. Included in the $4.4 million is a remaining commitment of $2.2 million under an agreement with the City of Claremont ( the City\u201d) to lease water rights that were ascribed to the City as part of the Six Basins adjudication. The initial term of the agreement expires in 2028. GSWC may exercise an option to renew this agreement for 10 additional years. The remaining $2.2 million is for commitments for purchased water with other third parties, which expire through 2038.\nMilitary Utility Privatization Subsidiaries\nThe U.S. government is responsible for providing the source of supply for all water on each of the bases served by the Military Utility Privatization Subsidiaries at no cost to the Military Utility Privatization Subsidiaries. Once received from the U.S. government, ASUS is responsible for ensuring the continued compliance of the provided source of supply with all federal, state and local regulations.\nNew Accounting Pronouncements\nRegistrant is subject to newly issued requirements as well as changes in existing requirements issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board.

electricity to customers in California. Rates charged to customers are regulated by the CPUC. \n\n- ASUS operates water and wastewater systems at military bases under 50-year contracts with the U.S. government. Revenues come from operations/maintenance fees and construction activities.\n\n- For 2018, consolidated operating revenues were $436.8 million, down 1% from 2017. Net income was $63.9 million, down 8% from 2017.\n\n- GSWC has filed general rate cases for its water and electric segments to determine new rates for 2019-2021. Settlements have been reached and await CPUC approval.\n\n- The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act lowered the federal corporate tax rate, resulting in reduced revenues and income tax expense for GSWC in 2018, but minimal impact on net earnings.\n\n- Capital expenditures were $125.1 million in 2018 and are estimated at $115-125 million for 2019. Funding comes from cash flows, debt issuance, and equity investments. \n\n- Drought conditions have improved in California but GSWC continues efforts to protect groundwater basins and utilize diverse water supply sources.\n\n- GSWC and ASUS face various regulatory compliance matters related to water quality, environmental cleanup, lead testing, and cybersecurity.\n\n- The MD&A provides analysis of financial performance, capital resources, liquidity, and key business developments and risks."}
