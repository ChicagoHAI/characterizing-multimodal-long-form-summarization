communities and businesses worldwide, including those in the Fifth District. The effects of COVID-19 continue to evolve, and the full impact and duration of the virus are unknown. Throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, we have continued to fulfill our mission of providing robust access to a key source of readily available and competitively priced wholesale funding to member financial institutions and supporting our commitment to affordable housing and community investment. Our capital and liquidity positions remained strong, as did our overall ability to fund operations through the issuance of Consolidated Obligations at acceptable interest costs. Additionally, overall residual credit risk exposure from our Credit Services, mortgage loan portfolio, investments, and derivative transactions has remained de minimis. We continue to monitor the effects of COVID-19, including the impact of variants, and are committed to assisting members and their communities as impacts related to the pandemic continue to unfold.\nFinancial Condition\nMission Assets and Activities\nPrimary Mission Assets (i.e., principal balances of Advances and mortgage loans held for portfolio) and Supplemental Mission Activities (i.e., Letters of Credit, Mandatory Delivery Contracts and standby bond purchase agreements) are the primary means by which we fulfill our mission with direct connections to members and what we refer to as Mission Assets and Activities. We regularly monitor our concentration of Mission Assets and Activities. One measure we use to assess mission achievement is our Primary Mission Asset ratio, which measures the sum of average Advances and mortgage loans as a percentage of average Consolidated Obligations (adjusted for certain high-quality liquid assets, as permitted by regulation). In 2021, the Primary Mission Asset ratio averaged 69 percent, slightly below the Finance Agency's preferred ratio of 70 percent. In assessing overall mission achievement, we also consider supplemental sources of Mission Assets and Activities, the most significant of which is Letters of Credit issued for the benefit of members.\nThe following table summarizes our Mission Assets and Activities.\nTable 11: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Year Ended December 31, </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Ending Balances </td> <td> </td> <td>Average Balances </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(In millions) </td> <td>2021 </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2021 </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Primary Mission Assets (1):\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Advances </td> <td>$ </td> <td>22,954 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>25,007 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>23,721 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>42,917 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Mortgage loans held for portfolio </td> <td>7,402 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>9,316 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>7,931 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>10,995 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total Primary Mission Assets </td> <td>$ </td> <td>30,356 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>34,323 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>31,652 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>53,912 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Supplemental Mission Activities (2):\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Letters of Credit (notional) </td> <td>$ </td> <td>34,637 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>28,812 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>33,922 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>20,141 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Mandatory Delivery Contracts (notional) </td> <td>250 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>137 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>249 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>338 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Standby bond purchase agreements (notional) </td> <td>27 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>35 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>31 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>68 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total Supplemental Mission Activities </td> <td>$ </td> <td>34,914 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>28,984 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>34,202 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>20,547 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\n(1)Amounts represent principal balances.\n(2)Amounts represent off-balance sheet commitments.\nAdvance principal balances decreased $2.1 billion (eight percent) from year-end 2020. Advance balances remained below pre-pandemic levels in 2021 due to increased liquidity in the financial markets and substantial growth in deposits at member institutions. Average principal Advance balances for 2021 decreased $19.2 billion (45 percent) compared to 2020. Advance balances in the first quarter of 2020 were significantly higher as members sought additional liquidity during the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. However, most of these Advances matured or were prepaid by the end of 2020, and the demand for Advances has remained low. Advance demand could improve as one or more of the following occur: reductions in government liquidity programs, changes in the Federal Reserve monetary policy, or a rise in interest rates.\nAdvance balances are often volatile due to members' ability to quickly, normally on the same day, increase or decrease their amount of Advances. We believe that a key benefit of membership comes from our business model as a wholesale lender GSE, which provides members flexibility in their Advance funding levels and helps support their asset-liability management needs. We act as a readily available source of funding for our members. Our business model is designed to support significant changes in asset levels without having to undergo material changes in staffing, operations, risk practices, or general resource needs. A key reason for this scalability is that our Capital Plan provides for additional capital when Advances grow and the opportunity for us to retire capital when Advances decline, thereby acting, along with our efficient level of operating expenses, to preserve competitive profitability.\nThe MPP principal balance fell $1.9 billion (21 percent) from year-end 2020. During 2021, we purchased $1.7 billion of mortgage loans, while principal reductions of $3.6 billion reflected the continuing high levels of mortgage loan refinance activity.\nLetters of Credit increased $5.8 billion (20 percent) from year-end 2020 primarily due to members using them to secure elevated levels of public unit deposits. We normally earn fees on Letters of Credit based on the actual average amount of the Letters utilized, which generally is less than the notional amount issued.\nInvestments\nThe balance of investments at December 31, 2021 was $29.4 billion, an increase of $2.4 billion from year-end 2020. At December 31, 2021, investments included $10.8 billion of MBS and $18.6 billion of other investments, which consisted primarily of highly-rated short-term instruments and longer-term U.S. Treasury and GSE obligations held for liquidity. All of our MBS held at December 31, 2021 were issued and guaranteed by Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac or a U.S. agency.\nInvestments averaged $28.1 billion in 2021, a decrease of $4.8 billion (15 percent) compared to the average in 2020. The decrease in average investments reflected lower liquidity investments needed in light of the reduced Advance demand and lower MBS given the elevated levels of prepayments throughout 2021 as a result of the low interest rate environment and inability to quickly replace those investments with suitable alternatives. However, the ending balance of MBS increased primarily due to the purchase of $3.1 billion of new MBS in the second half of 2021. Liquidity investments can vary significantly on a daily basis during times of volatility in Advance balances. We maintained a robust amount of asset liquidity throughout 2021 across a variety of liquidity measures, as discussed in the \"Liquidity Risk\" section of \"Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Risk Management.\"\nCapital\nCapital adequacy surpassed all minimum regulatory capital requirements in 2021. The GAAP and regulatory capital-to-assets ratios at December 31, 2021 were 6.26 percent and 6.28 percent, respectively. Both ratios exceeded the regulatory required minimum of four percent. Regulatory capital includes mandatorily redeemable capital stock accounted for as a liability under GAAP. GAAP and regulatory capital decreased $0.1 billion and $0.2 billion, respectively, from year-end 2020. Retained earnings totaled $1.3 billion at December 31, 2021, a decrease of one percent from year-end 2020. We believe the amount of retained earnings is sufficient to protect against members' impairment risk of their capital stock investment in the FHLB and to provide the opportunity to stabilize or increase future dividends.\nResults of Operations\nOverall Results\nOur earnings over time reflect the combination of a stable business model and conservative management of risk. Key market driven factors that can cause significant periodic volatility in our profitability are changes in the level of interest rates, changes in spreads between benchmark interest rates and our short-term funding costs, recognition of net amortization due to accelerated prepayments of mortgage assets, and fair value adjustments related to the use of derivatives and the associated hedged items. Our profitability may also be affected by our members' overall Advance demand, which is largely influenced by the monetary policies of the U.S. government and its agencies, including the Federal Reserve, and general economic conditions. The table below summarizes our results of operations.\nTable 12: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Year Ended December 31, </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(Dollars in millions) </td> <td>2021 </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net income </td> <td>$ </td> <td>42 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>276 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>276 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Affordable Housing Program assessments </td> <td>5 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>31 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>31 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Return on average equity (ROE) </td> <td>1.08 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>5.78 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5.65 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Return on average assets </td> <td>0.07 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.31 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.28 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Weighted average dividend rate </td> <td>2.00 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2.23 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5.05 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Average short-term interest rates (1)\n</td> <td>0.12 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.51 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2.24 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>ROE spread to average short-term interest rates </td> <td>0.96 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5.27 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3.41 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Dividend rate spread to average short-term interest rates </td> <td>1.88 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1.72 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2.81 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\n(1)Average short-term interest rates consist of 3-month LIBOR and the Federal funds effective rate.\nNet income decreased $234 million in 2021. The decline in profitability in 2021 compared to 2020 was primarily due to low interest rates and an unprecedented amount of liquidity in the financial markets due to governmental stimulus actions, which impacted the following:\n\u25aaAdvances. Average Advance balances declined 45 percent. Although Advances grew significantly during the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic as members sought additional liquidity, balances subsequently fell in 2020 and have remained below pre-pandemic levels due to increased liquidity in the financial markets and increased deposit levels at member institutions. Additionally, Advance prepayment fees declined since members prepaid fewer Advances in 2021 than in the prior year.\n\u25aaMortgage Assets. The spreads earned on mortgage assets declined due to the accelerated payoff of higher-yielding mortgages at a faster pace than the associated debt funding them. The historically low long-term interest rates led to prepayments occurring faster than the purchases of new mortgage assets, which also resulted in the average balances of mortgage assets declining 25 percent.\nAdditionally, the FHLB sold interest rate swaptions in the first quarter of 2020 in response to changes in interest rates, which resulted in net realized gains of approximately $69 million before assessments. The FHLB did not sell any interest rate swaptions in 2021. The FHLB uses swaptions to hedge market risk exposure associated with holding fixed-rate mortgage assets and may sell them to offset the risk incurred due to changes in interest rates.\nIn 2021, we accrued $5 million for the Affordable Housing Program (AHP) pool of funds, a decrease of $26 million compared to 2020 given the lower level of earnings noted above. The funds accrued in 2021 will be available to members in 2022. In addition to the required AHP assessment, we provided voluntary sponsorship of two other housing programs. These programs provided funds to cover accessibility and emergency repairs for special needs and elderly homeowners and funds for the replacement or repair of homes damaged or destroyed by natural disasters within the Fifth District.\nIn December 2021, we paid stockholders a quarterly dividend at a 2.00 percent annualized rate on their capital investment in our company, which is 1.88 percentage points above fourth quarter average short-term interest rates.\nEffect of Interest Rate Environment\nTrends in market interest rates and the resulting shapes of the market yield curves strongly influence our results of operations and profitability because of how they affect members' demand for Mission Assets and Activities, spreads on assets, funding costs and decisions in managing the tradeoffs in our market risk/return profile.

</tr>\n</table>\n(1) Current coupon rate of Fannie Mae par MBS indications.\nThe target overnight Federal funds rate was in the range of zero to 0.25 percent at December 31, 2021, unchanged from year-end 2020. The low interest rate environment reflects the Federal Reserve's response to the COVID-19 pandemic to keep interest rates low to facilitate liquidity. In March 2022, the Federal Reserve began to respond to inflationary concerns by increasing the target overnight Federal funds rate to a range of 0.25 to 0.50 percent while indicating further expected rate hikes in 2022.\nAverage short-term rates were approximately 30 to 50 basis points lower in 2021 compared to 2020 and average mortgage rates remained low, with the 15-year rate remaining the same while the 30-year rate increased only 15 basis points during the year. The overall low interest rate environment negatively impacted income in 2021 primarily because of a decrease in earnings generated from investing capital and lower spreads earned on mortgage assets due to the accelerated payoff of higher-yielding mortgages at a faster pace than the associated debt funding them.\nDuring 2021, as in 2020, the market risk exposure to changing interest rates was moderate overall and well within policy limits. We believe that longer-term profitability would not become uncompetitive unless interest rates were to change quickly and significantly. In the short-term, profitability could become uncompetitive if long-term interest rates decrease in excess of 100 basis points leading to faster prepayments of mortgage assets, which would further accelerate the recognition of purchased premiums.\nRegulatory and Legislative Developments\nGeneral\nThe FHLBank System is subject to legislative and regulatory oversight. Legislative and regulatory actions applicable, directly or indirectly, to the FHLBank System in the last decade have increased uncertainty regarding the business model and membership base under which the FHLBanks may operate in the future. This is due primarily to the uncertainty around potential future GSE reform, and the evolution of mortgage financing moving towards financial institutions currently not\neligible for FHLBank membership. See Item 1A. Risk Factors for more discussion. We cannot predict the ultimate outcome of GSE reform and whether our membership base will be legislatively and regulatorily permitted to evolve in concert with the housing finance market.\nFHLBank Membership\nOn September 9, 2021, the Finance Agency published a Supervisory Letter on FHLBank Membership Issues covering five issues, including (1) requirements for de novo Community Development Financial Institutions, (2) automatic transfer of membership, (3) large non-member institutions merging with small member institutions, (4) membership applicant's compliance with financial condition\u201d requirements, and (5) the definition of insurance company. The Supervisory Letter expresses the Finance Agency's views on these matters, which include the articulation of certain restrictions on eligibility for membership. The restrictions could result in:\n\u25aafewer opportunities for FHLBank membership; and/or\n\u25aaineligibility for continued membership by certain entities, most notably Community Development Financial Institutions, certain types of insurance companies and large institutions that have acquired small members.\nAccordingly, the restrictions could result in reduced opportunities for us to grow our membership and, in turn, fewer opportunities to provide our financial services. We continue to evaluate the Supervisory Letter and its effect on our membership.\nRegulatory Interpretation on Eligibility of Mortgage Participations as Collateral for FHLBank Advances\nOn October 4, 2021, the Finance Agency published a Regulatory Interpretation on Eligibility of Mortgage Loan Participations as Collateral for FHLBank Advances, which became effective on December 13, 2021. The Regulatory Interpretation addresses whether an FHLBank can accept as collateral mortgage loan participations that cannot be readily liquidated in the form they are pledged. The Regulatory Interpretation concludes that mortgage loan participations must meet the requirements of Finance Agency regulation 12 CFR 1266.7(a)(4), including the requirement that the collateral can be liquidated in due course\u201d in order to be eligible to secure Advances. It further concludes that participations for which there would be a known impediment to liquidation do not meet such requirement and therefore are not eligible collateral for Advances. Finally, the Regulatory Interpretation rescinds prior guidance from FHLBank System regulators that provide mortgage loan participations may be eligible as collateral under regulatory provisions other than 12 CFR 1266.7(a)(4). Although we do not currently expect the Regulatory Interpretation to have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations, this restriction on collateral may negatively impact future borrowing by certain members.\nFair Housing and Fair Lending Enforcement\nOn July 9, 2021, the Finance Agency published a Policy Statement on Fair Lending to communicate its general position on monitoring and information gathering, supervisory examinations, and administrative enforcement related to the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, the Fair Housing Act, and the Federal Housing Enterprises Financial Safety and Soundness Act. The Policy Statement became effective on the date of publication.\nOn August 12, 2021, the Finance Agency and the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development announced they had entered into a Memorandum of Understanding regarding fair housing and fair lending enforcement. Under the Memorandum of Understanding, the two agencies will focus on enhancing their enforcement of the Fair Housing Act, and their oversight of Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and the FHLBanks.\nWe continue to monitor these actions and guidance as they evolve and to evaluate their potential impact on us.\nAffordable Housing and Community Investment\nLegislation has been introduced in the U.S. Senate and House of Representatives that, if enacted in its proposed form, would require the FHLBanks to set aside higher percentages of their annual earnings for their affordable housing and community investment programs than are currently required by law. The FHLBanks continue to actively monitor any such potential legislation and developments.\nLIBOR Transition\nWe are planning for the replacement of LIBOR and the establishment of SOFR as the recommended alternative to LIBOR. Under the July 2017 and March 2021 announcements by the United Kingdom's Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), the one-week and two-month U.S. dollar LIBOR settings ceased to be provided by any administrator and were no longer representative as of January 1, 2022. The remaining U.S. dollar LIBOR settings will either cease to be provided by any administrator or no longer be representative immediately after June 30, 2023. Although the FCA does not expect these remaining LIBOR settings\nto become unrepresentative before the cessation date, there is no assurance that any of them will continue to be published or be representative through any particular date. In addition, the Adjustable Interest Rate (LIBOR) Act was signed into law on March 15, 2022. The legislation provides a statutory fallback mechanism and safe harbor on a nationwide basis to replace LIBOR with a benchmark rate, selected by the Federal Reserve Board based on SOFR, for certain contracts that reference LIBOR and contain no or insufficient fallback provisions, including fallback rates that are in any way based on LIBOR.\nAccordingly, we have developed and implemented a LIBOR transition plan to remediate our LIBOR-linked financial instruments and contracts. As the market activity in SOFR-linked financial instruments has continued to develop, we have offered SOFR-linked Consolidated Obligations and SOFR-linked Advances on an ongoing basis. In addition, we have been using SOFR-based derivatives to manage interest-rate risk, began purchasing SOFR-linked MBS in the second quarter of 2021, and began converting certain LIBOR-based derivatives to SOFR in 2021. During 2022, we expect to continue to convert certain LIBOR-based derivatives prior to the cessation of LIBOR to an alternative reference rate, such as SOFR. Collectively, we believe these efforts have reduced our LIBOR exposure and have kept us on track for the full replacement of LIBOR.\nThe following table presents our remaining LIBOR-indexed Advances, investment securities and derivatives at December 31, 2021. At December 31, 2021, all of our variable rate Consolidated Obligations were linked to SOFR.\nTable 15: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(In millions) </td> <td>Maturing on or before June 30, 2023 </td> <td> </td> <td>Maturing after June 30, 2023 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>LIBOR-Indexed Variable Rate Financial Instruments </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Advances by redemption term </td> <td>$ </td> <td>286 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>3,009 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>MBS by contractual maturity (1)\n</td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4,555 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total principal amount </td> <td>$ </td> <td>286 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>7,564 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Derivatives, notional amount by termination date </td> <td>$ </td> <td>3,375 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>3,454 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\n(1)MBS are presented by contractual maturity; however, their expected maturities will likely differ from contractual maturities as borrowers may have the right to call or prepay obligations with or without call or prepayment fees.\nThe market transition away from LIBOR towards SOFR is complicated, including the possible development of term structures and credit adjustments to accommodate differences between LIBOR and SOFR and the potential introduction of other alternative reference rates. As such, we are not currently able to predict the ultimate impact of such a transition on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION\nCredit

actively use our products augments the value of membership to all members. For example, such activity improves our operating efficiency, increases our earnings and thereby contributions to housing and community investment programs. This activity may enable us to obtain more favorable funding costs, and helps us maintain competitively priced products.\nMortgage Loans Held for Portfolio (Mortgage Purchase Program, or MPP)\nMPP balances are influenced by conditions in the housing and mortgage markets, the competitiveness of prices we offer to purchase loans as well as program features, and activity from our largest sellers. Our ongoing strategy for the MPP has two components: 1) increase the number of regular sellers and participants in the program; and 2) manage purchases and balances at a prudent level relative to capital and total assets to effectively manage market and credit risks consistent with our risk appetite.\nThe table below shows principal purchases and reductions of loans in the MPP for each of the last two years.

MPP principal paydowns increased in 2021 to a 34 percent annual constant prepayment rate, compared to the 30 percent rate for all of 2020, driven by the historically low mortgage rates. Our purchases of new loans were much lower than the elevated level of repayments during 2021 due to balance sheet concentration considerations given our lower total assets and capital balances. Purchases of new MPP loans in 2021 continued to offer favorable returns.\nOverall, MPP yields on existing portfolio balances, net of funding and hedging costs, have declined and are expected to remain at lower levels in the short-term due to the accelerated payoff of higher-yielding mortgages at a faster pace than the associated debt funding them. Despite the lower yields on existing MPP balances, the metrics of portfolio return relative to their market and credit risks continue to indicate that the MPP has generated, and can be expected to continue to generate, a profitable long-term, risk-adjusted return.\nHousing and Community Investment\nIn 2021, we accrued $5 million of earnings for the Affordable Housing Program, which will be awarded to members in 2022. The Affordable Housing Program consists of a Competitive Program and a homeownership program called Welcome Home, which assists homebuyers with down payments and closing costs.\nIncluding funds available in 2021 from previous years, we had $25 million available for the Competitive Program in 2021, which we awarded to 51 projects through a single competitive offering. In addition, we disbursed over $10 million to 170 members on behalf of 2,054 homebuyers through the Welcome Home Program, which assists homebuyers with down payments and closing costs.\nAdditionally, in 2021, our Board committed $1.0 million to the Carol M. Peterson Housing Fund, which helped 145 homeowners, and continued its commitment to the Disaster Reconstruction Program. Both are voluntary programs beyond the 10 percent of earnings that we are required by law to set aside for the Affordable Housing Program.\nOur activities to support affordable housing and economic development also include offering Advances through the Affordable Housing Program, Community Investment Program, Economic Development Program and Zero Interest Rate Fund with below-market interest rates at or near funding costs. At the end of 2021, Advance balances under these programs totaled $198 million.\nIn 2021, approximately 34 percent of members applied for funding under our Housing and Community Investment programs.\nInvestments\nThe table below presents the ending and average balances of our investment portfolio.\nTable 23: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(In millions) </td> <td>2021 </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Ending Balance </td> <td> </td> <td>Average Balance </td> <td> </td> <td>Ending Balance </td> <td> </td> <td>Average Balance </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Liquidity investments </td> <td>$ </td> <td>18,589 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>18,576 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>17,285 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>20,548 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>MBS </td> <td>10,803 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>9,186 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>9,756 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>11,864 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other investments (1)\n</td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>340 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td>459 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total investments </td> <td>$ </td> <td>29,392 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>28,102 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>27,041 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>32,871 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\n(1)The average balance includes the rights or obligations to cash collateral, which are included in the fair value of derivative assets or derivative liabilities on the Statements of Condition at period end.\nLiquidity investments are either short-term (primarily overnight), or longer-term investments that can be easily sold and converted to cash. Under the regulatory requirements, liquidity includes certain high-quality liquid assets, which are defined as U.S. Treasury obligations with remaining maturities of 10 years or less held as trading securities or available-for-sale securities. It is normal for liquidity investments to vary by up to several billion dollars on a daily basis. Liquidity investment levels can vary significantly based on changes in the amount of actual Advances, anticipated demand for Advances, liquidity needs, the availability of acceptable net spreads, and the number of eligible counterparties that meet our unsecured credit risk criteria. The average balance of liquidity investments for 2021 fell $2.0 billion (10 percent) from the average balance for all of 2020 due to lower liquidity investments being needed in light of the reduced Advance demand.\nOur overarching strategy for balances of MBS is to keep holdings as close as possible to the regulatory maximum. Finance Agency regulations prohibit us from purchasing MBS if our investment in these securities exceeds three times regulatory capital on the day we intend to purchase the securities. The ratio of MBS to regulatory capital was 2.84 at December 31, 2021. The MBS ratio was lower than our preference to hold it close to the 3.00 regulatory maximum primarily due to the paydowns of MBS given the low interest rate environment. In addition, regulatory limitations regarding the purchase of investments that reference LIBOR slowed the pace at which we were able to replace the prepaid MBS with suitable alternatives that provided an acceptable risk/return tradeoff. However, our purchases of MBS have increased beginning in the second half of 2021 as we purchased $3.1 billion in the last six months of the year. The majority of these purchases were variable-rate MBS linked to SOFR.\nThe balance of MBS at December 31, 2021 consisted of $9.7 billion of securities issued by Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac (of which $7.5 billion were floating-rate securities), and $1.1 billion of securities issued by Ginnie Mae (which are primarily fixed rate).\nThe table below shows principal purchases and paydowns of our MBS for each of the last two years.\nTable 24: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(In millions) </td> <td>MBS Principal </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>2021 </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Balance, beginning of year </td> <td>$ </td> <td>9,745 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>13,447 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Principal purchases </td> <td>3,837 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>149 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Principal paydowns </td> <td>(2,787) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(3,851) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Balance, end of year </td> <td>$ </td> <td>10,795 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>9,745 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nMBS principal paydowns in 2021 equated to a 26 percent annual constant prepayment rate, a slight decrease from the 27 percent rate experienced in 2020. The elevated prepayment rates experienced in 2021 and 2020 is a result of the historically low mortgage rate environment.\nConsolidated Obligations\nWe fund variable-rate assets with Discount Notes (a portion of which may be swapped), adjustable-rate Bonds, and swapped fixed-rate Bonds because they give us the ability to effectively match the underlying rate reset periods embedded in these assets. The balances and composition of our Consolidated Obligations tend to fluctuate with changes in the balances and composition of our assets. In addition, changes in the amount and composition of our funding may be necessary from time to time to meet the days of positive liquidity and asset/liability maturity funding gap requirements discussed in the \"Liquidity Risk\" section of \"Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Risk Management.\"\nThe table below presents the ending and average balances of our participations in Consolidated Obligations.\nTable 25: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(In millions) </td> <td>2021 </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Ending Balance </td> <td> </td> <td>Average Balance </td> <td> </td> <td>Ending Balance </td> <td> </td> <td>Average Balance </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Discount Notes: </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Unswapped </td> <td>$ </td> <td>19,418 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>22,933 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>27,503 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>39,478 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Swapped </td> <td>10,426 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3,156 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3,843 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total par Discount Notes </td> <td>29,844 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>26,089 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>27,503 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>43,321 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other items (1)\n</td> <td>(6) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(1) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(3) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(37) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total Discount Notes </td> <td>29,838 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>26,088 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>27,500 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>43,284 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Bonds: </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Unswapped fixed-rate </td> <td>16,112 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>18,840 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>18,940 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>21,288 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Unswapped adjustable-rate (2)\n</td> <td>850 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6,710 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>10,639 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>13,394 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Swapped fixed-rate </td> <td>7,627 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,737 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,372 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3,547 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total par Bonds </td> <td>24,589 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>28,287 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>31,951 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>38,229 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other items (1)\n</td> <td>13 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>24 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>46 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>68 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total Bonds </td> <td>24,602 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>28,311 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>31,997 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>38,297 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total Consolidated Obligations (3)\n</td> <td>$ </td> <td>54,440 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>54,399 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>59,497 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>81,581 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\n(1)Includes unamortized premiums/discounts, fair value option valuation adjustments, hedging and other basis adjustments.\n(2)At December 31, 2021 and 2020, all unswapped adjustable-rate Bonds were indexed to SOFR.\n(3)The 11 FHLBanks have joint and several liability for the par amount of all of the Consolidated Obligations issued on their behalves. The par amount of the outstanding Consolidated Obligations for all of the FHLBanks was (in millions) $652,862 and $746,772 at December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively.\nThe average balances of Discount Notes and unswapped adjustable-rate Bonds in 2021 were significantly lower compared to the averages in 2020 due to the growth in short-term and variable-rate Advances in the first quarter of 2020 as members sought additional liquidity during the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. However, most of these Advances matured or prepaid by the end of 2020 and the demand for Advances has remained below pre-pandemic levels.\nThe ending balances of swapped Discount Notes and swapped fixed-rate Bonds at the end of 2021 were higher than year-end 2020 due to the market environment at the end of 2021 favoring swapped debt. We swap term Discount Notes and fixed-rate bonds to adjustable-rates in order to match the underlying rate reset periods to the assets the Discount Notes and Bonds are funding as well as reduce the repricing risk of Discount Notes.\nThe following table shows the allocation on December 31, 2021 of unswapped fixed-rate Bonds according to their final remaining maturity and next call date (for callable Bonds).

We consider the regulatory ratio to be a better representation of financial leverage than the GAAP ratio because, although the GAAP ratio treats mandatorily redeemable capital stock as a liability, it protects investors in our debt in the same manner as GAAP capital stock and retained earnings.\nTable 27: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Year Ended December 31, </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(In millions) </td> <td>2021 </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Period End </td> <td> </td> <td>Average </td> <td> </td> <td>Period End </td> <td> </td> <td>Average </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>GAAP and Regulatory Capital </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>GAAP Capital Stock </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2,490 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2,585 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2,641 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>3,567 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Mandatorily Redeemable Capital Stock </td> <td>21 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>19 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>19 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>55 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Regulatory Capital Stock </td> <td>2,511 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,604 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,660 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3,622 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Retained Earnings </td> <td>1,293 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,304 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,304 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,228 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Regulatory Capital </td> <td>$ </td> <td>3,804 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>3,908 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>3,964 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>4,850 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 28: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>2021 </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Period End </td> <td> </td> <td>Average </td> <td> </td> <td>Period End </td> <td> </td> <td>Average </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>GAAP and Regulatory Capital-to-Assets Ratio </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>GAAP </td> <td>6.26 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>6.40 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>6.02 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>5.39 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Regulatory (1)\n</td> <td>6.28 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6.44 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6.07 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5.47 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\n(1) At all times, the FHLB must maintain at least a four percent minimum regulatory capital-to-assets ratio.\nThe following table presents the sources of change in regulatory capital stock balances in 2021 and 2020.\nTable 29: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(In millions) </td> <td>2021 </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Regulatory stock balance at beginning of year </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2,660 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>3,389 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Stock purchases: </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Membership stock </td> <td>20 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>25 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Activity stock </td> <td>1,089 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,110 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Stock repurchases/redemptions: </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Redemption of member excess </td> <td>(60) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(558) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Repurchase of member excess </td> <td>(1,186) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(2,300) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Withdrawals </td> <td>(12) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(6) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Regulatory stock balance at the end of the year </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2,511 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2,660 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nOur business model is structured to be able to absorb sharp changes in assets because we can execute commensurate changes in liability and capital stock balances. For example, in 2021, we issued $1.1 billion of capital stock to members in support of short-term Advance borrowings that were subsequently repaid prior to December 31, 2021. During the same period, we repurchased $1.2 billion of capital stock in response to members' subsequent repayment of Advances.\nA portion of our capital stock is excess, meaning it is not required as a condition to being a member and is not currently capitalizing Mission Assets and Activities. Excess capital stock provides a base of capital to manage financial leverage at prudent levels, augments loss protections for bondholders, and may be used to capitalize a portion of growth in Mission Assets and Activities. At December 31, 2021, the amount of excess stock, as defined by our Capital Plan, was $426 million, an increase of $198 million from year-end 2020. The balance of excess stock may fluctuate as short-term Advance borrowings can be volatile.\nSee the \"Capital Adequacy\" section in Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Risk Management\u201d for discussion of our retained earnings.\nMembership and Stockholders\nIn 2021, we added 11 new member stockholders and lost 21 member stockholders, ending the year at 618 member stockholders. Thirteen of the 21 members lost in 2021 were attributable to intra-district merger activity.\nIn 2021, there were no material changes in the allocation of membership by state, charter type, or asset size. At the end of 2021, the composition of membership by state was Ohio with 303, Kentucky with 161, and Tennessee with 154.\nThe following table provides the number of member stockholders by charter type.\nTable 30: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>December 31, </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>2021 </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Commercial Banks </td> <td>338 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>351 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Savings Institutions </td> <td>76 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>78 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Credit Unions </td> <td>142 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>140 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Insurance Companies </td> <td>55 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>53 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Community Development Financial Institutions </td> <td>7 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total </td> <td>618 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>628 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe following table provides the ownership of capital stock by charter type.\nTable 31: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(In millions) </td> <td>December 31, </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>2021 </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Commercial Banks </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,109 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,459 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Savings Institutions </td> <td>432 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>398 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Credit Unions </td> <td>184 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>179 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Insurance Companies </td> <td>764 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>604 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Community Development Financial Institutions </td> <td>1 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total GAAP Capital Stock </td> <td>2,490 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,641 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Mandatorily Redeemable Capital Stock </td> <td>21 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>19 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total Regulatory Capital Stock </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2,511 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2,660 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nCredit union members hold relatively less stock than their membership proportion because they tend to be smaller than the average member and borrow less.

Accordingly, recalculations based upon the disclosed amounts in millions may produce nominally different results.\nDetails on the individual factors contributing to the level and changes in profitability are explained in the sections below.\nNet Interest Income\nThe largest component of net income is net interest income. Our principal goal in managing net interest income is to balance the trade-offs between maintaining a moderate market risk profile and ensuring profitability remains competitive. Effective risk/return management requires us to focus principally on the relationships among assets and liabilities that affect net interest income, rather than individual balance sheet and income statement accounts in isolation.\nOur ROE normally is lower than that of many other financial institutions because of the cooperative wholesale business model that results in narrow spreads earned on our assets, the moderate overall risk profile, and the strategic objective to have a positive correlation of earnings to short-term interest rates.\nComponents of Net Interest Income\nWe generate net interest income from the following two components:\n\u25aaNet interest rate spread. This component equals the balance of total earning assets multiplied by the difference between the book yield on interest-earning assets and the book cost of interest-bearing liabilities. It is composed of net (amortization)/accretion, prepayment fees on Advances, and all other earnings from interest-earning assets net of funding costs. The latter is the largest component and represents the coupon yields of interest-earning assets net of the coupon costs of interest-bearing liabilities.\n\u25aaEarnings from funding assets with capital ( earnings from capital\u201d). Because of our relatively low net interest rate spread compared to other financial institutions, we have historically derived a substantial portion of net interest income from deploying interest-free capital in interest-earning assets. We deploy much of the capital in short-term and adjustable-rate assets in order to help ensure that ROE moves in the same direction as short-term interest rates and to help control market risk exposure.\nThe following table shows selected components of net interest income. Reasons for the variance in net interest income between the 2021 and 2020 periods are discussed below.\nTable 34: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(Dollars in millions) </td> <td>2021 </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Amount </td> <td> </td> <td>% of Earning Assets </td> <td> </td> <td>Amount </td> <td> </td> <td>% of Earning Assets </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Amount </td> <td> </td> <td>% of Earning Assets </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Components of net interest rate spread:\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net (amortization)/accretion (1) (2)\n</td> <td>$ </td> <td>(87) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(0.15) </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(115) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(0.13) </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(37) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(0.04) </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Prepayment fees on Advances, net (2)\n</td> <td>13 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.02 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>34 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.04 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>8 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.01 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other components of net interest rate spread\n</td> <td>324 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.54 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>441 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.50 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>317 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.33 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total net interest rate spread </td> <td>250 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.41 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>360 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.41 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>288 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.30 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Earnings from funding assets with interest-free capital\n</td> <td>27 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.05 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>46 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.05 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>118 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.12 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total net interest income/net interest margin (3)\n</td> <td>$ </td> <td>277 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.46 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>406 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.46 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>406 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.42 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table>\n(1)Includes monthly recognition of premiums and discounts paid on purchases of mortgage assets, premiums, discounts and concessions paid on Consolidated Obligations and other hedging basis adjustments.\n(2)This component of net interest rate spread has been segregated to display its relative impact.\n(3)Net interest margin is net interest income as a percentage of average total interest-earning assets.\nNet Amortization/Accretion (generally referred to as \"amortization\"): Net amortization can become substantial and volatile with changes in interest rates. When mortgage rates decrease, premium amortization of mortgage assets generally increases, which reduces net interest income. Net amortization in 2021 and 2020 was elevated due to the historically low mortgage rates, which led to accelerated prepayments of mortgage assets. Net amortization was higher in 2020 given the considerable decline in mortgage rates that took place in the first half of 2020. Mortgage rates have remained low, but experienced a small increase in 2021.\nPrepayment Fees on Advances: Fees for members' early repayment of certain Advances, which are included in net interest income, are designed to make us economically indifferent to whether members hold Advances to maturity or repay them before maturity. Advance prepayment fees were moderate in 2021. The higher Advance prepayment fees in 2020 were caused by a higher amount of member prepayments of Advances as interest rates declined.\nOther Components of Net Interest Rate Spread: The total other components of net interest rate spread decreased $117 million in 2021 compared to 2020. The net decrease was primarily due to the factors below.\n2021 Versus 2020\n\u25aaLower average Advance balances-Unfavorable: The $19.4 billion decrease in the average balance of Advances lowered net interest income by an estimated $63 million.\n\u25aaLower spreads earned on mortgage assets-Unfavorable: Lower spreads on the mortgage assets portfolio decreased net interest income by an estimated $58 million. The lower spreads were driven by the decline in average long-term interest rates in 2020, which accelerated the payoff of higher-yielding mortgages at a faster pace than the associated debt funding them.\n\u25aaLower average balances of mortgage assets-Unfavorable: The $2.7 billion decrease in the average balance of mortgage-backed securities and the $3.1 billion decrease in the average balance of mortgage loans held for portfolio lowered net interest income by an estimated $44 million. Mortgage balances declined due to the acceleration of principal cash flows driven by historically low mortgage interest rates.\n\u25aaHigher spreads on shorter-term and floating-rate asset balances-Favorable: Higher spreads on shorter-term assets and floating-rate assets (including those that have been swapped to a floating rate) improved net interest income by an estimated $31 million as the rates on the debt funding these assets declined. However, the increase in net interest income was more than offset by lower non-interest income (loss) primarily due to an increase of $37 million in the net interest settlements being paid on related derivatives not receiving hedge accounting.\n\u25aaUnrealized gains on designated fair value hedges-Favorable: Net unrealized gains on hedged items and derivatives in qualifying fair value hedge relationships improved net interest income by $17 million.\nEarnings from Capital: Earnings from capital decreased $19 million in 2021 compared to 2020 primarily due to lower average short-term interest rates as the Federal Reserve has continued to keep rates low in response to the evolving risks to economic activity from the COVID-19 pandemic.\nAverage Balance Sheet and Rates\nThe following table provides average balances and rates for major balance sheet accounts, which determine the changes in net interest rate spreads. Interest amounts and average rates are affected by our use of derivatives and the related accounting elections we make. Interest amounts reported for Advances, MBS, Other investments and Swapped Bonds include gains (losses) on hedged items and derivatives in qualifying fair value hedge relationships.\nIn addition, the net interest settlements of interest receivables or payables associated with derivatives in a fair value hedge relationship are included in net interest income and interest rate spread. However, if the derivatives do not qualify for fair value hedge accounting, the related net interest settlements of interest receivables or payables are recorded in Non-interest income (loss)\u201d as Net gains (losses) on derivatives\u201d and therefore are excluded from the calculation of net interest rate spread. Amortization associated with some hedging-related basis adjustments is also reflected in net interest income, which affects interest rate spread.\nTable 35: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td>

of derivatives and hedging activities. As noted above, gains (losses) on hedged items and derivatives in qualifying fair value hedge relationships are recorded in interest income or expense. In addition, for derivatives designated as a fair value hedge, the net interest settlements of interest receivables or payables related to such derivatives are recognized as adjustments to the interest income or expense of the designated hedged item. As such, all the effects on earnings of derivatives qualifying for fair value hedge accounting are reflected in net interest income. The effect on earnings from derivatives not receiving fair value hedge accounting is provided in the Non-Interest Income (Loss)\u201d section below.\nTable 39: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(In millions) </td> <td>2021 </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Advances: </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Amortization of hedging activities in net interest income\n</td> <td>$ </td> <td>(1) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(1) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(1) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gains (losses) on designated fair value hedges\n</td> <td>1 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(16) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(6) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net interest settlements included in net interest income\n</td> <td>(110) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(91) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>36 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Investment securities: </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net interest settlements included in net interest income\n</td> <td>(20) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(2) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Mortgage loans: </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Amortization of derivative fair value adjustments in net interest income\n</td> <td>(12) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(12) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(3) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Consolidated Obligation Bonds: </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net interest settlements included in net interest income\n</td> <td>1 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Increase (decrease) to net interest income </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(141) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(120) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>28 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nMost of our use of derivatives is to synthetically convert the fixed interest rates on certain Advances, investments and Consolidated Obligations to adjustable rates tied to an eligible benchmark rate (e.g., LIBOR, the Federal funds effective rate, or SOFR). The larger negative effect of derivatives on net interest income in 2021 was primarily due to lower short-term benchmark interest rates, which resulted in higher net interest settlements being paid on certain Advances and investments where the fixed interest rates were converted to adjustable-coupon rates. The fluctuation in earnings from the use of derivatives was acceptable because it enabled us to lower market risk exposure by matching actual cash flows between assets and liabilities more closely and efficiently than would otherwise occur.\nNon-Interest Income (Loss)\nNon-interest income (loss) consists of certain realized and unrealized gains (losses) on investment securities, derivatives activities, financial instruments held under the fair value option, and other non-interest earning activities. The following tables present the net effect of derivatives and hedging activities on non-interest income (loss). The effects of derivatives and hedging activities on non-interest income (loss) relate only to derivatives not qualifying for fair value hedge accounting.\nTable 40: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td>

Non-interest income in 2020 benefited from the sale of interest rate swaptions as interest rates fell to historically low levels during the first quarter of 2020. The sales of swaptions in the first quarter of 2020 resulted in net realized gains of approximately $69 million before assessments. We did not sell any interest rate swaptions in 2021. We use swaptions to hedge market risk exposure associated with fixed-rate mortgage assets and may sell swaptions as interest rates change in order to offset actual and anticipated risks associated with holding fixed-rate mortgage assets. Additionally, the negative impact in 2021 was largely a result of less net interest settlements being received on swapped Discount Notes and Bonds and the unrealized gains on derivatives and instruments held at fair value recognized in 2020, which were not experienced in 2021.\nIn the table above, \"Gains (losses) on trading securities\" consist of fixed-rate U.S. Treasury and GSE obligations that have been swapped to a variable rate. Trading securities are recorded at fair value, with changes in fair value reported in non-interest income (loss). There are a number of factors that affect the fair value of these securities, including changes in interest rates, the passage of time, and volatility. By hedging these trading securities, the gains or losses on these trading securities will generally be offset by the gains or losses on the associated interest rate swaps.\nNon-Interest Expense\nThe following table presents non-interest expense for each of the last three years.\nTable 43: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(In millions) </td> <td>2021 </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Non-interest expense </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Compensation and benefits </td> <td>$ </td> <td>48 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>50 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>46 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other operating expense </td> <td>23 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>21 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>22 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Finance Agency </td> <td>7 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>7 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>7 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Office of Finance </td> <td>5 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other </td> <td>9 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>9 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>9 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total non-interest expense </td> <td>$ </td> <td>92 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>92 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>89 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nOur business is designed to support significant changes in asset levels without having to undergo material changes in staffing, operations, risk practices, or general resource needs.

In the second quarter of 2021, ROE was comparatively lower than other quarters due to unrealized losses on derivatives and hedging activities and instruments held at fair value.\nSegment Information\nNote 14 of the Notes to Financial Statements presents information on our two operating business segments. We manage financial operations and market risk exposure primarily at the macro level, and within the context of the entire balance sheet, rather than exclusively at the level of individual segments. Under this approach, the market risk/return profile of each segment may not match, or possibly even have the same trends as, what would occur if we managed each segment on a stand-alone basis. The tables below summarize each segment's operating results for the periods shown.\nTable 45: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>

numbers in thousands. Accordingly, recalculations based upon the disclosed amounts in millions may not produce the same results.\nTraditional Member Finance Segment\nNet income decreased in 2021 compared to 2020 primarily due to the decline in average Advance and MBS balances, lower spreads on MBS, lower Advance prepayment fees, and net unrealized losses on derivatives and hedging activities and instruments held at fair value.\nMPP Segment\nDue to the low interest rate environment, the MPP segment experienced a net loss in 2021. The net loss was due to lower average MPP balances, elevated net amortization, and lower portfolio spreads earned on MPP driven by the accelerated payoff of higher-yielding mortgages at a faster pace than the associated debt funding them. Net income in 2020 significantly benefited from gains due to the sale of interest rate swaptions as rates fell to historically low levels in the first quarter of 2020. We did not sell any swaptions in 2021.\nQUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT RISK MANAGEMENT\nOverview\nWe face various risks that could affect the ability to achieve our mission and corporate objectives. We generally categorize risks as: 1) business/strategic risk, 2) regulatory/legal risk, 3) market risk (also referred to as interest rate or prepayment risk), 4) credit risk, 5) funding/liquidity risk, and 6) operational risk. Our Board of Directors establishes objectives regarding risk philosophy, risk appetite, risk tolerances, and financial performance expectations. Market, capital adequacy, credit, liquidity, concentration, and operational risks are discussed below. Other risks are discussed throughout this report.\nWe strive to maintain a risk profile that ensures we operate safely and soundly, promotes prudent growth in Mission Assets and Activities, consistently generates competitive earnings, and protects the par value of members' capital stock investment. We believe our business is financially sound and adequately capitalized on a risk-adjusted basis.\nWe practice this conservative risk philosophy in many ways:\n\u25aaWe operate with moderate market risk and limited residual credit risk, liquidity risk, operational risk, and capital impairment risk.\n\u25aaWe have a business objective to ensure competitive and relatively stable profitability.\n\u25aaWe make conservative investment choices in terms of the types of investments we purchase and counterparties with which we engage.\n\u25aaWe use derivatives to hedge assets and liabilities and to help reduce market risk exposure.\n\u25aaWe maintain a prudent amount of financial leverage.\n\u25aaWe are judicious in instituting regular, district-wide repurchases of excess stock.\n\u25aaWe hold an amount of retained earnings that we believe will protect the par value of capital stock and provide for dividend stabilization.\n\u25aaWe create a working and operating environment that emphasizes a stable employee base.\nWe have numerous Board-adopted policies and processes that address risk management including risk appetite, tolerances, limits, guidelines, and regulatory compliance. Our cooperative business model, corporate objectives, capital structure, and regulatory oversight provide us clear incentives to minimize risk exposures. Our policies and operating practices are designed to limit risk exposures from ongoing operations in the following broad ways:\n\u25aaby anticipating potential business risks and developing appropriate responses;\n\u25aaby defining permissible lines of business;\n\u25aaby limiting the kinds of assets we are permitted to hold in terms of their credit risk exposure and the kinds of hedging and financing arrangements we are permitted to use;\n\u25aaby limiting the amount of market risk to which we are permitted to be exposed;\n\u25aaby specifying very conservative tolerances for credit risk posed by Advances;\n\u25aaby specifying capital adequacy minimums; and\n\u25aaby requiring strict adherence to internal controls and operating procedures, adequate insurance coverage, and comprehensive Human Resources policies, procedures, and strategies.\nMarket Risk\nOverview\nMarket risk exposure is the risk that profitability and the value of stockholders' capital investment may decrease and that profitability may become uncompetitive for an extended period as a result of changes and volatility in the market environment and economy. Along with business/strategic risk, market risk is normally our largest residual risk.\nOur risk appetite is to maintain market risk exposure in a low to moderate range while earning a competitive return on members' capital stock investment. There is normally a tradeoff between long-term market risk exposure and shorter-term exposure. Effective management of each component is important in order to attract and retain members and capital and to support Mission Assets and Activities.\nThe primary challenges in managing market risk exposure arise from 1) the tradeoff between earning a competitive return and correlating profitability with short-term interest rates and 2) the market risk exposure of owning mortgage assets. Mortgage assets grant homeowners prepayment options that could adversely affect our financial performance when interest rates increase or decrease. We mitigate the market risk of mortgage assets primarily by funding them principally with a portfolio of long-term fixed-rate callable and non-callable Bonds. Secondarily, we use swaption derivative transactions to a limited extent to mitigate the market risk of mortgage assets. The Bonds and swaptions can provide expected cash flows that are similar to the cash flows expected from mortgage assets under a wide range of interest rate and prepayment environments. Because it is normally cost-prohibitive to completely mitigate mortgage prepayment risk, a residual amount of market risk remains after funding and hedging activities.\nWe analyze market risk using numerous analytical measures under a variety of interest rate and business scenarios, including stressed scenarios, and perform sensitivity analyses on the many variables that can affect market risk, using several market risk models from third-party software companies. These models employ rigorous valuation techniques for the optionality that exists in mortgage prepayments, call and put options, and caps/floors. We regularly assess the effects of different assumptions, techniques and methodologies on the measurements of market risk exposure, including comparisons to alternative models and information from brokers/dealers.\nPolicy Limits on Market Risk Exposure\nWe have six sets of policy limits regarding market risk exposure, which primarily measure long-term market risk exposure. We determine compliance with our policy limits at every month end or more frequently if market or business conditions change significantly or are volatile.\n\u25aaMarket Value of Equity Sensitivity. The market value of equity for the entire balance sheet in two hypothetical interest rate scenarios (up 200 basis points and down 100 to 200 basis points from the current interest rate environment) must be between positive and negative 10 percent of the current balance sheet's market value of equity. The interest rate movements are shocks,\u201d defined as instantaneous, permanent, and parallel changes in interest rates in which every point on the yield curve is changed by the same amount. The size of the down shock varies with the level of long-term interest rates observed when measuring the risk.\n\u25aaDuration of Equity. The duration of equity for the entire balance sheet in the current ( base case\u201d) interest rate environment must be between positive and negative five years and in the two interest rate shock scenarios (up 200 basis points and down 100 to 200 basis points from the current interest rate environment) must be between positive and negative six years.\n\u25aaMortgage Assets Portfolio. The change in net market value of the mortgage assets portfolio as a percentage of the book value of portfolio assets must be between positive and negative three percent in each of the two interest rate shock scenarios. Net market value is defined as the market value of assets minus the market value of liabilities, with no assumed capital allocation.\n\u25aaMarket Capitalization. The market capitalization ratio (defined as the ratio of the market value of equity to the par value of regulatory stock) must be above 100 percent in the current rate environment and must be above 95 percent in each of the two interest rate shock scenarios.\n\u25aaFixed Rate Mortgage Assets as a Multiple of Regulatory Capital. The amount of fixed mortgage assets must be less than five times the amount of regulatory capital.\n\u25aaMPP Assets as a Multiple of Regulatory Capital. The amount of MPP assets must be less than four times the amount of regulatory capital.\nIn addition, Finance Agency regulations and an internal policy provide controls on market risk exposure by restricting the types of mortgage loans, mortgage-backed securities and other investments we can hold. We also manage market risk exposure by charging members prepayment fees on many Advance programs where an early termination of an Advance would result in an economic loss to us.\nIn practice we carry a substantially smaller amount of market risk exposure by establishing a strategic management range that is well within policy limits.\nMarket Value of Equity and Duration of Equity - Entire Balance Sheet\nTwo key measures of long-term market risk exposure are the sensitivities of the market value of equity and the duration of equity to changes in interest rates and other variables, as presented in the following tables for various instantaneous and permanent interest rate shocks (in basis points). We compiled average results using data for each month end. Given the current level of rates, some down rate shocks are nonparallel scenarios, with short-term rates decreasing less than long-term rates such that no rate falls below zero.\nMarket Value of

At December 31, 2021, market risk exposure to rising and falling rate shocks shifted modestly driven by significant changes in the overall composition of the mortgage loans portfolio. Changes in the composition of the mortgage loans portfolio tends to happen more rapidly during a period of a decline in interest rates and subsequent elevated mortgage repayments. In addition to the noted changes in balance sheet composition, the increased exposure to rising rate shocks was impacted by the rise in long-term interest rates that occurred in 2021. Exposure to falling interest rates in the down shock scenarios continues to be muted as some rates become floored at near zero rate levels. The duration of equity, which provides an estimate of the change in market value of equity to further changes in interest rates, increased modestly due to the factors noted above, but remained well within policy limits.\nBased on the totality of our risk analysis, we expect that profitability, defined as the level of ROE compared with short-term market rates, will be competitive over the long term unless interest rates increase by large amounts in a short period of time.\nDeclines in long-term interest rates could materially decrease income temporarily before reverting to average levels. This temporary reduction in income would be driven by additional recognition of mortgage asset premiums as the further incentive for borrowers to refinance results in faster than anticipated repayments of those mortgage assets.\nMarket Risk Exposure of the Mortgage Assets Portfolio\nThe mortgage assets portfolio normally accounts for almost all market risk exposure because of prepayment volatility that we cannot completely hedge while maintaining sufficient net spreads. Sensitivities of the market value of equity allocated to the mortgage assets portfolio under interest rate shocks (in basis points) are shown below. The average mortgage assets portfolio had an assumed capital allocation of $1.1 billion in 2021 based on the entire balance sheet's average regulatory capital-to-assets ratio. Average results shown in the table below are compiled using data for each month end. The market value sensitivities are one measure we use to analyze the portfolio's estimated market risk exposure.\n% Change in Market Value of Equity-Mortgage Assets Portfolio\nTable 50: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Down 300 </td> <td> </td> <td>Down 200 </td> <td> </td> <td>Down 100 </td> <td> </td> <td>Flat Rates </td> <td> </td> <td>Up 100 </td> <td> </td> <td>Up 200 </td> <td> </td> <td>Up 300 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Average Results </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2021 Full Year </td> <td>(11.2) </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>(10.7) </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>(5.9) </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(1.4) </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>(5.8) </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>(7.7) </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2020 Full Year </td> <td>(15.9) </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>(15.9) </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>(14.6) </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>11.9 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>2.4 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>(10.3) </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Month-End Results </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>December 31, 2021 </td> <td>(4.8) </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>(4.8) </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>(2.8) </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(3.4) </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>(9.9) </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>(14.4) </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>December 31, 2020 </td> <td>(15.3) </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>(15.3) </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>(11.3) </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>10.6 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>3.9 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>(1.7) </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe average risk exposure of the mortgage assets portfolio in 2021 remained aligned with our preference to keep our exposure to market risk at a low to moderate level. The variances between periods primarily reflect the impact of slightly higher long-term interest rates observed in 2021 combined with the shift in composition of the mortgage asset portfolio, which was accelerated by rapid repayments of mortgage assets throughout 2021. We believe the mortgage asset portfolio will continue to provide an acceptable risk adjusted return consistent with our risk appetite philosophy.\nUse of Derivatives in Market Risk Management\nA key component of hedging market risk exposure is the use of derivative transactions. The following table presents the notional amounts of the derivatives classified by how we designate the hedging relationship. The notional amount of derivatives at December 31, 2021 increased by $13.2 billion from the end of 2020, primarily due to our heightened use of swapped Discount Notes and swapped fixed-rate Bonds in the current market environment.\nTable 51: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td>

including market, credit, and operational. We regularly conduct a variety of measurements and assessments for capital adequacy. At December 31, 2021, our capital management policy set forth approximately $270 million as the minimum amount of retained earnings we believe is necessary to mitigate impairment risk.\nThe following table presents retained earnings.\nTable 52: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(In millions) </td> <td>December 31, 2021 </td> <td> </td> <td>December 31, 2020 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Unrestricted retained earnings </td> <td>$ </td> <td>783 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>803 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Restricted retained earnings (1)\n</td> <td>510 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>501 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total retained earnings </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,293 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,304 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\n(1) Pursuant to the FHLBank System's Joint Capital Enhancement Agreement we are not permitted to distribute as dividends.\nAs indicated in the table above, our current balance of retained earnings exceeds the policy minimum, which we expect will continue to be the case as we bolster capital adequacy over time by allocating a portion of earnings to the restricted retained earnings account.\nRisk-Based Capital\nThe following table shows the amount of risk-based capital required based on Finance Agency prescribed measurements. By\nregulation, we are required to hold permanent capital at least equal to the amount of risk-based capital.\nTable 53: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(Dollars in millions) </td> <td>December 31, 2021 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>December 31, 2020 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Market risk-based capital </td> <td>$ </td> <td>435 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>211 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Credit risk-based capital </td> <td>224 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>204 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operational risk-based capital </td> <td>197 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>124 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total risk-based capital requirement </td> <td>856 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>539 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total permanent capital </td> <td>3,804 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3,964 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Excess permanent capital </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2,948 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>3,425 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Risk-based capital as a percent of permanent capital </td> <td>23 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>14 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe risk-based capital requirement has historically not been a constraint on operations, and we do not use it to actively manage\nany of our risks. It has normally ranged from 10 to 25 percent of permanent capital.\nMarket Capitalization Ratios\nWe measure two sets of market capitalization ratios. One measures the market value of equity (i.e., total capital) relative to the par value of regulatory capital stock (which is GAAP capital stock and mandatorily redeemable capital stock). The other measures the market value of total capital relative to the book value of total capital, which includes all components of capital, and mandatorily redeemable capital stock. The measures provide a point-in-time indication of the FHLB's liquidation or franchise value and can also serve as a measure of realized or potential market risk exposure.\nThe following table presents the market value of equity to regulatory capital stock (excluding retained earnings) for several interest rate environments.\nTable 54: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>December 31, 2021 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>December 31, 2020 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Market Value of Equity to Par Value of Regulatory Capital Stock - Base Case (Flat Rates) Scenario\n</td> <td>154 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>144 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Market Value of Equity to Par Value of Regulatory Capital Stock - Down Shock (1)\n</td> <td>154 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>143 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Market Value of Equity to Par Value of Regulatory Capital Stock - Up Shock (2)\n</td> <td>145 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>142 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\n(1) Represents a down shock of 100 basis points.\n(2) Represents an up shock of 200 basis points.\nA base case value below 100 percent could indicate that, in the remote event of an immediate liquidation scenario involving redemption of all capital stock, capital stock may be returned to stockholders at a value below par. This could be due to experiencing risks that lower the market value of capital and/or to having an insufficient amount of retained earnings. In 2021, the market capitalization ratios in the scenarios presented continued to be above our policy requirements. The base case ratio at December 31, 2021 was well above 100 percent because retained earnings were 51 percent of regulatory capital stock and we maintained stable market risk exposure.\nThe following table presents the market value of equity to the book value of total capital and mandatorily redeemable capital stock.\nTable 55: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>December 31, 2021 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>December 31, 2020 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Market Value of Equity to Book Value of Capital - Base Case (Flat Rates) Scenario (1)\n</td> <td>101 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>97 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Market Value of Equity to Book Value of Capital - Down Shock (1)(2)\n</td> <td>101 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>96 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Market Value of Equity to Book Value of Capital - Up Shock (1)(3)\n</td> <td>95 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>96 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\n(1) Capital includes total capital and mandatorily redeemable capital stock.\n(2) Represents a down shock of 100 basis points.\n(3) Represents an up shock of 200 basis points.\nA base-case value below 100 percent indicates that we have realized or could realize risks (especially market risk), such that the market value of total capital owned by stockholders is below the book value of total capital. In a scenario in which interest rates increase 200 basis points, the market value of total capital would be $189 million below the book value of total capital. This indicates that in a liquidation scenario, stockholders would not receive the full sum of their total equity ownership in the FHLB. We believe the likelihood of a liquidation scenario is extremely remote; and therefore, we accept the risk of diluting equity ownership in such a scenario.\nCredit Risk\nOverview\nWe believe our risk management practices, discussed below, minimize residual credit risk levels. We have no loan loss reserves or impairment recorded for Credit Services, investments, or derivatives. We have a minimal amount of legacy credit risk exposure in the MPP.\nCredit Services\nOverview: We have policies and practices to manage credit risk exposure from our secured lending activities, which include Advances and Letters of Credit. The objective of our credit risk management activities is to equalize risk exposure across members and counterparties to a zero level of expected losses. This approach is consistent with our conservative risk management principles and desire to have no residual credit risk related to Advances and Letters of Credit.\nCollateral: We require each member to provide a security interest in eligible collateral before it can undertake any secured borrowing. Eligible loan collateral types include the following: single- and multi-family residential, home equity, commercial real estate, government guaranteed and farm real estate. Eligible security types include those that are government or agency backed, along with highly-rated private-label residential and commercial mortgage-backed securities. We have conservative eligibility criteria within each of the above asset types. The estimated value of pledged collateral is discounted in order to offset market, credit, and liquidity risks that may affect the collateral's realizable value in the event it must be liquidated. At December 31, 2021, total collateral pledged of $425.2 billion resulted in total borrowing capacity of $346.8 billion of which $57.6 billion was used to support outstanding Advances and Letters of Credit. Borrowers often pledge collateral in excess of their collateral requirement to demonstrate access to liquidity and to have the ability to borrow additional amounts in the future. Over-collateralization by one member is not applied to another member. The collateral composition remained relatively stable compared to the end of 2020.\nThe table below shows total collateral pledged by type.\nTable 56: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>December 31, 2021 </td> <td> </td> <td>December 31, 2020 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(Dollars in billions) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Percent of Total </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Percent of Total </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Eligible Collateral </td> <td> </td> <td>Pledged Collateral </td> <td> </td> <td>Eligible Collateral </td> <td> </td> <td>Pledged Collateral </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Single-family loans </td> <td>$ </td> <td>258.8 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>61 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>226.6 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>57 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Multi-family loans </td> <td>59.5 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>14 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>60.0 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>15 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Commercial real estate loans </td> <td>50.6 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>12 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>48.0 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>12 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Bond Securities </td> <td>30.0 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>7 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>26.1 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>7 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Home equity loans/lines of credit </td> <td>22.3 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>25.2 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Government guaranteed loans\n</td> <td>3.3 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>12.4 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Farm real estate loans </td> <td>0.7 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.7 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total </td> <td>$ </td> <td>425.2 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>100 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>399.0 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>100 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table>\nAt December 31, 2021, 66 percent of collateral was related to residential mortgage lending in single-family loans and home equity loans/lines of credit.\nOur management of credit risk related to Advances and Letters of Credit includes risk-based variations in collateral requirements, including discounts or haircuts, eligibility criteria, form of valuation, custody arrangements, the level of detail in periodic reporting, and in blanket versus specific pledges, as discussed below.\n\u25aaHaircuts. We discount collateral values for purposes of determining borrowing capacity. These haircuts result in lendable values that are less than the amount of pledged collateral. In general, higher discounts are applied to more risky forms of collateral and to collateral pledged by higher risk members.\n\u25aaEligibility. The balances of loans and securities we lend against are subject to conservative eligibility criteria such that Advances and Letters of Credit are supported by high quality assets within each collateral type.\n\u25aaCustody. All pledged securities and loans pledged by higher risk members must be delivered into our custody or that of a third-party custodian that we have engaged.\n\u25aaBlanket versus Specific Pledge. Except under limited circumstances, we require a member pledging loans under a blanket agreement to pledge all of their loans for a given collateral type.\n\u25aaValuation. All members' securities collateral and individually listed loans are subject to a market valuation process to establish the borrowing base. For loan collateral, this involves submission of extensive loan level information (on \"Listings\") to facilitate the valuation process. Any member allowed to make a specific instead of a blanket pledge (non-depositories and certain highly-rated commercial banks) is required to submit this level of reporting.\nWe use third-party services and internally run models to regularly estimate market values of individually listed loan collateral. Third-party services use various proprietary models to estimate market values. Assumptions may be made on factors that affect collateral value, such as market liquidity, discount rates, prepayments, liquidation and servicing costs in the event of a default and economic and market conditions. We have policies and procedures for evaluating the reasonableness of collateral valuations.\nBorrowing Capacity/Lendable Value: Lendable Value Rates (LVRs) represent the percent of collateral value net of the haircut. LVRs are determined by statistical analysis and management assumptions relating to historical price volatility, inherent credit risks, liquidation costs, and the current credit and economic environment. We apply LVR results to the estimated values of pledged assets. LVRs vary among pledged assets and members based on the member institution type, the financial strength of the member institution, the form of valuation, lien position, the issuer of bond collateral or the quality of securitized assets, the quality of the loan collateral as reflected in the manner in which it was underwritten, and the marketability of the pledged assets.\nThe table below indicates the range of LVRs for each major collateral type pledged at December 31, 2021.\nTable 57: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Lendable Value Rates Applied to Collateral </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Blanket Status: </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Prime 1-4 family loans </td> <td>71-80% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Multi-family loans </td> <td>61-79% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Prime home equity loans/lines of credit </td> <td>50-74% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Commercial real estate loans </td> <td>61-80% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Farm real estate loans </td> <td>63-83% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Listing Status/Physical Delivery: </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cash/U.S. Government/U.S. Treasury/U.S. agency securities </td> <td>85-100% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>U.S. agency residential MBS/collateralized mortgage obligations </td> <td>86-94% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>U.S. agency commercial MBS/collateralized mortgage obligations </td> <td>78-89% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Private-label residential MBS </td> <td>61-87% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Private-label commercial MBS </td> <td>48-84% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Municipal securities </td> <td>79-92% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>SBA certificates </td> <td>85-91% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Prime 1-4 family loans </td> <td>71-86% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Multi-family loans </td> <td>64-86% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Prime home equity loans/lines of credit </td> <td>64-86% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Commercial real estate loans </td> <td>69-89% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Farm real estate loans </td> <td>64-87% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>SBA Paycheck Protection Program loans </td> <td>10-90% </td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe ranges of lendable values exclude subprime residential loan collateral. Loans pledged by lower risk members for which we require only high level, summary reporting of eligible balances are generally discounted more heavily than loans on which we have detailed loan structure and underwriting information. For any form of loan collateral, additional credit risk based adjustments may be made to an individual member's collateral that results in a lower lendable value than that indicated in the above table.\nSubprime Loan Collateral: We have policies and processes to identify subprime residential mortgage loans pledged by members. We perform collateral reviews to estimate the volume of subprime loans pledged by members in blanket status. Depending on the quality of underwriting and administration, we may subject these loans to lower LVRs.\nInternal Credit Ratings: We perform credit underwriting of our members and nonmember institutions and assign them an internal credit rating on a scale of one to seven, with a higher number representing a less favorable assessment of the institution's financial condition. These credit ratings are based on internal and third-party ratings models, credit analyses and consideration of credit ratings from independent credit rating organizations. Credit ratings are used in conjunction with other measures of credit risk in managing secured credit risk exposure.\nA less favorable credit rating can cause us to 1) decrease the institution's borrowing capacity via lower LVRs, 2) require the institution to provide an increased level of detail on pledged collateral, 3) require it to deliver collateral into our custody, 4) prompt us to more closely and/or frequently monitor the institution, and/or 5) limit the institution's exposure through borrowing restrictions (e.g., maturity restrictions on new Advances or restrictions on borrowing capacity from higher risk collateral sources).\nThe following tables show the distribution of internal credit ratings we assigned to member and nonmember institutions, which we use to help manage credit risk exposure.\nTable 58: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(Dollars in billions) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>December 31, 2021 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>December 31, 2020 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Number </td> <td> </td> <td>Collateral-Based </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Number </td> <td> </td> <td>Collateral-Based </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Credit </td> <td> </td> <td>of </td> <td> </td> <td>Borrowing </td> <td> </td> <td>Credit </td> <td> </td> <td>of </td> <td> </td> <td>Borrowing </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Rating </td> <td> </td> <td>Institutions </td> <td> </td> <td>Capacity </td> <td> </td> <td>Rating </td> <td> </td> <td>Institutions </td> <td> </td> <td>Capacity </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>1-3 </td> <td> </td> <td>470 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>322.6 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1-3 </td> <td> </td> <td>441 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>282.6 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>4 </td> <td> </td> <td>109 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>23.1 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4 </td> <td> </td> <td>141 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>31.7 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>5 </td> <td> </td> <td>29 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.9 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5 </td> <td> </td> <td>36 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1.3 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>6 </td> <td> </td> <td>12 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.2 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6 </td> <td> </td> <td>13 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.3 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>7 </td> <td> </td> <td>3 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>7 </td> <td> </td> <td>5 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total </td> <td> </td> <td>623 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>346.8 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Total </td> <td> </td> <td>636 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>315.9 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe consider institutions with credit ratings of \"1\" through \"4\" to be financially sound. At December 31, 2021, only 44 institutions (seven percent of the total) had credit ratings of \"5\" through \"7,\" a decrease of 10 institutions compared to the end of 2020. These institutions had $1.1 billion of borrowing capacity at December 31, 2021. We believe the credit rating distribution continues to show a financially sound membership base.\nMember Failures, Closures, and Receiverships: There were no member failures in 2021.\nMPP\nOverview: The residual amount of credit risk exposure to loans in the MPP is minimal, based on the following factors:\n\u25aavarious credit enhancements for conventional loans, which are designed to protect us against credit losses;\n\u25aaconservative underwriting and loan characteristics consistent with favorable expected credit performance;\n\u25aaa small overall amount of delinquencies and defaults when compared to national averages;\n\u25aacredit losses totaling less than $0.1 million in 2021 and $19.4 million since the introduction of the program in 2000, which represent an immaterial percentage of conventional loans' current unpaid principal balances at December 31, 2021 and of total purchases-to-date for the entire MPP; and\n\u25aain addition to the low program-to-date credit losses, based on financial analysis, we believe that future credit losses will not harm capital adequacy and will not significantly affect profitability except under the most extreme and unlikely credit conditions.\nPortfolio Loan Characteristics: The following table shows FICO\u00ae credit scores of homeowners at origination dates for the conventional loan portfolio.\nTable 59: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>FICO\u00ae Score (1)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>December 31, 2021 </td> <td> </td> <td>December 31, 2020 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>< 620 </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>620 to < 660 </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>660 to < 700 </td> <td> </td> <td>7 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>700 to < 740 </td> <td> </td> <td>18 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>17 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>>= 740 </td> <td> </td> <td>75 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>77 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Weighted Average </td> <td> </td> <td>763 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>765 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\n(1)Represents the FICO\u00ae score at origination.\nThe distribution of FICO\u00ae scores at origination as of December 31, 2021 were similar to those at year-end 2020. The distribution of FICO\u00ae scores at origination is one indication of the portfolio's overall favorable credit quality. At December 31, 2021, 75 percent of the portfolio had scores at an excellent level of 740 or above and 93 percent had scores above 700, which is a threshold generally considered indicative of homeowners with good credit quality.\nThe following tables show loan-to-value ratios for conventional loans based on values estimated at the origination dates and current values estimated at the noted periods. The estimated current ratios are based on original loan values, principal paydowns that have occurred since origination, and a third-party estimate of changes in historical home prices for the zip code in which each loan resides. Both measures are weighted by current unpaid principal.\nTable 60: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Based on Estimated Origination Value </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Based On Estimated Current Value </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Loan-to-Value </td> <td> </td> <td>December 31, 2021 </td> <td> </td> <td>December 31, 2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>Loan-to-Value </td> <td> </td> <td>December 31, 2021 </td> <td> </td> <td>December 31, 2020 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td><= 60% </td> <td> </td> <td>17 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>15 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td><= 60% </td> <td> </td> <td>77 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>60 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>> 60% to 70% </td> <td> </td> <td>18 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>16 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>> 60% to 70% </td> <td> </td> <td>14 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>28 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>> 70% to 80% </td> <td> </td> <td>53 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>55 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>> 70% to 80% </td> <td> </td> <td>7 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>11 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>> 80% to 90% </td> <td> </td> <td>8 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>9 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>> 80% to 90% </td> <td> </td> <td>1 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>> 90% </td> <td> </td> <td>4 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>> 90% to 100% </td> <td> </td> <td>1 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>> 100% </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Weighted Average </td> <td> </td> <td>73 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>73 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>Weighted Average </td> <td> </td> <td>49 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>55 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe levels of loan-to-value ratios are consistent with the portfolio's excellent credit quality. Loans with current loan-to-value ratios of 60 percent and below increased to 77 percent of the total portfolio at December 31, 2021, which reflected the approximately 18 percent average increase in housing prices nationwide based on the most recent data available.\nBased on the available data, we believe we have minimal exposure to loans in the MPP considered to have characteristics of subprime\u201d or alternative/nontraditional\u201d loans. Further, we do not knowingly purchase any loan that violates the terms of our Anti-Predatory Lending Policy.\nThe following table presents the geographical allocation based on the unpaid principal balance of conventional loans in the MPP.\nTable 61: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>December 31, 2021 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>December 31, 2020 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Ohio </td> <td>63 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>Ohio </td> <td>63 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Kentucky </td> <td>12 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Kentucky </td> <td>13 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Indiana </td> <td>9 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Indiana </td> <td>10 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Tennessee </td> <td>4 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Tennessee </td> <td>3 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Alabama </td> <td>1 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Michigan </td> <td>1 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>All others </td> <td>11 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>All others </td> <td>10 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total </td> <td>100 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>Total </td> <td>100 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table>\nCredit Enhancements: Conventional mortgage loans are supported against credit losses by various combinations of primary mortgage insurance (PMI), supplemental mortgage insurance (SMI) (for loans purchased before February 2011), and the Lender Risk Account (LRA). The LRA is a hold back of a portion of the initial purchase price to cover expected credit losses for a specific pool of loans. Starting after five years from the loan purchase date, we may return the hold back to PFIs if they manage credit risk to predefined acceptable levels of exposure on the loan pools they sell to us. As a result, some pools of loans may have sufficient credit enhancements to recapture all losses while other pools of loans may not. The LRA had balances of $252 million and $246 million at December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. For more information, see Note 6 of the Notes to Financial Statements.\nCredit Performance: The table below provides an analysis of conventional loans delinquent or in the process of foreclosure, along with the national average serious delinquency rate.\nTable 62: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Conventional Loan Delinquencies </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(Dollars in millions) </td> <td>December 31, 2021 </td> <td> </td> <td>December 31, 2020 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Early stage delinquencies - unpaid principal balance (1)\n</td> <td>$ </td> <td>33 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>49 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Serious delinquencies - unpaid principal balance (2)\n</td> <td>$ </td> <td>24 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>64 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Early stage delinquency rate (3)\n</td> <td>0.5 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>0.5 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Serious delinquency rate (4)\n</td> <td>0.3 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>0.7 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>National average serious delinquency rate (5)\n</td> <td>2.3 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>3.7 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table>\n(1)Includes conventional loans 30 to 89 days delinquent and not in foreclosure.\n(2)Includes conventional loans that are 90 days or more past due or where the decision of foreclosure or a similar alternative such as pursuit of deed-in-lieu has been reported.\n(3)Early stage delinquencies expressed as a percentage of the total conventional loan portfolio.\n(4)Serious delinquencies expressed as a percentage of the total conventional loan portfolio.\n(5)National average number of fixed-rate prime and subprime conventional loans that are 90 days or more past due or in the process of foreclosure is based on the most recent national delinquency data available. The December 31, 2021 rate is based on September 30, 2021 data.\nIn response to the COVID-19 pandemic, our mortgage loan servicers granted a forbearance period to borrowers who had COVID-19 related hardships such as illness, unemployment or loss of income when homeowners met certain eligibility requirements. These forbearances do not alter the underlying terms of the loans, and loans not paid timely are considered past due. As a result, serious delinquencies were elevated at December 31, 2021 and 2020. At December 31, 2021 and 2020, $8 million and $51 million of conventional loans with a serious delinquency were under a forbearance plan. Delinquencies at December 31, 2021 have decreased since year-end 2020 as fewer borrowers have requested temporary relief provisions for MPP loans.\nWe consider a high risk loan as having a current loan-to-value ratio above 100 percent. At December 31, 2021, we had no loans with a current loan-to-value ratio above 100 percent. Historically, high risk loans have experienced a minimal amount of serious delinquencies. We believe these data further support our view that the overall portfolio is comprised of high-quality, well-performing loans.\nCredit Losses: Residual credit risk exposure depends on the actual and potential credit performance of the loans in each pool compared to the pool's equity (on individual loans) and credit enhancements, including PMI, the LRA, and SMI. Our available credit enhancements at December 31, 2021 were ample and able to cover nearly all of the estimated gross credit losses. As a result, estimated credit losses at December 31, 2021 were less than $1 million. Estimated credit losses, after credit enhancements, are accounted for in the allowance for credit losses or as a charge off (i.e., a reduction to the principal of mortgage loans held for portfolio). In addition, we have assessed that we do not have any credit risk exposure to our PMI providers, and our estimation of credit exposure to SMI providers was not material at December 31, 2021 or 2020.\nSeparate from our allowance for credit losses analysis, we regularly analyze potential adverse scenarios of lifetime credit risk exposure for the loans in the MPP. Even under adverse macroeconomic scenarios, we expect credit losses to remain minimal.\nInvestments\nLiquidity Investments: We purchase liquidity investments from counterparties that have a strong ability to repay principal and interest. These investments can be easily converted to cash and may be unsecured, guaranteed or supported by the U.S. government, or secured (i.e., collateralized). For unsecured liquidity investments, we invest in the debt securities of highly rated, investment-grade institutions, have appropriate and conservative limits on dollar and maturity exposure to each institution, and have strong credit underwriting practices, including active monitoring of credit quality of our counterparties and of the environment in which they operate.\nOur unsecured liquidity investments to a counterparty or group of affiliated counterparties are limited by Finance Agency regulations to maturities of no more than nine months and limited to a dollar amount based on a percentage of eligible regulatory capital (defined as the lessor of our regulatory capital or the eligible amount of a counterparty's Tier 1 capital). The permissible percentage ranges from 1 percent to 15 percent. The permissible range is solely based on consideration of the internal credit risk ratings of unsecured counterparties as required by Finance Agency regulations.\nThe lowest long-term credit rating for a counterparty to which we are permitted to extend credit is double-B. However, we have generally invested funds only in those eligible institutions with long-term credit ratings of at least single-A. In addition, we restrict maturities, reduce dollar exposure, and avoid new investments with counterparties we deem to represent elevated credit risk. Furthermore, a portion of our total liquidity investments are with counterparties for which the investments are secured with collateral (secured resale agreements). We believe these investments present no credit risk exposure to us.\nThe following table presents the carrying value of liquidity investments outstanding in relation to the counterparties' lowest long-term credit ratings provided by Standard & Poor's, Moody's, and/or Fitch Advisory Services. For resale agreements, the ratings shown are based on ratings of the associated collateral. Our internal ratings of these investments may differ from those obtained from Standard & Poor's, Moody's, and/or Fitch Advisory Services. The historical or current ratings displayed in this table should not be taken as an indication of future ratings.\nTable 63: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>

By Finance Agency regulation, all counterparties exposed to non-U.S. countries are required to be domestic U.S. branches of foreign counterparties.\nMBS:\nGSE MBS\nAt December 31, 2021, $9.7 billion of MBS held were GSE securities issued by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, which provide credit safeguards by guaranteeing either timely or ultimate payments of principal and interest. We believe that the conservatorships of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac lower the chance that they would not be able to fulfill their credit guarantees. In addition, based on the data available to us and our purchase practices, we believe that most of the mortgage loans backing our GSE MBS are of high quality with acceptable credit performance.\nMBS Issued by Other Government Agencies\nWe also invest in MBS issued and guaranteed by Ginnie Mae. These investments totaled $1.1 billion at December 31, 2021. We believe that the strength of Ginnie Mae's guarantee and backing by the full faith and credit of the U.S. government is sufficient to protect us against credit losses on these securities.\nDerivatives\nCredit Risk Exposure: We mitigate most of the credit risk exposure resulting from derivative transactions through collateralization or use of daily settled contracts.

LCH Ltd. is rated AA- by Standard & Poor's, and CME Clearing is not rated, but its parent company, CME Group Inc., is rated Aa3 by Moody's and AA- by Standard & Poor's.\n(2)Represents Mandatory Delivery Contracts.\nOur exposure to cleared derivatives is primarily associated with the requirement to post initial margin through the clearing agent to the Derivatives Clearing Organizations. We pledge cash as collateral to satisfy this initial margin requirement. However, the use of cleared derivatives mitigates credit risk exposure because a central counterparty is substituted for individual counterparties.\nAt December 31, 2021, the net exposure of uncleared derivatives with residual credit risk exposure was less than $1 million. If interest rates rise or the composition of our derivatives change resulting in an increase to our gross exposure to uncleared derivatives, the contractual collateral provisions in these derivatives would limit our net exposure to acceptable levels.\nAlthough we cannot predict if we will realize credit risk losses from any of our derivatives counterparties, we believe that all of the counterparties will be able to continue making timely interest payments and, more generally, to continue to satisfy the terms and conditions of their derivative contracts with us. As of December 31, 2021, we had $0.4 billion of notional principal of interest rate swaps with a subsidiary of our member, JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., which also had outstanding credit services with us. Due to the amount of market value collateralization, we had no outstanding credit exposure to this counterparty related to interest rate swaps outstanding.\nLiquidity Risk\nLiquidity Overview\nWe strive to be in a liquidity position at all times to meet the borrowing needs of our members and to meet all current and future financial commitments. This objective is achieved by managing liquidity positions to maintain stable, reliable, and cost-effective sources of funds while taking into account market conditions, member demand, and the maturity profile of assets and liabilities. Our liquidity position complies with the FHLBank Act, Finance Agency regulations, and internal policies.\nThe FHLBank System's primary source of funds is the sale of Consolidated Obligations in the capital markets. Our ability to obtain funds through the sale of Consolidated Obligations at acceptable interest costs depends on the financial market's perception of the riskiness of the Obligations and on prevailing conditions in the capital markets, particularly the short-term capital markets. The System's favorable debt ratings, the implicit U.S. government backing of our debt, and our effective risk management practices are instrumental in ensuring stable and satisfactory access to the capital markets.\nWe believe our liquidity position, as well as that of the System, continued to be strong during 2021. Our overall ability to effectively fund our operations through debt issuances remained sufficient. Investor demand for System debt was robust in 2021, as investors continued to prefer short-term, high-quality money market instruments. We believe the possibility of a liquidity or funding crisis in the System that would impair our ability to participate, on a cost-effective basis, in issuances of debt, service outstanding debt, maintain adequate capitalization, or pay competitive dividends is remote.\nThe System works collectively to manage and monitor the System-wide liquidity and funding risks. Liquidity risk includes the risk that the System could have difficulty rolling over short-term Obligations when market conditions change, also called refinancing risk. The System has a large reliance on short-term funding; therefore, it has a sharp focus on managing liquidity risk to very low levels. As shown on the Statements of Cash Flows, in 2021, our portion of the System's debt issuances totaled $193.5 billion for Discount Notes and $33.8 billion for Bonds. Access to short-term debt markets has been reliable because investors, driven by liquidity preferences and risk aversion, have sought the System's short-term debt, which has resulted in strong demand for debt maturing in one year or less.\nSee the Notes to Financial Statements for more detailed information regarding maturities of certain financial assets and liabilities which are instrumental in determining the amount of liquidity risk. In addition to contractual maturities, other assumptions regarding cash flows such as estimated prepayments, embedded call optionality, and scheduled amortization are considered when managing liquidity risks.\nLiquidity Management and Regulatory Requirements\nWe manage liquidity risk by ensuring compliance with our regulatory liquidity requirements and regularly monitoring other metrics.\nThe Finance Agency establishes the expectations with respect to the maintenance of sufficient liquidity without access to the capital markets for a specified number of days, which was set as a period of between 10 to 30 calendar days in the base case. Under these expectations, all Advance maturities are assumed to renew, unless the Advances relate to former members who are ineligible to borrow new Advances. The maintenance of sufficient liquidity is intended to provide additional assurance that we can continue to provide Advances and Letters of Credit to members over an extended period without access to the capital markets. As of December 31, 2021, our days of positive daily cash balances were within these expectations.\nThe Finance Agency also provides guidance related to asset/liability maturity funding gap limits. Funding gap metrics measure the difference between assets and liabilities that are scheduled to mature during a specified period of time and are expressed as a percentage of total assets. Although subject to change depending on conditions in the financial markets, the current regulatory requirement for funding gaps is between -10 percent to -20 percent for the three-month maturity horizon and is between -25 percent to -35 percent for the one-year maturity horizon. As of December 31, 2021, we were operating within those limits.\nTo support our member deposits, we also must meet a statutory deposit reserve requirement. The sum of our investments in obligations of the United States, deposits in eligible banks or trust companies, and Advances with a final maturity not exceeding five years must equal or exceed the current amount of member deposits. The following table presents the components of this liquidity requirement.\nTable 68: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(In millions) </td> <td>December 31, 2021 </td> <td> </td> <td>December 31, 2020 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Deposit Reserve Requirement </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total Eligible Deposit Reserves </td> <td>$ </td> <td>35,230 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>37,185 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total Member Deposits </td> <td>(1,416) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(1,327) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Excess Deposit Reserves </td> <td>$ </td> <td>33,814 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>35,858 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nMember Concentration Risk\nWe regularly assess concentration risks from business activity. We believe that the concentration of Advance activity is consistent with our risk management philosophy, and the impact of borrower concentration on market risk, credit risk, and operational risk, after considering mitigating controls, is minimal.\nWe believe the effect on credit risk exposure from borrower concentration is minimal because of our application of credit risk mitigations, the most important of which is over-collateralization of borrowings. In the remote possibility of failure of a member to whom we lent a large amount of Advances, combined with the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation's decision not to repay Advances, we would implement our member failure plan. Our member failure plan, which we test periodically, would liquidate collateral to recover losses from losing principal and interest on the Advance balances.\nAdvance concentration has a minimal effect on market risk exposure because Advances are largely funded by Consolidated Obligations and interest rate swaps that have similar interest rate characteristics. Furthermore, additional increases in Advance concentration would not materially affect capital adequacy because Advance growth is supported by new purchases of capital stock as required by the Capital Plan.\nOperational Risks\nOperational risk is defined as the risk of an unexpected loss resulting from human error, fraud, inability to enforce legal contracts, or deficiencies in internal controls or information systems. We mitigate operational risks through adherence to internal policies, conformance with entity level controls, and through an emphasis on the importance of risk management, as further discussed below. In addition, the Internal Audit Department, which reports directly to the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors, regularly monitors and tests compliance with our policies, procedures and applicable regulatory requirements.\nInternal Department Procedures and Controls\nEach of our departments maintains and regularly reviews and enhances, as needed, a system of internal procedures and controls, including those that address proper segregation of duties. Each system is designed to prevent any one individual from processing the entirety of a transaction that affects member accounts, correspondent FHLB accounts or third-party servicers providing support to us. We review daily and periodic transaction activity reports in a timely manner to detect erroneous or fraudulent activity. Procedures and controls also are assessed on an enterprise-wide basis, independently from the business unit departments. We also are in compliance with Sarbanes-Oxley Sections 302 and 404, which focus on the control environment over financial reporting.\nInformation Systems\nWe rely heavily upon internal and third-party information systems and other technology to conduct and manage our business. Our operations rely on the secure processing, storage and transmission of confidential and other information in our computer systems and networks. Our computer systems, software and networks may be subjected to cyberattacks (e.g., breaches, unauthorized access, misuse, computer viruses or other malicious code and other events) that could jeopardize the confidentiality or integrity of such information, or otherwise cause interruptions or malfunctions in our operations.\nWe mitigate the risk associated with cyberattacks through the implementation of multiple layers of security controls. Administrative, physical, and logical controls are in place for establishing, administering and actively monitoring system access, sensitive data, and system change. Additionally, separate groups within our organization and/or third parties test the strength of our security controls and responses, and recommend changes as needed to bolster resilience to security risks.\nDisaster Recovery Provisions\nWe have a Business Resiliency Management Plan that provides us with the ability to maintain operations in various scenarios of business disruption. We review and update this plan periodically to ensure that it serves our changing operational needs and those of our members. In case of business disruptions, we have an off-site facility in a suburb of Cincinnati, Ohio, which is kept ready for use and tested at least annually, and employees are set up to work from home. We also have a back-up agreement in place with another FHLBank in the event that both of our Cincinnati-based facilities are inoperable.\nInsurance Coverage\nWe have insurance coverage for cyber risks, employee fraud, forgery and wrongdoing, and Directors' and Officers' liability. This coverage primarily provides protection for claims alleging breach of duty, misappropriation of funds, neglect, acts of omission, employment practices, and fiduciary liability. We also have property, casualty, computer equipment, automobile, and various other types of coverage.\nHuman Resources Policies and Procedures\nThe risks associated with our Human Resources function are categorized as either Employment Practices Risk or Human Capital Risk. Employment Practices Risk is the potential failure to properly administer our policies regarding employment practices and compensation and benefit programs for eligible staff and retirees, and the potential failure to observe and properly comply with federal, state and municipal laws and regulations. Human Capital Risk is the potential inability to attract and retain appropriate levels of qualified human resources to maintain efficient operations.\nComprehensive policies and procedures are in place to limit Employment Practices Risk. These are supported by an established internal control system that is routinely monitored and audited. With respect to Human Capital Risk, we strive to maintain a competitive salary and benefit structure, which is regularly reviewed and updated as appropriate to attract and retain qualified staff. In addition, we have a management succession plan that is reviewed and approved by our Board of Directors. See \"Human Capital Resources\" in Item 1. Business for further discussion.\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES\nIntroduction\nThe preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP requires management to make a number of significant judgments, estimates, and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities (if applicable), and the reported amounts of income and expenses during the reported periods. Although management believes its judgments, estimates, and assumptions are reasonable, actual results may differ and other parties could arrive at different conclusions.\nWe have identified the following critical accounting policies that require management to make subjective or complex judgments about inherently uncertain matters. Our financial condition and results of operations could be materially affected under different conditions or different assumptions related to these accounting policies.\nAccounting for Derivatives and Hedging Activity\nIn accordance with Finance Agency regulations, we execute all derivatives to manage market risk exposure, not for speculation or solely for earnings enhancement. We record derivative instruments at their fair values on the Statements of Condition, and we record changes in these fair values in current period earnings. We strive to ensure that our use of derivatives maximizes the probability that they are highly effective in offsetting changes in the market values of the designated balance sheet instruments.\nFair Value Hedges\nAs indicated in the \"Use of Derivatives in Market Risk Management\" section of \"Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Risk Management,\" we designate a portion of our derivatives as fair value hedges. Fair value hedge accounting permits the changes in fair values of the hedged risk in the hedged instruments to be recorded in the current period, thus offsetting the change in fair value of the derivatives. For derivatives accounted as fair value hedges, generally the hedged risk is designated to be changes in the eligible benchmark interest rate. The result is that there has been a relatively small amount of unrealized earnings volatility from hedging market risk with derivatives.\nIn order to determine if a derivative qualifies for fair value hedge accounting, we must assess how effective the derivative has been, and is expected to be, in hedging changes in the fair values of the risk being hedged. Each month we perform effectiveness testing using a consistently applied standard statistical methodology, regression analysis, which measures the degree of correlation and relationship between the changes in fair values of the derivative and hedged instrument. The results of the statistical measures must pass predefined threshold values to enable us to conclude that the changes in fair values of the derivative transaction have a close correlation with the changes in fair values of the hedged instrument. If any measure is outside of its respective tolerance, the hedge would no longer qualify for fair value hedge accounting. This means we must then record the fair value change of the derivative in current earnings without any offset in the fair value change of the related hedged instrument. Due to the intentional matching of terms between the derivative and the hedged instrument, we expect that failing an effectiveness test will be infrequent, which has been the case historically.\nIf a derivative/hedged instrument transaction fails effectiveness testing, it does not mean that the hedge relationship is no longer successful in achieving its intended economic purpose. For example, a Consolidated Obligation hedged with an interest rate swap creates adjustable-rate funding, which is used to match fund adjustable-rate and other short-term Advances. The hedge achieves the desired result (matching the net funding with the asset) because, economically, the Advance is part of the overall hedging strategy and the reason for engaging in the derivative transaction.\nEach month, we compute fair values on all derivatives and related hedged instruments across a range of interest rate scenarios. For derivatives receiving long-haul fair value hedge accounting, the additional amount of earnings volatility under an assumption of stressed interest rate environments as of year-end 2021 was in a range of negative $3 million to negative $8 million. This range is minimal compared to the notional principal amount.\nFair Value Option-Economic Hedge\nWe account for a portion of Advance and Consolidated Obligation-related derivatives using an accounting election called \"fair value option,\" which is included in the economic hedge category. An economic hedge under the fair value option does not require passing effectiveness testing to permit the derivative's fair market value to be offset with the market value of the hedged instrument, as is required under a fair value hedge. However, it records the fair market value of the hedged instrument at its full fair value instead of only the value related to the benchmark interest rate. The effect of electing full fair value is that the hedged instrument's market value includes the impact of changes in spreads between the designated benchmark interest rate and the interest rate index related to the hedged instrument, as well as other risk components, such as liquidity. Therefore, full fair value results in a different kind of unrealized earnings volatility, which could be higher or lower, compared to accounting under fair value hedge treatment.\nFair Values\nWe carry certain assets and liabilities on the Statement of Conditions at estimated fair value, including all derivatives, investments classified as available-for-sale and trading, and any financial instruments where we elected the fair value option. Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset, or paid to transfer a liability, in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. Because our financial instruments generally do not have available quoted market prices, we determine fair values based on 1) our valuation models or 2) dealer indications, which may be based on the dealers' own valuation models and/or prices of similar instruments.\nValuation models and their underlying assumptions are based on the best estimates of management with respect to discount rates, prepayments, market volatility, and other factors. These assumptions may have a significant effect on the reported fair values of assets and liabilities, and the income and expense related thereto. The use of different assumptions or changes in the models and assumptions, as well as changes in market conditions, could result in materially different net income and retained earnings.\nWe have control processes designed to ensure that fair value measurements are appropriate and reliable, that they are based on observable inputs wherever possible and that our valuation approaches and assumptions are reasonable and consistently applied. Where applicable, valuations are also compared to alternative external market data (e.g., quoted market prices, broker or dealer indications, pricing services and comparative analyses to similar instruments). For further discussion regarding how we measure financial assets and financial liabilities at fair value, see Note 15 of the Notes to Financial Statements.\nWe categorize each of our financial instruments carried at fair value into one of three levels in accordance with the fair value hierarchy. The hierarchy is based upon the transparency (observable or unobservable) of inputs to the valuation of an asset or liability as of the measurement date. Observable inputs reflect market data obtained from independent sources (Levels 1 and 2), while unobservable inputs reflect our assumptions of market variables (Level 3). Management utilizes valuation techniques that\nmaximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs. Because items classified as Level 3 are valued using significant unobservable inputs, the process for determining the fair value of these items is generally more subjective and involves a high degree of management judgment and use of assumptions. As of December 31, 2021 and 2020, all of our assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis were classified as Level 2 within the fair value hierarchy.\nRECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING

The effects of COVID-19 continue to evolve, and the full impact and duration of the virus are unknown. Throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, we have continued to fulfill our mission of providing robust access to a key source of readily available and competitively priced wholesale funding to member financial institutions and supporting our commitment to affordable housing and community investment. Our capital and liquidity positions remained strong, as did our overall ability to fund operations through the issuance of Consolidated Obligations at acceptable interest costs. Additionally, overall residual credit risk exposure from our Credit Services, mortgage loan portfolio, investments, and derivative transactions has remained de minimis. We continue to monitor the effects of COVID-19, including the impact of variants, and are committed to assisting members and their communities as impacts related to the pandemic continue to unfold.\nFinancial Condition\nMission Assets and Activities\nPrimary Mission Assets (i.e., principal balances of Advances and mortgage loans held for portfolio) and Supplemental Mission Activities (i.e., Letters of Credit, Mandatory Delivery Contracts and standby bond purchase agreements) are the primary means by which we fulfill our mission with direct connections to members and what we refer to as Mission Assets and Activities. We regularly monitor our concentration of Mission Assets and Activities. One measure we use to assess mission achievement is our Primary Mission Asset ratio, which measures the sum of average Advances and mortgage loans as a percentage of average Consolidated Obligations (adjusted for certain high-quality liquid assets, as permitted by regulation). In 2021, the Primary Mission Asset ratio averaged 69 percent, slightly below the Finance Agency's preferred ratio of 70 percent. In assessing overall mission achievement, we also consider supplemental sources of Mission Assets and Activities, the most significant of which is Letters of Credit issued for the benefit of members.\nThe following table summarizes our Mission Assets and Activities.\nTable 11: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Year Ended December 31, </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Ending Balances </td> <td> </td> <td>Average Balances </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(In millions) </td> <td>2021 </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2021 </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Primary Mission Assets (1):\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Advances </td> <td>$ </td> <td>22,954 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>25,007 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>23,721 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>42,917 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Mortgage loans held for portfolio </td> <td>7,402 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>9,316 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>7,931 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>10,995 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total Primary Mission Assets </td> <td>$ </td> <td>30,356 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>34,323 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>31,652 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>53,912 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Supplemental Mission Activities (2):\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Letters of Credit (notional) </td> <td>$ </td> <td>34,637 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>28,812 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>33,922 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>20,141 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Mandatory Delivery Contracts (notional) </td> <td>250 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>137 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>249 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>338 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Standby bond purchase agreements (notional) </td> <td>27 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>35 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>31 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>68 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total Supplemental Mission Activities </td> <td>$ </td> <td>34,914 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>28,984 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>34,202 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>20,547 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\n(1)Amounts represent principal balances.\n(2)Amounts represent off-balance sheet commitments.\nAdvance principal balances decreased $2.1 billion (eight percent) from year-end 2020. Advance balances remained below pre-pandemic levels in 2021 due to increased liquidity in the financial markets and substantial growth in deposits at member institutions. Average principal Advance balances for 2021 decreased $19.2 billion (45 percent) compared to 2020. Advance balances in the first quarter of 2020 were significantly higher as members sought additional liquidity during the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. However, most of these Advances matured or were prepaid by the end of 2020, and the demand for Advances has remained low. Advance demand could improve as one or more of the following occur: reductions in government liquidity programs, changes in the Federal Reserve monetary policy, or a rise in interest rates.\nAdvance balances are often volatile due to members' ability to quickly, normally on the same day, increase or decrease their amount of Advances. We believe that a key benefit of membership comes from our business model as a wholesale lender GSE, which provides members flexibility in their Advance funding levels and helps support their asset-liability management needs. We act as a readily available source of funding for our members. Our business model is designed to support significant changes in asset levels without having to undergo material changes in staffing, operations, risk practices, or general resource needs. A key reason for this scalability is that our Capital Plan provides for additional capital when Advances grow and the opportunity for us to retire capital when Advances decline, thereby acting, along with our efficient level of operating expenses, to preserve competitive profitability.\nThe MPP principal balance fell $1.9 billion (21 percent) from year-end 2020. During 2021, we purchased $1.7 billion of mortgage loans, while principal reductions of $3.6 billion reflected the continuing high levels of mortgage loan refinance activity.\nLetters of Credit increased $5.8 billion (20 percent) from year-end 2020 primarily due to members using them to secure elevated levels of public unit deposits. We normally earn fees on Letters of Credit based on the actual average amount of the Letters utilized, which generally is less than the notional amount issued.\nInvestments\nThe balance of investments at December 31, 2021 was $29.4 billion, an increase of $2.4 billion from year-end 2020. At December 31, 2021, investments included $10.8 billion of MBS and $18.6 billion of other investments, which consisted primarily of highly-rated short-term instruments and longer-term U.S. Treasury and GSE obligations held for liquidity. All of our MBS held at December 31, 2021 were issued and guaranteed by Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac or a U.S. agency.\nInvestments averaged $28.1 billion in 2021, a decrease of $4.8 billion (15 percent) compared to the average in 2020. The decrease in average investments reflected lower liquidity investments needed in light of the reduced Advance demand and lower MBS given the elevated levels of prepayments throughout 2021 as a result of the low interest rate environment and inability to quickly replace those investments with suitable alternatives. However, the ending balance of MBS increased primarily due to the purchase of $3.1 billion of new MBS in the second half of 2021. Liquidity investments can vary significantly on a daily basis during times of volatility in Advance balances. We maintained a robust amount of asset liquidity throughout 2021 across a variety of liquidity measures, as discussed in the \"Liquidity Risk\" section of \"Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Risk Management.\"\nCapital\nCapital adequacy surpassed all minimum regulatory capital requirements in 2021. The GAAP and regulatory capital-to-assets ratios at December 31, 2021 were 6.26 percent and 6.28 percent, respectively. Both ratios exceeded the regulatory required minimum of four percent. Regulatory capital includes mandatorily redeemable capital stock accounted for as a liability under GAAP. GAAP and regulatory capital decreased $0.1 billion and $0.2 billion, respectively, from year-end 2020. Retained earnings totaled $1.3 billion at December 31, 2021, a decrease of one percent from year-end 2020. We believe the amount of retained earnings is sufficient to protect against members' impairment risk of their capital stock investment in the FHLB and to provide the opportunity to stabilize or increase future dividends.\nResults of Operations\nOverall Results\nOur earnings over time reflect the combination of a stable business model and conservative management of risk. Key market driven factors that can cause significant periodic volatility in our profitability are changes in the level of interest rates, changes in spreads between benchmark interest rates and our short-term funding costs, recognition of net amortization due to accelerated prepayments of mortgage assets, and fair value adjustments related to the use of derivatives and the associated hedged items. Our profitability may also be affected by our members' overall Advance demand, which is largely influenced by the monetary policies of the U.S. government and its agencies, including the Federal Reserve, and general economic conditions. The table below summarizes our results of operations.\nTable 12: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Year Ended December 31, </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(Dollars in millions) </td> <td>2021 </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net income </td> <td>$ </td> <td>42 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>276 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>276 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Affordable Housing Program assessments </td> <td>5 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>31 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>31 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Return on average equity (ROE) </td> <td>1.08 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>5.78 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5.65 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Return on average assets </td> <td>0.07 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.31 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.28 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Weighted average dividend rate </td> <td>2.00 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2.23 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5.05 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Average short-term interest rates (1)\n</td> <td>0.12 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.51 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2.24 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>ROE spread to average short-term interest rates </td> <td>0.96 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5.27 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3.41 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Dividend rate spread to average short-term interest rates </td> <td>1.88 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1.72 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2.81 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\n(1)Average short-term interest rates consist of 3-month LIBOR and the Federal funds effective rate.\nNet income decreased $234 million in 2021. The decline in profitability in 2021 compared to 2020 was primarily due to low interest rates and an unprecedented amount of liquidity in the financial markets due to governmental stimulus actions, which impacted the following:\n\u25aaAdvances. Average Advance balances declined 45 percent. Although Advances grew significantly during the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic as members sought additional liquidity, balances subsequently fell in 2020 and have remained below pre-pandemic levels due to increased liquidity in the financial markets and increased deposit levels at member institutions. Additionally, Advance prepayment fees declined since members prepaid fewer Advances in 2021 than in the prior year.\n\u25aaMortgage Assets. The spreads earned on mortgage assets declined due to the accelerated payoff of higher-yielding mortgages at a faster pace than the associated debt funding them. The historically low long-term interest rates led to prepayments occurring faster than the purchases of new mortgage assets, which also resulted in the average balances of mortgage assets declining 25 percent.\nAdditionally, the FHLB sold interest rate swaptions in the first quarter of 2020 in response to changes in interest rates, which resulted in net realized gains of approximately $69 million before assessments. The FHLB did not sell any interest rate swaptions in 2021. The FHLB uses swaptions to hedge market risk exposure associated with holding fixed-rate mortgage assets and may sell them to offset the risk incurred due to changes in interest rates.\nIn 2021, we accrued $5 million for the Affordable Housing Program (AHP) pool of funds, a decrease of $26 million compared to 2020 given the lower level of earnings noted above. The funds accrued in 2021 will be available to members in 2022. In addition to the required AHP assessment, we provided voluntary sponsorship of two other housing programs. These programs provided funds to cover accessibility and emergency repairs for special needs and elderly homeowners and funds for the replacement or repair of homes damaged or destroyed by natural disasters within the Fifth District.\nIn December 2021, we paid stockholders a quarterly dividend at a 2.00 percent annualized rate on their capital investment in our company, which is 1.88 percentage points above fourth quarter average short-term interest rates.\nEffect of Interest Rate Environment\nTrends in market interest rates and the resulting shapes of the market yield curves strongly influence our results of operations and profitability because of how they affect members' demand for Mission Assets and Activities, spreads on assets, funding costs and decisions in managing the tradeoffs in our market risk/return profile. The following table presents key market interest rates (obtained from Bloomberg L.P.).\nTable 13: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td>

</tr>\n</table>\n(1) Current coupon rate of Fannie Mae par MBS indications.\nThe target overnight Federal funds rate was in the range of zero to 0.25 percent at December 31, 2021, unchanged from year-end 2020. The low interest rate environment reflects the Federal Reserve's response to the COVID-19 pandemic to keep interest rates low to facilitate liquidity. In March 2022, the Federal Reserve began to respond to inflationary concerns by increasing the target overnight Federal funds rate to a range of 0.25 to 0.50 percent while indicating further expected rate hikes in 2022.\nAverage short-term rates were approximately 30 to 50 basis points lower in 2021 compared to 2020 and average mortgage rates remained low, with the 15-year rate remaining the same while the 30-year rate increased only 15 basis points during the year. The overall low interest rate environment negatively impacted income in 2021 primarily because of a decrease in earnings generated from investing capital and lower spreads earned on mortgage assets due to the accelerated payoff of higher-yielding mortgages at a faster pace than the associated debt funding them.\nDuring 2021, as in 2020, the market risk exposure to changing interest rates was moderate overall and well within policy limits. We believe that longer-term profitability would not become uncompetitive unless interest rates were to change quickly and significantly. In the short-term, profitability could become uncompetitive if long-term interest rates decrease in excess of 100 basis points leading to faster prepayments of mortgage assets, which would further accelerate the recognition of purchased premiums.\nRegulatory and Legislative Developments\nGeneral\nThe FHLBank System is subject to legislative and regulatory oversight. Legislative and regulatory actions applicable, directly or indirectly, to the FHLBank System in the last decade have increased uncertainty regarding the business model and membership base under which the FHLBanks may operate in the future. This is due primarily to the uncertainty around potential future GSE reform, and the evolution of mortgage financing moving towards financial institutions currently not\neligible for FHLBank membership. See Item 1A. Risk Factors for more discussion. We cannot predict the ultimate outcome of GSE reform and whether our membership base will be legislatively and regulatorily permitted to evolve in concert with the housing finance market.\nFHLBank Membership\nOn September 9, 2021, the Finance Agency published a Supervisory Letter on FHLBank Membership Issues covering five issues, including (1) requirements for de novo Community Development Financial Institutions, (2) automatic transfer of membership, (3) large non-member institutions merging with small member institutions, (4) membership applicant's compliance with financial condition\u201d requirements, and (5) the definition of insurance company. The Supervisory Letter expresses the Finance Agency's views on these matters, which include the articulation of certain restrictions on eligibility for membership. The restrictions could result in:\n\u25aafewer opportunities for FHLBank membership; and/or\n\u25aaineligibility for continued membership by certain entities, most notably Community Development Financial Institutions, certain types of insurance companies and large institutions that have acquired small members.\nAccordingly, the restrictions could result in reduced opportunities for us to grow our membership and, in turn, fewer opportunities to provide our financial services. We continue to evaluate the Supervisory Letter and its effect on our membership.\nRegulatory Interpretation on Eligibility of Mortgage Participations as Collateral for FHLBank Advances\nOn October 4, 2021, the Finance Agency published a Regulatory Interpretation on Eligibility of Mortgage Loan Participations as Collateral for FHLBank Advances, which became effective on December 13, 2021. The Regulatory Interpretation addresses whether an FHLBank can accept as collateral mortgage loan participations that cannot be readily liquidated in the form they are pledged. The Regulatory Interpretation concludes that mortgage loan participations must meet the requirements of Finance Agency regulation 12 CFR 1266.7(a)(4), including the requirement that the collateral can be liquidated in due course\u201d in order to be eligible to secure Advances. It further concludes that participations for which there would be a known impediment to liquidation do not meet such requirement and therefore are not eligible collateral for Advances. Finally, the Regulatory Interpretation rescinds prior guidance from FHLBank System regulators that provide mortgage loan participations may be eligible as collateral under regulatory provisions other than 12 CFR 1266.7(a)(4). Although we do not currently expect the Regulatory Interpretation to have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations, this restriction on collateral may negatively impact future borrowing by certain members.\nFair Housing and Fair Lending Enforcement\nOn July 9, 2021, the Finance Agency published a Policy Statement on Fair Lending to communicate its general position on monitoring and information gathering, supervisory examinations, and administrative enforcement related to the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, the Fair Housing Act, and the Federal Housing Enterprises Financial Safety and Soundness Act. The Policy Statement became effective on the date of publication.\nOn August 12, 2021, the Finance Agency and the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development announced they had entered into a Memorandum of Understanding regarding fair housing and fair lending enforcement. Under the Memorandum of Understanding, the two agencies will focus on enhancing their enforcement of the Fair Housing Act, and their oversight of Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and the FHLBanks.\nWe continue to monitor these actions and guidance as they evolve and to evaluate their potential impact on us.\nAffordable Housing and Community Investment\nLegislation has been introduced in the U.S. Senate and House of Representatives that, if enacted in its proposed form, would require the FHLBanks to set aside higher percentages of their annual earnings for their affordable housing and community investment programs than are currently required by law. The FHLBanks continue to actively monitor any such potential legislation and developments.\nLIBOR Transition\nWe are planning for the replacement of LIBOR and the establishment of SOFR as the recommended alternative to LIBOR. Under the July 2017 and March 2021 announcements by the United Kingdom's Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), the one-week and two-month U.S. dollar LIBOR settings ceased to be provided by any administrator and were no longer representative as of January 1, 2022. The remaining U.S. dollar LIBOR settings will either cease to be provided by any administrator or no longer be representative immediately after June 30, 2023. Although the FCA does not expect these remaining LIBOR settings\nto become unrepresentative before the cessation date, there is no assurance that any of them will continue to be published or be representative through any particular date. In addition, the Adjustable Interest Rate (LIBOR) Act was signed into law on March 15, 2022. The legislation provides a statutory fallback mechanism and safe harbor on a nationwide basis to replace LIBOR with a benchmark rate, selected by the Federal Reserve Board based on SOFR, for certain contracts that reference LIBOR and contain no or insufficient fallback provisions, including fallback rates that are in any way based on LIBOR.\nAccordingly, we have developed and implemented a LIBOR transition plan to remediate our LIBOR-linked financial instruments and contracts. As the market activity in SOFR-linked financial instruments has continued to develop, we have offered SOFR-linked Consolidated Obligations and SOFR-linked Advances on an ongoing basis. In addition, we have been using SOFR-based derivatives to manage interest-rate risk, began purchasing SOFR-linked MBS in the second quarter of 2021, and began converting certain LIBOR-based derivatives to SOFR in 2021. During 2022, we expect to continue to convert certain LIBOR-based derivatives prior to the cessation of LIBOR to an alternative reference rate, such as SOFR. Collectively, we believe these efforts have reduced our LIBOR exposure and have kept us on track for the full replacement of LIBOR.\nThe following table presents our remaining LIBOR-indexed Advances, investment securities and derivatives at December 31, 2021. At December 31, 2021, all of our variable rate Consolidated Obligations were linked to SOFR.\nTable 15: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(In millions) </td> <td>Maturing on or before June 30, 2023 </td> <td> </td> <td>Maturing after June 30, 2023 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>LIBOR-Indexed Variable Rate Financial Instruments </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Advances by redemption term </td> <td>$ </td> <td>286 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>3,009 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>MBS by contractual maturity (1)\n</td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4,555 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total principal amount </td> <td>$ </td> <td>286 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>7,564 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Derivatives, notional amount by termination date </td> <td>$ </td> <td>3,375 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>3,454 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\n(1)MBS are presented by contractual maturity; however, their expected maturities will likely differ from contractual maturities as borrowers may have the right to call or prepay obligations with or without call or prepayment fees.\nThe market transition away from LIBOR towards SOFR is complicated, including the possible development of term structures and credit adjustments to accommodate differences between LIBOR and SOFR and the potential introduction of other alternative reference rates. As such, we are not currently able to predict the ultimate impact of such a transition on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION\nCredit

Advance balances have remained low since the last half of 2020 as members experienced a significant inflow of deposits on their balance sheets, while also having access to other liquidity sources as a result of certain government actions related to the COVID-19 pandemic.\nLetters of Credit are issued on behalf of members to support certain obligations of members (or member's customer) to third-party beneficiaries. Letters of Credit increased 20 percent compared to year-end 2020 primarily due to members using them to secure elevated levels of public unit deposits. Letters of Credit usually expire without being drawn upon.\nAdvance Usage\nIn addition to analyzing Advance balances by dollar trends, we monitor the degree to which members use Advances to fund their balance sheets.

actively use our products augments the value of membership to all members. For example, such activity improves our operating efficiency, increases our earnings and thereby contributions to housing and community investment programs. This activity may enable us to obtain more favorable funding costs, and helps us maintain competitively priced products.\nMortgage Loans Held for Portfolio (Mortgage Purchase Program, or MPP)\nMPP balances are influenced by conditions in the housing and mortgage markets, the competitiveness of prices we offer to purchase loans as well as program features, and activity from our largest sellers. Our ongoing strategy for the MPP has two components: 1) increase the number of regular sellers and participants in the program; and 2) manage purchases and balances at a prudent level relative to capital and total assets to effectively manage market and credit risks consistent with our risk appetite.\nThe table below shows principal purchases and reductions of loans in the MPP for each of the last two years.

MPP principal paydowns increased in 2021 to a 34 percent annual constant prepayment rate, compared to the 30 percent rate for all of 2020, driven by the historically low mortgage rates. Our purchases of new loans were much lower than the elevated level of repayments during 2021 due to balance sheet concentration considerations given our lower total assets and capital balances. Purchases of new MPP loans in 2021 continued to offer favorable returns.\nOverall, MPP yields on existing portfolio balances, net of funding and hedging costs, have declined and are expected to remain at lower levels in the short-term due to the accelerated payoff of higher-yielding mortgages at a faster pace than the associated debt funding them. Despite the lower yields on existing MPP balances, the metrics of portfolio return relative to their market and credit risks continue to indicate that the MPP has generated, and can be expected to continue to generate, a profitable long-term, risk-adjusted return.\nHousing and Community Investment\nIn 2021, we accrued $5 million of earnings for the Affordable Housing Program, which will be awarded to members in 2022. The Affordable Housing Program consists of a Competitive Program and a homeownership program called Welcome Home, which assists homebuyers with down payments and closing costs.\nIncluding funds available in 2021 from previous years, we had $25 million available for the Competitive Program in 2021, which we awarded to 51 projects through a single competitive offering. In addition, we disbursed over $10 million to 170 members on behalf of 2,054 homebuyers through the Welcome Home Program, which assists homebuyers with down payments and closing costs.\nAdditionally, in 2021, our Board committed $1.0 million to the Carol M. Peterson Housing Fund, which helped 145 homeowners, and continued its commitment to the Disaster Reconstruction Program. Both are voluntary programs beyond the 10 percent of earnings that we are required by law to set aside for the Affordable Housing Program.\nOur activities to support affordable housing and economic development also include offering Advances through the Affordable Housing Program, Community Investment Program, Economic Development Program and Zero Interest Rate Fund with below-market interest rates at or near funding costs. At the end of 2021, Advance balances under these programs totaled $198 million.\nIn 2021, approximately 34 percent of members applied for funding under our Housing and Community Investment programs.\nInvestments\nThe table below presents the ending and average balances of our investment portfolio.\nTable 23: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(In millions) </td> <td>2021 </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Ending Balance </td> <td> </td> <td>Average Balance </td> <td> </td> <td>Ending Balance </td> <td> </td> <td>Average Balance </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Liquidity investments </td> <td>$ </td> <td>18,589 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>18,576 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>17,285 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>20,548 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>MBS </td> <td>10,803 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>9,186 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>9,756 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>11,864 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other investments (1)\n</td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>340 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td>459 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total investments </td> <td>$ </td> <td>29,392 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>28,102 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>27,041 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>32,871 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\n(1)The average balance includes the rights or obligations to cash collateral, which are included in the fair value of derivative assets or derivative liabilities on the Statements of Condition at period end.\nLiquidity investments are either short-term (primarily overnight), or longer-term investments that can be easily sold and converted to cash. Under the regulatory requirements, liquidity includes certain high-quality liquid assets, which are defined as U.S. Treasury obligations with remaining maturities of 10 years or less held as trading securities or available-for-sale securities. It is normal for liquidity investments to vary by up to several billion dollars on a daily basis. Liquidity investment levels can vary significantly based on changes in the amount of actual Advances, anticipated demand for Advances, liquidity needs, the availability of acceptable net spreads, and the number of eligible counterparties that meet our unsecured credit risk criteria. The average balance of liquidity investments for 2021 fell $2.0 billion (10 percent) from the average balance for all of 2020 due to lower liquidity investments being needed in light of the reduced Advance demand.\nOur overarching strategy for balances of MBS is to keep holdings as close as possible to the regulatory maximum. Finance Agency regulations prohibit us from purchasing MBS if our investment in these securities exceeds three times regulatory capital on the day we intend to purchase the securities. The ratio of MBS to regulatory capital was 2.84 at December 31, 2021. The MBS ratio was lower than our preference to hold it close to the 3.00 regulatory maximum primarily due to the paydowns of MBS given the low interest rate environment. In addition, regulatory limitations regarding the purchase of investments that reference LIBOR slowed the pace at which we were able to replace the prepaid MBS with suitable alternatives that provided an acceptable risk/return tradeoff. However, our purchases of MBS have increased beginning in the second half of 2021 as we purchased $3.1 billion in the last six months of the year. The majority of these purchases were variable-rate MBS linked to SOFR.\nThe balance of MBS at December 31, 2021 consisted of $9.7 billion of securities issued by Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac (of which $7.5 billion were floating-rate securities), and $1.1 billion of securities issued by Ginnie Mae (which are primarily fixed rate).\nThe table below shows principal purchases and paydowns of our MBS for each of the last two years.\nTable 24: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(In millions) </td> <td>MBS Principal </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>2021 </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Balance, beginning of year </td> <td>$ </td> <td>9,745 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>13,447 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Principal purchases </td> <td>3,837 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>149 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Principal paydowns </td> <td>(2,787) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(3,851) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Balance, end of year </td> <td>$ </td> <td>10,795 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>9,745 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nMBS principal paydowns in 2021 equated to a 26 percent annual constant prepayment rate, a slight decrease from the 27 percent rate experienced in 2020. The elevated prepayment rates experienced in 2021 and 2020 is a result of the historically low mortgage rate environment.\nConsolidated Obligations\nWe fund variable-rate assets with Discount Notes (a portion of which may be swapped), adjustable-rate Bonds, and swapped fixed-rate Bonds because they give us the ability to effectively match the underlying rate reset periods embedded in these assets. The balances and composition of our Consolidated Obligations tend to fluctuate with changes in the balances and composition of our assets. In addition, changes in the amount and composition of our funding may be necessary from time to time to meet the days of positive liquidity and asset/liability maturity funding gap requirements discussed in the \"Liquidity Risk\" section of \"Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Risk Management.\"\nThe table below presents the ending and average balances of our participations in Consolidated Obligations.\nTable 25: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(In millions) </td> <td>2021 </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Ending Balance </td> <td> </td> <td>Average Balance </td> <td> </td> <td>Ending Balance </td> <td> </td> <td>Average Balance </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Discount Notes: </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Unswapped </td> <td>$ </td> <td>19,418 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>22,933 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>27,503 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>39,478 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Swapped </td> <td>10,426 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3,156 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3,843 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total par Discount Notes </td> <td>29,844 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>26,089 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>27,503 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>43,321 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other items (1)\n</td> <td>(6) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(1) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(3) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(37) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total Discount Notes </td> <td>29,838 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>26,088 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>27,500 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>43,284 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Bonds: </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Unswapped fixed-rate </td> <td>16,112 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>18,840 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>18,940 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>21,288 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Unswapped adjustable-rate (2)\n</td> <td>850 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6,710 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>10,639 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>13,394 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Swapped fixed-rate </td> <td>7,627 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,737 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,372 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3,547 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total par Bonds </td> <td>24,589 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>28,287 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>31,951 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>38,229 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other items (1)\n</td> <td>13 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>24 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>46 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>68 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total Bonds </td> <td>24,602 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>28,311 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>31,997 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>38,297 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total Consolidated Obligations (3)\n</td> <td>$ </td> <td>54,440 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>54,399 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>59,497 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>81,581 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\n(1)Includes unamortized premiums/discounts, fair value option valuation adjustments, hedging and other basis adjustments.\n(2)At December 31, 2021 and 2020, all unswapped adjustable-rate Bonds were indexed to SOFR.\n(3)The 11 FHLBanks have joint and several liability for the par amount of all of the Consolidated Obligations issued on their behalves. The par amount of the outstanding Consolidated Obligations for all of the FHLBanks was (in millions) $652,862 and $746,772 at December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively.\nThe average balances of Discount Notes and unswapped adjustable-rate Bonds in 2021 were significantly lower compared to the averages in 2020 due to the growth in short-term and variable-rate Advances in the first quarter of 2020 as members sought additional liquidity during the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. However, most of these Advances matured or prepaid by the end of 2020 and the demand for Advances has remained below pre-pandemic levels.\nThe ending balances of swapped Discount Notes and swapped fixed-rate Bonds at the end of 2021 were higher than year-end 2020 due to the market environment at the end of 2021 favoring swapped debt. We swap term Discount Notes and fixed-rate bonds to adjustable-rates in order to match the underlying rate reset periods to the assets the Discount Notes and Bonds are funding as well as reduce the repricing risk of Discount Notes.\nThe following table shows the allocation on December 31, 2021 of unswapped fixed-rate Bonds according to their final remaining maturity and next call date (for callable Bonds). We believe that the allocations of Bonds among these classifications provide effective mitigation of market risk exposure to both higher and lower interest rates.\nTable 26: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(In millions) </td> <td>Year of Maturity </td> <td> </td> <td>Year of Next Call </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Callable </td> <td>Noncallable </td> <td> </td> <td>Total </td> <td> </td> <td>Callable </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Due in 1 year or less </td> <td>$ </td> <td>25 </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>4,787 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>4,812 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>4,715 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Due after 1 year through 2 years </td> <td>936 </td> <td> </td> <td>2,440 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3,376 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>185 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Due after 2 years through 3 years </td> <td>462 </td> <td> </td> <td>1,262 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,724 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Due after 3 years through 4 years </td> <td>1,367 </td> <td> </td> <td>728 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,095 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Due after 4 years through 5 years </td> <td>323 </td> <td> </td> <td>547 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>870 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Thereafter </td> <td>1,787 </td> <td> </td> <td>1,448 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3,235 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total </td> <td>$ </td> <td>4,900 </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>11,212 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>16,112 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>4,900 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nDeposits\nTotal deposits with us are normally a relatively minor source of low-cost funding.

We consider the regulatory ratio to be a better representation of financial leverage than the GAAP ratio because, although the GAAP ratio treats mandatorily redeemable capital stock as a liability, it protects investors in our debt in the same manner as GAAP capital stock and retained earnings.\nTable 27: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Year Ended December 31, </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(In millions) </td> <td>2021 </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Period End </td> <td> </td> <td>Average </td> <td> </td> <td>Period End </td> <td> </td> <td>Average </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>GAAP and Regulatory Capital </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>GAAP Capital Stock </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2,490 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2,585 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2,641 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>3,567 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Mandatorily Redeemable Capital Stock </td> <td>21 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>19 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>19 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>55 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Regulatory Capital Stock </td> <td>2,511 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,604 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,660 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3,622 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Retained Earnings </td> <td>1,293 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,304 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,304 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,228 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Regulatory Capital </td> <td>$ </td> <td>3,804 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>3,908 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>3,964 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>4,850 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 28: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>2021 </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Period End </td> <td> </td> <td>Average </td> <td> </td> <td>Period End </td> <td> </td> <td>Average </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>GAAP and Regulatory Capital-to-Assets Ratio </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>GAAP </td> <td>6.26 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>6.40 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>6.02 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>5.39 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Regulatory (1)\n</td> <td>6.28 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6.44 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6.07 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5.47 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\n(1) At all times, the FHLB must maintain at least a four percent minimum regulatory capital-to-assets ratio.\nThe following table presents the sources of change in regulatory capital stock balances in 2021 and 2020.\nTable 29: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(In millions) </td> <td>2021 </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Regulatory stock balance at beginning of year </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2,660 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>3,389 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Stock purchases: </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Membership stock </td> <td>20 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>25 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Activity stock </td> <td>1,089 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,110 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Stock repurchases/redemptions: </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Redemption of member excess </td> <td>(60) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(558) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Repurchase of member excess </td> <td>(1,186) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(2,300) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Withdrawals </td> <td>(12) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(6) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Regulatory stock balance at the end of the year </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2,511 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2,660 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nOur business model is structured to be able to absorb sharp changes in assets because we can execute commensurate changes in liability and capital stock balances. For example, in 2021, we issued $1.1 billion of capital stock to members in support of short-term Advance borrowings that were subsequently repaid prior to December 31, 2021. During the same period, we repurchased $1.2 billion of capital stock in response to members' subsequent repayment of Advances.\nA portion of our capital stock is excess, meaning it is not required as a condition to being a member and is not currently capitalizing Mission Assets and Activities. Excess capital stock provides a base of capital to manage financial leverage at prudent levels, augments loss protections for bondholders, and may be used to capitalize a portion of growth in Mission Assets and Activities. At December 31, 2021, the amount of excess stock, as defined by our Capital Plan, was $426 million, an increase of $198 million from year-end 2020. The balance of excess stock may fluctuate as short-term Advance borrowings can be volatile.\nSee the \"Capital Adequacy\" section in Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Risk Management\u201d for discussion of our retained earnings.\nMembership and Stockholders\nIn 2021, we added 11 new member stockholders and lost 21 member stockholders, ending the year at 618 member stockholders. Thirteen of the 21 members lost in 2021 were attributable to intra-district merger activity.\nIn 2021, there were no material changes in the allocation of membership by state, charter type, or asset size.

Accordingly, recalculations based upon the disclosed amounts in millions may produce nominally different results.\nDetails on the individual factors contributing to the level and changes in profitability are explained in the sections below.\nNet Interest Income\nThe largest component of net income is net interest income. Our principal goal in managing net interest income is to balance the trade-offs between maintaining a moderate market risk profile and ensuring profitability remains competitive. Effective risk/return management requires us to focus principally on the relationships among assets and liabilities that affect net interest income, rather than individual balance sheet and income statement accounts in isolation.\nOur ROE normally is lower than that of many other financial institutions because of the cooperative wholesale business model that results in narrow spreads earned on our assets, the moderate overall risk profile, and the strategic objective to have a positive correlation of earnings to short-term interest rates.\nComponents of Net Interest Income\nWe generate net interest income from the following two components:\n\u25aaNet interest rate spread. This component equals the balance of total earning assets multiplied by the difference between the book yield on interest-earning assets and the book cost of interest-bearing liabilities. It is composed of net (amortization)/accretion, prepayment fees on Advances, and all other earnings from interest-earning assets net of funding costs. The latter is the largest component and represents the coupon yields of interest-earning assets net of the coupon costs of interest-bearing liabilities.\n\u25aaEarnings from funding assets with capital ( earnings from capital\u201d). Because of our relatively low net interest rate spread compared to other financial institutions, we have historically derived a substantial portion of net interest income from deploying interest-free capital in interest-earning assets. We deploy much of the capital in short-term and adjustable-rate assets in order to help ensure that ROE moves in the same direction as short-term interest rates and to help control market risk exposure.\nThe following table shows selected components of net interest income. Reasons for the variance in net interest income between the 2021 and 2020 periods are discussed below.\nTable 34: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(Dollars in millions) </td> <td>2021 </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Amount </td> <td> </td> <td>% of Earning Assets </td> <td> </td> <td>Amount </td> <td> </td> <td>% of Earning Assets </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Amount </td> <td> </td> <td>% of Earning Assets </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Components of net interest rate spread:\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net (amortization)/accretion (1) (2)\n</td> <td>$ </td> <td>(87) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(0.15) </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(115) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(0.13) </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(37) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(0.04) </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Prepayment fees on Advances, net (2)\n</td> <td>13 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.02 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>34 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.04 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>8 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.01 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other components of net interest rate spread\n</td> <td>324 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.54 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>441 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.50 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>317 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.33 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total net interest rate spread </td> <td>250 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.41 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>360 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.41 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>288 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.30 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Earnings from funding assets with interest-free capital\n</td> <td>27 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.05 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>46 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.05 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>118 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.12 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total net interest income/net interest margin (3)\n</td> <td>$ </td> <td>277 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.46 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>406 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.46 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>406 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.42 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table>\n(1)Includes monthly recognition of premiums and discounts paid on purchases of mortgage assets, premiums, discounts and concessions paid on Consolidated Obligations and other hedging basis adjustments.\n(2)This component of net interest rate spread has been segregated to display its relative impact.\n(3)Net interest margin is net interest income as a percentage of average total interest-earning assets.\nNet Amortization/Accretion (generally referred to as \"amortization\"): Net amortization can become substantial and volatile with changes in interest rates. When mortgage rates decrease, premium amortization of mortgage assets generally increases, which reduces net interest income. Net amortization in 2021 and 2020 was elevated due to the historically low mortgage rates, which led to accelerated prepayments of mortgage assets. Net amortization was higher in 2020 given the considerable decline in mortgage rates that took place in the first half of 2020. Mortgage rates have remained low, but experienced a small increase in 2021.\nPrepayment Fees on Advances: Fees for members' early repayment of certain Advances, which are included in net interest income, are designed to make us economically indifferent to whether members hold Advances to maturity or repay them before maturity. Advance prepayment fees were moderate in 2021. The higher Advance prepayment fees in 2020 were caused by a higher amount of member prepayments of Advances as interest rates declined.\nOther Components of Net Interest Rate Spread: The total other components of net interest rate spread decreased $117 million in 2021 compared to 2020. The net decrease was primarily due to the factors below.\n2021 Versus 2020\n\u25aaLower average Advance balances-Unfavorable: The $19.4 billion decrease in the average balance of Advances lowered net interest income by an estimated $63 million.\n\u25aaLower spreads earned on mortgage assets-Unfavorable: Lower spreads on the mortgage assets portfolio decreased net interest income by an estimated $58 million. The lower spreads were driven by the decline in average long-term interest rates in 2020, which accelerated the payoff of higher-yielding mortgages at a faster pace than the associated debt funding them.\n\u25aaLower average balances of mortgage assets-Unfavorable: The $2.7 billion decrease in the average balance of mortgage-backed securities and the $3.1 billion decrease in the average balance of mortgage loans held for portfolio lowered net interest income by an estimated $44 million. Mortgage balances declined due to the acceleration of principal cash flows driven by historically low mortgage interest rates.\n\u25aaHigher spreads on shorter-term and floating-rate asset balances-Favorable: Higher spreads on shorter-term assets and floating-rate assets (including those that have been swapped to a floating rate) improved net interest income by an estimated $31 million as the rates on the debt funding these assets declined. However, the increase in net interest income was more than offset by lower non-interest income (loss) primarily due to an increase of $37 million in the net interest settlements being paid on related derivatives not receiving hedge accounting.\n\u25aaUnrealized gains on designated fair value hedges-Favorable: Net unrealized gains on hedged items and derivatives in qualifying fair value hedge relationships improved net interest income by $17 million.\nEarnings from Capital: Earnings from capital decreased $19 million in 2021 compared to 2020 primarily due to lower average short-term interest rates as the Federal Reserve has continued to keep rates low in response to the evolving risks to economic activity from the COVID-19 pandemic.\nAverage Balance Sheet and Rates\nThe following table provides average balances and rates for major balance sheet accounts, which determine the changes in net interest rate spreads. Interest amounts and average rates are affected by our use of derivatives and the related accounting elections we make. Interest amounts reported for Advances, MBS, Other investments and Swapped Bonds include gains (losses) on hedged items and derivatives in qualifying fair value hedge relationships.\nIn addition, the net interest settlements of interest receivables or payables associated with derivatives in a fair value hedge relationship are included in net interest income and interest rate spread. However, if the derivatives do not qualify for fair value hedge accounting, the related net interest settlements of interest receivables or payables are recorded in Non-interest income (loss)\u201d as Net gains (losses) on derivatives\u201d and therefore are excluded from the calculation of net interest rate spread. Amortization associated with some hedging-related basis adjustments is also reflected in net interest income, which affects interest rate spread.\nTable 35: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td>

of derivatives and hedging activities. As noted above, gains (losses) on hedged items and derivatives in qualifying fair value hedge relationships are recorded in interest income or expense. In addition, for derivatives designated as a fair value hedge, the net interest settlements of interest receivables or payables related to such derivatives are recognized as adjustments to the interest income or expense of the designated hedged item. As such, all the effects on earnings of derivatives qualifying for fair value hedge accounting are reflected in net interest income. The effect on earnings from derivatives not receiving fair value hedge accounting is provided in the Non-Interest Income (Loss)\u201d section below.\nTable 39: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(In millions) </td> <td>2021 </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Advances: </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Amortization of hedging activities in net interest income\n</td> <td>$ </td> <td>(1) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(1) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(1) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gains (losses) on designated fair value hedges\n</td> <td>1 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(16) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(6) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net interest settlements included in net interest income\n</td> <td>(110) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(91) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>36 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Investment securities: </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net interest settlements included in net interest income\n</td> <td>(20) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(2) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Mortgage loans: </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Amortization of derivative fair value adjustments in net interest income\n</td> <td>(12) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(12) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(3) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Consolidated Obligation Bonds: </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net interest settlements included in net interest income\n</td> <td>1 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Increase (decrease) to net interest income </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(141) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(120) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>28 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nMost of our use of derivatives is to synthetically convert the fixed interest rates on certain Advances, investments and Consolidated Obligations to adjustable rates tied to an eligible benchmark rate (e.g., LIBOR, the Federal funds effective rate, or SOFR). The larger negative effect of derivatives on net interest income in 2021 was primarily due to lower short-term benchmark interest rates, which resulted in higher net interest settlements being paid on certain Advances and investments where the fixed interest rates were converted to adjustable-coupon rates. The fluctuation in earnings from the use of derivatives was acceptable because it enabled us to lower market risk exposure by matching actual cash flows between assets and liabilities more closely and efficiently than would otherwise occur.\nNon-Interest Income (Loss)\nNon-interest income (loss) consists of certain realized and unrealized gains (losses) on investment securities, derivatives activities, financial instruments held under the fair value option, and other non-interest earning activities. The following tables present the net effect of derivatives and hedging activities on non-interest income (loss). The effects of derivatives and hedging activities on non-interest income (loss) relate only to derivatives not qualifying for fair value hedge accounting.\nTable 40: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td>

securities that have an assigned economic derivative; therefore, this line item may not agree to the Statement of Income.\n(3)Includes only those gains or losses on financial instruments held at fair value that have an economic derivative \"assigned.\"\n \nThe net effect of derivatives and hedging activities was more unfavorable in 2021 compared to 2020. Non-interest income in 2020 benefited from the sale of interest rate swaptions as interest rates fell to historically low levels during the first quarter of 2020. The sales of swaptions in the first quarter of 2020 resulted in net realized gains of approximately $69 million before assessments. We did not sell any interest rate swaptions in 2021. We use swaptions to hedge market risk exposure associated with fixed-rate mortgage assets and may sell swaptions as interest rates change in order to offset actual and anticipated risks associated with holding fixed-rate mortgage assets. Additionally, the negative impact in 2021 was largely a result of less net interest settlements being received on swapped Discount Notes and Bonds and the unrealized gains on derivatives and instruments held at fair value recognized in 2020, which were not experienced in 2021.\nIn the table above, \"Gains (losses) on trading securities\" consist of fixed-rate U.S. Treasury and GSE obligations that have been swapped to a variable rate. Trading securities are recorded at fair value, with changes in fair value reported in non-interest income (loss). There are a number of factors that affect the fair value of these securities, including changes in interest rates, the passage of time, and volatility. By hedging these trading securities, the gains or losses on these trading securities will generally be offset by the gains or losses on the associated interest rate swaps.\nNon-Interest Expense\nThe following table presents non-interest expense for each of the last three years.\nTable 43: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(In millions) </td> <td>2021 </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Non-interest expense </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Compensation and benefits </td> <td>$ </td> <td>48 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>50 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>46 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other operating expense </td> <td>23 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>21 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>22 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Finance Agency </td> <td>7 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>7 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>7 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Office of Finance </td> <td>5 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other </td> <td>9 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>9 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>9 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total non-interest expense </td> <td>$ </td> <td>92 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>92 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>89 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nOur business is designed to support significant changes in asset levels without having to undergo material changes in staffing, operations, risk practices, or general resource needs.

In the second quarter of 2021, ROE was comparatively lower than other quarters due to unrealized losses on derivatives and hedging activities and instruments held at fair value.\nSegment Information\nNote 14 of the Notes to Financial Statements presents information on our two operating business segments. We manage financial operations and market risk exposure primarily at the macro level, and within the context of the entire balance sheet, rather than exclusively at the level of individual segments. Under this approach, the market risk/return profile of each segment may not match, or possibly even have the same trends as, what would occur if we managed each segment on a stand-alone basis.

Accordingly, recalculations based upon the disclosed amounts in millions may not produce the same results.\nTraditional Member Finance Segment\nNet income decreased in 2021 compared to 2020 primarily due to the decline in average Advance and MBS balances, lower spreads on MBS, lower Advance prepayment fees, and net unrealized losses on derivatives and hedging activities and instruments held at fair value.\nMPP Segment\nDue to the low interest rate environment, the MPP segment experienced a net loss in 2021. The net loss was due to lower average MPP balances, elevated net amortization, and lower portfolio spreads earned on MPP driven by the accelerated payoff of higher-yielding mortgages at a faster pace than the associated debt funding them. Net income in 2020 significantly benefited from gains due to the sale of interest rate swaptions as rates fell to historically low levels in the first quarter of 2020. We did not sell any swaptions in 2021.\nQUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT RISK MANAGEMENT\nOverview\nWe face various risks that could affect the ability to achieve our mission and corporate objectives. We generally categorize risks as: 1) business/strategic risk, 2) regulatory/legal risk, 3) market risk (also referred to as interest rate or prepayment risk), 4) credit risk, 5) funding/liquidity risk, and 6) operational risk. Our Board of Directors establishes objectives regarding risk philosophy, risk appetite, risk tolerances, and financial performance expectations. Market, capital adequacy, credit, liquidity, concentration, and operational risks are discussed below. Other risks are discussed throughout this report.\nWe strive to maintain a risk profile that ensures we operate safely and soundly, promotes prudent growth in Mission Assets and Activities, consistently generates competitive earnings, and protects the par value of members' capital stock investment. We believe our business is financially sound and adequately capitalized on a risk-adjusted basis.\nWe practice this conservative risk philosophy in many ways:\n\u25aaWe operate with moderate market risk and limited residual credit risk, liquidity risk, operational risk, and capital impairment risk.\n\u25aaWe have a business objective to ensure competitive and relatively stable profitability.\n\u25aaWe make conservative investment choices in terms of the types of investments we purchase and counterparties with which we engage.\n\u25aaWe use derivatives to hedge assets and liabilities and to help reduce market risk exposure.\n\u25aaWe maintain a prudent amount of financial leverage.\n\u25aaWe are judicious in instituting regular, district-wide repurchases of excess stock.\n\u25aaWe hold an amount of retained earnings that we believe will protect the par value of capital stock and provide for dividend stabilization.\n\u25aaWe create a working and operating environment that emphasizes a stable employee base.\nWe have numerous Board-adopted policies and processes that address risk management including risk appetite, tolerances, limits, guidelines, and regulatory compliance. Our cooperative business model, corporate objectives, capital structure, and regulatory oversight provide us clear incentives to minimize risk exposures. Our policies and operating practices are designed to limit risk exposures from ongoing operations in the following broad ways:\n\u25aaby anticipating potential business risks and developing appropriate responses;\n\u25aaby defining permissible lines of business;\n\u25aaby limiting the kinds of assets we are permitted to hold in terms of their credit risk exposure and the kinds of hedging and financing arrangements we are permitted to use;\n\u25aaby limiting the amount of market risk to which we are permitted to be exposed;\n\u25aaby specifying very conservative tolerances for credit risk posed by Advances;\n\u25aaby specifying capital adequacy minimums; and\n\u25aaby requiring strict adherence to internal controls and operating procedures, adequate insurance coverage, and comprehensive Human Resources policies, procedures, and strategies.\nMarket Risk\nOverview\nMarket risk exposure is the risk that profitability and the value of stockholders' capital investment may decrease and that profitability may become uncompetitive for an extended period as a result of changes and volatility in the market environment and economy. Along with business/strategic risk, market risk is normally our largest residual risk.\nOur risk appetite is to maintain market risk exposure in a low to moderate range while earning a competitive return on members' capital stock investment. There is normally a tradeoff between long-term market risk exposure and shorter-term exposure. Effective management of each component is important in order to attract and retain members and capital and to support Mission Assets and Activities.\nThe primary challenges in managing market risk exposure arise from 1) the tradeoff between earning a competitive return and correlating profitability with short-term interest rates and 2) the market risk exposure of owning mortgage assets. Mortgage assets grant homeowners prepayment options that could adversely affect our financial performance when interest rates increase or decrease. We mitigate the market risk of mortgage assets primarily by funding them principally with a portfolio of long-term fixed-rate callable and non-callable Bonds. Secondarily, we use swaption derivative transactions to a limited extent to mitigate the market risk of mortgage assets. The Bonds and swaptions can provide expected cash flows that are similar to the cash flows expected from mortgage assets under a wide range of interest rate and prepayment environments. Because it is normally cost-prohibitive to completely mitigate mortgage prepayment risk, a residual amount of market risk remains after funding and hedging activities.\nWe analyze market risk using numerous analytical measures under a variety of interest rate and business scenarios, including stressed scenarios, and perform sensitivity analyses on the many variables that can affect market risk, using several market risk models from third-party software companies. These models employ rigorous valuation techniques for the optionality that exists in mortgage prepayments, call and put options, and caps/floors. We regularly assess the effects of different assumptions, techniques and methodologies on the measurements of market risk exposure, including comparisons to alternative models and information from brokers/dealers.\nPolicy Limits on Market Risk Exposure\nWe have six sets of policy limits regarding market risk exposure, which primarily measure long-term market risk exposure. We determine compliance with our policy limits at every month end or more frequently if market or business conditions change significantly or are volatile.\n\u25aaMarket Value of Equity Sensitivity. The market value of equity for the entire balance sheet in two hypothetical interest rate scenarios (up 200 basis points and down 100 to 200 basis points from the current interest rate environment) must be between positive and negative 10 percent of the current balance sheet's market value of equity. The interest rate movements are shocks,\u201d defined as instantaneous, permanent, and parallel changes in interest rates in which every point on the yield curve is changed by the same amount. The size of the down shock varies with the level of long-term interest rates observed when measuring the risk.\n\u25aaDuration of Equity. The duration of equity for the entire balance sheet in the current ( base case\u201d) interest rate environment must be between positive and negative five years and in the two interest rate shock scenarios (up 200 basis points and down 100 to 200 basis points from the current interest rate environment) must be between positive and negative six years.\n\u25aaMortgage Assets Portfolio. The change in net market value of the mortgage assets portfolio as a percentage of the book value of portfolio assets must be between positive and negative three percent in each of the two interest rate shock scenarios. Net market value is defined as the market value of assets minus the market value of liabilities, with no assumed capital allocation.\n\u25aaMarket Capitalization. The market capitalization ratio (defined as the ratio of the market value of equity to the par value of regulatory stock) must be above 100 percent in the current rate environment and must be above 95 percent in each of the two interest rate shock scenarios.\n\u25aaFixed Rate Mortgage Assets as a Multiple of Regulatory Capital. The amount of fixed mortgage assets must be less than five times the amount of regulatory capital.\n\u25aaMPP Assets as a Multiple of Regulatory Capital. The amount of MPP assets must be less than four times the amount of regulatory capital.\nIn addition, Finance Agency regulations and an internal policy provide controls on market risk exposure by restricting the types of mortgage loans, mortgage-backed securities and other investments we can hold. We also manage market risk exposure by charging members prepayment fees on many Advance programs where an early termination of an Advance would result in an economic loss to us.\nIn practice we carry a substantially smaller amount of market risk exposure by establishing a strategic management range that is well within policy limits.\nMarket Value of Equity and Duration of Equity - Entire Balance Sheet\nTwo key measures of long-term market risk exposure are the sensitivities of the market value of equity and the duration of equity to changes in interest rates and other variables, as presented in the following tables for various instantaneous and permanent interest rate shocks (in basis points). We compiled average results using data for each month end. Given the current level of rates, some down rate shocks are nonparallel scenarios, with short-term rates decreasing less than long-term rates such that no rate falls below zero.\nMarket Value of

At December 31, 2021, market risk exposure to rising and falling rate shocks shifted modestly driven by significant changes in the overall composition of the mortgage loans portfolio. Changes in the composition of the mortgage loans portfolio tends to happen more rapidly during a period of a decline in interest rates and subsequent elevated mortgage repayments. In addition to the noted changes in balance sheet composition, the increased exposure to rising rate shocks was impacted by the rise in long-term interest rates that occurred in 2021. Exposure to falling interest rates in the down shock scenarios continues to be muted as some rates become floored at near zero rate levels. The duration of equity, which provides an estimate of the change in market value of equity to further changes in interest rates, increased modestly due to the factors noted above, but remained well within policy limits.\nBased on the totality of our risk analysis, we expect that profitability, defined as the level of ROE compared with short-term market rates, will be competitive over the long term unless interest rates increase by large amounts in a short period of time.\nDeclines in long-term interest rates could materially decrease income temporarily before reverting to average levels. This temporary reduction in income would be driven by additional recognition of mortgage asset premiums as the further incentive for borrowers to refinance results in faster than anticipated repayments of those mortgage assets.\nMarket Risk Exposure of the Mortgage Assets Portfolio\nThe mortgage assets portfolio normally accounts for almost all market risk exposure because of prepayment volatility that we cannot completely hedge while maintaining sufficient net spreads. Sensitivities of the market value of equity allocated to the mortgage assets portfolio under interest rate shocks (in basis points) are shown below. The average mortgage assets portfolio had an assumed capital allocation of $1.1 billion in 2021 based on the entire balance sheet's average regulatory capital-to-assets ratio. Average results shown in the table below are compiled using data for each month end. The market value sensitivities are one measure we use to analyze the portfolio's estimated market risk exposure.\n% Change in Market Value of Equity-Mortgage Assets Portfolio\nTable 50: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Down 300 </td> <td> </td> <td>Down 200 </td> <td> </td> <td>Down 100 </td> <td> </td> <td>Flat Rates </td> <td> </td> <td>Up 100 </td> <td> </td> <td>Up 200 </td> <td> </td> <td>Up 300 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Average Results </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2021 Full Year </td> <td>(11.2) </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>(10.7) </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>(5.9) </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(1.4) </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>(5.8) </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>(7.7) </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2020 Full Year </td> <td>(15.9) </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>(15.9) </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>(14.6) </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>11.9 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>2.4 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>(10.3) </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Month-End Results </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>December 31, 2021 </td> <td>(4.8) </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>(4.8) </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>(2.8) </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(3.4) </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>(9.9) </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>(14.4) </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>December 31, 2020 </td> <td>(15.3) </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>(15.3) </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>(11.3) </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>10.6 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>3.9 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>(1.7) </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe average risk exposure of the mortgage assets portfolio in 2021 remained aligned with our preference to keep our exposure to market risk at a low to moderate level. The variances between periods primarily reflect the impact of slightly higher long-term interest rates observed in 2021 combined with the shift in composition of the mortgage asset portfolio, which was accelerated by rapid repayments of mortgage assets throughout 2021. We believe the mortgage asset portfolio will continue to provide an acceptable risk adjusted return consistent with our risk appetite philosophy.\nUse of Derivatives in Market Risk Management\nA key component of hedging market risk exposure is the use of derivative transactions. The following table presents the notional amounts of the derivatives classified by how we designate the hedging relationship. The notional amount of derivatives at December 31, 2021 increased by $13.2 billion from the end of 2020, primarily due to our heightened use of swapped Discount Notes and swapped fixed-rate Bonds in the current market environment.\nTable 51: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td>

including market, credit, and operational. We regularly conduct a variety of measurements and assessments for capital adequacy. At December 31, 2021, our capital management policy set forth approximately $270 million as the minimum amount of retained earnings we believe is necessary to mitigate impairment risk.\nThe following table presents retained earnings.\nTable 52: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(In millions) </td> <td>December 31, 2021 </td> <td> </td> <td>December 31, 2020 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Unrestricted retained earnings </td> <td>$ </td> <td>783 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>803 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Restricted retained earnings (1)\n</td> <td>510 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>501 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total retained earnings </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,293 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,304 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\n(1) Pursuant to the FHLBank System's Joint Capital Enhancement Agreement we are not permitted to distribute as dividends.\nAs indicated in the table above, our current balance of retained earnings exceeds the policy minimum, which we expect will continue to be the case as we bolster capital adequacy over time by allocating a portion of earnings to the restricted retained earnings account.\nRisk-Based Capital\nThe following table shows the amount of risk-based capital required based on Finance Agency prescribed measurements. By\nregulation, we are required to hold permanent capital at least equal to the amount of risk-based capital.\nTable 53: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(Dollars in millions) </td> <td>December 31, 2021 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>December 31, 2020 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Market risk-based capital </td> <td>$ </td> <td>435 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>211 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Credit risk-based capital </td> <td>224 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>204 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operational risk-based capital </td> <td>197 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>124 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total risk-based capital requirement </td> <td>856 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>539 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total permanent capital </td> <td>3,804 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3,964 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Excess permanent capital </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2,948 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>3,425 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Risk-based capital as a percent of permanent capital </td> <td>23 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>14 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe risk-based capital requirement has historically not been a constraint on operations, and we do not use it to actively manage\nany of our risks. It has normally ranged from 10 to 25 percent of permanent capital.\nMarket Capitalization Ratios\nWe measure two sets of market capitalization ratios. One measures the market value of equity (i.e., total capital) relative to the par value of regulatory capital stock (which is GAAP capital stock and mandatorily redeemable capital stock). The other measures the market value of total capital relative to the book value of total capital, which includes all components of capital, and mandatorily redeemable capital stock. The measures provide a point-in-time indication of the FHLB's liquidation or franchise value and can also serve as a measure of realized or potential market risk exposure.\nThe following table presents the market value of equity to regulatory capital stock (excluding retained earnings) for several interest rate environments.\nTable 54: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>December 31, 2021 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>December 31, 2020 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Market Value of Equity to Par Value of Regulatory Capital Stock - Base Case (Flat Rates) Scenario\n</td> <td>154 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>144 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Market Value of Equity to Par Value of Regulatory Capital Stock - Down Shock (1)\n</td> <td>154 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>143 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Market Value of Equity to Par Value of Regulatory Capital Stock - Up Shock (2)\n</td> <td>145 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>142 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\n(1) Represents a down shock of 100 basis points.\n(2) Represents an up shock of 200 basis points.\nA base case value below 100 percent could indicate that, in the remote event of an immediate liquidation scenario involving redemption of all capital stock, capital stock may be returned to stockholders at a value below par. This could be due to experiencing risks that lower the market value of capital and/or to having an insufficient amount of retained earnings. In 2021, the market capitalization ratios in the scenarios presented continued to be above our policy requirements. The base case ratio at December 31, 2021 was well above 100 percent because retained earnings were 51 percent of regulatory capital stock and we maintained stable market risk exposure.\nThe following table presents the market value of equity to the book value of total capital and mandatorily redeemable capital stock.\nTable 55: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>December 31, 2021 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>December 31, 2020 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Market Value of Equity to Book Value of Capital - Base Case (Flat Rates) Scenario (1)\n</td> <td>101 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>97 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Market Value of Equity to Book Value of Capital - Down Shock (1)(2)\n</td> <td>101 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>96 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Market Value of Equity to Book Value of Capital - Up Shock (1)(3)\n</td> <td>95 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>96 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\n(1) Capital includes total capital and mandatorily redeemable capital stock.\n(2) Represents a down shock of 100 basis points.\n(3) Represents an up shock of 200 basis points.\nA base-case value below 100 percent indicates that we have realized or could realize risks (especially market risk), such that the market value of total capital owned by stockholders is below the book value of total capital. In a scenario in which interest rates increase 200 basis points, the market value of total capital would be $189 million below the book value of total capital. This indicates that in a liquidation scenario, stockholders would not receive the full sum of their total equity ownership in the FHLB. We believe the likelihood of a liquidation scenario is extremely remote; and therefore, we accept the risk of diluting equity ownership in such a scenario.\nCredit Risk\nOverview\nWe believe our risk management practices, discussed below, minimize residual credit risk levels. We have no loan loss reserves or impairment recorded for Credit Services, investments, or derivatives. We have a minimal amount of legacy credit risk exposure in the MPP.\nCredit Services\nOverview: We have policies and practices to manage credit risk exposure from our secured lending activities, which include Advances and Letters of Credit. The objective of our credit risk management activities is to equalize risk exposure across members and counterparties to a zero level of expected losses. This approach is consistent with our conservative risk management principles and desire to have no residual credit risk related to Advances and Letters of Credit.\nCollateral: We require each member to provide a security interest in eligible collateral before it can undertake any secured borrowing. Eligible loan collateral types include the following: single- and multi-family residential, home equity, commercial real estate, government guaranteed and farm real estate. Eligible security types include those that are government or agency backed, along with highly-rated private-label residential and commercial mortgage-backed securities. We have conservative eligibility criteria within each of the above asset types. The estimated value of pledged collateral is discounted in order to offset market, credit, and liquidity risks that may affect the collateral's realizable value in the event it must be liquidated. At December 31, 2021, total collateral pledged of $425.2 billion resulted in total borrowing capacity of $346.8 billion of which $57.6 billion was used to support outstanding Advances and Letters of Credit. Borrowers often pledge collateral in excess of their collateral requirement to demonstrate access to liquidity and to have the ability to borrow additional amounts in the future. Over-collateralization by one member is not applied to another member. The collateral composition remained relatively stable compared to the end of 2020.\nThe table below shows total collateral pledged by type.\nTable 56: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>December 31, 2021 </td> <td> </td> <td>December 31, 2020 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(Dollars in billions) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Percent of Total </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Percent of Total </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Eligible Collateral </td> <td> </td> <td>Pledged Collateral </td> <td> </td> <td>Eligible Collateral </td> <td> </td> <td>Pledged Collateral </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Single-family loans </td> <td>$ </td> <td>258.8 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>61 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>226.6 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>57 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Multi-family loans </td> <td>59.5 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>14 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>60.0 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>15 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Commercial real estate loans </td> <td>50.6 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>12 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>48.0 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>12 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Bond Securities </td> <td>30.0 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>7 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>26.1 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>7 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Home equity loans/lines of credit </td> <td>22.3 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>25.2 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Government guaranteed loans\n</td> <td>3.3 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>12.4 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Farm real estate loans </td> <td>0.7 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.7 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total </td> <td>$ </td> <td>425.2 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>100 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>399.0 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>100 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table>\nAt December 31, 2021, 66 percent of collateral was related to residential mortgage lending in single-family loans and home equity loans/lines of credit.\nOur management of credit risk related to Advances and Letters of Credit includes risk-based variations in collateral requirements, including discounts or haircuts, eligibility criteria, form of valuation, custody arrangements, the level of detail in periodic reporting, and in blanket versus specific pledges, as discussed below.\n\u25aaHaircuts. We discount collateral values for purposes of determining borrowing capacity. These haircuts result in lendable values that are less than the amount of pledged collateral. In general, higher discounts are applied to more risky forms of collateral and to collateral pledged by higher risk members.\n\u25aaEligibility. The balances of loans and securities we lend against are subject to conservative eligibility criteria such that Advances and Letters of Credit are supported by high quality assets within each collateral type.\n\u25aaCustody. All pledged securities and loans pledged by higher risk members must be delivered into our custody or that of a third-party custodian that we have engaged.\n\u25aaBlanket versus Specific Pledge. Except under limited circumstances, we require a member pledging loans under a blanket agreement to pledge all of their loans for a given collateral type.\n\u25aaValuation. All members' securities collateral and individually listed loans are subject to a market valuation process to establish the borrowing base. For loan collateral, this involves submission of extensive loan level information (on \"Listings\") to facilitate the valuation process. Any member allowed to make a specific instead of a blanket pledge (non-depositories and certain highly-rated commercial banks) is required to submit this level of reporting.\nWe use third-party services and internally run models to regularly estimate market values of individually listed loan collateral. Third-party services use various proprietary models to estimate market values. Assumptions may be made on factors that affect collateral value, such as market liquidity, discount rates, prepayments, liquidation and servicing costs in the event of a default and economic and market conditions. We have policies and procedures for evaluating the reasonableness of collateral valuations.\nBorrowing Capacity/Lendable Value: Lendable Value Rates (LVRs) represent the percent of collateral value net of the haircut. LVRs are determined by statistical analysis and management assumptions relating to historical price volatility, inherent credit risks, liquidation costs, and the current credit and economic environment. We apply LVR results to the estimated values of pledged assets. LVRs vary among pledged assets and members based on the member institution type, the financial strength of the member institution, the form of valuation, lien position, the issuer of bond collateral or the quality of securitized assets, the quality of the loan collateral as reflected in the manner in which it was underwritten, and the marketability of the pledged assets.\nThe table below indicates the range of LVRs for each major collateral type pledged at December 31, 2021.\nTable 57: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Lendable Value Rates Applied to Collateral </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Blanket Status: </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Prime 1-4 family loans </td> <td>71-80% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Multi-family loans </td> <td>61-79% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Prime home equity loans/lines of credit </td> <td>50-74% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Commercial real estate loans </td> <td>61-80% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Farm real estate loans </td> <td>63-83% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Listing Status/Physical Delivery: </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cash/U.S. Government/U.S. Treasury/U.S. agency securities </td> <td>85-100% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>U.S. agency residential MBS/collateralized mortgage obligations </td> <td>86-94% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>U.S. agency commercial MBS/collateralized mortgage obligations </td> <td>78-89% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Private-label residential MBS </td> <td>61-87% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Private-label commercial MBS </td> <td>48-84% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Municipal securities </td> <td>79-92% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>SBA certificates </td> <td>85-91% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Prime 1-4 family loans </td> <td>71-86% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Multi-family loans </td> <td>64-86% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Prime home equity loans/lines of credit </td> <td>64-86% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Commercial real estate loans </td> <td>69-89% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Farm real estate loans </td> <td>64-87% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>SBA Paycheck Protection Program loans </td> <td>10-90% </td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe ranges of lendable values exclude subprime residential loan collateral. Loans pledged by lower risk members for which we require only high level, summary reporting of eligible balances are generally discounted more heavily than loans on which we have detailed loan structure and underwriting information. For any form of loan collateral, additional credit risk based adjustments may be made to an individual member's collateral that results in a lower lendable value than that indicated in the above table.\nSubprime Loan Collateral: We have policies and processes to identify subprime residential mortgage loans pledged by members. We perform collateral reviews to estimate the volume of subprime loans pledged by members in blanket status. Depending on the quality of underwriting and administration, we may subject these loans to lower LVRs.\nInternal Credit Ratings: We perform credit underwriting of our members and nonmember institutions and assign them an internal credit rating on a scale of one to seven, with a higher number representing a less favorable assessment of the institution's financial condition. These credit ratings are based on internal and third-party ratings models, credit analyses and consideration of credit ratings from independent credit rating organizations. Credit ratings are used in conjunction with other measures of credit risk in managing secured credit risk exposure.\nA less favorable credit rating can cause us to 1) decrease the institution's borrowing capacity via lower LVRs, 2) require the institution to provide an increased level of detail on pledged collateral, 3) require it to deliver collateral into our custody, 4) prompt us to more closely and/or frequently monitor the institution, and/or 5) limit the institution's exposure through borrowing restrictions (e.g., maturity restrictions on new Advances or restrictions on borrowing capacity from higher risk collateral sources).\nThe following tables show the distribution of internal credit ratings we assigned to member and nonmember institutions, which we use to help manage credit risk exposure.\nTable 58: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(Dollars in billions) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>December 31, 2021 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>December 31, 2020 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Number </td> <td> </td> <td>Collateral-Based </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Number </td> <td> </td> <td>Collateral-Based </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Credit </td> <td> </td> <td>of </td> <td> </td> <td>Borrowing </td> <td> </td> <td>Credit </td> <td> </td> <td>of </td> <td> </td> <td>Borrowing </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Rating </td> <td> </td> <td>Institutions </td> <td> </td> <td>Capacity </td> <td> </td> <td>Rating </td> <td> </td> <td>Institutions </td> <td> </td> <td>Capacity </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>1-3 </td> <td> </td> <td>470 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>322.6 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1-3 </td> <td> </td> <td>441 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>282.6 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>4 </td> <td> </td> <td>109 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>23.1 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4 </td> <td> </td> <td>141 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>31.7 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>5 </td> <td> </td> <td>29 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.9 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5 </td> <td> </td> <td>36 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1.3 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>6 </td> <td> </td> <td>12 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.2 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6 </td> <td> </td> <td>13 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.3 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>7 </td> <td> </td> <td>3 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>7 </td> <td> </td> <td>5 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total </td> <td> </td> <td>623 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>346.8 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Total </td> <td> </td> <td>636 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>315.9 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe consider institutions with credit ratings of \"1\" through \"4\" to be financially sound. At December 31, 2021, only 44 institutions (seven percent of the total) had credit ratings of \"5\" through \"7,\" a decrease of 10 institutions compared to the end of 2020. These institutions had $1.1 billion of borrowing capacity at December 31, 2021. We believe the credit rating distribution continues to show a financially sound membership base.\nMember Failures, Closures, and Receiverships: There were no member failures in 2021.\nMPP\nOverview: The residual amount of credit risk exposure to loans in the MPP is minimal, based on the following factors:\n\u25aavarious credit enhancements for conventional loans, which are designed to protect us against credit losses;\n\u25aaconservative underwriting and loan characteristics consistent with favorable expected credit performance;\n\u25aaa small overall amount of delinquencies and defaults when compared to national averages;\n\u25aacredit losses totaling less than $0.1 million in 2021 and $19.4 million since the introduction of the program in 2000, which represent an immaterial percentage of conventional loans' current unpaid principal balances at December 31, 2021 and of total purchases-to-date for the entire MPP; and\n\u25aain addition to the low program-to-date credit losses, based on financial analysis, we believe that future credit losses will not harm capital adequacy and will not significantly affect profitability except under the most extreme and unlikely credit conditions.\nPortfolio Loan Characteristics: The following table shows FICO\u00ae credit scores of homeowners at origination dates for the conventional loan portfolio.\nTable 59: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>FICO\u00ae Score (1)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>December 31, 2021 </td> <td> </td> <td>December 31, 2020 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>< 620 </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>620 to < 660 </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>660 to < 700 </td> <td> </td> <td>7 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>700 to < 740 </td> <td> </td> <td>18 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>17 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>>= 740 </td> <td> </td> <td>75 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>77 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Weighted Average </td> <td> </td> <td>763 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>765 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\n(1)Represents the FICO\u00ae score at origination.\nThe distribution of FICO\u00ae scores at origination as of December 31, 2021 were similar to those at year-end 2020. The distribution of FICO\u00ae scores at origination is one indication of the portfolio's overall favorable credit quality. At December 31, 2021, 75 percent of the portfolio had scores at an excellent level of 740 or above and 93 percent had scores above 700, which is a threshold generally considered indicative of homeowners with good credit quality.\nThe following tables show loan-to-value ratios for conventional loans based on values estimated at the origination dates and current values estimated at the noted periods. The estimated current ratios are based on original loan values, principal paydowns that have occurred since origination, and a third-party estimate of changes in historical home prices for the zip code in which each loan resides.

Loans with current loan-to-value ratios of 60 percent and below increased to 77 percent of the total portfolio at December 31, 2021, which reflected the approximately 18 percent average increase in housing prices nationwide based on the most recent data available.\nBased on the available data, we believe we have minimal exposure to loans in the MPP considered to have characteristics of subprime\u201d or alternative/nontraditional\u201d loans. Further, we do not knowingly purchase any loan that violates the terms of our Anti-Predatory Lending Policy.\nThe following table presents the geographical allocation based on the unpaid principal balance of conventional loans in the MPP.\nTable 61: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>December 31, 2021 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>December 31, 2020 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Ohio </td> <td>63 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>Ohio </td> <td>63 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Kentucky </td> <td>12 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Kentucky </td> <td>13 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Indiana </td> <td>9 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Indiana </td> <td>10 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Tennessee </td> <td>4 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Tennessee </td> <td>3 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Alabama </td> <td>1 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Michigan </td> <td>1 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>All others </td> <td>11 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>All others </td> <td>10 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total </td> <td>100 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>Total </td> <td>100 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table>\nCredit Enhancements: Conventional mortgage loans are supported against credit losses by various combinations of primary mortgage insurance (PMI), supplemental mortgage insurance (SMI) (for loans purchased before February 2011), and the Lender Risk Account (LRA). The LRA is a hold back of a portion of the initial purchase price to cover expected credit losses for a specific pool of loans. Starting after five years from the loan purchase date, we may return the hold back to PFIs if they manage credit risk to predefined acceptable levels of exposure on the loan pools they sell to us. As a result, some pools of loans may have sufficient credit enhancements to recapture all losses while other pools of loans may not. The LRA had balances of $252 million and $246 million at December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. For more information, see Note 6 of the Notes to Financial Statements.\nCredit Performance: The table below provides an analysis of conventional loans delinquent or in the process of foreclosure, along with the national average serious delinquency rate.\nTable 62: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Conventional Loan Delinquencies </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(Dollars in millions) </td> <td>December 31, 2021 </td> <td> </td> <td>December 31, 2020 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Early stage delinquencies - unpaid principal balance (1)\n</td> <td>$ </td> <td>33 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>49 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Serious delinquencies - unpaid principal balance (2)\n</td> <td>$ </td> <td>24 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>64 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Early stage delinquency rate (3)\n</td> <td>0.5 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>0.5 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Serious delinquency rate (4)\n</td> <td>0.3 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>0.7 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>National average serious delinquency rate (5)\n</td> <td>2.3 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>3.7 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table>\n(1)Includes conventional loans 30 to 89 days delinquent and not in foreclosure.\n(2)Includes conventional loans that are 90 days or more past due or where the decision of foreclosure or a similar alternative such as pursuit of deed-in-lieu has been reported.\n(3)Early stage delinquencies expressed as a percentage of the total conventional loan portfolio.\n(4)Serious delinquencies expressed as a percentage of the total conventional loan portfolio.\n(5)National average number of fixed-rate prime and subprime conventional loans that are 90 days or more past due or in the process of foreclosure is based on the most recent national delinquency data available. The December 31, 2021 rate is based on September 30, 2021 data.\nIn response to the COVID-19 pandemic, our mortgage loan servicers granted a forbearance period to borrowers who had COVID-19 related hardships such as illness, unemployment or loss of income when homeowners met certain eligibility requirements. These forbearances do not alter the underlying terms of the loans, and loans not paid timely are considered past due. As a result, serious delinquencies were elevated at December 31, 2021 and 2020. At December 31, 2021 and 2020, $8 million and $51 million of conventional loans with a serious delinquency were under a forbearance plan. Delinquencies at December 31, 2021 have decreased since year-end 2020 as fewer borrowers have requested temporary relief provisions for MPP loans.\nWe consider a high risk loan as having a current loan-to-value ratio above 100 percent. At December 31, 2021, we had no loans with a current loan-to-value ratio above 100 percent. Historically, high risk loans have experienced a minimal amount of serious delinquencies. We believe these data further support our view that the overall portfolio is comprised of high-quality, well-performing loans.\nCredit Losses: Residual credit risk exposure depends on the actual and potential credit performance of the loans in each pool compared to the pool's equity (on individual loans) and credit enhancements, including PMI, the LRA, and SMI. Our available credit enhancements at December 31, 2021 were ample and able to cover nearly all of the estimated gross credit losses. As a result, estimated credit losses at December 31, 2021 were less than $1 million. Estimated credit losses, after credit enhancements, are accounted for in the allowance for credit losses or as a charge off (i.e., a reduction to the principal of mortgage loans held for portfolio). In addition, we have assessed that we do not have any credit risk exposure to our PMI providers, and our estimation of credit exposure to SMI providers was not material at December 31, 2021 or 2020.\nSeparate from our allowance for credit losses analysis, we regularly analyze potential adverse scenarios of lifetime credit risk exposure for the loans in the MPP. Even under adverse macroeconomic scenarios, we expect credit losses to remain minimal.\nInvestments\nLiquidity Investments: We purchase liquidity investments from counterparties that have a strong ability to repay principal and interest. These investments can be easily converted to cash and may be unsecured, guaranteed or supported by the U.S. government, or secured (i.e., collateralized). For unsecured liquidity investments, we invest in the debt securities of highly rated, investment-grade institutions, have appropriate and conservative limits on dollar and maturity exposure to each institution, and have strong credit underwriting practices, including active monitoring of credit quality of our counterparties and of the environment in which they operate.\nOur unsecured liquidity investments to a counterparty or group of affiliated counterparties are limited by Finance Agency regulations to maturities of no more than nine months and limited to a dollar amount based on a percentage of eligible regulatory capital (defined as the lessor of our regulatory capital or the eligible amount of a counterparty's Tier 1 capital). The permissible percentage ranges from 1 percent to 15 percent. The permissible range is solely based on consideration of the internal credit risk ratings of unsecured counterparties as required by Finance Agency regulations.\nThe lowest long-term credit rating for a counterparty to which we are permitted to extend credit is double-B. However, we have generally invested funds only in those eligible institutions with long-term credit ratings of at least single-A. In addition, we restrict maturities, reduce dollar exposure, and avoid new investments with counterparties we deem to represent elevated credit risk. Furthermore, a portion of our total liquidity investments are with counterparties for which the investments are secured with collateral (secured resale agreements). We believe these investments present no credit risk exposure to us.\nThe following table presents the carrying value of liquidity investments outstanding in relation to the counterparties' lowest long-term credit ratings provided by Standard & Poor's, Moody's, and/or Fitch Advisory Services. For resale agreements, the ratings shown are based on ratings of the associated collateral. Our internal ratings of these investments may differ from those obtained from Standard & Poor's, Moody's, and/or Fitch Advisory Services. The historical or current ratings displayed in this table should not be taken as an indication of future ratings.\nTable 63: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>

By Finance Agency regulation, all counterparties exposed to non-U.S. countries are required to be domestic U.S. branches of foreign counterparties.\nMBS:\nGSE MBS\nAt December 31, 2021, $9.7 billion of MBS held were GSE securities issued by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, which provide credit safeguards by guaranteeing either timely or ultimate payments of principal and interest. We believe that the conservatorships of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac lower the chance that they would not be able to fulfill their credit guarantees. In addition, based on the data available to us and our purchase practices, we believe that most of the mortgage loans backing our GSE MBS are of high quality with acceptable credit performance.\nMBS Issued by Other Government Agencies\nWe also invest in MBS issued and guaranteed by Ginnie Mae. These investments totaled $1.1 billion at December 31, 2021. We believe that the strength of Ginnie Mae's guarantee and backing by the full faith and credit of the U.S. government is sufficient to protect us against credit losses on these securities.\nDerivatives\nCredit Risk Exposure: We mitigate most of the credit risk exposure resulting from derivative transactions through collateralization or use of daily settled contracts. The table below presents derivative positions to which we had credit risk exposure at December 31, 2021.\nTable 67: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(In millions) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Total Notional </td> <td> </td> <td>Net Derivatives Fair Value Before Collateral </td> <td> </td> <td>Cash Collateral Pledged to (from) Counterparties </td> <td> </td> <td>Net Credit Exposure to Counterparties </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Nonmember counterparties: </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Asset positions with credit exposure: </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Uncleared derivatives: </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>AA-rated </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>155 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>A-rated </td> <td> </td> <td>66 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total uncleared derivatives\n</td> <td> </td> <td>221 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cleared derivatives (1)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>26,552 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>160 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>161 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Liability positions with credit exposure: </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Uncleared derivatives: </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>BBB-rated </td> <td> </td> <td>208 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(13) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>13 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total uncleared derivatives </td> <td> </td> <td>208 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(13) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>13 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cleared derivatives (1)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>8,734 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>137 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>137 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total derivative positions with credit exposure to nonmember counterparties\n</td> <td> </td> <td>35,715 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(12) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>310 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>298 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Member institutions (2)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>38 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>35,753 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(12) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>310 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>298 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\n(1)Represents derivative transactions cleared with LCH Ltd. and CME Clearing, the FHLB's clearinghouses. LCH Ltd. is rated AA- by Standard & Poor's, and CME Clearing is not rated, but its parent company, CME Group Inc., is rated Aa3 by Moody's and AA- by Standard & Poor's.\n(2)Represents Mandatory Delivery Contracts.\nOur exposure to cleared derivatives is primarily associated with the requirement to post initial margin through the clearing agent to the Derivatives Clearing Organizations. We pledge cash as collateral to satisfy this initial margin requirement. However, the use of cleared derivatives mitigates credit risk exposure because a central counterparty is substituted for individual counterparties.\nAt December 31, 2021, the net exposure of uncleared derivatives with residual credit risk exposure was less than $1 million. If interest rates rise or the composition of our derivatives change resulting in an increase to our gross exposure to uncleared derivatives, the contractual collateral provisions in these derivatives would limit our net exposure to acceptable levels.\nAlthough we cannot predict if we will realize credit risk losses from any of our derivatives counterparties, we believe that all of the counterparties will be able to continue making timely interest payments and, more generally, to continue to satisfy the terms and conditions of their derivative contracts with us. As of December 31, 2021, we had $0.4 billion of notional principal of interest rate swaps with a subsidiary of our member, JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., which also had outstanding credit services with us. Due to the amount of market value collateralization, we had no outstanding credit exposure to this counterparty related to interest rate swaps outstanding.\nLiquidity Risk\nLiquidity Overview\nWe strive to be in a liquidity position at all times to meet the borrowing needs of our members and to meet all current and future financial commitments. This objective is achieved by managing liquidity positions to maintain stable, reliable, and cost-effective sources of funds while taking into account market conditions, member demand, and the maturity profile of assets and liabilities. Our liquidity position complies with the FHLBank Act, Finance Agency regulations, and internal policies.\nThe FHLBank System's primary source of funds is the sale of Consolidated Obligations in the capital markets. Our ability to obtain funds through the sale of Consolidated Obligations at acceptable interest costs depends on the financial market's perception of the riskiness of the Obligations and on prevailing conditions in the capital markets, particularly the short-term capital markets. The System's favorable debt ratings, the implicit U.S. government backing of our debt, and our effective risk management practices are instrumental in ensuring stable and satisfactory access to the capital markets.\nWe believe our liquidity position, as well as that of the System, continued to be strong during 2021. Our overall ability to effectively fund our operations through debt issuances remained sufficient. Investor demand for System debt was robust in 2021, as investors continued to prefer short-term, high-quality money market instruments. We believe the possibility of a liquidity or funding crisis in the System that would impair our ability to participate, on a cost-effective basis, in issuances of debt, service outstanding debt, maintain adequate capitalization, or pay competitive dividends is remote.\nThe System works collectively to manage and monitor the System-wide liquidity and funding risks. Liquidity risk includes the risk that the System could have difficulty rolling over short-term Obligations when market conditions change, also called refinancing risk. The System has a large reliance on short-term funding; therefore, it has a sharp focus on managing liquidity risk to very low levels. As shown on the Statements of Cash Flows, in 2021, our portion of the System's debt issuances totaled $193.5 billion for Discount Notes and $33.8 billion for Bonds. Access to short-term debt markets has been reliable because investors, driven by liquidity preferences and risk aversion, have sought the System's short-term debt, which has resulted in strong demand for debt maturing in one year or less.\nSee the Notes to Financial Statements for more detailed information regarding maturities of certain financial assets and liabilities which are instrumental in determining the amount of liquidity risk. In addition to contractual maturities, other assumptions regarding cash flows such as estimated prepayments, embedded call optionality, and scheduled amortization are considered when managing liquidity risks.\nLiquidity Management and Regulatory Requirements\nWe manage liquidity risk by ensuring compliance with our regulatory liquidity requirements and regularly monitoring other metrics.\nThe Finance Agency establishes the expectations with respect to the maintenance of sufficient liquidity without access to the capital markets for a specified number of days, which was set as a period of between 10 to 30 calendar days in the base case. Under these expectations, all Advance maturities are assumed to renew, unless the Advances relate to former members who are ineligible to borrow new Advances. The maintenance of sufficient liquidity is intended to provide additional assurance that we can continue to provide Advances and Letters of Credit to members over an extended period without access to", "item_7_text": "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nThis discussion and analysis of the FHLB's financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the Financial Statements and related Notes to Financial Statements contained in this Form 10-K.\nEXECUTIVE OVERVIEW\n \nRecent Developments\nCOVID-19 Pandemic\nThe global outbreak of COVID-19 has impacted communities and businesses worldwide, including those in the Fifth District. The effects of COVID-19 continue to evolve, and the full impact and duration of the virus are unknown. Throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, we have continued to fulfill our mission of providing robust access to a key source of readily available and competitively priced wholesale funding to member financial institutions and supporting our commitment to affordable housing and community investment. Our capital and liquidity positions remained strong, as did our overall ability to fund operations through the issuance of Consolidated Obligations at acceptable interest costs. Additionally, overall residual credit risk exposure from our Credit Services, mortgage loan portfolio, investments, and derivative transactions has remained de minimis. We continue to monitor the effects of COVID-19, including the impact of variants, and are committed to assisting members and their communities as impacts related to the pandemic continue to unfold.\nFinancial Condition\nMission Assets and Activities\nPrimary Mission Assets (i.e., principal balances of Advances and mortgage loans held for portfolio) and Supplemental Mission Activities (i.e., Letters of Credit, Mandatory Delivery Contracts and standby bond purchase agreements) are the primary means by which we fulfill our mission with direct connections to members and what we refer to as Mission Assets and Activities. We regularly monitor our concentration of Mission Assets and Activities. One measure we use to assess mission achievement is our Primary Mission Asset ratio, which measures the sum of average Advances and mortgage loans as a percentage of average Consolidated Obligations (adjusted for certain high-quality liquid assets, as permitted by regulation). In 2021, the Primary Mission Asset ratio averaged 69 percent, slightly below the Finance Agency's preferred ratio of 70 percent. In assessing overall mission achievement, we also consider supplemental sources of Mission Assets and Activities, the most significant of which is Letters of Credit issued for the benefit of members.\nThe following table summarizes our Mission Assets and Activities.\n\n(1)Amounts represent principal balances.\n(2)Amounts represent off-balance sheet commitments.\nAdvance principal balances decreased $2.1 billion (eight percent) from year-end 2020. Advance balances remained below pre-pandemic levels in 2021 due to increased liquidity in the financial markets and substantial growth in deposits at member institutions. Average principal Advance balances for 2021 decreased $19.2 billion (45 percent) compared to 2020. Advance balances in the first quarter of 2020 were significantly higher as members sought additional liquidity during the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. However, most of these Advances matured or were prepaid by the end of 2020, and the demand for Advances has remained low. Advance demand could improve as one or more of the following occur: reductions in government liquidity programs, changes in the Federal Reserve monetary policy, or a rise in interest rates.\nAdvance balances are often volatile due to members' ability to quickly, normally on the same day, increase or decrease their amount of Advances. We believe that a key benefit of membership comes from our business model as a wholesale lender GSE, which provides members flexibility in their Advance funding levels and helps support their asset-liability management needs. We act as a readily available source of funding for our members. Our business model is designed to support significant changes in asset levels without having to undergo material changes in staffing, operations, risk practices, or general resource needs. A key reason for this scalability is that our Capital Plan provides for additional capital when Advances grow and the opportunity for us to retire capital when Advances decline, thereby acting, along with our efficient level of operating expenses, to preserve competitive profitability.\nThe MPP principal balance fell $1.9 billion (21 percent) from year-end 2020. During 2021, we purchased $1.7 billion of mortgage loans, while principal reductions of $3.6 billion reflected the continuing high levels of mortgage loan refinance activity.\nLetters of Credit increased $5.8 billion (20 percent) from year-end 2020 primarily due to members using them to secure elevated levels of public unit deposits. We normally earn fees on Letters of Credit based on the actual average amount of the Letters utilized, which generally is less than the notional amount issued.\nInvestments\nThe balance of investments at December 31, 2021 was $29.4 billion, an increase of $2.4 billion from year-end 2020. At December 31, 2021, investments included $10.8 billion of MBS and $18.6 billion of other investments, which consisted primarily of highly-rated short-term instruments and longer-term U.S. Treasury and GSE obligations held for liquidity. All of our MBS held at December 31, 2021 were issued and guaranteed by Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac or a U.S. agency.\nInvestments averaged $28.1 billion in 2021, a decrease of $4.8 billion (15 percent) compared to the average in 2020. The decrease in average investments reflected lower liquidity investments needed in light of the reduced Advance demand and lower MBS given the elevated levels of prepayments throughout 2021 as a result of the low interest rate environment and inability to quickly replace those investments with suitable alternatives. However, the ending balance of MBS increased primarily due to the purchase of $3.1 billion of new MBS in the second half of 2021. Liquidity investments can vary significantly on a daily basis during times of volatility in Advance balances. We maintained a robust amount of asset liquidity throughout 2021 across a variety of liquidity measures, as discussed in the \"Liquidity Risk\" section of \"Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Risk Management.\"\nCapital\nCapital adequacy surpassed all minimum regulatory capital requirements in 2021. The GAAP and regulatory capital-to-assets ratios at December 31, 2021 were 6.26 percent and 6.28 percent, respectively. Both ratios exceeded the regulatory required minimum of four percent. Regulatory capital includes mandatorily redeemable capital stock accounted for as a liability under GAAP. GAAP and regulatory capital decreased $0.1 billion and $0.2 billion, respectively, from year-end 2020. Retained earnings totaled $1.3 billion at December 31, 2021, a decrease of one percent from year-end 2020. We believe the amount of retained earnings is sufficient to protect against members' impairment risk of their capital stock investment in the FHLB and to provide the opportunity to stabilize or increase future dividends.\nResults of Operations\nOverall Results\nOur earnings over time reflect the combination of a stable business model and conservative management of risk. Key market driven factors that can cause significant periodic volatility in our profitability are changes in the level of interest rates, changes in spreads between benchmark interest rates and our short-term funding costs, recognition of net amortization due to accelerated prepayments of mortgage assets, and fair value adjustments related to the use of derivatives and the associated hedged items. Our profitability may also be affected by our members' overall Advance demand, which is largely influenced by the monetary policies of the U.S. government and its agencies, including the Federal Reserve, and general economic conditions. The table below summarizes our results of operations.\n\n(1)Average short-term interest rates consist of 3-month LIBOR and the Federal funds effective rate.\nNet income decreased $234 million in 2021. The decline in profitability in 2021 compared to 2020 was primarily due to low interest rates and an unprecedented amount of liquidity in the financial markets due to governmental stimulus actions, which impacted the following:\n\u25aaAdvances. Average Advance balances declined 45 percent. Although Advances grew significantly during the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic as members sought additional liquidity, balances subsequently fell in 2020 and have remained below pre-pandemic levels due to increased liquidity in the financial markets and increased deposit levels at member institutions. Additionally, Advance prepayment fees declined since members prepaid fewer Advances in 2021 than in the prior year.\n\u25aaMortgage Assets. The spreads earned on mortgage assets declined due to the accelerated payoff of higher-yielding mortgages at a faster pace than the associated debt funding them. The historically low long-term interest rates led to prepayments occurring faster than the purchases of new mortgage assets, which also resulted in the average balances of mortgage assets declining 25 percent.\nAdditionally, the FHLB sold interest rate swaptions in the first quarter of 2020 in response to changes in interest rates, which resulted in net realized gains of approximately $69 million before assessments. The FHLB did not sell any interest rate swaptions in 2021. The FHLB uses swaptions to hedge market risk exposure associated with holding fixed-rate mortgage assets and may sell them to offset the risk incurred due to changes in interest rates.\nIn 2021, we accrued $5 million for the Affordable Housing Program (AHP) pool of funds, a decrease of $26 million compared to 2020 given the lower level of earnings noted above. The funds accrued in 2021 will be available to members in 2022. In addition to the required AHP assessment, we provided voluntary sponsorship of two other housing programs. These programs provided funds to cover accessibility and emergency repairs for special needs and elderly homeowners and funds for the replacement or repair of homes damaged or destroyed by natural disasters within the Fifth District.\nIn December 2021, we paid stockholders a quarterly dividend at a 2.00 percent annualized rate on their capital investment in our company, which is 1.88 percentage points above fourth quarter average short-term interest rates.\nEffect of Interest Rate Environment\nTrends in market interest rates and the resulting shapes of the market yield curves strongly influence our results of operations and profitability because of how they affect members' demand for Mission Assets and Activities, spreads on assets, funding costs and decisions in managing the tradeoffs in our market risk/return profile. The following table presents key market interest rates (obtained from Bloomberg L.P.).\n\n\n(1) Current coupon rate of Fannie Mae par MBS indications.\nThe target overnight Federal funds rate was in the range of zero to 0.25 percent at December 31, 2021, unchanged from year-end 2020. The low interest rate environment reflects the Federal Reserve's response to the COVID-19 pandemic to keep interest rates low to facilitate liquidity. In March 2022, the Federal Reserve began to respond to inflationary concerns by increasing the target overnight Federal funds rate to a range of 0.25 to 0.50 percent while indicating further expected rate hikes in 2022.\nAverage short-term rates were approximately 30 to 50 basis points lower in 2021 compared to 2020 and average mortgage rates remained low, with the 15-year rate remaining the same while the 30-year rate increased only 15 basis points during the year. The overall low interest rate environment negatively impacted income in 2021 primarily because of a decrease in earnings generated from investing capital and lower spreads earned on mortgage assets due to the accelerated payoff of higher-yielding mortgages at a faster pace than the associated debt funding them.\nDuring 2021, as in 2020, the market risk exposure to changing interest rates was moderate overall and well within policy limits. We believe that longer-term profitability would not become uncompetitive unless interest rates were to change quickly and significantly. In the short-term, profitability could become uncompetitive if long-term interest rates decrease in excess of 100 basis points leading to faster prepayments of mortgage assets, which would further accelerate the recognition of purchased premiums.\nRegulatory and Legislative Developments\nGeneral\nThe FHLBank System is subject to legislative and regulatory oversight. Legislative and regulatory actions applicable, directly or indirectly, to the FHLBank System in the last decade have increased uncertainty regarding the business model and membership base under which the FHLBanks may operate in the future. This is due primarily to the uncertainty around potential future GSE reform, and the evolution of mortgage financing moving towards financial institutions currently not\neligible for FHLBank membership. See Item 1A. Risk Factors for more discussion. We cannot predict the ultimate outcome of GSE reform and whether our membership base will be legislatively and regulatorily permitted to evolve in concert with the housing finance market.\nFHLBank Membership\nOn September 9, 2021, the Finance Agency published a Supervisory Letter on FHLBank Membership Issues covering five issues, including (1) requirements for de novo Community Development Financial Institutions, (2) automatic transfer of membership, (3) large non-member institutions merging with small member institutions, (4) membership applicant's compliance with financial condition\u201d requirements, and (5) the definition of insurance company. The Supervisory Letter expresses the Finance Agency's views on these matters, which include the articulation of certain restrictions on eligibility for membership. The restrictions could result in:\n\u25aafewer opportunities for FHLBank membership; and/or\n\u25aaineligibility for continued membership by certain entities, most notably Community Development Financial Institutions, certain types of insurance companies and large institutions that have acquired small members.\nAccordingly, the restrictions could result in reduced opportunities for us to grow our membership and, in turn, fewer opportunities to provide our financial services. We continue to evaluate the Supervisory Letter and its effect on our membership.\nRegulatory Interpretation on Eligibility of Mortgage Participations as Collateral for FHLBank Advances\nOn October 4, 2021, the Finance Agency published a Regulatory Interpretation on Eligibility of Mortgage Loan Participations as Collateral for FHLBank Advances, which became effective on December 13, 2021. The Regulatory Interpretation addresses whether an FHLBank can accept as collateral mortgage loan participations that cannot be readily liquidated in the form they are pledged. The Regulatory Interpretation concludes that mortgage loan participations must meet the requirements of Finance Agency regulation 12 CFR 1266.7(a)(4), including the requirement that the collateral can be liquidated in due course\u201d in order to be eligible to secure Advances. It further concludes that participations for which there would be a known impediment to liquidation do not meet such requirement and therefore are not eligible collateral for Advances. Finally, the Regulatory Interpretation rescinds prior guidance from FHLBank System regulators that provide mortgage loan participations may be eligible as collateral under regulatory provisions other than 12 CFR 1266.7(a)(4). Although we do not currently expect the Regulatory Interpretation to have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations, this restriction on collateral may negatively impact future borrowing by certain members.\nFair Housing and Fair Lending Enforcement\nOn July 9, 2021, the Finance Agency published a Policy Statement on Fair Lending to communicate its general position on monitoring and information gathering, supervisory examinations, and administrative enforcement related to the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, the Fair Housing Act, and the Federal Housing Enterprises Financial Safety and Soundness Act. The Policy Statement became effective on the date of publication.\nOn August 12, 2021, the Finance Agency and the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development announced they had entered into a Memorandum of Understanding regarding fair housing and fair lending enforcement. Under the Memorandum of Understanding, the two agencies will focus on enhancing their enforcement of the Fair Housing Act, and their oversight of Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and the FHLBanks.\nWe continue to monitor these actions and guidance as they evolve and to evaluate their potential impact on us.\nAffordable Housing and Community Investment\nLegislation has been introduced in the U.S. Senate and House of Representatives that, if enacted in its proposed form, would require the FHLBanks to set aside higher percentages of their annual earnings for their affordable housing and community investment programs than are currently required by law. The FHLBanks continue to actively monitor any such potential legislation and developments.\nLIBOR Transition\nWe are planning for the replacement of LIBOR and the establishment of SOFR as the recommended alternative to LIBOR. Under the July 2017 and March 2021 announcements by the United Kingdom's Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), the one-week and two-month U.S. dollar LIBOR settings ceased to be provided by any administrator and were no longer representative as of January 1, 2022. The remaining U.S. dollar LIBOR settings will either cease to be provided by any administrator or no longer be representative immediately after June 30, 2023. Although the FCA does not expect these remaining LIBOR settings\nto become unrepresentative before the cessation date, there is no assurance that any of them will continue to be published or be representative through any particular date. In addition, the Adjustable Interest Rate (LIBOR) Act was signed into law on March 15, 2022. The legislation provides a statutory fallback mechanism and safe harbor on a nationwide basis to replace LIBOR with a benchmark rate, selected by the Federal Reserve Board based on SOFR, for certain contracts that reference LIBOR and contain no or insufficient fallback provisions, including fallback rates that are in any way based on LIBOR.\nAccordingly, we have developed and implemented a LIBOR transition plan to remediate our LIBOR-linked financial instruments and contracts. As the market activity in SOFR-linked financial instruments has continued to develop, we have offered SOFR-linked Consolidated Obligations and SOFR-linked Advances on an ongoing basis. In addition, we have been using SOFR-based derivatives to manage interest-rate risk, began purchasing SOFR-linked MBS in the second quarter of 2021, and began converting certain LIBOR-based derivatives to SOFR in 2021. During 2022, we expect to continue to convert certain LIBOR-based derivatives prior to the cessation of LIBOR to an alternative reference rate, such as SOFR. Collectively, we believe these efforts have reduced our LIBOR exposure and have kept us on track for the full replacement of LIBOR.\nThe following table presents our remaining LIBOR-indexed Advances, investment securities and derivatives at December 31, 2021. At December 31, 2021, all of our variable rate Consolidated Obligations were linked to SOFR.\n\n(1)MBS are presented by contractual maturity; however, their expected maturities will likely differ from contractual maturities as borrowers may have the right to call or prepay obligations with or without call or prepayment fees.\nThe market transition away from LIBOR towards SOFR is complicated, including the possible development of term structures and credit adjustments to accommodate differences between LIBOR and SOFR and the potential introduction of other alternative reference rates. As such, we are not currently able to predict the ultimate impact of such a transition on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION\nCredit Services\nCredit Activity and Advance Composition\nThe table below shows trends in Advance balances by major programs and in the notional amount of Letters of Credit.\n\n\n(1)As a percentage of total Advances principal.\n(2)Excludes Putable Advances where the related put options have expired or where the Advance is indexed to a variable-rate. These Advances are classified based on their current terms.\n(3)Represents the amount of an off-balance sheet obligation.\nAdvance principal balances at December 31, 2021 decreased eight percent compared to year-end 2020. Advance balances have remained low since the last half of 2020 as members experienced a significant inflow of deposits on their balance sheets, while also having access to other liquidity sources as a result of certain government actions related to the COVID-19 pandemic.\nLetters of Credit are issued on behalf of members to support certain obligations of members (or member's customer) to third-party beneficiaries. Letters of Credit increased 20 percent compared to year-end 2020 primarily due to members using them to secure elevated levels of public unit deposits. Letters of Credit usually expire without being drawn upon.\nAdvance Usage\nIn addition to analyzing Advance balances by dollar trends, we monitor the degree to which members use Advances to fund their balance sheets. The following table shows the unweighted, average ratio of each member's Advance balance to its most-recently available figures for total assets.\n\nThe following table shows Advance usage of members by charter type.\n\nThe following tables present principal balances for the five members with the largest Advance borrowings.\n\nWe believe that having large financial institutions that actively use our products augments the value of membership to all members. For example, such activity improves our operating efficiency, increases our earnings and thereby contributions to housing and community investment programs. This activity may enable us to obtain more favorable funding costs, and helps us maintain competitively priced products.\nMortgage Loans Held for Portfolio (Mortgage Purchase Program, or MPP)\nMPP balances are influenced by conditions in the housing and mortgage markets, the competitiveness of prices we offer to purchase loans as well as program features, and activity from our largest sellers. Our ongoing strategy for the MPP has two components: 1) increase the number of regular sellers and participants in the program; and 2) manage purchases and balances at a prudent level relative to capital and total assets to effectively manage market and credit risks consistent with our risk appetite.\nThe table below shows principal purchases and reductions of loans in the MPP for each of the last two years. All loans acquired in 2021 were conventional loans.\n\nThe following tables show the percentage of principal balances from Participating Financial Institutions (PFIs) supplying five percent or more of total principal and the percentage of principal balances from all other PFIs. As shown below, MPP activity is concentrated amongst a few members.\n\nWe closely track the refinancing incentives of our mortgage assets (including loans in the MPP and MBS) because the option for homeowners to change their principal payments normally represents the largest portion of our market risk exposure and can affect MPP balances. MPP principal paydowns increased in 2021 to a 34 percent annual constant prepayment rate, compared to the 30 percent rate for all of 2020, driven by the historically low mortgage rates. Our purchases of new loans were much lower than the elevated level of repayments during 2021 due to balance sheet concentration considerations given our lower total assets and capital balances. Purchases of new MPP loans in 2021 continued to offer favorable returns.\nOverall, MPP yields on existing portfolio balances, net of funding and hedging costs, have declined and are expected to remain at lower levels in the short-term due to the accelerated payoff of higher-yielding mortgages at a faster pace than the associated debt funding them. Despite the lower yields on existing MPP balances, the metrics of portfolio return relative to their market and credit risks continue to indicate that the MPP has generated, and can be expected to continue to generate, a profitable long-term, risk-adjusted return.\nHousing and Community Investment\nIn 2021, we accrued $5 million of earnings for the Affordable Housing Program, which will be awarded to members in 2022. The Affordable Housing Program consists of a Competitive Program and a homeownership program called Welcome Home, which assists homebuyers with down payments and closing costs.\nIncluding funds available in 2021 from previous years, we had $25 million available for the Competitive Program in 2021, which we awarded to 51 projects through a single competitive offering. In addition, we disbursed over $10 million to 170 members on behalf of 2,054 homebuyers through the Welcome Home Program, which assists homebuyers with down payments and closing costs.\nAdditionally, in 2021, our Board committed $1.0 million to the Carol M. Peterson Housing Fund, which helped 145 homeowners, and continued its commitment to the Disaster Reconstruction Program. Both are voluntary programs beyond the 10 percent of earnings that we are required by law to set aside for the Affordable Housing Program.\nOur activities to support affordable housing and economic development also include offering Advances through the Affordable Housing Program, Community Investment Program, Economic Development Program and Zero Interest Rate Fund with below-market interest rates at or near funding costs. At the end of 2021, Advance balances under these programs totaled $198 million.\nIn 2021, approximately 34 percent of members applied for funding under our Housing and Community Investment programs.\nInvestments\nThe table below presents the ending and average balances of our investment portfolio.\n\n(1)The average balance includes the rights or obligations to cash collateral, which are included in the fair value of derivative assets or derivative liabilities on the Statements of Condition at period end.\nLiquidity investments are either short-term (primarily overnight), or longer-term investments that can be easily sold and converted to cash. Under the regulatory requirements, liquidity includes certain high-quality liquid assets, which are defined as U.S. Treasury obligations with remaining maturities of 10 years or less held as trading securities or available-for-sale securities. It is normal for liquidity investments to vary by up to several billion dollars on a daily basis. Liquidity investment levels can vary significantly based on changes in the amount of actual Advances, anticipated demand for Advances, liquidity needs, the availability of acceptable net spreads, and the number of eligible counterparties that meet our unsecured credit risk criteria. The average balance of liquidity investments for 2021 fell $2.0 billion (10 percent) from the average balance for all of 2020 due to lower liquidity investments being needed in light of the reduced Advance demand.\nOur overarching strategy for balances of MBS is to keep holdings as close as possible to the regulatory maximum. Finance Agency regulations prohibit us from purchasing MBS if our investment in these securities exceeds three times regulatory capital on the day we intend to purchase the securities. The ratio of MBS to regulatory capital was 2.84 at December 31, 2021. The MBS ratio was lower than our preference to hold it close to the 3.00 regulatory maximum primarily due to the paydowns of MBS given the low interest rate environment. In addition, regulatory limitations regarding the purchase of investments that reference LIBOR slowed the pace at which we were able to replace the prepaid MBS with suitable alternatives that provided an acceptable risk/return tradeoff. However, our purchases of MBS have increased beginning in the second half of 2021 as we purchased $3.1 billion in the last six months of the year. The majority of these purchases were variable-rate MBS linked to SOFR.\nThe balance of MBS at December 31, 2021 consisted of $9.7 billion of securities issued by Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac (of which $7.5 billion were floating-rate securities), and $1.1 billion of securities issued by Ginnie Mae (which are primarily fixed rate).\nThe table below shows principal purchases and paydowns of our MBS for each of the last two years.\n\nMBS principal paydowns in 2021 equated to a 26 percent annual constant prepayment rate, a slight decrease from the 27 percent rate experienced in 2020. The elevated prepayment rates experienced in 2021 and 2020 is a result of the historically low mortgage rate environment.\nConsolidated Obligations\nWe fund variable-rate assets with Discount Notes (a portion of which may be swapped), adjustable-rate Bonds, and swapped fixed-rate Bonds because they give us the ability to effectively match the underlying rate reset periods embedded in these assets. The balances and composition of our Consolidated Obligations tend to fluctuate with changes in the balances and composition of our assets. In addition, changes in the amount and composition of our funding may be necessary from time to time to meet the days of positive liquidity and asset/liability maturity funding gap requirements discussed in the \"Liquidity Risk\" section of \"Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Risk Management.\"\nThe table below presents the ending and average balances of our participations in Consolidated Obligations.\n\n(1)Includes unamortized premiums/discounts, fair value option valuation adjustments, hedging and other basis adjustments.\n(2)At December 31, 2021 and 2020, all unswapped adjustable-rate Bonds were indexed to SOFR.\n(3)The 11 FHLBanks have joint and several liability for the par amount of all of the Consolidated Obligations issued on their behalves. The par amount of the outstanding Consolidated Obligations for all of the FHLBanks was (in millions) $652,862 and $746,772 at December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively.\nThe average balances of Discount Notes and unswapped adjustable-rate Bonds in 2021 were significantly lower compared to the averages in 2020 due to the growth in short-term and variable-rate Advances in the first quarter of 2020 as members sought additional liquidity during the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. However, most of these Advances matured or prepaid by the end of 2020 and the demand for Advances has remained below pre-pandemic levels.\nThe ending balances of swapped Discount Notes and swapped fixed-rate Bonds at the end of 2021 were higher than year-end 2020 due to the market environment at the end of 2021 favoring swapped debt. We swap term Discount Notes and fixed-rate bonds to adjustable-rates in order to match the underlying rate reset periods to the assets the Discount Notes and Bonds are funding as well as reduce the repricing risk of Discount Notes.\nThe following table shows the allocation on December 31, 2021 of unswapped fixed-rate Bonds according to their final remaining maturity and next call date (for callable Bonds). We believe that the allocations of Bonds among these classifications provide effective mitigation of market risk exposure to both higher and lower interest rates.\n\nDeposits\nTotal deposits with us are normally a relatively minor source of low-cost funding. Total interest-bearing deposits at December 31, 2021 were $1.4 billion, an increase of $0.1 billion compared to the balance at year-end 2020.\nDerivatives Hedging Activity and Liquidity\nOur use of derivatives is discussed in the \"Effect of the Use of Derivatives on Net Interest Income\" and \"Non-Interest Income (Loss)\" sections in \"Results of Operations.\" Liquidity is discussed in the \"Liquidity Risk\" section in Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Risk Management.\u201d\nCapital Resources\nThe following tables present capital amounts and capital-to-assets ratios, on both a GAAP and regulatory basis. We consider the regulatory ratio to be a better representation of financial leverage than the GAAP ratio because, although the GAAP ratio treats mandatorily redeemable capital stock as a liability, it protects investors in our debt in the same manner as GAAP capital stock and retained earnings.\n\n\n(1) At all times, the FHLB must maintain at least a four percent minimum regulatory capital-to-assets ratio.\nThe following table presents the sources of change in regulatory capital stock balances in 2021 and 2020.\n\nOur business model is structured to be able to absorb sharp changes in assets because we can execute commensurate changes in liability and capital stock balances. For example, in 2021, we issued $1.1 billion of capital stock to members in support of short-term Advance borrowings that were subsequently repaid prior to December 31, 2021. During the same period, we repurchased $1.2 billion of capital stock in response to members' subsequent repayment of Advances.\nA portion of our capital stock is excess, meaning it is not required as a condition to being a member and is not currently capitalizing Mission Assets and Activities. Excess capital stock provides a base of capital to manage financial leverage at prudent levels, augments loss protections for bondholders, and may be used to capitalize a portion of growth in Mission Assets and Activities. At December 31, 2021, the amount of excess stock, as defined by our Capital Plan, was $426 million, an increase of $198 million from year-end 2020. The balance of excess stock may fluctuate as short-term Advance borrowings can be volatile.\nSee the \"Capital Adequacy\" section in Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Risk Management\u201d for discussion of our retained earnings.\nMembership and Stockholders\nIn 2021, we added 11 new member stockholders and lost 21 member stockholders, ending the year at 618 member stockholders. Thirteen of the 21 members lost in 2021 were attributable to intra-district merger activity.\nIn 2021, there were no material changes in the allocation of membership by state, charter type, or asset size. At the end of 2021, the composition of membership by state was Ohio with 303, Kentucky with 161, and Tennessee with 154.\nThe following table provides the number of member stockholders by charter type.\n\nThe following table provides the ownership of capital stock by charter type.\n\nCredit union members hold relatively less stock than their membership proportion because they tend to be smaller than the average member and borrow less. Insurance company members hold relatively more stock than their membership proportion because they tend to be larger than the average member and borrow more.\nThe following table provides a summary of member stockholders by asset size.\n\n(1) The December 31 membership composition reflects members' assets as of the most-recently available figures for total assets.\nMost members are smaller community financial institutions, with 69 percent having assets up to $500 million. As noted elsewhere, having larger members is important to help achieve our mission objectives, including providing valuable products and services to all members.\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe following tables and discussion provide information for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019 and a comparison of the results between 2021 and 2020. For a comparison of the results between 2020 and 2019, see Part II, Item 7. \"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\" of our 2020 Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nComponents of Earnings and Return on Equity\nThe following table is a summary income statement for the last three years. Each ROE percentage is computed by dividing income or expense for the category by the average amount of stockholders' equity for the period.\n\n(1)The ROE amounts have been computed using dollars in thousands. Accordingly, recalculations based upon the disclosed amounts in millions may produce nominally different results.\nDetails on the individual factors contributing to the level and changes in profitability are explained in the sections below.\nNet Interest Income\nThe largest component of net income is net interest income. Our principal goal in managing net interest income is to balance the trade-offs between maintaining a moderate market risk profile and ensuring profitability remains competitive. Effective risk/return management requires us to focus principally on the relationships among assets and liabilities that affect net interest income, rather than individual balance sheet and income statement accounts in isolation.\nOur ROE normally is lower than that of many other financial institutions because of the cooperative wholesale business model that results in narrow spreads earned on our assets, the moderate overall risk profile, and the strategic objective to have a positive correlation of earnings to short-term interest rates.\nComponents of Net Interest Income\nWe generate net interest income from the following two components:\n\u25aaNet interest rate spread. This component equals the balance of total earning assets multiplied by the difference between the book yield on interest-earning assets and the book cost of interest-bearing liabilities. It is composed of net (amortization)/accretion, prepayment fees on Advances, and all other earnings from interest-earning assets net of funding costs. The latter is the largest component and represents the coupon yields of interest-earning assets net of the coupon costs of interest-bearing liabilities.\n\u25aaEarnings from funding assets with capital ( earnings from capital\u201d). Because of our relatively low net interest rate spread compared to other financial institutions, we have historically derived a substantial portion of net interest income from deploying interest-free capital in interest-earning assets. We deploy much of the capital in short-term and adjustable-rate assets in order to help ensure that ROE moves in the same direction as short-term interest rates and to help control market risk exposure.\nThe following table shows selected components of net interest income. Reasons for the variance in net interest income between the 2021 and 2020 periods are discussed below.\n\n(1)Includes monthly recognition of premiums and discounts paid on purchases of mortgage assets, premiums, discounts and concessions paid on Consolidated Obligations and other hedging basis adjustments.\n(2)This component of net interest rate spread has been segregated to display its relative impact.\n(3)Net interest margin is net interest income as a percentage of average total interest-earning assets.\nNet Amortization/Accretion (generally referred to as \"amortization\"): Net amortization can become substantial and volatile with changes in interest rates. When mortgage rates decrease, premium amortization of mortgage assets generally increases, which reduces net interest income. Net amortization in 2021 and 2020 was elevated due to the historically low mortgage rates, which led to accelerated prepayments of mortgage assets. Net amortization was higher in 2020 given the considerable decline in mortgage rates that took place in the first half of 2020. Mortgage rates have remained low, but experienced a small increase in 2021.\nPrepayment Fees on Advances: Fees for members' early repayment of certain Advances, which are included in net interest income, are designed to make us economically indifferent to whether members hold Advances to maturity or repay them before maturity. Advance prepayment fees were moderate in 2021. The higher Advance prepayment fees in 2020 were caused by a higher amount of member prepayments of Advances as interest rates declined.\nOther Components of Net Interest Rate Spread: The total other components of net interest rate spread decreased $117 million in 2021 compared to 2020. The net decrease was primarily due to the factors below.\n2021 Versus 2020\n\u25aaLower average Advance balances-Unfavorable: The $19.4 billion decrease in the average balance of Advances lowered net interest income by an estimated $63 million.\n\u25aaLower spreads earned on mortgage assets-Unfavorable: Lower spreads on the mortgage assets portfolio decreased net interest income by an estimated $58 million. The lower spreads were driven by the decline in average long-term interest rates in 2020, which accelerated the payoff of higher-yielding mortgages at a faster pace than the associated debt funding them.\n\u25aaLower average balances of mortgage assets-Unfavorable: The $2.7 billion decrease in the average balance of mortgage-backed securities and the $3.1 billion decrease in the average balance of mortgage loans held for portfolio lowered net interest income by an estimated $44 million. Mortgage balances declined due to the acceleration of principal cash flows driven by historically low mortgage interest rates.\n\u25aaHigher spreads on shorter-term and floating-rate asset balances-Favorable: Higher spreads on shorter-term assets and floating-rate assets (including those that have been swapped to a floating rate) improved net interest income by an estimated $31 million as the rates on the debt funding these assets declined. However, the increase in net interest income was more than offset by lower non-interest income (loss) primarily due to an increase of $37 million in the net interest settlements being paid on related derivatives not receiving hedge accounting.\n\u25aaUnrealized gains on designated fair value hedges-Favorable: Net unrealized gains on hedged items and derivatives in qualifying fair value hedge relationships improved net interest income by $17 million.\nEarnings from Capital: Earnings from capital decreased $19 million in 2021 compared to 2020 primarily due to lower average short-term interest rates as the Federal Reserve has continued to keep rates low in response to the evolving risks to economic activity from the COVID-19 pandemic.\nAverage Balance Sheet and Rates\nThe following table provides average balances and rates for major balance sheet accounts, which determine the changes in net interest rate spreads. Interest amounts and average rates are affected by our use of derivatives and the related accounting elections we make. Interest amounts reported for Advances, MBS, Other investments and Swapped Bonds include gains (losses) on hedged items and derivatives in qualifying fair value hedge relationships.\nIn addition, the net interest settlements of interest receivables or payables associated with derivatives in a fair value hedge relationship are included in net interest income and interest rate spread. However, if the derivatives do not qualify for fair value hedge accounting, the related net interest settlements of interest receivables or payables are recorded in Non-interest income (loss)\u201d as Net gains (losses) on derivatives\u201d and therefore are excluded from the calculation of net interest rate spread. Amortization associated with some hedging-related basis adjustments is also reflected in net interest income, which affects interest rate spread.\n\n \n(1)Amounts used to calculate average rates are based on dollars in thousands. Accordingly, recalculations based upon the disclosed amounts in millions may not produce the same results.\n(2)Non-accrual loans are included in average balances used to determine average rate.\n(3)Includes certificates of deposit that are classified as available-for-sale securities.\n(4)Includes available-for-sale securities based on their amortized costs. The yield information does not give effect to changes in fair value that are reflected as a component of stockholders' equity for available-for-sale securities.\n(5)The average balance amounts include the rights or obligations to cash collateral, which are included in the fair value of derivative assets or derivative liabilities on the Statements of Condition at period end.\n(6)Net interest margin is net interest income as a percentage of average total interest-earning assets.\n \nRates and corresponding levels of interest income and expense on most of our interest-bearing assets and liabilities decreased in 2021 compared to 2020 due to the decline of short-term interest rates.\nVolume/Rate Analysis\nChanges in both average balances (volume) and interest rates influence changes in net interest income, as shown in the following table.\n\n(1)Volume changes are calculated as the change in volume multiplied by the prior year rate.\n(2)Rate changes are calculated as the change in rate multiplied by the prior year average balance.\n(3)Changes that are not identifiable as either volume-related or rate-related, but rather are equally attributable to both volume and rate changes, have been allocated to the volume and rate categories based upon the proportion of the absolute value of the volume and rate changes.\nEffect of the Use of Derivatives on Net Interest Income\nThe following table shows the impact on net interest income from the effect of derivatives and hedging activities. As noted above, gains (losses) on hedged items and derivatives in qualifying fair value hedge relationships are recorded in interest income or expense. In addition, for derivatives designated as a fair value hedge, the net interest settlements of interest receivables or payables related to such derivatives are recognized as adjustments to the interest income or expense of the designated hedged item. As such, all the effects on earnings of derivatives qualifying for fair value hedge accounting are reflected in net interest income. The effect on earnings from derivatives not receiving fair value hedge accounting is provided in the Non-Interest Income (Loss)\u201d section below.\n\nMost of our use of derivatives is to synthetically convert the fixed interest rates on certain Advances, investments and Consolidated Obligations to adjustable rates tied to an eligible benchmark rate (e.g., LIBOR, the Federal funds effective rate, or SOFR). The larger negative effect of derivatives on net interest income in 2021 was primarily due to lower short-term benchmark interest rates, which resulted in higher net interest settlements being paid on certain Advances and investments where the fixed interest rates were converted to adjustable-coupon rates. The fluctuation in earnings from the use of derivatives was acceptable because it enabled us to lower market risk exposure by matching actual cash flows between assets and liabilities more closely and efficiently than would otherwise occur.\nNon-Interest Income (Loss)\nNon-interest income (loss) consists of certain realized and unrealized gains (losses) on investment securities, derivatives activities, financial instruments held under the fair value option, and other non-interest earning activities. The following tables present the net effect of derivatives and hedging activities on non-interest income (loss). The effects of derivatives and hedging activities on non-interest income (loss) relate only to derivatives not qualifying for fair value hedge accounting.\n\n\n(1)Balance sheet includes synthetic basis swaps and swaptions, which are not designated as hedging a specific financial instrument.\n(2)Includes only those gains (losses) on trading securities that have an assigned economic derivative; therefore, this line item may not agree to the Statement of Income.\n(3)Includes only those gains or losses on financial instruments held at fair value that have an economic derivative \"assigned.\"\n \nThe net effect of derivatives and hedging activities was more unfavorable in 2021 compared to 2020. Non-interest income in 2020 benefited from the sale of interest rate swaptions as interest rates fell to historically low levels during the first quarter of 2020. The sales of swaptions in the first quarter of 2020 resulted in net realized gains of approximately $69 million before assessments. We did not sell any interest rate swaptions in 2021. We use swaptions to hedge market risk exposure associated with fixed-rate mortgage assets and may sell swaptions as interest rates change in order to offset actual and anticipated risks associated with holding fixed-rate mortgage assets. Additionally, the negative impact in 2021 was largely a result of less net interest settlements being received on swapped Discount Notes and Bonds and the unrealized gains on derivatives and instruments held at fair value recognized in 2020, which were not experienced in 2021.\nIn the table above, \"Gains (losses) on trading securities\" consist of fixed-rate U.S. Treasury and GSE obligations that have been swapped to a variable rate. Trading securities are recorded at fair value, with changes in fair value reported in non-interest income (loss). There are a number of factors that affect the fair value of these securities, including changes in interest rates, the passage of time, and volatility. By hedging these trading securities, the gains or losses on these trading securities will generally be offset by the gains or losses on the associated interest rate swaps.\nNon-Interest Expense\nThe following table presents non-interest expense for each of the last three years.\n\nOur business is designed to support significant changes in asset levels without having to undergo material changes in staffing, operations, risk practices, or general resource needs. Accordingly, total non-interest expenses remained stable with only minimal increases over the past several years.\nAnalysis of Quarterly ROE\nThe following table summarizes the components of 2021's quarterly ROE and provides quarterly ROE for 2020 and 2019.\n\nThe decline in profitability in 2021 compared to 2020 was in part due to low interest rates and an unprecedented amount of liquidity in the financial markets due to governmental stimulus actions, which resulted in, among other things, lower average balances of Advances and mortgage assets and lower spreads earned on mortgage assets. In the second quarter of 2021, ROE was comparatively lower than other quarters due to unrealized losses on derivatives and hedging activities and instruments held at fair value.\nSegment Information\nNote 14 of the Notes to Financial Statements presents information on our two operating business segments. We manage financial operations and market risk exposure primarily at the macro level, and within the context of the entire balance sheet, rather than exclusively at the level of individual segments. Under this approach, the market risk/return profile of each segment may not match, or possibly even have the same trends as, what would occur if we managed each segment on a stand-alone basis. The tables below summarize each segment's operating results for the periods shown.\n \n \n\n(1)Amounts used to calculate returns are based on numbers in thousands. Accordingly, recalculations based upon the disclosed amounts in millions may not produce the same results.\nTraditional Member Finance Segment\nNet income decreased in 2021 compared to 2020 primarily due to the decline in average Advance and MBS balances, lower spreads on MBS, lower Advance prepayment fees, and net unrealized losses on derivatives and hedging activities and instruments held at fair value.\nMPP Segment\nDue to the low interest rate environment, the MPP segment experienced a net loss in 2021. The net loss was due to lower average MPP balances, elevated net amortization, and lower portfolio spreads earned on MPP driven by the accelerated payoff of higher-yielding mortgages at a faster pace than the associated debt funding them. Net income in 2020 significantly benefited from gains due to the sale of interest rate swaptions as rates fell to historically low levels in the first quarter of 2020. We did not sell any swaptions in 2021.\nQUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT RISK MANAGEMENT\nOverview\nWe face various risks that could affect the ability to achieve our mission and corporate objectives. We generally categorize risks as: 1) business/strategic risk, 2) regulatory/legal risk, 3) market risk (also referred to as interest rate or prepayment risk), 4) credit risk, 5) funding/liquidity risk, and 6) operational risk. Our Board of Directors establishes objectives regarding risk philosophy, risk appetite, risk tolerances, and financial performance expectations. Market, capital adequacy, credit, liquidity, concentration, and operational risks are discussed below. Other risks are discussed throughout this report.\nWe strive to maintain a risk profile that ensures we operate safely and soundly, promotes prudent growth in Mission Assets and Activities, consistently generates competitive earnings, and protects the par value of members' capital stock investment. We believe our business is financially sound and adequately capitalized on a risk-adjusted basis.\nWe practice this conservative risk philosophy in many ways:\n\u25aaWe operate with moderate market risk and limited residual credit risk, liquidity risk, operational risk, and capital impairment risk.\n\u25aaWe have a business objective to ensure competitive and relatively stable profitability.\n\u25aaWe make conservative investment choices in terms of the types of investments we purchase and counterparties with which we engage.\n\u25aaWe use derivatives to hedge assets and liabilities and to help reduce market risk exposure.\n\u25aaWe maintain a prudent amount of financial leverage.\n\u25aaWe are judicious in instituting regular, district-wide repurchases of excess stock.\n\u25aaWe hold an amount of retained earnings that we believe will protect the par value of capital stock and provide for dividend stabilization.\n\u25aaWe create a working and operating environment that emphasizes a stable employee base.\nWe have numerous Board-adopted policies and processes that address risk management including risk appetite, tolerances, limits, guidelines, and regulatory compliance. Our cooperative business model, corporate objectives, capital structure, and regulatory oversight provide us clear incentives to minimize risk exposures. Our policies and operating practices are designed to limit risk exposures from ongoing operations in the following broad ways:\n\u25aaby anticipating potential business risks and developing appropriate responses;\n\u25aaby defining permissible lines of business;\n\u25aaby limiting the kinds of assets we are permitted to hold in terms of their credit risk exposure and the kinds of hedging and financing arrangements we are permitted to use;\n\u25aaby limiting the amount of market risk to which we are permitted to be exposed;\n\u25aaby specifying very conservative tolerances for credit risk posed by Advances;\n\u25aaby specifying capital adequacy minimums; and\n\u25aaby requiring strict adherence to internal controls and operating procedures, adequate insurance coverage, and comprehensive Human Resources policies, procedures, and strategies.\nMarket Risk\nOverview\nMarket risk exposure is the risk that profitability and the value of stockholders' capital investment may decrease and that profitability may become uncompetitive for an extended period as a result of changes and volatility in the market environment and economy. Along with business/strategic risk, market risk is normally our largest residual risk.\nOur risk appetite is to maintain market risk exposure in a low to moderate range while earning a competitive return on members' capital stock investment. There is normally a tradeoff between long-term market risk exposure and shorter-term exposure. Effective management of each component is important in order to attract and retain members and capital and to support Mission Assets and Activities.\nThe primary challenges in managing market risk exposure arise from 1) the tradeoff between earning a competitive return and correlating profitability with short-term interest rates and 2) the market risk exposure of owning mortgage assets. Mortgage assets grant homeowners prepayment options that could adversely affect our financial performance when interest rates increase or decrease. We mitigate the market risk of mortgage assets primarily by funding them principally with a portfolio of long-term fixed-rate callable and non-callable Bonds. Secondarily, we use swaption derivative transactions to a limited extent to mitigate the market risk of mortgage assets. The Bonds and swaptions can provide expected cash flows that are similar to the cash flows expected from mortgage assets under a wide range of interest rate and prepayment environments. Because it is normally cost-prohibitive to completely mitigate mortgage prepayment risk, a residual amount of market risk remains after funding and hedging activities.\nWe analyze market risk using numerous analytical measures under a variety of interest rate and business scenarios, including stressed scenarios, and perform sensitivity analyses on the many variables that can affect market risk, using several market risk models from third-party software companies. These models employ rigorous valuation techniques for the optionality that exists in mortgage prepayments, call and put options, and caps/floors. We regularly assess the effects of different assumptions, techniques and methodologies on the measurements of market risk exposure, including comparisons to alternative models and information from brokers/dealers.\nPolicy Limits on Market Risk Exposure\nWe have six sets of policy limits regarding market risk exposure, which primarily measure long-term market risk exposure. We determine compliance with our policy limits at every month end or more frequently if market or business conditions change significantly or are volatile.\n\u25aaMarket Value of Equity Sensitivity. The market value of equity for the entire balance sheet in two hypothetical interest rate scenarios (up 200 basis points and down 100 to 200 basis points from the current interest rate environment) must be between positive and negative 10 percent of the current balance sheet's market value of equity. The interest rate movements are shocks,\u201d defined as instantaneous, permanent, and parallel changes in interest rates in which every point on the yield curve is changed by the same amount. The size of the down shock varies with the level of long-term interest rates observed when measuring the risk.\n\u25aaDuration of Equity. The duration of equity for the entire balance sheet in the current ( base case\u201d) interest rate environment must be between positive and negative five years and in the two interest rate shock scenarios (up 200 basis points and down 100 to 200 basis points from the current interest rate environment) must be between positive and negative six years.\n\u25aaMortgage Assets Portfolio. The change in net market value of the mortgage assets portfolio as a percentage of the book value of portfolio assets must be between positive and negative three percent in each of the two interest rate shock scenarios. Net market value is defined as the market value of assets minus the market value of liabilities, with no assumed capital allocation.\n\u25aaMarket Capitalization. The market capitalization ratio (defined as the ratio of the market value of equity to the par value of regulatory stock) must be above 100 percent in the current rate environment and must be above 95 percent in each of the two interest rate shock scenarios.\n\u25aaFixed Rate Mortgage Assets as a Multiple of Regulatory Capital. The amount of fixed mortgage assets must be less than five times the amount of regulatory capital.\n\u25aaMPP Assets as a Multiple of Regulatory Capital. The amount of MPP assets must be less than four times the amount of regulatory capital.\nIn addition, Finance Agency regulations and an internal policy provide controls on market risk exposure by restricting the types of mortgage loans, mortgage-backed securities and other investments we can hold. We also manage market risk exposure by charging members prepayment fees on many Advance programs where an early termination of an Advance would result in an economic loss to us.\nIn practice we carry a substantially smaller amount of market risk exposure by establishing a strategic management range that is well within policy limits.\nMarket Value of Equity and Duration of Equity - Entire Balance Sheet\nTwo key measures of long-term market risk exposure are the sensitivities of the market value of equity and the duration of equity to changes in interest rates and other variables, as presented in the following tables for various instantaneous and permanent interest rate shocks (in basis points). We compiled average results using data for each month end. Given the current level of rates, some down rate shocks are nonparallel scenarios, with short-term rates decreasing less than long-term rates such that no rate falls below zero.\nMarket Value of Equity\n\nDuration of Equity\n\nThe overall market risk exposure to changing interest rates was well within policy limits during the periods presented. At December 31, 2021, market risk exposure to rising and falling rate shocks shifted modestly driven by significant changes in the overall composition of the mortgage loans portfolio. Changes in the composition of the mortgage loans portfolio tends to happen more rapidly during a period of a decline in interest rates and subsequent elevated mortgage repayments. In addition to the noted changes in balance sheet composition, the increased exposure to rising rate shocks was impacted by the rise in long-term interest rates that occurred in 2021. Exposure to falling interest rates in the down shock scenarios continues to be muted as some rates become floored at near zero rate levels. The duration of equity, which provides an estimate of the change in market value of equity to further changes in interest rates, increased modestly due to the factors noted above, but remained well within policy limits.\nBased on the totality of our risk analysis, we expect that profitability, defined as the level of ROE compared with short-term market rates, will be competitive over the long term unless interest rates increase by large amounts in a short period of time.\nDeclines in long-term interest rates could materially decrease income temporarily before reverting to average levels. This temporary reduction in income would be driven by additional recognition of mortgage asset premiums as the further incentive for borrowers to refinance results in faster than anticipated repayments of those mortgage assets.\nMarket Risk Exposure of the Mortgage Assets Portfolio\nThe mortgage assets portfolio normally accounts for almost all market risk exposure because of prepayment volatility that we cannot completely hedge while maintaining sufficient net spreads. Sensitivities of the market value of equity allocated to the mortgage assets portfolio under interest rate shocks (in basis points) are shown below. The average mortgage assets portfolio had an assumed capital allocation of $1.1 billion in 2021 based on the entire balance sheet's average regulatory capital-to-assets ratio. Average results shown in the table below are compiled using data for each month end. The market value sensitivities are one measure we use to analyze the portfolio's estimated market risk exposure.\n% Change in Market Value of Equity-Mortgage Assets Portfolio\n\nThe average risk exposure of the mortgage assets portfolio in 2021 remained aligned with our preference to keep our exposure to market risk at a low to moderate level. The variances between periods primarily reflect the impact of slightly higher long-term interest rates observed in 2021 combined with the shift in composition of the mortgage asset portfolio, which was accelerated by rapid repayments of mortgage assets throughout 2021. We believe the mortgage asset portfolio will continue to provide an acceptable risk adjusted return consistent with our risk appetite philosophy.\nUse of Derivatives in Market Risk Management\nA key component of hedging market risk exposure is the use of derivative transactions. The following table presents the notional amounts of the derivatives classified by how we designate the hedging relationship. The notional amount of derivatives at December 31, 2021 increased by $13.2 billion from the end of 2020, primarily due to our heightened use of swapped Discount Notes and swapped fixed-rate Bonds in the current market environment.\n\nSee Note 7 of the Notes to Financial Statements for additional information on how we use derivatives and the types of assets and liabilities hedged with derivatives.\nCapital Adequacy\nRetained Earnings\nWe must hold sufficient capital to protect against exposure to various risks, including market, credit, and operational. We regularly conduct a variety of measurements and assessments for capital adequacy. At December 31, 2021, our capital management policy set forth approximately $270 million as the minimum amount of retained earnings we believe is necessary to mitigate impairment risk.\nThe following table presents retained earnings.\n\n(1) Pursuant to the FHLBank System's Joint Capital Enhancement Agreement we are not permitted to distribute as dividends.\nAs indicated in the table above, our current balance of retained earnings exceeds the policy minimum, which we expect will continue to be the case as we bolster capital adequacy over time by allocating a portion of earnings to the restricted retained earnings account.\nRisk-Based Capital\nThe following table shows the amount of risk-based capital required based on Finance Agency prescribed measurements. By\nregulation, we are required to hold permanent capital at least equal to the amount of risk-based capital.\n\nThe risk-based capital requirement has historically not been a constraint on operations, and we do not use it to actively manage\nany of our risks. It has normally ranged from 10 to 25 percent of permanent capital.\nMarket Capitalization Ratios\nWe measure two sets of market capitalization ratios. One measures the market value of equity (i.e., total capital) relative to the par value of regulatory capital stock (which is GAAP capital stock and mandatorily redeemable capital stock). The other measures the market value of total capital relative to the book value of total capital, which includes all components of capital, and mandatorily redeemable capital stock. The measures provide a point-in-time indication of the FHLB's liquidation or franchise value and can also serve as a measure of realized or potential market risk exposure.\nThe following table presents the market value of equity to regulatory capital stock (excluding retained earnings) for several interest rate environments.\n\n(1) Represents a down shock of 100 basis points.\n(2) Represents an up shock of 200 basis points.\nA base case value below 100 percent could indicate that, in the remote event of an immediate liquidation scenario involving redemption of all capital stock, capital stock may be returned to stockholders at a value below par. This could be due to experiencing risks that lower the market value of capital and/or to having an insufficient amount of retained earnings. In 2021, the market capitalization ratios in the scenarios presented continued to be above our policy requirements. The base case ratio at December 31, 2021 was well above 100 percent because retained earnings were 51 percent of regulatory capital stock and we maintained stable market risk exposure.\nThe following table presents the market value of equity to the book value of total capital and mandatorily redeemable capital stock.\n\n(1) Capital includes total capital and mandatorily redeemable capital stock.\n(2) Represents a down shock of 100 basis points.\n(3) Represents an up shock of 200 basis points.\nA base-case value below 100 percent indicates that we have realized or could realize risks (especially market risk), such that the market value of total capital owned by stockholders is below the book value of total capital. In a scenario in which interest rates increase 200 basis points, the market value of total capital would be $189 million below the book value of total capital. This indicates that in a liquidation scenario, stockholders would not receive the full sum of their total equity ownership in the FHLB. We believe the likelihood of a liquidation scenario is extremely remote; and therefore, we accept the risk of diluting equity ownership in such a scenario.\nCredit Risk\nOverview\nWe believe our risk management practices, discussed below, minimize residual credit risk levels. We have no loan loss reserves or impairment recorded for Credit Services, investments, or derivatives. We have a minimal amount of legacy credit risk exposure in the MPP.\nCredit Services\nOverview: We have policies and practices to manage credit risk exposure from our secured lending activities, which include Advances and Letters of Credit. The objective of our credit risk management activities is to equalize risk exposure across members and counterparties to a zero level of expected losses. This approach is consistent with our conservative risk management principles and desire to have no residual credit risk related to Advances and Letters of Credit.\nCollateral: We require each member to provide a security interest in eligible collateral before it can undertake any secured borrowing. Eligible loan collateral types include the following: single- and multi-family residential, home equity, commercial real estate, government guaranteed and farm real estate. Eligible security types include those that are government or agency backed, along with highly-rated private-label residential and commercial mortgage-backed securities. We have conservative eligibility criteria within each of the above asset types. The estimated value of pledged collateral is discounted in order to offset market, credit, and liquidity risks that may affect the collateral's realizable value in the event it must be liquidated. At December 31, 2021, total collateral pledged of $425.2 billion resulted in total borrowing capacity of $346.8 billion of which $57.6 billion was used to support outstanding Advances and Letters of Credit. Borrowers often pledge collateral in excess of their collateral requirement to demonstrate access to liquidity and to have the ability to borrow additional amounts in the future. Over-collateralization by one member is not applied to another member. The collateral composition remained relatively stable compared to the end of 2020.\nThe table below shows total collateral pledged by type.\n\nAt December 31, 2021, 66 percent of collateral was related to residential mortgage lending in single-family loans and home equity loans/lines of credit.\nOur management of credit risk related to Advances and Letters of Credit includes risk-based variations in collateral requirements, including discounts or haircuts, eligibility criteria, form of valuation, custody arrangements, the level of detail in periodic reporting, and in blanket versus specific pledges, as discussed below.\n\u25aaHaircuts. We discount collateral values for purposes of determining borrowing capacity. These haircuts result in lendable values that are less than the amount of pledged collateral. In general, higher discounts are applied to more risky forms of collateral and to collateral pledged by higher risk members.\n\u25aaEligibility. The balances of loans and securities we lend against are subject to conservative eligibility criteria such that Advances and Letters of Credit are supported by high quality assets within each collateral type.\n\u25aaCustody. All pledged securities and loans pledged by higher risk members must be delivered into our custody or that of a third-party custodian that we have engaged.\n\u25aaBlanket versus Specific Pledge. Except under limited circumstances, we require a member pledging loans under a blanket agreement to pledge all of their loans for a given collateral type.\n\u25aaValuation. All members' securities collateral and individually listed loans are subject to a market valuation process to establish the borrowing base. For loan collateral, this involves submission of extensive loan level information (on \"Listings\") to facilitate the valuation process. Any member allowed to make a specific instead of a blanket pledge (non-depositories and certain highly-rated commercial banks) is required to submit this level of reporting.\nWe use third-party services and internally run models to regularly estimate market values of individually listed loan collateral. Third-party services use various proprietary models to estimate market values. Assumptions may be made on factors that affect collateral value, such as market liquidity, discount rates, prepayments, liquidation and servicing costs in the event of a default and economic and market conditions. We have policies and procedures for evaluating the reasonableness of collateral valuations.\nBorrowing Capacity/Lendable Value: Lendable Value Rates (LVRs) represent the percent of collateral value net of the haircut. LVRs are determined by statistical analysis and management assumptions relating to historical price volatility, inherent credit risks, liquidation costs, and the current credit and economic environment. We apply LVR results to the estimated values of pledged assets. LVRs vary among pledged assets and members based on the member institution type, the financial strength of the member institution, the form of valuation, lien position, the issuer of bond collateral or the quality of securitized assets, the quality of the loan collateral as reflected in the manner in which it was underwritten, and the marketability of the pledged assets.\nThe table below indicates the range of LVRs for each major collateral type pledged at December 31, 2021.\n\nThe ranges of lendable values exclude subprime residential loan collateral. Loans pledged by lower risk members for which we require only high level, summary reporting of eligible balances are generally discounted more heavily than loans on which we have detailed loan structure and underwriting information. For any form of loan collateral, additional credit risk based adjustments may be made to an individual member's collateral that results in a lower lendable value than that indicated in the above table.\nSubprime Loan Collateral: We have policies and processes to identify subprime residential mortgage loans pledged by members. We perform collateral reviews to estimate the volume of subprime loans pledged by members in blanket status. Depending on the quality of underwriting and administration, we may subject these loans to lower LVRs.\nInternal Credit Ratings: We perform credit underwriting of our members and nonmember institutions and assign them an internal credit rating on a scale of one to seven, with a higher number representing a less favorable assessment of the institution's financial condition. These credit ratings are based on internal and third-party ratings models, credit analyses and consideration of credit ratings from independent credit rating organizations. Credit ratings are used in conjunction with other measures of credit risk in managing secured credit risk exposure.\nA less favorable credit rating can cause us to 1) decrease the institution's borrowing capacity via lower LVRs, 2) require the institution to provide an increased level of detail on pledged collateral, 3) require it to deliver collateral into our custody, 4) prompt us to more closely and/or frequently monitor the institution, and/or 5) limit the institution's exposure through borrowing restrictions (e.g., maturity restrictions on new Advances or restrictions on borrowing capacity from higher risk collateral sources).\nThe following tables show the distribution of internal credit ratings we assigned to member and nonmember institutions, which we use to help manage credit risk exposure.\n\nWe consider institutions with credit ratings of \"1\" through \"4\" to be financially sound. At December 31, 2021, only 44 institutions (seven percent of the total) had credit ratings of \"5\" through \"7,\" a decrease of 10 institutions compared to the end of 2020. These institutions had $1.1 billion of borrowing capacity at December 31, 2021. We believe the credit rating distribution continues to show a financially sound membership base.\nMember Failures, Closures, and Receiverships: There were no member failures in 2021.\nMPP\nOverview: The residual amount of credit risk exposure to loans in the MPP is minimal, based on the following factors:\n\u25aavarious credit enhancements for conventional loans, which are designed to protect us against credit losses;\n\u25aaconservative underwriting and loan characteristics consistent with favorable expected credit performance;\n\u25aaa small overall amount of delinquencies and defaults when compared to national averages;\n\u25aacredit losses totaling less than $0.1 million in 2021 and $19.4 million since the introduction of the program in 2000, which represent an immaterial percentage of conventional loans' current unpaid principal balances at December 31, 2021 and of total purchases-to-date for the entire MPP; and\n\u25aain addition to the low program-to-date credit losses, based on financial analysis, we believe that future credit losses will not harm capital adequacy and will not significantly affect profitability except under the most extreme and unlikely credit conditions.\nPortfolio Loan Characteristics: The following table shows FICO\u00ae credit scores of homeowners at origination dates for the conventional loan portfolio.\n\n(1)Represents the FICO\u00ae score at origination.\nThe distribution of FICO\u00ae scores at origination as of December 31, 2021 were similar to those at year-end 2020. The distribution of FICO\u00ae scores at origination is one indication of the portfolio's overall favorable credit quality. At December 31, 2021, 75 percent of the portfolio had scores at an excellent level of 740 or above and 93 percent had scores above 700, which is a threshold generally considered indicative of homeowners with good credit quality.\nThe following tables show loan-to-value ratios for conventional loans based on values estimated at the origination dates and current values estimated at the noted periods. The estimated current ratios are based on original loan values, principal paydowns that have occurred since origination, and a third-party estimate of changes in historical home prices for the zip code in which each loan resides. Both measures are weighted by current unpaid principal.\n\nThe levels of loan-to-value ratios are consistent with the portfolio's excellent credit quality. Loans with current loan-to-value ratios of 60 percent and below increased to 77 percent of the total portfolio at December 31, 2021, which reflected the approximately 18 percent average increase in housing prices nationwide based on the most recent data available.\nBased on the available data, we believe we have minimal exposure to loans in the MPP considered to have characteristics of subprime\u201d or alternative/nontraditional\u201d loans. Further, we do not knowingly purchase any loan that violates the terms of our Anti-Predatory Lending Policy.\nThe following table presents the geographical allocation based on the unpaid principal balance of conventional loans in the MPP.\n\nCredit Enhancements: Conventional mortgage loans are supported against credit losses by various combinations of primary mortgage insurance (PMI), supplemental mortgage insurance (SMI) (for loans purchased before February 2011), and the Lender Risk Account (LRA). The LRA is a hold back of a portion of the initial purchase price to cover expected credit losses for a specific pool of loans. Starting after five years from the loan purchase date, we may return the hold back to PFIs if they manage credit risk to predefined acceptable levels of exposure on the loan pools they sell to us. As a result, some pools of loans may have sufficient credit enhancements to recapture all losses while other pools of loans may not. The LRA had balances of $252 million and $246 million at December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. For more information, see Note 6 of the Notes to Financial Statements.\nCredit Performance: The table below provides an analysis of conventional loans delinquent or in the process of foreclosure, along with the national average serious delinquency rate.\n\n(1)Includes conventional loans 30 to 89 days delinquent and not in foreclosure.\n(2)Includes conventional loans that are 90 days or more past due or where the decision of foreclosure or a similar alternative such as pursuit of deed-in-lieu has been reported.\n(3)Early stage delinquencies expressed as a percentage of the total conventional loan portfolio.\n(4)Serious delinquencies expressed as a percentage of the total conventional loan portfolio.\n(5)National average number of fixed-rate prime and subprime conventional loans that are 90 days or more past due or in the process of foreclosure is based on the most recent national delinquency data available. The December 31, 2021 rate is based on September 30, 2021 data.\nIn response to the COVID-19 pandemic, our mortgage loan servicers granted a forbearance period to borrowers who had COVID-19 related hardships such as illness, unemployment or loss of income when homeowners met certain eligibility requirements. These forbearances do not alter the underlying terms of the loans, and loans not paid timely are considered past due. As a result, serious delinquencies were elevated at December 31, 2021 and 2020. At December 31, 2021 and 2020, $8 million and $51 million of conventional loans with a serious delinquency were under a forbearance plan. Delinquencies at December 31, 2021 have decreased since year-end 2020 as fewer borrowers have requested temporary relief provisions for MPP loans.\nWe consider a high risk loan as having a current loan-to-value ratio above 100 percent. At December 31, 2021, we had no loans with a current loan-to-value ratio above 100 percent. Historically, high risk loans have experienced a minimal amount of serious delinquencies. We believe these data further support our view that the overall portfolio is comprised of high-quality, well-performing loans.\nCredit Losses: Residual credit risk exposure depends on the actual and potential credit performance of the loans in each pool compared to the pool's equity (on individual loans) and credit enhancements, including PMI, the LRA, and SMI. Our available credit enhancements at December 31, 2021 were ample and able to cover nearly all of the estimated gross credit losses. As a result, estimated credit losses at December 31, 2021 were less than $1 million. Estimated credit losses, after credit enhancements, are accounted for in the allowance for credit losses or as a charge off (i.e., a reduction to the principal of mortgage loans held for portfolio). In addition, we have assessed that we do not have any credit risk exposure to our PMI providers, and our estimation of credit exposure to SMI providers was not material at December 31, 2021 or 2020.\nSeparate from our allowance for credit losses analysis, we regularly analyze potential adverse scenarios of lifetime credit risk exposure for the loans in the MPP. Even under adverse macroeconomic scenarios, we expect credit losses to remain minimal.\nInvestments\nLiquidity Investments: We purchase liquidity investments from counterparties that have a strong ability to repay principal and interest. These investments can be easily converted to cash and may be unsecured, guaranteed or supported by the U.S. government, or secured (i.e., collateralized). For unsecured liquidity investments, we invest in the debt securities of highly rated, investment-grade institutions, have appropriate and conservative limits on dollar and maturity exposure to each institution, and have strong credit underwriting practices, including active monitoring of credit quality of our counterparties and of the environment in which they operate.\nOur unsecured liquidity investments to a counterparty or group of affiliated counterparties are limited by Finance Agency regulations to maturities of no more than nine months and limited to a dollar amount based on a percentage of eligible regulatory capital (defined as the lessor of our regulatory capital or the eligible amount of a counterparty's Tier 1 capital). The permissible percentage ranges from 1 percent to 15 percent. The permissible range is solely based on consideration of the internal credit risk ratings of unsecured counterparties as required by Finance Agency regulations.\nThe lowest long-term credit rating for a counterparty to which we are permitted to extend credit is double-B. However, we have generally invested funds only in those eligible institutions with long-term credit ratings of at least single-A. In addition, we restrict maturities, reduce dollar exposure, and avoid new investments with counterparties we deem to represent elevated credit risk. Furthermore, a portion of our total liquidity investments are with counterparties for which the investments are secured with collateral (secured resale agreements). We believe these investments present no credit risk exposure to us.\nThe following table presents the carrying value of liquidity investments outstanding in relation to the counterparties' lowest long-term credit ratings provided by Standard & Poor's, Moody's, and/or Fitch Advisory Services. For resale agreements, the ratings shown are based on ratings of the associated collateral. Our internal ratings of these investments may differ from those obtained from Standard & Poor's, Moody's, and/or Fitch Advisory Services. The historical or current ratings displayed in this table should not be taken as an indication of future ratings.\n\n\nLiquidity investments were lower at December 31, 2020 due to holding more of our liquidity portfolio as deposits at the Federal Reserve in anticipation of volatile market conditions.\nThe following table presents the lowest long-term credit ratings provided by Standard & Poor's, Moody's, and/or Fitch Advisory Services of our unsecured investment credit exposure by the domicile of the counterparty or the domicile of the counterparty's immediate parent for U.S. branches and agency offices of foreign commercial banks. Our internal ratings of these investments may differ from those obtained from Standard & Poor's, Moody's, and/or Fitch Advisory Services. The historical or current ratings displayed in this table should not be taken as an indication of future ratings.\n\nThe following table presents the remaining contractual maturity of our unsecured investment credit exposure by the domicile of the counterparty or the domicile of the counterparty's immediate parent for U.S. branches and agency offices of foreign commercial banks.\n\nWe restrict a significant portion of unsecured lending to overnight maturities, which further limits risk exposure to these counterparties. By Finance Agency regulation, all counterparties exposed to non-U.S. countries are required to be domestic U.S. branches of foreign counterparties.\nMBS:\nGSE MBS\nAt December 31, 2021, $9.7 billion of MBS held were GSE securities issued by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, which provide credit safeguards by guaranteeing either timely or ultimate payments of principal and interest. We believe that the conservatorships of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac lower the chance that they would not be able to fulfill their credit guarantees. In addition, based on the data available to us and our purchase practices, we believe that most of the mortgage loans backing our GSE MBS are of high quality with acceptable credit performance.\nMBS Issued by Other Government Agencies\nWe also invest in MBS issued and guaranteed by Ginnie Mae. These investments totaled $1.1 billion at December 31, 2021. We believe that the strength of Ginnie Mae's guarantee and backing by the full faith and credit of the U.S. government is sufficient to protect us against credit losses on these securities.\nDerivatives\nCredit Risk Exposure: We mitigate most of the credit risk exposure resulting from derivative transactions through collateralization or use of daily settled contracts. The table below presents derivative positions to which we had credit risk exposure at December 31, 2021.\n\n(1)Represents derivative transactions cleared with LCH Ltd. and CME Clearing, the FHLB's clearinghouses. LCH Ltd. is rated AA- by Standard & Poor's, and CME Clearing is not rated, but its parent company, CME Group Inc., is rated Aa3 by Moody's and AA- by Standard & Poor's.\n(2)Represents Mandatory Delivery Contracts.\nOur exposure to cleared derivatives is primarily associated with the requirement to post initial margin through the clearing agent to the Derivatives Clearing Organizations. We pledge cash as collateral to satisfy this initial margin requirement. However, the use of cleared derivatives mitigates credit risk exposure because a central counterparty is substituted for individual counterparties.\nAt December 31, 2021, the net exposure of uncleared derivatives with residual credit risk exposure was less than $1 million. If interest rates rise or the composition of our derivatives change resulting in an increase to our gross exposure to uncleared derivatives, the contractual collateral provisions in these derivatives would limit our net exposure to acceptable levels.\nAlthough we cannot predict if we will realize credit risk losses from any of our derivatives counterparties, we believe that all of the counterparties will be able to continue making timely interest payments and, more generally, to continue to satisfy the terms and conditions of their derivative contracts with us. As of December 31, 2021, we had $0.4 billion of notional principal of interest rate swaps with a subsidiary of our member, JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., which also had outstanding credit services with us. Due to the amount of market value collateralization, we had no outstanding credit exposure to this counterparty related to interest rate swaps outstanding.\nLiquidity Risk\nLiquidity Overview\nWe strive to be in a liquidity position at all times to meet the borrowing needs of our members and to meet all current and future financial commitments. This objective is achieved by managing liquidity positions to maintain stable, reliable, and cost-effective sources of funds while taking into account market conditions, member demand, and the maturity profile of assets and liabilities. Our liquidity position complies with the FHLBank Act, Finance Agency regulations, and internal policies.\nThe FHLBank System's primary source of funds is the sale of Consolidated Obligations in the capital markets. Our ability to obtain funds through the sale of Consolidated Obligations at acceptable interest costs depends on the financial market's perception of the riskiness of the Obligations and on prevailing conditions in the capital markets, particularly the short-term capital markets. The System's favorable debt ratings, the implicit U.S. government backing of our debt, and our effective risk management practices are instrumental in ensuring stable and satisfactory access to the capital markets.\nWe believe our liquidity position, as well as that of the System, continued to be strong during 2021. Our overall ability to effectively fund our operations through debt issuances remained sufficient. Investor demand for System debt was robust in 2021, as investors continued to prefer short-term, high-quality money market instruments. We believe the possibility of a liquidity or funding crisis in the System that would impair our ability to participate, on a cost-effective basis, in issuances of debt, service outstanding debt, maintain adequate capitalization, or pay competitive dividends is remote.\nThe System works collectively to manage and monitor the System-wide liquidity and funding risks. Liquidity risk includes the risk that the System could have difficulty rolling over short-term Obligations when market conditions change, also called refinancing risk. The System has a large reliance on short-term funding; therefore, it has a sharp focus on managing liquidity risk to very low levels. As shown on the Statements of Cash Flows, in 2021, our portion of the System's debt issuances totaled $193.5 billion for Discount Notes and $33.8 billion for Bonds. Access to short-term debt markets has been reliable because investors, driven by liquidity preferences and risk aversion, have sought the System's short-term debt, which has resulted in strong demand for debt maturing in one year or less.\nSee the Notes to Financial Statements for more detailed information regarding maturities of certain financial assets and liabilities which are instrumental in determining the amount of liquidity risk. In addition to contractual maturities, other assumptions regarding cash flows such as estimated prepayments, embedded call optionality, and scheduled amortization are considered when managing liquidity risks.\nLiquidity Management and Regulatory Requirements\nWe manage liquidity risk by ensuring compliance with our regulatory liquidity requirements and regularly monitoring other metrics.\nThe Finance Agency establishes the expectations with respect to the maintenance of sufficient liquidity without access to the capital markets for a specified number of days, which was set as a period of between 10 to 30 calendar days in the base case. Under these expectations, all Advance maturities are assumed to renew, unless the Advances relate to former members who are ineligible to borrow new Advances. The maintenance of sufficient liquidity is intended to provide additional assurance that we can continue to provide Advances and Letters of Credit to members over an extended period without access

Bank for the years 2021, 2020, and 2019. \n\nKey points:\n\n- Net income was $42 million in 2021, down from $276 million in 2020, primarily due to lower interest rates, lower Advance balances, and lower spreads on mortgage assets. \n\n- Average Advance balances declined 45% in 2021 compared to 2020 as demand remained low. Mortgage loan balances also declined due to accelerated prepayments from low interest rates.\n\n- Net interest income fell to $277 million in 2021 from $406 million in 2020 due to the factors above. Non-interest income also declined due to gains on derivatives in 2020 that did not recur.\n\n- The bank maintains a conservative risk philosophy, with moderate market risk exposure and limited credit risk. Liquidity and capital positions remained strong.\n\n- Total assets were $60.7 billion at year-end 2021 compared to $88.7 billion at year-end 2020. Regulatory capital ended the year at $3.8 billion.\n\n- The bank accrued $5 million for affordable housing programs in 2021 based on the lower level of earnings. \n\n- The MD&A provides detailed analysis of the bank's financial performance, credit quality, liquidity, capital, and market risk management. Regulatory developments and membership composition are also discussed.\n\nIn summary, the Federal Home Loan Bank experienced lower profitability in 2021 driven by the low interest rate environment but maintained a strong financial position and continued fulfilling its housing mission. The MD&A provides comprehensive analysis of the bank's operations and risk management."}
