Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nOVERVIEW\nManagement's discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes that appear elsewhere in this annual report on Form 10-K.\nInvacare is a multi-national company with integrated capabilities to design, produce and distribute durable medical equipment. The company makes products that help people move, breathe, rest and perform essential hygiene, and with those products the company supports people with congenital, acquired and degenerative conditions. The company's products and solutions are important parts of care for people with a range of challenges, from those who are active and heading to work or school each day and may need additional mobility or respiratory support, to those who are cared for in residential care settings, at home and in rehabilitation centers. The company operates in facilities in North America, Europe and Asia/Pacific, which are the result of dozens of acquisitions made over the company's nearly forty-year history. Some of these acquisitions have been combined into integrated operating units, while others remain relatively independent.\nStrategy\nThe company had a strategy to be a leading provider of durable medical equipment to providers in global markets by providing the broadest portfolio available. This strategy has not kept pace with certain reimbursement changes, competitive dynamics and company-specific challenges. Since 2015, the company has made a major shift in its strategy. The company has since been aligning its resources to produce products and solutions that assist customers and end-users with their most clinically complex needs. By focusing the company's efforts to provide the best possible assistance and outcomes to the people and caregivers who use its products, the company aims to improve its financial condition for sustainable profit and growth. To execute this transformation, the company is undertaking a substantial three-phase multi-year transformation plan.\nTransformation\nThe company is executing a multi-year transformation to shift to its new strategy. This is expected to yield better financial results from the application of the company's resources to products and solutions that provide greater healthcare value in clinically complex rehabilitation and post-acute care. The transformation is divided into the following three phases:\nPhase One - Assess and Reorient\nTable 62: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Increase commercial effectiveness;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 63: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Shift and narrow the product portfolio;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 64: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Align innovation resources to clinically complex solutions;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 65: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Accelerate quality efforts with culture of quality excellence; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 66: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Develop and expand talent.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nPhase Two - Build and Align\nTable 67: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Leverage commercial improvements;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 68: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Optimize the business for cost and efficiency;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 69: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Continue to improve quality systems;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 70: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Launch new clinical product platforms; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 71: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Expand talent management and culture.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nPhase Three - Grow\nTable 72: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Lead in quality culture and operations excellence; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 73: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Grow above market.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nIn 2016, the company made significant progress on its Phase One work, most notably in North America, where some of the greatest improvement is needed. As expected, the 2016 financial results show the near-term impact of investments in commercial resources, new product development, and quality systems, ahead of accretion. The company will continue to make significant investments in this transformation, reduce sales in certain areas, refocus resources away from less accretive activities, and look at its global infrastructure for opportunities to drive efficiency. Phase One investments are in the early phases of providing returns.\nI-39\nThe company expects to begin seeing some results later in 2017 and more substantive results in 2018. In the meantime, the company has begun taking early Phase Two actions to streamline operations, resize and reshape the organization, especially in North America, around its new business mix and size. By executing this strategy and making these operational improvements, the company expects long-term benefits for the company's constituents.\nFavorable Long-term Demand\nUltimately, demand for the company's products and services is based on the need to provide care for people with certain conditions. The company's medical devices provide solutions for end-users and caregivers. Therefore, the demand for the company's medical equipment is largely driven by population growth and the incidence of certain conditions where treatment may be supplemented by the company's devices. The company also provides solutions to help equipment providers and residential care operators deliver cost-effective and high-quality care. The company believes that its commercial team, customer relationships, products and solutions, supply chain infrastructure, and strong research and development pipeline will create favorable business potential.\nDISCONTINUED AND DIVESTED OPERATIONS\nOn August 29, 2014, the company sold Altimate Medical, Inc. (Altimate), its manufacturer of stationary standing assistive devices for use in patient rehabilitation, to REP Acquisition Corporation for $23,000,000 in cash, which was subject to final post-closing adjustments. Altimate had been operated on a stand-alone basis and reported as part of the North America/HME segment of the company. The company recorded a gain of $17,069,000 pre-tax in the third quarter of 2014, which represented the excess of the net sales price over the book value of the assets and liabilities of Altimate. The sale of this business was dilutive to the company's results. The company utilized the proceeds from the sale to reduce debt outstanding under its revolving credit facility in the third quarter of 2014. The gain recorded by the company reflects the company's estimated final purchase adjustments.\nIn 2014, the net sales of the Altimate discontinued operations were $11,778,000 and earnings before income taxes were $2,796,000. Results for Altimate include an interest expense allocation from continuing operations to discontinued operations of $202,000 in 2014 as proceeds from the sale were required to be utilized to pay down debt. The interest allocation was based on the net proceeds assumed to pay down debt applying the company's average interest rates for the periods presented. The company has classified Altimate as a discontinued operation for all periods presented.\nThe company recorded total expenses related to all of its discontinued operations since 2012 of $8,801,000, of which $8,405,000 were paid as of December 31, 2016. The company recorded an incremental intra-period tax allocation expense to discontinued operations for 2015 and 2014 representing the cumulative intra-period allocation expense to discontinued operations based on the company's domestic taxable loss related to continuing operations for 2015 and 2014.\nOn July 2, 2015, the company sold its rentals businesses to Joerns Healthcare Parent, LLC, for approximately $15,500,000 in cash, which was subject to final post-closing adjustments. The rentals businesses had been operated on a stand-alone basis and reported as part of the IPG segment of the company. The company recorded a pre-tax gain of approximately $24,000 in the third quarter of 2015, which represented the excess of the net sales price over the book value of the assets and liabilities of the rentals businesses, as of the date of completion of the disposition. The company recorded expenses related to the sale of the rentals businesses totaling $1,792,000, of which $1,265,000 have been paid as of December 31, 2016. The sale of the rentals businesses was not dilutive to the company's results. The company utilized the net proceeds from the sale to reduce debt outstanding under its credit agreement. The company determined that the sale of the rentals businesses did not meet the criteria for classification as a discontinued operation in accordance with ASU 2014-08. The rentals businesses were treated as held for sale as of June 30, 2015 until sold on July 2, 2015. As such, the results of the rentals businesses are included in the Results from Continuing Operations discussion below.\nOn September 30, 2016, the company, completed the sale of GCM to Compass Health Brands Corp., for approximately $13,829,000 in cash, which is subject to final post-closing adjustments. The net proceeds from the transaction were $12,729,000, net of expenses. The company recorded a pre-tax gain of $7,386,000 in the third quarter of 2016, which represented the excess of the net sales price over the book value of the assets and liabilities of GCM. The company recorded expenses related to the sale of GCM totaling $1,100,000, of which $230,000 has been paid out as of December 31, 2016. The sale of GCM was dilutive to the company's results. The company utilized the net proceeds to fund operations. The company determined that the sale of GCM did not meet the criteria for classification as a discontinued operation in accordance with ASU 2014-08 but the \"held for sale\" criteria of ASC 360-10-45-9 were met and thus GCM was treated as held for sale for purposes of the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets as of December 31, 2015. As such, the results of the rentals businesses are included in the Results from Continuing Operations discussion below.\nI-40\nRESULTS OF CONTINUING OPERATIONS\n2016 Versus 2015\nNet Sales. Consolidated net sales for 2016 decreased 8.3% for the year, to $1,047,474,000 from $1,142,338,000 in 2015. Foreign currency translation decreased net sales by 1.6 percentage points. Constant currency net sales decreased 6.7% compared to 2015. Higher constant currency net sales in the Europe and Asia/Pacific segments were offset by lower constant currency net sales in the North America/HME and IPG segments. Constant currency net sales for the company, excluding the impact of all the divested businesses (GCM and rentals businesses), decreased 4.9% compared to 2015. Constant currency net sales is a non-GAAP financial measure - see \"Business Segment Net Sales\" on page I-49.\nEurope\nEuropean net sales increased 0.7% in 2016 compared to the prior year to $540,013,000 from $536,463,000 as foreign currency translation decreased net sales by 3.0 percentage points. Constant currency net sales increased 3.7% compared to 2015. The improvements in constant currency net sales were driven by increased sales of mobility and seating and lifestyle products. Changes in exchange rates have had, and may continue to have, a significant impact on sales in this segment.\nNorth America/Home Medical Equipment (North America/HME)\nNorth America/HME net sales decreased 16.1% in 2016 versus the prior year to $397,702,000 from $474,196,000 with foreign currency translation decreasing net sales by 0.2 of a percentage point. Constant currency net sales decreased 15.9% compared to the prior year. Excluding the net sales impact of the divested GCM business, reported net sales decreased by 15.5% and by 15.3% on a constant currency basis. The decreases in constant currency net sales were primarily driven by reduced sales of lifestyle and respiratory products while mobility and seating declined slightly.\nInstitutional Products Group (IPG)\nIPG net sales decreased 26.1% in 2016 over the prior year to $64,413,000 from $87,137,000 as foreign currency translation decreased sales by 0.2 of a percentage point. Excluding the net sales impact of the divested rentals businesses, reported net sales decreased by 11.5% and by 11.3% on a constant currency basis. The decreases in constant currency net sales of the non-rentals businesses were driven by sales declines in all major product categories.\nAsia/Pacific\nAsia/Pacific net sales increased 1.8% in 2016 from the prior year to $45,346,000 from $44,542,000. Foreign currency translation decreased net sales by 1.7 percentage points. Constant currency net sales increased 3.5% compared to 2015 due to net sales increases in the Australia and New Zealand distribution businesses and at the company's subsidiary that produces microprocessor controllers. Changes in exchange rates, particularly with the euro and U.S. dollar, have had, and may continue to have, a significant impact on sales in this segment.\nGross Profit. Consolidated gross profit as a percentage of net sales was 27.1% in 2016 as compared to 27.4% in 2015. Excluding the impact of all the divested businesses, gross margin as a percentage of net sales for 2016 increased by 0.2 of a percentage point as compared to 2015 driven by favorable sales mix principally offset by increased warranty expense. Gross margin as a percentage of net sales increased for the North America/HME and Asia/Pacific segments with declines in the Europe and IPG segments. Gross profit dollars declined in all segments, except for Asia/Pacific, with the largest declines in North America/HME and IPG. The decline in IPG was primarily impacted by the sale of the rentals businesses in 2015.\nGross profit in Europe as a percentage of net sales decreased 0.5 of a percentage point in 2016 from the prior year and gross margin dollars decreased by $1,721,000. The decrease in margin was principally due to unfavorable foreign currency, pricing, warranty and R&D expense. Incremental warranty recall expense of $1,490,000 was recorded in 2016 for a component of a lifestyles product.\nNorth America/HME gross profit as a percentage of net sales increased by 0.4 of a percentage point in 2016 from the prior year while gross margin dollars decreased by $14,106,000 driven by net sales declines and increased warranty expense. The 2016 gross margin reflects warranty recall expense of $1,366,000, or 0.3 of a percentage point, for a recall which was related to a component on a lifestyles product. In comparison, warranty recall expense reversals of $2,325,000, or 0.5 of a percentage point, were recorded in 2015.\nI-41\nIPG gross profit as a percentage of net sales decreased 9.9 percentage points in 2016 from the prior year and gross margin dollars decreased $14,090,000. The decrease in margin was primarily attributable to the sale of the rentals businesses ($11,359,000 or 8.5 percentage points) and to a lesser extent unfavorable sales mix and increased warranty expense.\nGross profit in Asia/Pacific as a percentage of net sales increased 1.8 percentage points in 2016 from the prior year and gross margin dollars increased $1,038,000. The increase was primarily related to favorable sales mix and reduced manufacturing costs, which were partially offset by R&D expense.\nSee Accrued Expenses\u201d in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this report for the total warranty provision amounts and a reconciliation of the changes in the warranty accrual.\nSelling, General and Administrative. Consolidated selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses as a percentage of net sales were 29.0% in 2016 and 27.9% in 2015. The overall dollar decrease was $14,865,000, or 4.7%, with foreign currency translation decreasing expense by $4,226,000 or 1.4 percentage points. Excluding the impact of foreign currency translation, SG&A expenses decreased $10,639,000, or 3.3%. Excluding the impacts of all the divested businesses and foreign currency translation, SG&A expense increased $2,212,000, or 0.7%, compared to 2015, primarily related to increased product liability and employment costs. The SG&A expense in 2015 included a write-off of costs related to a canceled legacy software program based on a change in the North America/HME IT strategy.\nEuropean SG&A expenses increased by 3.5%, or $4,079,000, in 2016 compared to 2015. Foreign currency translation decreased expense by approximately $3,224,000 or 2.7 percentage points. Excluding the foreign currency translation impact, SG&A expenses increased by $7,303,000, or 6.2%, principally related to increased employment costs.\nSG&A expenses for North America/HME decreased 4.0%, or $5,603,000, in 2016 compared to 2015 with foreign currency translation decreasing expense by $722,000 or 0.5 of a percentage point. Excluding the foreign currency translation, SG&A expense decreased $4,881,000, or 3.5%, principally as a result of reduced regulatory costs in 2016, a $4,031,000 2015 write-off of costs for a canceled legacy software program, and a reduction in expense in 2016 resulting from the GCM divestiture.\nSG&A expenses for IPG decreased by 50.7%, or $11,949,000, in 2016 compared to 2015. Excluding the impact of foreign currency translation, SG&A expenses decreased by $11,927,000, or 50.6%, primarily related to a reduction in expense for the rentals business divestiture ($11,239,000) and employment costs.\nAsia/Pacific SG&A expenses decreased 6.1%, or $1,018,000, in 2016 compared to 2015. Foreign currency translation decreased expense by $258,000 or 1.6 percentage points. Excluding the foreign currency translation impact, SG&A expenses decreased $760,000, or 4.5%, principally as a result of favorable foreign currency transactions and reduced employment costs.\nSG&A expenses related to the Other Segment decreased by 1.8% or $374,000 in 2016 as compared to 2015 primarily related to decreased legal expense in 2016.\nGain on Sale of Business. As a result of the sale of GCM on September 30, 2016, the company recorded a gain in 2016 of $7,386,000 on the sale, which represents the excess of the net sales price over the book value of the net assets of GCM. As a result of the sale of the rentals business on July 2, 2015, the company recorded a gain of $24,000 in 2015, which represented the excess of the net sales price over the book value of the assets and liabilities of the rentals businesses.\nCharge Related to Restructuring Activities. The company's restructuring charges were necessitated primarily by continued declines in Medicare and Medicaid reimbursement by the U.S. government, as well as similar healthcare reimbursement pressures abroad, which negatively affect the company's customers (e.g. home health care providers) and continued pricing pressures faced by the company as a result of outsourcing by competitors to lower cost locations. Restructuring decisions were also the result of reduced profitability in the North America/HME and Asia/Pacific segments impacted by the FDA consent decree. In addition, as a result of the company's transformation strategy, additional restructuring charges were incurred during 2016 and are expected to continue into 2017. While the company's restructuring efforts have been executed on a timely basis, and have resulted in operating cost savings, the savings have been more than offset by the general business decline, higher regulatory and compliance costs related to quality system improvements, and more recently, investments as a result of the company's transformation strategy and higher interest expense. The company expects any near-term cost savings from restructuring will be offset by other costs as a result of the company's transformation strategy and other pressures on the business.\nCharges for the year ended December 31, 2016 totaled $2,447,000 which were related to North America/HME segment ($2,347,000) and the Asia/Pacific segment ($100,000). In North America/HME, costs were incurred related to severance ($1,862,000) and lease termination costs ($485,000). The Asia/Pacific charges were for severance costs. The savings from these\nI-42\ncharges will be reflected primarily in reduced selling, general and administrative expenses and manufacturing expenses for the company. Payments for the year ended December 31, 2016 were $2,992,000 and the cash payments were funded with company's cash on hand. The majority of the 2016 charges are expected to be paid out within twelve months.\nCharges for the year ended December 31, 2015 totaled $1,971,000 including charges for severance ($1,678,000) and charges principally related to a building lease termination primarily in the North America/HME segment ($293,000). Severance charges were incurred in the North America/HME segment ($1,069,000), Europe segment ($510,000), IPG segment ($73,000) and Asia/Pacific segment ($26,000) related to the elimination of certain positions as a result of general restructuring efforts. The savings from these charges have been reflected primarily in reduced selling, general and administrative expenses and manufacturing expenses for the company. Payments for the year ended December 31, 2015 were $3,723,000 and were funded with operating cash flows and cash on hand. The 2015 charges have been paid out.\nTo date, the company's liquidity has not been materially impacted; however, the company's disclosure below in Liquidity and Capital Resources highlights risks that could negatively impact the company's liquidity. See also \"Charges Related to Restructuring Activities\" in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nAsset write-downs to intangible assets. In accordance with ASC 350, Intangibles - Goodwill and Other, the company reviews intangibles for impairment. As a result of the company's 2016 and 2015 intangible reviews, the company did not recognize any intangible write-down charges.\nNet Gain on Convertible Debt Derivatives. For 2016, the company recognized a loss of $2,504,000 related to the convertible note hedge derivative long-term asset and recognized a gain of $3,772,000 related to the convertible debt conversion liability derivative which resulted in a net gain of $1,268,000 related to the fair value of the convertible debt derivatives. See \"Long-Term Debt\" in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this report for more detail.\nInterest. Interest expense increased to $15,875,000 in 2016 from $4,136,000 in 2015, representing a 283.8% increase. This increase was due to the convertible debt issuance in the first quarter of 2016 and, to a lesser extent, capital lease interest expense as a result of the real estate sale and leaseback transaction completed during the second quarter of 2015. Interest income in 2016 was $265,000, as compared to $165,000 in 2015.\nIncome Taxes. The company had an effective tax rate of 45.0% in 2016 compared to an expected benefit of 35% on the continuing operations pre-tax loss and an effective tax rate of 125.3% in 2015 compared to an expected benefit of 35% on the pre-tax loss from continuing operations. The company's effective tax rates in 2016 and 2015 both were unfavorable to the expected U.S. federal statutory rate benefit for those years due to the negative impact of the company not being able to record tax benefits related to losses in those countries which had tax valuation allowances for the year, which more than offset the benefit of foreign income taxed at rates below the U.S. statutory rate. See Income Taxes\u201d in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this report for more detail.\nResearch and Development. The company continued to invest in research and development activities in 2016. The company dedicated funds to applied research activities to ensure that new and enhanced design concepts are available to its businesses. Research and development expenditures, which are included in costs of products sold, decreased to $17,123,000 in 2016 from $18,677,000 in 2015. The expenditures, as a percentage of net sales, were 1.6% and 1.6% in 2016 and 2015, respectively.\n2015 Versus 2014\nNet Sales. Consolidated net sales for 2015 decreased 10.1% for the year, to $1,142,338,000 from $1,270,163,000 in 2014. Foreign currency translation decreased net sales by 8.7 percentage points. Constant currency net sales decreased 1.4% compared to 2014. Higher constant currency net sales in the Europe and Asia/Pacific segments were offset by lower constant currency net sales in the North America/HME and IPG segments. Constant currency net sales for the company, excluding the impact of the divested rentals businesses in the IPG segment, were flat for the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to the prior year. Constant currency net sales is a non-GAAP financial measure - see \"Business Segment Net Sales\" on page I-49.\nEurope\nEuropean net sales decreased 12.1% in 2015 compared to the prior year to $536,463,000 from $610,555,000 as foreign currency translation decreased net sales by 15.6 percentage points. Constant currency net sales increased 3.5% compared to 2014 principally due to increases in sales of mobility and seating, respiratory and lifestyle products.\nI-43\nNorth America/Home Medical Equipment (North America/HME)\nNorth America/HME net sales decreased 6.6% in 2015 versus the prior year to $474,196,000 from $507,867,000, with foreign currency translation decreasing net sales by 1.0 percentage point. Constant currency net sales decreased 5.6% compared to the prior year, as increases in sales of mobility and seating products were more than offset by declines in sales of respiratory and lifestyle products. Net sales in the mobility and seating product category were impacted by the FDA consent decree, which limits production of custom power wheelchairs and seating systems at the Taylor Street manufacturing facility to products having properly completed verification of medical necessity (VMN) documentation. The VMN is a signed document from a clinician, and in some instances a physician, that certifies that the product is deemed medically necessary for a particular patient's condition, which cannot be adequately addressed by another manufacturer's product or which is a replacement of the patient's existing product. In an effort to position the company for improved sales results in the future, during 2015, the company began a transformation of its generalist sales force to one more focused on clinically complex products, which includes the mobility and seating product category. As a result, lifestyle and respiratory product net sales were de-emphasized contributing to lower net sales for these products.\nInstitutional Products Group (IPG)\nIPG net sales decreased 15.2% in 2015 over the prior year to $87,137,000 from $102,796,000 as foreign currency translation decreased sales by 0.8 of a percentage point. Excluding the net sales impact of the divested rentals businesses, constant currency net sales increased 3.7% driven primarily by increases in sales of beds and interior design projects. These increases were partially offset by sales declines in therapeutic support surfaces.\nAsia/Pacific\nAsia/Pacific net sales decreased 9.0% in 2015 from the prior year to $44,542,000 from $48,945,000. Foreign currency translation decreased net sales by 16.5 percentage points. Constant currency net sales increased 7.5% primarily due to sales increases at the company's New Zealand and Australian distribution businesses, and at the company's subsidiary that produces microprocessor controllers.\nGross Profit. Consolidated gross profit as a percentage of net sales was 27.4% in 2015 as compared to 27.3% in 2014. The 2015 gross margin reflects a warranty expense reversal related to recalls of $2,325,000 or 0.2 of a percentage point, recorded in the North America/HME segment. The company's warranty reserve is subject to adjustment as new developments change the company's estimates. The 2014 gross margin reflected an incremental warranty expense for three previously disclosed recalls of $11,493,000 or 0.9 of a percentage point. The incremental warranty expense was recorded in the North America/HME, Europe and Asia/Pacific reporting segments. Excluding the impact of the warranty expense amounts noted previously, the gross margin as a percentage of net sales was 27.2% in 2015 as compared to 28.2% in 2014. The margin decrease was principally related to unfavorable sales mix, foreign exchange and the impact of the divested rentals businesses. The rentals businesses had a higher gross margin as a percentage of net sales than the average gross margin as a percentage of net sales for the overall company. Gross profit as a percentage of net sales for the North America/HME and Asia/Pacific segments was favorable as compared to the prior year with the Europe and IPG segments unfavorable compared to the prior year.\nGross profit in Europe as a percentage of net sales decreased 1.9 percentage points in 2015 from the prior year. The decrease in margin was principally due to unfavorable foreign currency exchange and a negative sales mix, partially offset by reduced warranty expense. The 2014 gross margin reflected an incremental warranty expense of $3,395,000 or 0.6 of a percentage point for a previously disclosed recall.\nNorth America/HME gross profit as a percentage of net sales increased 2.7 percentage points in 2015 from the prior year. The increase in margins was principally due to reduced warranty expense, favorable sales mix and decreased manufacturing costs. The 2015 gross margin reflects a warranty recall expense reversal of $2,325,000 or 0.5 of a percentage point for three recalls compared to incremental warranty recall expense of $6,833,000 or 1.3 of a percentage point in 2014.\nIPG gross profit as a percentage of net sales decreased 7.9 percentage points in 2015 from the prior year. The decrease in margin is primarily attributable to the sale of the rentals businesses (5.4 percentage points) and increased freight costs.\nGross profit in Asia/Pacific as a percentage of net sales increased 1.9 percentage points in 2015 from the prior year. The increase was primarily as a result of reduced warranty expense and a favorable manufacturing costs. The 2014 gross margin included an incremental warranty expense for the power wheelchair joystick recall of $1,265,000, or 2.6 percentage points.\nI-44\nSee Accrued Expenses\u201d in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this report for the total provision amounts and a reconciliation of the changes in the warranty accrual.\nSelling, General and Administrative. Consolidated selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses as a percentage of net sales were 27.9% in 2015 and 30.1% in 2014. The overall dollar decrease was $63,419,000, or 16.6%, with foreign currency translation decreasing expense by $23,891,000 or 6.3 percentage points. Excluding the impact of foreign currency translation, SG&A expenses decreased $39,528,000, or 10.3%. This decrease was primarily attributable to the sale of the rentals businesses in the third quarter of 2015, which lowered SG&A expenses by $15,626,000, and by reduced consulting expense (including regulatory and compliance costs related to quality system improvements), employment costs and product liability expense. These were partially offset by a $4,031,000 write-off of costs associated with a canceled legacy software program based on a change in the North America/HME IT strategy.\nEuropean SG&A expenses decreased by 15.9%, or $22,254,000, in 2015 compared to 2014. Foreign currency translation decreased expense by approximately $18,709,000 or 13.4 percentage points. Excluding the foreign currency translation impact, SG&A expenses decreased by $3,545,000, or 2.5%, primarily in depreciation and amortization expense partially offset by increased employment costs.\nSG&A expenses for North America/HME decreased 9.5%, or $14,673,000, in 2015 compared to 2014, with foreign currency translation decreasing expense by $2,313,000 or 1.5 percentage points. Excluding the foreign currency translation, SG&A expense decreased $12,360,000, or 8.0%, due principally to reduced employment costs, product liability expense and consulting expense, including lower regulatory and compliance costs related to quality systems improvements. These were partially offset by a $4,031,000 write-off of costs in 2015 associated with a canceled legacy software program based on a change in the North America/HME IT strategy. In addition, 2014 included an incremental expense of $958,000 related to the retirement of an executive officer of the company.\nSG&A expenses for IPG decreased by 43.1%, or $17,874,000, in 2015 compared to 2014. Excluding the impact of foreign currency translation, SG&A expenses decreased by $17,881,000, or 43.1%, primarily due to the sale of the rentals businesses, which reduced SG&A expenses by $15,626,000, as well as reduced employment costs.\nAsia/Pacific SG&A expenses decreased 21.5%, or $4,580,000, in 2015 compared to 2014. Foreign currency translation decreased expense by $2,876,000 or 13.5 percentage points. Excluding the foreign currency translation impact, SG&A expenses decreased $1,704,000, or 8.0%, principally as a result of reduced employment costs and depreciation expense.\nSG&A expenses related to the Other Segment decreased by 16.3% or $4,038,000 in 2015 as compared to 2014. The decrease is attributable to lower legal and professional costs as well as decreased employment costs. In addition, 2014 included an incremental expense of $1,800,000 related to the retirement of an executive officer of the company.\nAsset write-downs to intangible assets. As a result of the company's 2015 intangible review, the company did not recognize any intangible write-down charges.\nAs a result of the company's review of intangible assets for 2014, the company recognized intangible write-down charges in the IPG segment of $13,041,000 comprised of a customer list impairment of $12,826,000 and a non-compete agreement of $215,000 as the actual and remaining cash flows associated with the intangibles were less than the cash flows originally used to value the intangibles, primarily driven by reduced net sales. The after-tax and pre-tax impairment amounts were the same for each of the above impairments.\nCharge Related to Restructuring Activities. Charges for the year ended December 31, 2015 totaled $1,971,000 including charges for severance ($1,678,000) and charges principally related to a building lease termination primarily in the North America/HME segment ($293,000). Severance charges were incurred in the North America/HME segment ($1,069,000), Europe segment ($510,000), IPG segment ($73,000) and Asia/Pacific segment ($26,000) related to the elimination of certain positions as a result of general restructuring efforts. The savings from these charges have been reflected primarily in reduced selling, general and administrative expenses and manufacturing expenses for the company. Payments for the year ended December 31, 2015 were $3,723,000 and were funded with operating cash flows and cash on hand. The 2015 charges have been paid out.\nCharges for the year ended December 31, 2014 totaled $11,112,000 including charges for severance ($9,841,000), other charges in IPG and Europe ($1,286,000) principally related to building write-downs and lease termination cost reversals ($15,000). Severance charges were incurred in the North America/HME segment ($4,404,000), Other ($2,978,000), IPG segment ($1,163,000), Asia/Pacific segment ($769,000) and Europe segment ($527,000). The North America/HME segment severance charges were principally related to additional positions eliminated due to lost sales volumes resulting from the impact of the FDA\nI-45\nconsent decree. The Other severance charges related to the elimination of two senior corporate executive positions. IPG segment severance charges related principally to the closure of the London, Ontario facility. Europe and Asia/Pacific severance charges related to the elimination of certain positions as a result of general restructuring efforts. The costs related to the building write-downs related to two plant closures. The savings from these charges have been reflected primarily in reduced selling, general and administrative expenses and manufacturing expenses for the company. Payments for the year ended December 31, 2014 were $11,131,000 and were funded with operating cash flows and the company's revolving credit facility. The majority of the 2014 charges have been paid out other than certain executive charge payments which will be paid out over the next few years.\nThe company's disclosure below in Liquidity and Capital Resources highlights risks that could negatively impact the company's liquidity. See also \"Charges Related to Restructuring Activities\" in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nInterest. Interest expense decreased to $4,136,000 in 2015 from $4,887,000 in 2014, representing a 15.4% decrease. This decrease was attributable primarily to lower average borrowings in 2015 versus 2014, despite an increase in interest expense related to capital leases. Interest income in 2015 was $165,000 as compared to $507,000 in 2014, primarily due to interest income earned in Europe on a VAT receivable in 2014 that did not recur in 2015.\nIncome Taxes. The company had an effective tax rate of 125.3% in 2015 compared to an expected benefit of 35% on the continuing operations pre-tax loss and an effective rate of 8.8% in 2014 compared to an expected benefit of 35% on the pre-tax loss from continuing operations. The company's effective tax rate in 2015 was unfavorable to the expected U.S. federal statutory rate benefit due to the negative impact of the company not being able to record tax benefits related to losses in those countries which had tax valuation allowances for the year, which more than offset the benefit of foreign income taxed at rates below the U.S. statutory rate. The company's effective tax rate in 2014 was unfavorable to the expected U.S. federal statutory rate benefit due to the same reasons, except the company recognized a benefit of $7,175,000 in the U.S. as an intra-period allocation with discontinued operations against a portion of the domestic taxable loss from continuing operations. See Income Taxes\u201d in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this report for more detail.\nResearch and Development. Research and development expenditures, which were included in costs of products sold, decreased to $18,677,000 in 2015 from $23,149,000 in 2014. The expenditures, as a percentage of net sales, were 1.6% and 1.8% in 2015 and 2014, respectively.\nINFLATION\nAlthough the company cannot determine the precise effects of inflation, management believes that inflation does continue to have an influence on the cost of materials, salaries and benefits, utilities and outside services. The company attempts to minimize or offset the effects through its review of pricing, capital expenditure programs designed to improve productivity, alternative sourcing of material and other cost control measures.\nLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\nThe company continues to maintain an adequate liquidity position through its unused bank lines of credit (see Long-Term Debt in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this report) and cash balances, as described below.\nThe company's total debt outstanding, inclusive of the debt discount related to the 4.125% Convertible Senior Subordinated Debentures due 2027 (the \"2027 Debentures\") included in equity in accordance with FSB APB 14-1 as well as the debt discount and fees associated with the 5.00% Convertible Senior Notes due 2021 (the \"2021 Notes\"), increased by $148,178,000 to $196,501,000 at December 31, 2016 from $48,323,000 as of December 31, 2015. The company's balance sheet reflects the impact of ASC 470-20, which reduced debt and increased equity by $311,000 and $1,203,000 as of December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively, related to the 2027 Debentures. The debt discount and fees associated with the 2021 Notes reduced the company's reported debt balance by $29,919,000 and $4,922,000, respectively, as of December 31, 2016. The debt increase in 2016 was principally a result of issuing $150,000,000 aggregate principal amount of 2021 Notes. The company's cash and cash equivalents were $124,234,000 at December 31, 2016, compared to $60,055,000 as of December 31, 2015. At December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the company had zero borrowings outstanding under its revolving credit facility. The increase in cash balances compared to December 31, 2015 was primarily the result of the net proceeds received from the issuance of the 2021 Notes in the first quarter of 2016 and the sale proceeds from the sale of GCM, partially offset by cash flow usage.\nOn February 2, 2017, the company repurchased all of the outstanding $13,350,000 principal amount of 2027 Debentures as the holders exercised their February 1, 2017 right to require the company to repurchase their 2027 Debentures (see Long-Term Debt and Subsequent Event in the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements included in this report).\nI-46\nThe company's borrowing capacity and cash balances were utilized for normal operations during the period ended December 31, 2016. Debt repayments, acquisitions, divestitures, the timing of vendor payments, the granting of extended payment terms to significant national accounts and other activity can have a significant impact on the company's cash flow and borrowings outstanding such that the debt reported at the end of a given period may be materially different than debt levels during a given period. While the company has cash balances in various jurisdictions around the world, there are no material restrictions regarding the use of such cash for dividends within the company, loans or other purposes, except in China where the cash balance as of December 31, 2016 was approximately $7,145,000.\nThe company has an asset-based lending Amended and Restated Revolving Credit and Security Agreement (the Credit Agreement\u201d), which provides for a revolving line of credit, letter of credit and swing line facility for the company's U.S. and Canadian borrowers in an aggregate principal amount of up to $100,000,000 (the \"U.S. and Canadian Credit Facility\") and a similar facility for European borrowers in an aggregate principal amount of up to $30,000,000 (the \"European Credit Facility\") each of which is subject to variable rates and availability based on a borrowing base formula. The initial borrowings under the Credit Agreement were used to repay approximately $17,000,000 in aggregate principal amount of borrowings and terminate the company's previous credit agreement, which was scheduled to mature in October 2015. As determined pursuant to the borrowing base formula for the U.S. and Canadian borrowers, the company's borrowing base including the period ending December 31, 2016 under the U.S. and Canadian Credit Facility of the Credit Agreement was approximately $52,761,000, with aggregate borrowing availability of approximately $32,031,000, taking into account the $5,000,000 minimum availability reserve, then-outstanding letters of credit, other reserves and the $11,250,000 dominion trigger amount noted below. As determined pursuant to the borrowing base formula for the European borrowers, the company's borrowing base including the period ending December 31, 2016 under the European Credit Facility of the Credit Agreement was approximately $18,604,000, with aggregate borrowing availability of approximately $12,229,000, considering the $3,000,000 minimum availability reserve and the $3,375,000 dominion trigger amount noted below. As of December 31, 2016, the combined aggregate borrowing availability under the U.S. and Canadian Credit Facility and the European Credit Facility of the Credit Agreement was $44,260,000. See Long-Term Debt in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more details regarding the Credit Agreement.\nAs a result of entering into the Credit Agreement, the company incurred $2,113,000 in fees, which were capitalized and are being amortized through January 16, 2021. In addition, as a result of terminating the previous credit agreement, which was scheduled to mature in October 2015, the company wrote-off $668,000 in previously capitalized fees in the first quarter of 2015, which is reflected in the expense of the North America / HME segment.\nAs of December 31, 2016, the company was in compliance with all covenant requirements under the Credit Agreement. The Credit Agreement contains customary representations, warranties and covenants including dominion triggers requiring the company to maintain borrowing capacity of not less than $11,250,000 on an given business day or $12,500,000 for five consecutive days related to the U.S. and Canadian borrowers, and $3,375,000 on an given business day or 12.5% of the maximum amount that may be drawn under the European Credit Facility for five consecutive days related to European borrowers, in order to avoid triggering full control by an agent for the lenders of the company's cash receipts for application to the company's obligations under the agreement.\nIf the company is unable to comply with the provisions in the Credit Agreement, it could result in a default, which could trigger acceleration of, or the right to accelerate, the related debt. Because of cross-default provisions in its agreements and instruments governing certain of the company's indebtedness, a default under the Credit Agreement could result in a default under, and the acceleration of, certain other company indebtedness. In addition, the company's lenders would be entitled to proceed against the collateral securing the indebtedness.\nBased on the company's current expectations, the company believes that its cash balances and available borrowing capacity under its Credit Agreement should be sufficient to meet working capital needs, capital requirements, and commitments for at least the next twelve months. Notwithstanding the company's expectations, if the company's operating results decline as the result of pressures on the business due to, for example, currency fluctuations or regulatory issues or the company's failure to execute its business plans, the company may be unable to comply with its obligations under the Credit Agreement, and its lenders could demand repayment of any amounts outstanding under the company's credit facilities.\nIn the first quarter of 2016, the company issued $150,000,000 aggregate principal amount of 2021 Notes in a private offering. The notes bear interest at a rate of 5.00% per year payable semi-annually and will mature in February 2021, unless repurchased or converted in accordance with their terms prior to such date. Prior to August 15, 2020, the notes will be convertible only upon satisfaction of certain conditions and during certain periods, and thereafter, at any time until the close of business on the second scheduled trading day immediately preceding the maturity date. Unless and until the company obtains shareholder approval under applicable New York Stock Exchange rules, the notes will be convertible, subject to certain conditions, into cash. If the company\nI-47\nobtains such shareholder approval, the notes may be settled in cash, the company's common shares or a combination of cash and the company's common shares, at the company's election.\nIn connection with the offering of the 2021 Notes, the company entered into privately negotiated convertible note hedge transactions with two financial institutions (the option counterparties\u201d). These transactions cover, subject to customary anti-dilution adjustments, the number of the company's common shares that will initially underlie the 2021 Notes, and are expected generally to reduce the potential equity dilution, and/or offset any cash payments in excess of the principal amount due, as the case may be, upon conversion of the 2021 Notes. The company entered into separate, privately negotiated warrant transactions with the option counterparties at a higher strike price relating to the same number of the company's common shares, subject to customary anti-dilution adjustments, pursuant to which the company sold warrants to the option counterparties. The warrants could have a dilutive effect on the company's outstanding common shares and the company's earnings per share to the extent that the price of the company's common shares exceeds the strike price of those warrants.\nThe initial net proceeds from the offering of the 2021 Notes were $144,034,000, after deducting fees and estimated offering expenses payable by the company. Approximately $5,000,000 of the net proceeds from the offering was used to repurchase the company's common shares, and $15,600,000 of the net proceeds was used to pay the net cost of the convertible note hedge and warrant transactions. The company incurred $5,966,000 in fees, which were capitalized and are being amortized as interest expense through February 2021, of which all $5,966,000 was paid by December 31, 2016. The company has used, and intends to continue to use the remaining net proceeds from the offering for working capital and general corporate purposes, which may include funding portions of the company's ongoing turnaround and addressing potential risks and contingencies. The net proceeds have allowed the company to invest in new products, people, marketing initiatives and working capital to transform the business and pursue growth.\nThe company also has an agreement with De Lage Landen, Inc. ( DLL\u201d), a third-party financing company, to provide lease financing to the company's U.S. customers. Either party could terminate this agreement with 180 days' notice or 90 days' notice by DLL upon the occurrence of certain events. Should this agreement be terminated, the company's borrowing needs under the Credit Agreement could increase.\nWhile there is general concern about the potential for rising interest rates, the company expects that it will be able to absorb modest rate increases in the months ahead without any material impact on its liquidity or capital resources. For 2016 and 2015, the weighted average interest rate on all borrowings, excluding capital leases, was 4.85% and 3.83%, respectively.\nCAPITAL EXPENDITURES\nThere were no individually material capital expenditure commitments outstanding as of December 31, 2016. The company estimates that capital investments for 2017 will be between $15,000,000 and $20,000,000 compared to actual capital expenditures of $10,151,000 in 2016. The anticipated increase relates primarily to the company's investments to transform the company. The company believes that its balances of cash and cash equivalents and existing borrowing facilities will be sufficient to meet its operating cash requirements and fund required capital expenditures (see \"Liquidity and Capital Resources\"). The Credit Agreement limits the company's annual capital expenditures to $35,000,000.\nCASH FLOWS\nCash flows used by operating activities were $56,613,000 in 2016, compared to cash used of $5,378,000 in the previous year. The 2016 operating cash flows were negatively impacted by net loss, declines in accrued expenses, including tax payments of approximately $12,500,000 related to a previously disclosed liability for uncertain tax positions and current taxes, and accounts payable as well as increased inventory. Operating cash flows in 2016 were positively impacted by a reduction in accounts receivable. Operating cash flows in 2015 were negatively impacted by retirement payments of $24,651,000 related to the retirement of two executive officers of the company.\nCash flows provided by investing activities were $3,649,000 in 2016, compared to $44,376,000 in 2015. Cash flows provided by investing activities in 2016 included net proceeds of $13,829,000 from the sale of GCM. Cash flows provided by investing activities in 2015 included the receipt of $23,000,000 in proceeds from the company's real estate sale leaseback transaction, surrender of corporate-owned life insurance of $11,902,000 to fund payments in 2015 related to the retirement of certain executive officers of the company in 2014 and net proceeds of $13,700,000 from the sale of its rental businesses in July 2015.\nCash flows provided by financing activities in 2016 were $118,549,000 compared to cash flows used of $14,346,000 in 2015. Cash flows provided in 2016 reflect net proceeds received as a result of the issuance of the 2021 Notes, including the net proceeds used for the related convertible note hedge transactions, repurchase of common shares and payment of financing costs.\nI-48\nDuring 2016, free cash flow was negative $66,722,000 compared to free cash flow generation of $10,217,000 in 2015. In 2016 and 2015, free cash flow was negatively impacted by the same items that affected cash flows used by operation activities. In addition, free cash flow in 2015 included a positive free cash flow impact of $23,000,000 as a result of the proceeds from the company's real estate sale leaseback transaction. Excluding the negative impact of $12,500,000 in tax payments, free cash flow in 2016 was negative $54,222,000. Excluding the $23,000,000 positive impact of the real estate sale and leaseback transaction and the $24,651,000 negative impact of the retirement payments noted above, free cash flow in 2015 was positive $11,868,000. Free cash flow is a non-GAAP financial measure that is comprised of net cash used by operating activities less purchases of property and equipment plus proceeds from sales of property and equipment. Management believes that this financial measure provides meaningful information for evaluating the overall financial performance of the company and its ability to repay debt or make future investments (including acquisitions, etc.). The non-GAAP financial measure is reconciled to the GAAP measure as follows (in thousands):\nTable 74: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Twelve Months Ended\nDecember 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash provided by operating activities\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(56,613\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(5,378\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Sales of property and equipment\n</td> <td>42\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>23,117\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Less: Purchases of property and equipment-net\n</td> <td>(10,151\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(7,522\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Free Cash Flow\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(66,722\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>10,217\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nBUSINESS SEGMENT NET SALES\nThe following tables provide net sales change for continuing operations as reported and as adjusted to exclude the impact of foreign exchange translation (constant currency net sales) as well as net sales further adjusted to exclude the impact of the sale of GCM on September 30, 2016 and the sale of the rentals businesses in July 2015, neither of which were deemed discontinued operations for financial reporting purposes. Constant currency net sales\" is a non-GAAP financial measure, which is defined as net sales excluding the impact of foreign currency translation. The current year's functional constant currency net sales are translated using the prior year's foreign exchange rates. These amounts are then compared to the prior year's sales to calculate the constant currency net sales change. Management believes that this financial measure provides meaningful information for evaluating the core operating performance of the company.\nI-49\nTwelve months ended December 31, 2016 compared to

timing of any other payments. See Income Taxes in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this report.\nDIVIDEND POLICY\nIt is the company's policy to pay a nominal dividend in order for its stock to be more attractive to a broader range of investors. For 2016, annualized dividends of $0.05 per Common Share and $0.045 per Class B Common Share were declared and paid. It is not anticipated that this annual dividend rate will change materially as the company believes that capital should be kept available for investments and growth opportunities as a result of its multi-year turnaround strategy.\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES\nThe Consolidated Financial Statements included in the report include accounts of the company and all majority-owned subsidiaries. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires management to make estimates and assumptions in certain circumstances that affect amounts reported in the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements and related footnotes. In preparing the financial statements, management has made its best estimates and judgments of certain amounts included in the financial statements, giving due consideration to materiality. However, application of these accounting policies involves the exercise of judgment and use of assumptions as to future uncertainties and, as a result, actual results could differ from these estimates.\nThe following critical accounting policies, among others, affect the more significant judgments and estimates used in preparation of the company's consolidated financial statements.\nRevenue Recognition\nInvacare's revenues are recognized when products are shipped or services provided to unaffiliated customers. Revenue Recognition, ASC 605, provides guidance on the application of generally accepted accounting principles to selected revenue recognition issues. The company has concluded that its revenue recognition policy is appropriate and in accordance with GAAP and ASC 605. Shipping and handling costs are included in cost of goods sold.\nSales are made only to customers with whom the company believes collection is reasonably assured based upon a credit analysis, which may include obtaining a credit application, a signed security agreement, personal guarantee and/or a cross corporate guarantee depending on the credit history of the customer. Credit lines are established for new customers after an evaluation of their credit report and/or other relevant financial information. Existing credit lines are regularly reviewed and adjusted with consideration given to any outstanding past due amounts.\nI-51\nThe company offers discounts and rebates, which are accounted for as reductions to revenue in the period in which the sale is recognized. Discounts offered include: cash discounts for prompt payment, base and trade discounts based on contract level for specific classes of customers. Volume discounts and rebates are given based on large purchases and the achievement of certain sales volumes. Product returns are accounted for as a reduction to reported sales with estimates recorded for anticipated returns at the time of sale. The company does not ship any goods on consignment.\nDistributed products sold by the company are accounted for in accordance with the revenue recognition guidance in ASC 605-45-05. The company records distributed product sales gross as a principal since the company takes title to the products and has the risks of loss for collections, delivery and returns.\nProduct sales that give rise to installment receivables are recorded at the time of sale when the risks and rewards of ownership are transferred. Interest income is recognized on installment agreements in accordance with the terms of the agreements. Installment accounts are monitored and if a customer defaults on payments, interest income is no longer recognized. All installment accounts are accounted for using the same methodology, regardless of duration of the installment agreements.\nAllowance for Uncollectible Accounts Receivable\nThe estimated allowance for uncollectible amounts is based primarily on management's evaluation of the financial condition of the customer. In addition, as a result of the third party financing arrangement, management monitors the collection status of these contracts in accordance with the company's limited recourse obligations and provides amounts necessary for estimated losses in the allowance for doubtful accounts and establishing reserves for specific customers as needed.\nThe company continues to closely monitor the credit-worthiness of its customers and adhere to tight credit policies. In 2013, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services announced new Medicare prices which became effective in July 2013 for the second round of the NCB program, which was expanded to include 91 additional MSAs. In January 2016, CMS began expanding NCB to rural areas which expanded the program to 100% of the Medicare population. While the current NCB program contract pricing continues through the end of 2018, the company believes the changes could have a significant impact on the collectability of accounts receivable for those customers which are in the rural locations impacted and which have a portion of their revenues tied to Medicare reimbursement. In addition, there is a risk that these precedent-setting price reductions could influence other non-CMS payors' reimbursement rates for the same product categories. As a result, this is an additional risk factor which the company considers when assessing the collectability of accounts receivable.\nThe company has an agreement with DLL, a third-party financing company, to provide lease financing to Invacare's U.S. customers. The DLL agreement provides for direct leasing between DLL and the Invacare customer. The company retains a recourse obligation for events of default under the contracts. The company monitors the collections status of these contracts and has provided amounts for estimated losses in its allowances for doubtful accounts.\nInventories and Related Allowance for Obsolete and Excess Inventory\nInventories are stated at the lower of cost or market with cost determined by the first-in, first-out method. Inventories have been reduced by an allowance for excess and obsolete inventories. The estimated allowance is based on management's review of inventories on hand compared to estimated future usage and sales. A provision for excess and obsolete inventory is recorded as needed based upon the discontinuation of products, redesigning of existing products, new product introductions, market changes and safety issues. Both raw materials and finished goods are reserved for on the balance sheet.\nIn general, Invacare reviews inventory turns as an indicator of obsolescence or slow moving product as well as the impact of new product introductions. Depending on the situation, the company may partially or fully reserve for the individual item. The company continues to increase its overseas sourcing efforts, increase its emphasis on the development and introduction of new products, and decrease the cycle time to bring new product offerings to market. These initiatives are potential sources of inventory obsolescence for both raw material and finished goods.\nGoodwill, Intangible and Other Long-Lived Assets\nProperty, equipment, intangibles and certain other long-lived assets are amortized over their useful lives. Useful lives are based on management's estimates of the period that the assets will generate revenue. Under Intangibles-Goodwill and Other, ASC 350, goodwill and intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives are subject to annual impairment tests. The company's measurement date for its annual goodwill impairment test is October 1 and the analysis is completed in the fourth quarter. Furthermore, goodwill and other long-lived assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances\nI-52\nindicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. The majority of the company's goodwill and intangible assets relate to the company's Europe and IPG segments which were profitable in 2016.\nTo review goodwill for impairment in accordance with ASC 350, the company first estimates the fair value of each reporting unit and compares the calculated fair value to the carrying value of each reporting unit. A reporting unit is defined as an operating segment or one level below. The company has determined that its reporting units are the same as its operating segments. The company completes its annual impairment tests in the fourth quarter of each year. To estimate the fair values of the reporting units, the company utilizes a discounted cash flow (DCF) method in which the company forecasts income statement and balance sheet amounts based on assumptions regarding future sales growth, profitability, inventory turns, days' sales outstanding, etc. to forecast future cash flows. The cash flows are discounted using a weighted average cost of capital discount rate where the cost of debt is based on quoted rates for 20-year debt of companies of similar credit risk and the cost of equity is based upon the 20-year treasury rate for the risk-free rate, a market risk premium, the industry average beta and a small cap stock adjustment. The discount rates used have a significant impact upon the discounted cash flow methodology utilized in the company's annual impairment testing as higher discount rates decrease the fair value estimates. The assumptions used are based on a market participant's point of view and yielded a discount rate of 8.67% in 2016 for the company's annual impairment analysis compared to 9.41% in 2015 and 9.89% in 2014.\nThe company also utilizes an Enterprise Value (EV) to Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization (EBITDA) Method to compute the fair value of its reporting units which considers potential acquirers and their EV to EBITDA multiples adjusted by an estimated premium. While more weight is given to the discounted cash flow method, the EV to EBITDA method does provide corroborative evidence of the reasonableness of the discounted cash flow method results.\nIn 2016, 2015 and 2014, the company performed a review for potential impairments of any other assets, including the company's Taylor Street facility which is subject to the FDA consent decree that limits the company's manufacture and distribution of custom power and manual wheelchairs, wheelchair components and wheelchair subassemblies at the Taylor Street facility. The company determined there was no impairment of the property, plant and equipment of the Taylor Street facility based on a comparison of the forecasted undiscounted cash flows to the carrying value of the net assets in accordance with ASC 360. In addition, the company determined there was no impairment of inventory associated with the facility.\nWhile there was no indication of impairment in 2016 related to goodwill for the Europe or IPG segments, a future potential impairment is possible for any of the company's segments should actual results differ materially from forecasted results used in the valuation analysis. Furthermore, the company's annual valuation of goodwill can differ materially if the market inputs used to determine the discount rate change significantly. For instance, higher interest rates or greater stock price volatility would increase the discount rate and thus increase the chance of impairment. In consideration of this potential, the company reviewed the results if the discount rate used were 100 basis points higher for the 2016 impairment analysis and determined that there still would not be any indicator of potential impairment for the segments with goodwill which are Europe and IPG.\nThe company's intangible assets consist of intangible assets with defined lives as well as intangible assets with indefinite lives. Defined-lived intangible assets consist principally of customer lists, developed technology, license agreements, patents and other miscellaneous intangibles such as non-compete agreements. The company's indefinite lived intangible assets consist entirely of trademarks.\nThe company evaluates the carrying value of definite-lived assets whenever events or circumstances indicate possible impairment. Definite-lived assets are determined to be impaired if the future un-discounted cash flows expected to be generated by the asset are less than the carrying value. Actual impairment amounts for definite-lived assets are then calculated using a discounted cash flow calculation. The company reviews indefinite-lived assets for impairment annually in the fourth quarter of each year and whenever events or circumstances indicate possible impairment. Any impairment amounts for indefinite-lived assets are calculated as the difference between the future discounted cash flows expected to be generated by the asset less than the carrying value for the asset.\nDuring 2014, the company recognized intangible write-down charges in the IPG segment of $13,041,000 comprised of a customer list impairment of $12,826,000 and a non-compete agreement of $215,000 as the actual and remaining cash flows associated with the intangibles were less than the cash flows originally used to value the intangibles, primarily driven by reduced net sales. The after-tax and pre-tax impairment amounts were the same for each of the above impairments. The fair value of the customer list was calculated using an excess earnings method, using a discounted cash flow model. Estimated cash flow returns to the customer relationship were reduced by the cash flows required to satisfy the return requirements of each of the assets employed with the residual cash flow then discounted to value the customer relationship. The write-down charges were the result of decisions to exit certain businesses as well as lower than anticipated sales.\nI-53\nProduct Liability\nThe company is self-insured in North America for product liability exposures through its captive insurance company, Invatection Insurance Company, which currently has a policy year that runs from September 1 to August 31 and insures annual policy losses up to $10,000,000 per occurrence and $13,000,000 in the aggregate. The company also has additional layers of external insurance coverage, related to all lines of insurance coverage, insuring up to $75,000,000 in aggregate losses per policy year arising from individual claims anywhere in the world that exceed the captive insurance company policy limits or the limits of the company's per country foreign liability limits, as applicable. There can be no assurance that Invacare's current insurance levels will continue to be adequate or available at affordable rates.\nProduct liability reserves are recorded for individual claims based upon historical experience, industry expertise and other indicators. Additional reserves, in excess of the specific individual case reserves, are provided for incurred but not reported claims based upon actuarial valuations at the time such valuations are conducted. Historical claims experience and other assumptions are taken into consideration by the company in estimating the ultimate reserves. For example, the actuarial analysis assumes that historical loss experience is an indicator of future experience, that the distribution of exposures by geographic area and nature of operations for ongoing operations is expected to be very similar to historical operations with no dramatic changes and that the government indices used to trend losses and exposures are appropriate. Estimates made are adjusted on a regular basis and can be impacted by actual loss awards and settlements on claims. While actuarial analysis is used to help determine adequate reserves, the company is responsible for the determination and recording of adequate reserves in accordance with accepted loss reserving standards and practices.\nWarranty\nGenerally, the company's products are covered by warranties against defects in material and workmanship for various periods depending on the product from the date of sale to the customer. Certain components carry a lifetime warranty. A provision for estimated warranty cost is recorded at the time of sale based upon actual experience. The company continuously assesses the adequacy of its product warranty accrual and makes adjustments as needed. Historical analysis is primarily used to determine the company's warranty reserves. Claims history is reviewed and provisions are adjusted as needed. However, the company does consider other events, such as a product recall, which could warrant additional warranty reserve provision. See Accrued Expenses in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a reconciliation of the changes in the warranty accrual.\nAccounting for Stock-Based Compensation\nThe company accounts for share based compensation under the provisions of Compensation-Stock Compensation, ASC 718. The company has not made any modifications to the terms of any previously granted options and no changes have been made regarding the valuation methodologies or assumptions used to determine the fair value of options granted and the company continues to use a Black-Scholes valuation model. As of December 31, 2016, there was $12,049,000 of total unrecognized compensation cost from stock-based compensation arrangements, which is related to non-vested options and shares, and includes $8,740,000 related to restricted stock awards, $3,134,000 related to performance awards and $175,000 related to non-qualified stock options.\nThe substantial majority of the options awarded have been granted at exercise prices equal to the market value of the underlying stock on the date of grant. Restricted stock awards granted without cost to the recipients are expensed on a straight-line basis over the vesting periods. Performance awards granted are expensed based on estimated achievement of the performance objectives over the relevant performance award periods.\nIncome Taxes\nAs part of the process of preparing its financial statements, the company is required to estimate income taxes in various jurisdictions. The process requires estimating the company's current tax liability, including assessing uncertainties related to tax return filing positions, as well as estimating temporary differences due to the different treatment of items for tax and accounting policies. The temporary differences are reported as deferred tax assets and or liabilities. The company also must estimate whether it will more likely than not realize its deferred tax assets and whether a valuation allowance should be established. Substantially all of the company's U.S., Australia, Switzerland and New Zealand deferred tax assets are offset by a valuation allowance. In the event that actual results differ from its estimates, the company's provision for income taxes could be materially impacted. The company does not believe that there is a substantial likelihood that materially different amounts would be reported related to its critical accounting policies.\nI-54\nAccounting for Convertible Debt and Related Derivatives\nIn the first quarter of 2016, the company issued $150,000,000 aggregate principal amount of the 2021 Notes. In connection with the offering of the 2021 Notes, the company entered into privately negotiated convertible note hedge transactions with two option counterparties. These transactions cover, subject to customary anti-dilution adjustments, the number of the company's common shares that will initially underlie the 2021 Notes, and are expected generally to reduce the potential equity dilution, and/or offset any cash payments in excess of the principal amount due, as the case may be, upon conversion of the 2021 Notes. The company entered into separate, privately negotiated warrant transactions with the option counterparties at a higher strike price relating to the same number of the company's common shares, subject to customary anti-dilution adjustments, pursuant to which the company sold warrants to the option counterparties. The warrants could have a dilutive effect on the company's outstanding common shares and the company's earnings per share to the extent that the price of the company's common shares exceeds the strike price of those warrants. The strike price of the warrants will initially be $22.4175 per share and is subject to certain adjustments under the terms of the warrant transactions.\nThe convertible debt conversion liability and the convertible note hedges are accounted for as derivatives that are fair valued quarterly while the warrants are included as equity. The fair value of the convertible debt conversion liability and the convertible note hedges are estimated using a lattice model incorporating the terms and conditions of the notes and considering, for example, changes in the prices of the company's common shares, company stock price volatility, risk-free rates and changes in market rates. The valuations are, among other things, subject to changes in both the company's credit worthiness and the counter-parties to the instruments as well as change in general market conditions. While the change in fair value of the convertible debt conversion liability and the convertible note hedges are generally expected to move in opposite directions, the net change in any given period may be material.\nRECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS\nFor the company's disclosure regarding recently issued accounting pronouncements, see Accounting Policies - Recent Accounting Pronouncements in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.", "item_7_truncated": "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nOVERVIEW\nManagement's discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes that appear elsewhere in this annual report on Form 10-K.\nInvacare is a multi-national company with integrated capabilities to design, produce and distribute durable medical equipment. The company makes products that help people move, breathe, rest and perform essential hygiene, and with those products the company supports people with congenital, acquired and degenerative conditions. The company's products and solutions are important parts of care for people with a range of challenges, from those who are active and heading to work or school each day and may need additional mobility or respiratory support, to those who are cared for in residential care settings, at home and in rehabilitation centers. The company operates in facilities in North America, Europe and Asia/Pacific, which are the result of dozens of acquisitions made over the company's nearly forty-year history. Some of these acquisitions have been combined into integrated operating units, while others remain relatively independent.\nStrategy\nThe company had a strategy to be a leading provider of durable medical equipment to providers in global markets by providing the broadest portfolio available. This strategy has not kept pace with certain reimbursement changes, competitive dynamics and company-specific challenges. Since 2015, the company has made a major shift in its strategy. The company has since been aligning its resources to produce products and solutions that assist customers and end-users with their most clinically complex needs. By focusing the company's efforts to provide the best possible assistance and outcomes to the people and caregivers who use its products, the company aims to improve its financial condition for sustainable profit and growth. To execute this transformation, the company is undertaking a substantial three-phase multi-year transformation plan.\nTransformation\nThe company is executing a multi-year transformation to shift to its new strategy. This is expected to yield better financial results from the application of the company's resources to products and solutions that provide greater healthcare value in clinically complex rehabilitation and post-acute care. The transformation is divided into the following three phases:\nPhase One - Assess and Reorient\n \u2022 Increase commercial effectiveness; \n \u2022 Shift and narrow the product portfolio; \n \u2022 Align innovation resources to clinically complex solutions; \n \u2022 Accelerate quality efforts with culture of quality excellence; and \n \u2022 Develop and expand talent. \nPhase Two - Build and Align\n \u2022 Leverage commercial improvements; \n \u2022 Optimize the business for cost and efficiency; \n \u2022 Continue to improve quality systems; \n \u2022 Launch new clinical product platforms; and \n \u2022 Expand talent management and culture. \nPhase Three - Grow\n \u2022 Lead in quality culture and operations excellence; and \n \u2022 Grow above market. \nIn 2016, the company made significant progress on its Phase One work, most notably in North America, where some of the greatest improvement is needed. As expected, the 2016 financial results show the near-term impact of investments in commercial resources, new product development, and quality systems, ahead of accretion. The company will continue to make significant investments in this transformation, reduce sales in certain areas, refocus resources away from less accretive activities, and look at its global infrastructure for opportunities to drive efficiency. Phase One investments are in the early phases of providing returns.\nI-39\nThe company expects to begin seeing some results later in 2017 and more substantive results in 2018. In the meantime, the company has begun taking early Phase Two actions to streamline operations, resize and reshape the organization, especially in North America, around its new business mix and size. By executing this strategy and making these operational improvements, the company expects long-term benefits for the company's constituents.\nFavorable Long-term Demand\nUltimately, demand for the company's products and services is based on the need to provide care for people with certain conditions. The company's medical devices provide solutions for end-users and caregivers. Therefore, the demand for the company's medical equipment is largely driven by population growth and the incidence of certain conditions where treatment may be supplemented by the company's devices. The company also provides solutions to help equipment providers and residential care operators deliver cost-effective and high-quality care. The company believes that its commercial team, customer relationships, products and solutions, supply chain infrastructure, and strong research and development pipeline will create favorable business potential.\nDISCONTINUED AND DIVESTED OPERATIONS\nOn August 29, 2014, the company sold Altimate Medical, Inc. (Altimate), its manufacturer of stationary standing assistive devices for use in patient rehabilitation, to REP Acquisition Corporation for $23,000,000 in cash, which was subject to final post-closing adjustments. Altimate had been operated on a stand-alone basis and reported as part of the North America/HME segment of the company. The company recorded a gain of $17,069,000 pre-tax in the third quarter of 2014, which represented the excess of the net sales price over the book value of the assets and liabilities of Altimate. The sale of this business was dilutive to the company's results. The company utilized the proceeds from the sale to reduce debt outstanding under its revolving credit facility in the third quarter of 2014. The gain recorded by the company reflects the company's estimated final purchase adjustments.\nIn 2014, the net sales of the Altimate discontinued operations were $11,778,000 and earnings before income taxes were $2,796,000. Results for Altimate include an interest expense allocation from continuing operations to discontinued operations of $202,000 in 2014 as proceeds from the sale were required to be utilized to pay down debt. The interest allocation was based on the net proceeds assumed to pay down debt applying the company's average interest rates for the periods presented. The company has classified Altimate as a discontinued operation for all periods presented.\nThe company recorded total expenses related to all of its discontinued operations since 2012 of $8,801,000, of which $8,405,000 were paid as of December 31, 2016. The company recorded an incremental intra-period tax allocation expense to discontinued operations for 2015 and 2014 representing the cumulative intra-period allocation expense to discontinued operations based on the company's domestic taxable loss related to continuing operations for 2015 and 2014.\nOn July 2, 2015, the company sold its rentals businesses to Joerns Healthcare Parent, LLC, for approximately $15,500,000 in cash, which was subject to final post-closing adjustments. The rentals businesses had been operated on a stand-alone basis and reported as part of the IPG segment of the company. The company recorded a pre-tax gain of approximately $24,000 in the third quarter of 2015, which represented the excess of the net sales price over the book value of the assets and liabilities of the rentals businesses, as of the date of completion of the disposition. The company recorded expenses related to the sale of the rentals businesses totaling $1,792,000, of which $1,265,000 have been paid as of December 31, 2016. The sale of the rentals businesses was not dilutive to the company's results. The company utilized the net proceeds from the sale to reduce debt outstanding under its credit agreement. The company determined that the sale of the rentals businesses did not meet the criteria for classification as a discontinued operation in accordance with ASU 2014-08. The rentals businesses were treated as held for sale as of June 30, 2015 until sold on July 2, 2015. As such, the results of the rentals businesses are included in the Results from Continuing Operations discussion below.\nOn September 30, 2016, the company, completed the sale of GCM to Compass Health Brands Corp., for approximately $13,829,000 in cash, which is subject to final post-closing adjustments. The net proceeds from the transaction were $12,729,000, net of expenses. The company recorded a pre-tax gain of $7,386,000 in the third quarter of 2016, which represented the excess of the net sales price over the book value of the assets and liabilities of GCM. The company recorded expenses related to the sale of GCM totaling $1,100,000, of which $230,000 has been paid out as of December 31, 2016. The sale of GCM was dilutive to the company's results. The company utilized the net proceeds to fund operations. The company determined that the sale of GCM did not meet the criteria for classification as a discontinued operation in accordance with ASU 2014-08 but the \"held for sale\" criteria of ASC 360-10-45-9 were met and thus GCM was treated as held for sale for purposes of the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets as of December 31, 2015. As such, the results of the rentals businesses are included in the Results from Continuing Operations discussion below.\nI-40\nRESULTS OF CONTINUING OPERATIONS\n2016 Versus 2015\nNet Sales. Consolidated net sales for 2016 decreased 8.3% for the year, to $1,047,474,000 from $1,142,338,000 in 2015. Foreign currency translation decreased net sales by 1.6 percentage points. Constant currency net sales decreased 6.7% compared to 2015. Higher constant currency net sales in the Europe and Asia/Pacific segments were offset by lower constant currency net sales in the North America/HME and IPG segments. Constant currency net sales for the company, excluding the impact of all the divested businesses (GCM and rentals businesses), decreased 4.9% compared to 2015. Constant currency net sales is a non-GAAP financial measure - see \"Business Segment Net Sales\" on page I-49.\nEurope\nEuropean net sales increased 0.7% in 2016 compared to the prior year to $540,013,000 from $536,463,000 as foreign currency translation decreased net sales by 3.0 percentage points. Constant currency net sales increased 3.7% compared to 2015. The improvements in constant currency net sales were driven by increased sales of mobility and seating and lifestyle products. Changes in exchange rates have had, and may continue to have, a significant impact on sales in this segment.\nNorth America/Home Medical Equipment (North America/HME)\nNorth America/HME net sales decreased 16.1% in 2016 versus the prior year to $397,702,000 from $474,196,000 with foreign currency translation decreasing net sales by 0.2 of a percentage point. Constant currency net sales decreased 15.9% compared to the prior year. Excluding the net sales impact of the divested GCM business, reported net sales decreased by 15.5% and by 15.3% on a constant currency basis. The decreases in constant currency net sales were primarily driven by reduced sales of lifestyle and respiratory products while mobility and seating declined slightly.\nInstitutional Products Group (IPG)\nIPG net sales decreased 26.1% in 2016 over the prior year to $64,413,000 from $87,137,000 as foreign currency translation decreased sales by 0.2 of a percentage point. Excluding the net sales impact of the divested rentals businesses, reported net sales decreased by 11.5% and by 11.3% on a constant currency basis. The decreases in constant currency net sales of the non-rentals businesses were driven by sales declines in all major product categories.\nAsia/Pacific\nAsia/Pacific net sales increased 1.8% in 2016 from the prior year to $45,346,000 from $44,542,000. Foreign currency translation decreased net sales by 1.7 percentage points. Constant currency net sales increased 3.5% compared to 2015 due to net sales increases in the Australia and New Zealand distribution businesses and at the company's subsidiary that produces microprocessor controllers. Changes in exchange rates, particularly with the euro and U.S. dollar, have had, and may continue to have, a significant impact on sales in this segment.\nGross Profit. Consolidated gross profit as a percentage of net sales was 27.1% in 2016 as compared to 27.4% in 2015. Excluding the impact of all the divested businesses, gross margin as a percentage of net sales for 2016 increased by 0.2 of a percentage point as compared to 2015 driven by favorable sales mix principally offset by increased warranty expense. Gross margin as a percentage of net sales increased for the North America/HME and Asia/Pacific segments with declines in the Europe and IPG segments. Gross profit dollars declined in all segments, except for Asia/Pacific, with the largest declines in North America/HME and IPG. The decline in IPG was primarily impacted by the sale of the rentals businesses in 2015.\nGross profit in Europe as a percentage of net sales decreased 0.5 of a percentage point in 2016 from the prior year and gross margin dollars decreased by $1,721,000. The decrease in margin was principally due to unfavorable foreign currency, pricing, warranty and R&D expense. Incremental warranty recall expense of $1,490,000 was recorded in 2016 for a component of a lifestyles product.\nNorth America/HME gross profit as a percentage of net sales increased by 0.4 of a percentage point in 2016 from the prior year while gross margin dollars decreased by $14,106,000 driven by net sales declines and increased warranty expense. The 2016 gross margin reflects warranty recall expense of $1,366,000, or 0.3 of a percentage point, for a recall which was related to a component on a lifestyles product. In comparison, warranty recall expense reversals of $2,325,000, or 0.5 of a percentage point, were recorded in 2015.\nI-41\nIPG gross profit as a percentage of net sales decreased 9.9 percentage points in 2016 from the prior year and gross margin dollars decreased $14,090,000. The decrease in margin was primarily attributable to the sale of the rentals businesses ($11,359,000 or 8.5 percentage points) and to a lesser extent unfavorable sales mix and increased warranty expense.\nGross profit in Asia/Pacific as a percentage of net sales increased 1.8 percentage points in 2016 from the prior year and gross margin dollars increased $1,038,000. The increase was primarily related to favorable sales mix and reduced manufacturing costs, which were partially offset by R&D expense.\nSee Accrued Expenses\u201d in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this report for the total warranty provision amounts and a reconciliation of the changes in the warranty accrual.\nSelling, General and Administrative. Consolidated selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses as a percentage of net sales were 29.0% in 2016 and 27.9% in 2015. The overall dollar decrease was $14,865,000, or 4.7%, with foreign currency translation decreasing expense by $4,226,000 or 1.4 percentage points. Excluding the impact of foreign currency translation, SG&A expenses decreased $10,639,000, or 3.3%. Excluding the impacts of all the divested businesses and foreign currency translation, SG&A expense increased $2,212,000, or 0.7%, compared to 2015, primarily related to increased product liability and employment costs. The SG&A expense in 2015 included a write-off of costs related to a canceled legacy software program based on a change in the North America/HME IT strategy.\nEuropean SG&A expenses increased by 3.5%, or $4,079,000, in 2016 compared to 2015. Foreign currency translation decreased expense by approximately $3,224,000 or 2.7 percentage points. Excluding the foreign currency translation impact, SG&A expenses increased by $7,303,000, or 6.2%, principally related to increased employment costs.\nSG&A expenses for North America/HME decreased 4.0%, or $5,603,000, in 2016 compared to 2015 with foreign currency translation decreasing expense by $722,000 or 0.5 of a percentage point. Excluding the foreign currency translation, SG&A expense decreased $4,881,000, or 3.5%, principally as a result of reduced regulatory costs in 2016, a $4,031,000 2015 write-off of costs for a canceled legacy software program, and a reduction in expense in 2016 resulting from the GCM divestiture.\nSG&A expenses for IPG decreased by 50.7%, or $11,949,000, in 2016 compared to 2015. Excluding the impact of foreign currency translation, SG&A expenses decreased by $11,927,000, or 50.6%, primarily related to a reduction in expense for the rentals business divestiture ($11,239,000) and employment costs.\nAsia/Pacific SG&A expenses decreased 6.1%, or $1,018,000, in 2016 compared to 2015. Foreign currency translation decreased expense by $258,000 or 1.6 percentage points. Excluding the foreign currency translation impact, SG&A expenses decreased $760,000, or 4.5%, principally as a result of favorable foreign currency transactions and reduced employment costs.\nSG&A expenses related to the Other Segment decreased by 1.8% or $374,000 in 2016 as compared to 2015 primarily related to decreased legal expense in 2016.\nGain on Sale of Business. As a result of the sale of GCM on September 30, 2016, the company recorded a gain in 2016 of $7,386,000 on the sale, which represents the excess of the net sales price over the book value of the net assets of GCM. As a result of the sale of the rentals business on July 2, 2015, the company recorded a gain of $24,000 in 2015, which represented the excess of the net sales price over the book value of the assets and liabilities of the rentals businesses.\nCharge Related to Restructuring Activities. The company's restructuring charges were necessitated primarily by continued declines in Medicare and Medicaid reimbursement by the U.S. government, as well as similar healthcare reimbursement pressures abroad, which negatively affect the company's customers (e.g. home health care providers) and continued pricing pressures faced by the company as a result of outsourcing by competitors to lower cost locations. Restructuring decisions were also the result of reduced profitability in the North America/HME and Asia/Pacific segments impacted by the FDA consent decree. In addition, as a result of the company's transformation strategy, additional restructuring charges were incurred during 2016 and are expected to continue into 2017. While the company's restructuring efforts have been executed on a timely basis, and have resulted in operating cost savings, the savings have been more than offset by the general business decline, higher regulatory and compliance costs related to quality system improvements, and more recently, investments as a result of the company's transformation strategy and higher interest expense. The company expects any near-term cost savings from restructuring will be offset by other costs as a result of the company's transformation strategy and other pressures on the business.\nCharges for the year ended December 31, 2016 totaled $2,447,000 which were related to North America/HME segment ($2,347,000) and the Asia/Pacific segment ($100,000). In North America/HME, costs were incurred related to severance ($1,862,000) and lease termination costs ($485,000). The Asia/Pacific charges were for severance costs. The savings from these\nI-42\ncharges will be reflected primarily in reduced selling, general and administrative expenses and manufacturing expenses for the company. Payments for the year ended December 31, 2016 were $2,992,000 and the cash payments were funded with company's cash on hand. The majority of the 2016 charges are expected to be paid out within twelve months.\nCharges for the year ended December 31, 2015 totaled $1,971,000 including charges for severance ($1,678,000) and charges principally related to a building lease termination primarily in the North America/HME segment ($293,000). Severance charges were incurred in the North America/HME segment ($1,069,000), Europe segment ($510,000), IPG segment ($73,000) and Asia/Pacific segment ($26,000) related to the elimination of certain positions as a result of general restructuring efforts. The savings from these charges have been reflected primarily in reduced selling, general and administrative expenses and manufacturing expenses for the company. Payments for the year ended December 31, 2015 were $3,723,000 and were funded with operating cash flows and cash on hand. The 2015 charges have been paid out.\nTo date, the company's liquidity has not been materially impacted; however, the company's disclosure below in Liquidity and Capital Resources highlights risks that could negatively impact the company's liquidity. See also \"Charges Related to Restructuring Activities\" in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nAsset write-downs to intangible assets. In accordance with ASC 350, Intangibles - Goodwill and Other, the company reviews intangibles for impairment. As a result of the company's 2016 and 2015 intangible reviews, the company did not recognize any intangible write-down charges.\nNet Gain on Convertible Debt Derivatives. For 2016, the company recognized a loss of $2,504,000 related to the convertible note hedge derivative long-term asset and recognized a gain of $3,772,000 related to the convertible debt conversion liability derivative which resulted in a net gain of $1,268,000 related to the fair value of the convertible debt derivatives. See \"Long-Term Debt\" in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this report for more detail.\nInterest. Interest expense increased to $15,875,000 in 2016 from $4,136,000 in 2015, representing a 283.8% increase. This increase was due to the convertible debt issuance in the first quarter of 2016 and, to a lesser extent, capital lease interest expense as a result of the real estate sale and leaseback transaction completed during the second quarter of 2015. Interest income in 2016 was $265,000, as compared to $165,000 in 2015.\nIncome Taxes. The company had an effective tax rate of 45.0% in 2016 compared to an expected benefit of 35% on the continuing operations pre-tax loss and an effective tax rate of 125.3% in 2015 compared to an expected benefit of 35% on the pre-tax loss from continuing operations. The company's effective tax rates in 2016 and 2015 both were unfavorable to the expected U.S. federal statutory rate benefit for those years due to the negative impact of the company not being able to record tax benefits related to losses in those countries which had tax valuation allowances for the year, which more than offset the benefit of foreign income taxed at rates below the U.S. statutory rate. See Income Taxes\u201d in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this report for more detail.\nResearch and Development. The company continued to invest in research and development activities in 2016. The company dedicated funds to applied research activities to ensure that new and enhanced design concepts are available to its businesses. Research and development expenditures, which are included in costs of products sold, decreased to $17,123,000 in 2016 from $18,677,000 in 2015. The expenditures, as a percentage of net sales, were 1.6% and 1.6% in 2016 and 2015, respectively.\n2015 Versus 2014\nNet Sales. Consolidated net sales for 2015 decreased 10.1% for the year, to $1,142,338,000 from $1,270,163,000 in 2014. Foreign currency translation decreased net sales by 8.7 percentage points. Constant currency net sales decreased 1.4% compared to 2014. Higher constant currency net sales in the Europe and Asia/Pacific segments were offset by lower constant currency net sales in the North America/HME and IPG segments. Constant currency net sales for the company, excluding the impact of the divested rentals businesses in the IPG segment, were flat for the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to the prior year. Constant currency net sales is a non-GAAP financial measure - see \"Business Segment Net Sales\" on page I-49.\nEurope\nEuropean net sales decreased 12.1% in 2015 compared to the prior year to $536,463,000 from $610,555,000 as foreign currency translation decreased net sales by 15.6 percentage points. Constant currency net sales increased 3.5% compared to 2014 principally due to increases in sales of mobility and seating, respiratory and lifestyle products.\nI-43\nNorth America/Home Medical Equipment (North America/HME)\nNorth America/HME net sales decreased 6.6% in 2015 versus the prior year to $474,196,000 from $507,867,000, with foreign currency translation decreasing net sales by 1.0 percentage point. Constant currency net sales decreased 5.6% compared to the prior year, as increases in sales of mobility and seating products were more than offset by declines in sales of respiratory and lifestyle products. Net sales in the mobility and seating product category were impacted by the FDA consent decree, which limits production of custom power wheelchairs and seating systems at the Taylor Street manufacturing facility to products having properly completed verification of medical necessity (VMN) documentation. The VMN is a signed document from a clinician, and in some instances a physician, that certifies that the product is deemed medically necessary for a particular patient's condition, which cannot be adequately addressed by another manufacturer's product or which is a replacement of the patient's existing product. In an effort to position the company for improved sales results in the future, during 2015, the company began a transformation of its generalist sales force to one more focused on clinically complex products, which includes the mobility and seating product category. As a result, lifestyle and respiratory product net sales were de-emphasized contributing to lower net sales for these products.\nInstitutional Products Group (IPG)\nIPG net sales decreased 15.2% in 2015 over the prior year to $87,137,000 from $102,796,000 as foreign currency translation decreased sales by 0.8 of a percentage point. Excluding the net sales impact of the divested rentals businesses, constant currency net sales increased 3.7% driven primarily by increases in sales of beds and interior design projects. These increases were partially offset by sales declines in therapeutic support surfaces.\nAsia/Pacific\nAsia/Pacific net sales decreased 9.0% in 2015 from the prior year to $44,542,000 from $48,945,000. Foreign currency translation decreased net sales by 16.5 percentage points. Constant currency net sales increased 7.5% primarily due to sales increases at the company's New Zealand and Australian distribution businesses, and at the company's subsidiary that produces microprocessor controllers.\nGross Profit. Consolidated gross profit as a percentage of net sales was 27.4% in 2015 as compared to 27.3% in 2014. The 2015 gross margin reflects a warranty expense reversal related to recalls of $2,325,000 or 0.2 of a percentage point, recorded in the North America/HME segment. The company's warranty reserve is subject to adjustment as new developments change the company's estimates. The 2014 gross margin reflected an incremental warranty expense for three previously disclosed recalls of $11,493,000 or 0.9 of a percentage point. The incremental warranty expense was recorded in the North America/HME, Europe and Asia/Pacific reporting segments. Excluding the impact of the warranty expense amounts noted previously, the gross margin as a percentage of net sales was 27.2% in 2015 as compared to 28.2% in 2014. The margin decrease was principally related to unfavorable sales mix, foreign exchange and the impact of the divested rentals businesses. The rentals businesses had a higher gross margin as a percentage of net sales than the average gross margin as a percentage of net sales for the overall company. Gross profit as a percentage of net sales for the North America/HME and Asia/Pacific segments was favorable as compared to the prior year with the Europe and IPG segments unfavorable compared to the prior year.\nGross profit in Europe as a percentage of net sales decreased 1.9 percentage points in 2015 from the prior year. The decrease in margin was principally due to unfavorable foreign currency exchange and a negative sales mix, partially offset by reduced warranty expense. The 2014 gross margin reflected an incremental warranty expense of $3,395,000 or 0.6 of a percentage point for a previously disclosed recall.\nNorth America/HME gross profit as a percentage of net sales increased 2.7 percentage points in 2015 from the prior year. The increase in margins was principally due to reduced warranty expense, favorable sales mix and decreased manufacturing costs. The 2015 gross margin reflects a warranty recall expense reversal of $2,325,000 or 0.5 of a percentage point for three recalls compared to incremental warranty recall expense of $6,833,000 or 1.3 of a percentage point in 2014.\nIPG gross profit as a percentage of net sales decreased 7.9 percentage points in 2015 from the prior year. The decrease in margin is primarily attributable to the sale of the rentals businesses (5.4 percentage points) and increased freight costs.\nGross profit in Asia/Pacific as a percentage of net sales increased 1.9 percentage points in 2015 from the prior year. The increase was primarily as a result of reduced warranty expense and a favorable manufacturing costs. The 2014 gross margin included an incremental warranty expense for the power wheelchair joystick recall of $1,265,000, or 2.6 percentage points.\nI-44\nSee Accrued Expenses\u201d in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this report for the total provision amounts and a reconciliation of the changes in the warranty accrual.\nSelling, General and Administrative. Consolidated selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses as a percentage of net sales were 27.9% in 2015 and 30.1% in 2014. The overall dollar decrease was $63,419,000, or 16.6%, with foreign currency translation decreasing expense by $23,891,000 or 6.3 percentage points. Excluding the impact of foreign currency translation, SG&A expenses decreased $39,528,000, or 10.3%. This decrease was primarily attributable to the sale of the rentals businesses in the third quarter of 2015, which lowered SG&A expenses by $15,626,000, and by reduced consulting expense (including regulatory and compliance costs related to quality system improvements), employment costs and product liability expense. These were partially offset by a $4,031,000 write-off of costs associated with a canceled legacy software program based on a change in the North America/HME IT strategy.\nEuropean SG&A expenses decreased by 15.9%, or $22,254,000, in 2015 compared to 2014. Foreign currency translation decreased expense by approximately $18,709,000 or 13.4 percentage points. Excluding the foreign currency translation impact, SG&A expenses decreased by $3,545,000, or 2.5%, primarily in depreciation and amortization expense partially offset by increased employment costs.\nSG&A expenses for North America/HME decreased 9.5%, or $14,673,000, in 2015 compared to 2014, with foreign currency translation decreasing expense by $2,313,000 or 1.5 percentage points. Excluding the foreign currency translation, SG&A expense decreased $12,360,000, or 8.0%, due principally to reduced employment costs, product liability expense and consulting expense, including lower regulatory and compliance costs related to quality systems improvements. These were partially offset by a $4,031,000 write-off of costs in 2015 associated with a canceled legacy software program based on a change in the North America/HME IT strategy. In addition, 2014 included an incremental expense of $958,000 related to the retirement of an executive officer of the company.\nSG&A expenses for IPG decreased by 43.1%, or $17,874,000, in 2015 compared to 2014. Excluding the impact of foreign currency translation, SG&A expenses decreased by $17,881,000, or 43.1%, primarily due to the sale of the rentals businesses, which reduced SG&A expenses by $15,626,000, as well as reduced employment costs.\nAsia/Pacific SG&A expenses decreased 21.5%, or $4,580,000, in 2015 compared to 2014. Foreign currency translation decreased expense by $2,876,000 or 13.5 percentage points. Excluding the foreign currency translation impact, SG&A expenses decreased $1,704,000, or 8.0%, principally as a result of reduced employment costs and depreciation expense.\nSG&A expenses related to the Other Segment decreased by 16.3% or $4,038,000 in 2015 as compared to 2014. The decrease is attributable to lower legal and professional costs as well as decreased employment costs. In addition, 2014 included an incremental expense of $1,800,000 related to the retirement of an executive officer of the company.\nAsset write-downs to intangible assets. As a result of the company's 2015 intangible review, the company did not recognize any intangible write-down charges.\nAs a result of the company's review of intangible assets for 2014, the company recognized intangible write-down charges in the IPG segment of $13,041,000 comprised of a customer list impairment of $12,826,000 and a non-compete agreement of $215,000 as the actual and remaining cash flows associated with the intangibles were less than the cash flows originally used to value the intangibles, primarily driven by reduced net sales. The after-tax and pre-tax impairment amounts were the same for each of the above impairments.\nCharge Related to Restructuring Activities. Charges for the year ended December 31, 2015 totaled $1,971,000 including charges for severance ($1,678,000) and charges principally related to a building lease termination primarily in the North America/HME segment ($293,000). Severance charges were incurred in the North America/HME segment ($1,069,000), Europe segment ($510,000), IPG segment ($73,000) and Asia/Pacific segment ($26,000) related to the elimination of certain positions as a result of general restructuring efforts. The savings from these charges have been reflected primarily in reduced selling, general and administrative expenses and manufacturing expenses for the company. Payments for the year ended December 31, 2015 were $3,723,000 and were funded with operating cash flows and cash on hand. The 2015 charges have been paid out.\nCharges for the year ended December 31, 2014 totaled $11,112,000 including charges for severance ($9,841,000), other charges in IPG and Europe ($1,286,000) principally related to building write-downs and lease termination cost reversals ($15,000). Severance charges were incurred in the North America/HME segment ($4,404,000), Other ($2,978,000), IPG segment ($1,163,000), Asia/Pacific segment ($769,000) and Europe segment ($527,000). The North America/HME segment severance charges were principally related to additional positions eliminated due to lost sales volumes resulting from the impact of the FDA\nI-45\nconsent decree. The Other severance charges related to the elimination of two senior corporate executive positions. IPG segment severance charges related principally to the closure of the London, Ontario facility. Europe and Asia/Pacific severance charges related to the elimination of certain positions as a result of general restructuring efforts. The costs related to the building write-downs related to two plant closures. The savings from these charges have been reflected primarily in reduced selling, general and administrative expenses and manufacturing expenses for the company. Payments for the year ended December 31, 2014 were $11,131,000 and were funded with operating cash flows and the company's revolving credit facility. The majority of the 2014 charges have been paid out other than certain executive charge payments which will be paid out over the next few years.\nThe company's disclosure below in Liquidity and Capital Resources highlights risks that could negatively impact the company's liquidity. See also \"Charges Related to Restructuring Activities\" in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nInterest. Interest expense decreased to $4,136,000 in 2015 from $4,887,000 in 2014, representing a 15.4% decrease. This decrease was attributable primarily to lower average borrowings in 2015 versus 2014, despite an increase in interest expense related to capital leases. Interest income in 2015 was $165,000 as compared to $507,000 in 2014, primarily due to interest income earned in Europe on a VAT receivable in 2014 that did not recur in 2015.\nIncome Taxes. The company had an effective tax rate of 125.3% in 2015 compared to an expected benefit of 35% on the continuing operations pre-tax loss and an effective rate of 8.8% in 2014 compared to an expected benefit of 35% on the pre-tax loss from continuing operations. The company's effective tax rate in 2015 was unfavorable to the expected U.S. federal statutory rate benefit due to the negative impact of the company not being able to record tax benefits related to losses in those countries which had tax valuation allowances for the year, which more than offset the benefit of foreign income taxed at rates below the U.S. statutory rate. The company's effective tax rate in 2014 was unfavorable to the expected U.S. federal statutory rate benefit due to the same reasons, except the company recognized a benefit of $7,175,000 in the U.S. as an intra-period allocation with discontinued operations against a portion of the domestic taxable loss from continuing operations. See Income Taxes\u201d in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this report for more detail.\nResearch and Development. Research and development expenditures, which were included in costs of products sold, decreased to $18,677,000 in 2015 from $23,149,000 in 2014. The expenditures, as a percentage of net sales, were 1.6% and 1.8% in 2015 and 2014, respectively.\nINFLATION\nAlthough the company cannot determine the precise effects of inflation, management believes that inflation does continue to have an influence on the cost of materials, salaries and benefits, utilities and outside services. The company attempts to minimize or offset the effects through its review of pricing, capital expenditure programs designed to improve productivity, alternative sourcing of material and other cost control measures.\nLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\nThe company continues to maintain an adequate liquidity position through its unused bank lines of credit (see Long-Term Debt in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this report) and cash balances, as described below.\nThe company's total debt outstanding, inclusive of the debt discount related to the 4.125% Convertible Senior Subordinated Debentures due 2027 (the \"2027 Debentures\") included in equity in accordance with FSB APB 14-1 as well as the debt discount and fees associated with the 5.00% Convertible Senior Notes due 2021 (the \"2021 Notes\"), increased by $148,178,000 to $196,501,000 at December 31, 2016 from $48,323,000 as of December 31, 2015. The company's balance sheet reflects the impact of ASC 470-20, which reduced debt and increased equity by $311,000 and $1,203,000 as of December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively, related to the 2027 Debentures. The debt discount and fees associated with the 2021 Notes reduced the company's reported debt balance by $29,919,000 and $4,922,000, respectively, as of December 31, 2016. The debt increase in 2016 was principally a result of issuing $150,000,000 aggregate principal amount of 2021 Notes. The company's cash and cash equivalents were $124,234,000 at December 31, 2016, compared to $60,055,000 as of December 31, 2015. At December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the company had zero borrowings outstanding under its revolving credit facility. The increase in cash balances compared to December 31, 2015 was primarily the result of the net proceeds received from the issuance of the 2021 Notes in the first quarter of 2016 and the sale proceeds from the sale of GCM, partially offset by cash flow usage.\nOn February 2, 2017, the company repurchased all of the outstanding $13,350,000 principal amount of 2027 Debentures as the holders exercised their February 1, 2017 right to require the company to repurchase their 2027 Debentures (see Long-Term Debt and Subsequent Event in the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements included in this report).\nI-46\nThe company's borrowing capacity and cash balances were utilized for normal operations during the period ended December 31, 2016. Debt repayments, acquisitions, divestitures, the timing of vendor payments, the granting of extended payment terms to significant national accounts and other activity can have a significant impact on the company's cash flow and borrowings outstanding such that the debt reported at the end of a given period may be materially different than debt levels during a given period. While the company has cash balances in various jurisdictions around the world, there are no material restrictions regarding the use of such cash for dividends within the company, loans or other purposes, except in China where the cash balance as of December 31, 2016 was approximately $7,145,000.\nThe company has an asset-based lending Amended and Restated Revolving Credit and Security Agreement (the Credit Agreement\u201d), which provides for a revolving line of credit, letter of credit and swing line facility for the company's U.S. and Canadian borrowers in an aggregate principal amount of up to $100,000,000 (the \"U.S. and Canadian Credit Facility\") and a similar facility for European borrowers in an aggregate principal amount of up to $30,000,000 (the \"European Credit Facility\") each of which is subject to variable rates and availability based on a borrowing base formula. The initial borrowings under the Credit Agreement were used to repay approximately $17,000,000 in aggregate principal amount of borrowings and terminate the company's previous credit agreement, which was scheduled to mature in October 2015. As determined pursuant to the borrowing base formula for the U.S. and Canadian borrowers, the company's borrowing base including the period ending December 31, 2016 under the U.S. and Canadian Credit Facility of the Credit Agreement was approximately $52,761,000, with aggregate borrowing availability of approximately $32,031,000, taking into account the $5,000,000 minimum availability reserve, then-outstanding letters of credit, other reserves and the $11,250,000 dominion trigger amount noted below. As determined pursuant to the borrowing base formula for the European borrowers, the company's borrowing base including the period ending December 31, 2016 under the European Credit Facility of the Credit Agreement was approximately $18,604,000, with aggregate borrowing availability of approximately $12,229,000, considering the $3,000,000 minimum availability reserve and the $3,375,000 dominion trigger amount noted below. As of December 31, 2016, the combined aggregate borrowing availability under the U.S. and Canadian Credit Facility and the European Credit Facility of the Credit Agreement was $44,260,000. See Long-Term Debt in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more details regarding the Credit Agreement.\nAs a result of entering into the Credit Agreement, the company incurred $2,113,000 in fees, which were capitalized and are being amortized through January 16, 2021. In addition, as a result of terminating the previous credit agreement, which was scheduled to mature in October 2015, the company wrote-off $668,000 in previously capitalized fees in the first quarter of 2015, which is reflected in the expense of the North America / HME segment.\nAs of December 31, 2016, the company was in compliance with all covenant requirements under the Credit Agreement. The Credit Agreement contains customary representations, warranties and covenants including dominion triggers requiring the company to maintain borrowing capacity of not less than $11,250,000 on an given business day or $12,500,000 for five consecutive days related to the U.S. and Canadian borrowers, and $3,375,000 on an given business day or 12.5% of the maximum amount that may be drawn under the European Credit Facility for five consecutive days related to European borrowers, in order to avoid triggering full control by an agent for the lenders of the company's cash receipts for application to the company's obligations under the agreement.\nIf the company is unable to comply with the provisions in the Credit Agreement, it could result in a default, which could trigger acceleration of, or the right to accelerate, the related debt. Because of cross-default provisions in its agreements and instruments governing certain of the company's indebtedness, a default under the Credit Agreement could result in a default under, and the acceleration of, certain other company indebtedness. In addition, the company's lenders would be entitled to proceed against the collateral securing the indebtedness.\nBased on the company's current expectations, the company believes that its cash balances and available borrowing capacity under its Credit Agreement should be sufficient to meet working capital needs, capital requirements, and commitments for at least the next twelve months. Notwithstanding the company's expectations, if the company's operating results decline as the result of pressures on the business due to, for example, currency fluctuations or regulatory issues or the company's failure to execute its business plans, the company may be unable to comply with its obligations under the Credit Agreement, and its lenders could demand repayment of any amounts outstanding under the company's credit facilities.\nIn the first quarter of 2016, the company issued $150,000,000 aggregate principal amount of 2021 Notes in a private offering. The notes bear interest at a rate of 5.00% per year payable semi-annually and will mature in February 2021, unless repurchased or converted in accordance with their terms prior to such date. Prior to August 15, 2020, the notes will be convertible only upon satisfaction of certain conditions and during certain periods, and thereafter, at any time until the close of business on the second scheduled trading day immediately preceding the maturity date. Unless and until the company obtains shareholder approval under applicable New York Stock Exchange rules, the notes will be convertible, subject to certain conditions, into cash. If the company\nI-47\nobtains such shareholder approval, the notes may be settled in cash, the company's common shares or a combination of cash and the company's common shares, at the company's election.\nIn connection with the offering of the 2021 Notes, the company entered into privately negotiated convertible note hedge transactions with two financial institutions (the option counterparties\u201d). These transactions cover, subject to customary anti-dilution adjustments, the number of the company's common shares that will initially underlie the 2021 Notes, and are expected generally to reduce the potential equity dilution, and/or offset any cash payments in excess of the principal amount due, as the case may be, upon conversion of the 2021 Notes. The company entered into separate, privately negotiated warrant transactions with the option counterparties at a higher strike price relating to the same number of the company's common shares, subject to customary anti-dilution adjustments, pursuant to which the company sold warrants to the option counterparties. The warrants could have a dilutive effect on the company's outstanding common shares and the company's earnings per share to the extent that the price of the company's common shares exceeds the strike price of those warrants.\nThe initial net proceeds from the offering of the 2021 Notes were $144,034,000, after deducting fees and estimated offering expenses payable by the company. Approximately $5,000,000 of the net proceeds from the offering was used to repurchase the company's common shares, and $15,600,000 of the net proceeds was used to pay the net cost of the convertible note hedge and warrant transactions. The company incurred $5,966,000 in fees, which were capitalized and are being amortized as interest expense through February 2021, of which all $5,966,000 was paid by December 31, 2016. The company has used, and intends to continue to use the remaining net proceeds from the offering for working capital and general corporate purposes, which may include funding portions of the company's ongoing turnaround and addressing potential risks and contingencies. The net proceeds have allowed the company to invest in new products, people, marketing initiatives and working capital to transform the business and pursue growth.\nThe company also has an agreement with De Lage Landen, Inc. ( DLL\u201d), a third-party financing company, to provide lease financing to the company's U.S. customers. Either party could terminate this agreement with 180 days' notice or 90 days' notice by DLL upon the occurrence of certain events. Should this agreement be terminated, the company's borrowing needs under the Credit Agreement could increase.\nWhile there is general concern about the potential for rising interest rates, the company expects that it will be able to absorb modest rate increases in the months ahead without any material impact on its liquidity or capital resources. For 2016 and 2015, the weighted average interest rate on all borrowings, excluding capital leases, was 4.85% and 3.83%, respectively.\nCAPITAL EXPENDITURES\nThere were no individually material capital expenditure commitments outstanding as of December 31, 2016. The company estimates that capital investments for 2017 will be between $15,000,000 and $20,000,000 compared to actual capital expenditures of $10,151,000 in 2016. The anticipated increase relates primarily to the company's investments to transform the company. The company believes that its balances of cash and cash equivalents and existing borrowing facilities will be sufficient to meet its operating cash requirements and fund required capital expenditures (see \"Liquidity and Capital Resources\"). The Credit Agreement limits the company's annual capital expenditures to $35,000,000.\nCASH FLOWS\nCash flows used by operating activities were $56,613,000 in 2016, compared to cash used of $5,378,000 in the previous year. The 2016 operating cash flows were negatively impacted by net loss, declines in accrued expenses, including tax payments of approximately $12,500,000 related to a previously disclosed liability for uncertain tax positions and current taxes, and accounts payable as well as increased inventory. Operating cash flows in 2016 were positively impacted by a reduction in accounts receivable. Operating cash flows in 2015 were negatively impacted by retirement payments of $24,651,000 related to the retirement of two executive officers of the company.\nCash flows provided by investing activities were $3,649,000 in 2016, compared to $44,376,000 in 2015. Cash flows provided by investing activities in 2016 included net proceeds of $13,829,000 from the sale of GCM. Cash flows provided by investing activities in 2015 included the receipt of $23,000,000 in proceeds from the company's real estate sale leaseback transaction, surrender of corporate-owned life insurance of $11,902,000 to fund payments in 2015 related to the retirement of certain executive officers of the company in 2014 and net proceeds of $13,700,000 from the sale of its rental businesses in July 2015.\nCash flows provided by financing activities in 2016 were $118,549,000 compared to cash flows used of $14,346,000 in 2015. Cash flows provided in 2016 reflect net proceeds received as a result of the issuance of the 2021 Notes, including the net proceeds used for the related convertible note hedge transactions, repurchase of common shares and payment of financing costs.\nI-48\nDuring 2016, free cash flow was negative $66,722,000 compared to free cash flow generation of $10,217,000 in 2015. In 2016 and 2015, free cash flow was negatively impacted by the same items that affected cash flows used by operation activities. In addition, free cash flow in 2015 included a positive free cash flow impact of $23,000,000 as a result of the proceeds from the company's real estate sale leaseback transaction. Excluding the negative impact of $12,500,000 in tax payments, free cash flow in 2016 was negative $54,222,000. Excluding the $23,000,000 positive impact of the real estate sale and leaseback transaction and the $24,651,000 negative impact of the retirement payments noted above, free cash flow in 2015 was positive $11,868,000. Free cash flow is a non-GAAP financial measure that is comprised of net cash used by operating activities less purchases of property and equipment plus proceeds from sales of property and equipment. Management believes that this financial measure provides meaningful information for evaluating the overall financial performance of the company and its ability to repay debt or make future investments (including acquisitions, etc.). The non-GAAP financial measure is reconciled to the GAAP measure as follows (in thousands):\nTable 74: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Twelve Months Ended\nDecember 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash provided by operating activities\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(56,613\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(5,378\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Sales of property and equipment\n</td> <td>42\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>23,117\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Less: Purchases of property and equipment-net\n</td> <td>(10,151\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(7,522\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Free Cash Flow\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(66,722\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>10,217\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nBUSINESS SEGMENT NET SALES\nThe following tables provide net sales change for continuing operations as reported and as adjusted to exclude the impact of foreign exchange translation (constant currency net sales) as well as net sales further adjusted to exclude the impact of the sale of GCM on September 30, 2016 and the sale of the rentals businesses in July 2015, neither of which were deemed discontinued operations for financial reporting purposes. Constant currency net sales\" is a non-GAAP financial measure, which is defined as net sales excluding the impact of foreign currency translation. The current year's functional constant currency net sales are translated using the prior year's foreign exchange rates. These amounts are then compared to the prior year's sales to calculate the constant currency net sales change. Management believes that this financial measure provides meaningful information for evaluating the core operating performance of the company.\nI-49\nTwelve months ended December 31, 2016 compared to

timing of any other payments. See Income Taxes in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this report.\nDIVIDEND POLICY\nIt is the company's policy to pay a nominal dividend in order for its stock to be more attractive to a broader range of investors. For 2016, annualized dividends of $0.05 per Common Share and $0.045 per Class B Common Share were declared and paid. It is not anticipated that this annual dividend rate will change materially as the company believes that capital should be kept available for investments and growth opportunities as a result of its multi-year turnaround strategy.\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES\nThe Consolidated Financial Statements included in the report include accounts of the company and all majority-owned subsidiaries. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires management to make estimates and assumptions in certain circumstances that affect amounts reported in the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements and related footnotes. In preparing the financial statements, management has made its best estimates and judgments of certain amounts included in the financial statements, giving due consideration to materiality. However, application of these accounting policies involves the exercise of judgment and use of assumptions as to future uncertainties and, as a result, actual results could differ from these estimates.\nThe following critical accounting policies, among others, affect the more significant judgments and estimates used in preparation of the company's consolidated financial statements.\nRevenue Recognition\nInvacare's revenues are recognized when products are shipped or services provided to unaffiliated customers. Revenue Recognition, ASC 605, provides guidance on the application of generally accepted accounting principles to selected revenue recognition issues. The company has concluded that its revenue recognition policy is appropriate and in accordance with GAAP and ASC 605. Shipping and handling costs are included in cost of goods sold.\nSales are made only to customers with whom the company believes collection is reasonably assured based upon a credit analysis, which may include obtaining a credit application, a signed security agreement, personal guarantee and/or a cross corporate guarantee depending on the credit history of the customer. Credit lines are established for new customers after an evaluation of their credit report and/or other relevant financial information. Existing credit lines are regularly reviewed and adjusted with consideration given to any outstanding past due amounts.\nI-51\nThe company offers discounts and rebates, which are accounted for as reductions to revenue in the period in which the sale is recognized. Discounts offered include: cash discounts for prompt payment, base and trade discounts based on contract level for specific classes of customers. Volume discounts and rebates are given based on large purchases and the achievement of certain sales volumes. Product returns are accounted for as a reduction to reported sales with estimates recorded for anticipated returns at the time of sale. The company does not ship any goods on consignment.\nDistributed products sold by the company are accounted for in accordance with the revenue recognition guidance in ASC 605-45-05. The company records distributed product sales gross as a principal since the company takes title to the products and has the risks of loss for collections, delivery and returns.\nProduct sales that give rise to installment receivables are recorded at the time of sale when the risks and rewards of ownership are transferred. Interest income is recognized on installment agreements in accordance with the terms of the agreements. Installment accounts are monitored and if a customer defaults on payments, interest income is no longer recognized. All installment accounts are accounted for using the same methodology, regardless of duration of the installment agreements.\nAllowance for Uncollectible Accounts Receivable\nThe estimated allowance for uncollectible amounts is based primarily on management's evaluation of the financial condition of the customer. In addition, as a result of the third party financing arrangement, management monitors the collection status of these contracts in accordance with the company's limited recourse obligations and provides amounts necessary for estimated losses in the allowance for doubtful accounts and establishing reserves for specific customers as needed.\nThe company continues to closely monitor the credit-worthiness of its customers and adhere to tight credit policies. In 2013, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services announced new Medicare prices which became effective in July 2013 for the second round of the NCB program, which was expanded to include 91 additional MSAs. In January 2016, CMS began expanding NCB to rural areas which expanded the program to 100% of the Medicare population. While the current NCB program contract pricing continues through the end of 2018, the company believes the changes could have a significant impact on the collectability of accounts receivable for those customers which are in the rural locations impacted and which have a portion of their revenues tied to Medicare reimbursement. In addition, there is a risk that these precedent-setting price reductions could influence other non-CMS payors' reimbursement rates for the same product categories. As a result, this is an additional risk factor which the company considers when assessing the collectability of accounts receivable.\nThe company has an agreement with DLL, a third-party financing company, to provide lease financing to Invacare's U.S. customers. The DLL agreement provides for direct leasing between DLL and the Invacare customer. The company retains a recourse obligation for events of default under the contracts. The company monitors the collections status of these contracts and has provided amounts for estimated losses in its allowances for doubtful accounts.\nInventories and Related Allowance for Obsolete and Excess Inventory\nInventories are stated at the lower of cost or market with cost determined by the first-in, first-out method. Inventories have been reduced by an allowance for excess and obsolete inventories. The estimated allowance is based on management's review of inventories on hand compared to estimated future usage and sales. A provision for excess and obsolete inventory is recorded as needed based upon the discontinuation of products, redesigning of existing products, new product introductions, market changes and safety issues. Both raw materials and finished goods are reserved for on the balance sheet.\nIn general, Invacare reviews inventory turns as an indicator of obsolescence or slow moving product as well as the impact of new product introductions. Depending on the situation, the company may partially or fully reserve for the individual item. The company continues to increase its overseas sourcing efforts, increase its emphasis on the development and introduction of new products, and decrease the cycle time to bring new product offerings to market. These initiatives are potential sources of inventory obsolescence for both raw material and finished goods.\nGoodwill, Intangible and Other Long-Lived Assets\nProperty, equipment, intangibles and certain other long-lived assets are amortized over their useful lives. Useful lives are based on management's estimates of the period that the assets will generate revenue. Under Intangibles-Goodwill and Other, ASC 350, goodwill and intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives are subject to annual impairment tests. The company's measurement date for its annual goodwill impairment test is October 1 and the analysis is completed in the fourth quarter. Furthermore, goodwill and other long-lived assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances\nI-52\nindicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. The majority of the company's goodwill and intangible assets relate to the company's Europe and IPG segments which were profitable in 2016.\nTo review goodwill for impairment in accordance with ASC 350, the company first estimates the fair value of each reporting unit and compares the calculated fair value to the carrying value of each reporting unit. A reporting unit is defined as an operating segment or one level below. The company has determined that its reporting units are the same as its operating segments. The company completes its annual impairment tests in the fourth quarter of each year. To estimate the fair values of the reporting units, the company utilizes a discounted cash flow (DCF) method in which the company forecasts income statement and balance sheet amounts based on assumptions regarding future sales growth, profitability, inventory turns, days' sales outstanding, etc. to forecast future cash flows. The cash flows are discounted using a weighted average cost of capital discount rate where the cost of debt is based on quoted rates for 20-year debt of companies of similar credit risk and the cost of equity is based upon the 20-year treasury rate for the risk-free rate, a market risk premium, the industry average beta and a small cap stock adjustment. The discount rates used have a significant impact upon the discounted cash flow methodology utilized in the company's annual impairment testing as higher discount rates decrease the fair value estimates. The assumptions used are based on a market participant's point of view and yielded a discount rate of 8.67% in 2016 for the company's annual impairment analysis compared to 9.41% in 2015 and 9.89% in 2014.\nThe company also utilizes an Enterprise Value (EV) to Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization (EBITDA) Method to compute the fair value of its reporting units which considers potential acquirers and their EV to EBITDA multiples adjusted by an estimated premium. While more weight is given to the discounted cash flow method, the EV to EBITDA method does provide corroborative evidence of the reasonableness of the discounted cash flow method results.\nIn 2016, 2015 and 2014, the company performed a review for potential impairments of any other assets, including the company's Taylor Street facility which is subject to the FDA consent decree that limits the company's manufacture and distribution of custom power and manual wheelchairs, wheelchair components and wheelchair subassemblies at the Taylor Street facility. The company determined there was no impairment of the property, plant and equipment of the Taylor Street facility based on a comparison of the forecasted undiscounted cash flows to the carrying value of the net assets in accordance with ASC 360. In addition, the company determined there was no impairment of inventory associated with the facility.\nWhile there was no indication of impairment in 2016 related to goodwill for the Europe or IPG segments, a future potential impairment is possible for any of the company's segments should actual results differ materially from forecasted results used in the valuation analysis. Furthermore, the company's annual valuation of goodwill can differ materially if the market inputs used to determine the discount rate change significantly. For instance, higher interest rates or greater stock price volatility would increase the discount rate and thus increase the chance of impairment. In consideration of this potential, the company reviewed the results if the discount rate used were 100 basis points higher for the 2016 impairment analysis and determined that there still would not be any indicator of potential impairment for the segments with goodwill which are Europe and IPG.\nThe company's intangible assets consist of intangible assets with defined lives as well as intangible assets with indefinite lives. Defined-lived intangible assets consist principally of customer lists, developed technology, license agreements, patents and other miscellaneous intangibles such as non-compete agreements. The company's indefinite lived intangible assets consist entirely of trademarks.\nThe company evaluates the carrying value of definite-lived assets whenever events or circumstances indicate possible impairment. Definite-lived assets are determined to be impaired if the future un-discounted cash flows expected to be generated by the asset are less than the carrying value. Actual impairment amounts for definite-lived assets are then calculated using a discounted cash flow calculation. The company reviews indefinite-lived assets for impairment annually in the fourth quarter of each year and whenever events or circumstances indicate possible impairment. Any impairment amounts for indefinite-lived assets are calculated as the difference between the future discounted cash flows expected to be generated by the asset less than the carrying value for the asset.\nDuring 2014, the company recognized intangible write-down charges in the IPG segment of $13,041,000 comprised of a customer list impairment of $12,826,000 and a non-compete agreement of $215,000 as the actual and remaining cash flows associated with the intangibles were less than the cash flows originally used to value the intangibles, primarily driven by reduced net sales. The after-tax and pre-tax impairment amounts were the same for each of the above impairments. The fair value of the customer list was calculated using an excess earnings method, using a discounted cash flow model. Estimated cash flow returns to the customer relationship were reduced by the cash flows required to satisfy the return requirements of each of the assets employed with the residual cash flow then discounted to value the customer relationship. The write-down charges were the result of decisions to exit certain businesses as well as lower than anticipated sales.\nI-53\nProduct Liability\nThe company is self-insured in North America for product liability exposures through its captive insurance company, Invatection Insurance Company, which currently has a policy year that runs from September 1 to August 31 and insures annual policy losses up to $10,000,000 per occurrence and $13,000,000 in the aggregate. The company also has additional layers of external insurance coverage, related to all lines of insurance coverage, insuring up to $75,000,000 in aggregate losses per policy year arising from individual claims anywhere in the world that exceed the captive insurance company policy limits or the limits of the company's per country foreign liability limits, as applicable. There can be no assurance that Invacare's current insurance levels will continue to be adequate or available at affordable rates.\nProduct liability reserves are recorded for individual claims based upon historical experience, industry expertise and other indicators. Additional reserves, in excess of the specific individual case reserves, are provided for incurred but not reported claims based upon actuarial valuations at the time such valuations are conducted. Historical claims experience and other assumptions are taken into consideration by the company in estimating the ultimate reserves. For example, the actuarial analysis assumes that historical loss experience is an indicator of future experience, that the distribution of exposures by geographic area and nature of operations for ongoing operations is expected to be very similar to historical operations with no dramatic changes and that the government indices used to trend losses and exposures are appropriate. Estimates made are adjusted on a regular basis and can be impacted by actual loss awards and settlements on claims. While actuarial analysis is used to help determine adequate reserves, the company is responsible for the determination and recording of adequate reserves in accordance with accepted loss reserving standards and practices.\nWarranty\nGenerally, the company's products are covered by warranties against defects in material and workmanship for various periods depending on the product from the date of sale to the customer. Certain components carry a lifetime warranty. A provision for estimated warranty cost is recorded at the time of sale based upon actual experience. The company continuously assesses the adequacy of its product warranty accrual and makes adjustments as needed. Historical analysis is primarily used to determine the company's warranty reserves. Claims history is reviewed and provisions are adjusted as needed. However, the company does consider other events, such as a product recall, which could warrant additional warranty reserve provision. See Accrued Expenses in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a reconciliation of the changes in the warranty accrual.\nAccounting for Stock-Based Compensation\nThe company accounts for share based compensation under the provisions of Compensation-Stock Compensation, ASC 718. The company has not made any modifications to the terms of any previously granted options and no changes have been made regarding the valuation methodologies or assumptions used to determine the fair value of options granted and the company continues to use a Black-Scholes valuation model. As of December 31, 2016, there was $12,049,000 of total unrecognized compensation cost from stock-based compensation arrangements, which is related to non-vested options and shares, and includes $8,740,000 related to restricted stock awards, $3,134,000 related to performance awards and $175,000 related to non-qualified stock options.\nThe substantial majority of the options awarded have been granted at exercise prices equal to the market value of the underlying stock on the date of grant. Restricted stock awards granted without cost to the recipients are expensed on a straight-line basis over the vesting periods. Performance awards granted are expensed based on estimated achievement of the performance objectives over the relevant performance award periods.\nIncome Taxes\nAs part of the process of preparing its financial statements, the company is required to estimate income taxes in various jurisdictions. The process requires estimating the company's current tax liability, including assessing uncertainties related to tax return filing positions, as well as estimating temporary differences due to the different treatment of items for tax and accounting policies. The temporary differences are reported as deferred tax assets and or liabilities. The company also must estimate whether it will more likely than not realize its deferred tax assets and whether a valuation allowance should be established. Substantially all of the company's U.S., Australia, Switzerland and New Zealand deferred tax assets are offset by a valuation allowance. In the event that actual results differ from its estimates, the company's provision for income taxes could be materially impacted. The company does not believe that there is a substantial likelihood that materially different amounts would be reported related to its critical accounting policies.\nI-54\nAccounting for Convertible Debt and Related Derivatives\nIn the first quarter of 2016, the company issued $150,000,000 aggregate principal amount of the 2021 Notes. In connection with the offering of the 2021 Notes, the company entered into privately negotiated convertible note hedge transactions with two option counterparties. These transactions cover, subject to customary anti-dilution adjustments, the number of the company's common shares that will initially underlie the 2021 Notes, and are expected generally to reduce the potential equity dilution, and/or offset any cash payments in excess of the principal amount due, as the case may be, upon conversion of the 2021 Notes. The company entered into separate, privately negotiated warrant transactions with the option counterparties at a higher strike price relating to the same number of the company's common shares, subject to customary anti-dilution adjustments, pursuant to which the company sold warrants to the option counterparties. The warrants could have a dilutive effect on the company's outstanding common shares and the company's earnings per share to the extent that the price of the company's common shares exceeds the strike price of those warrants. The strike price of the warrants will initially be $22.4175 per share and is subject to certain adjustments under the terms of the warrant transactions.\nThe convertible debt conversion liability and the convertible note hedges are accounted for as derivatives that are fair valued quarterly while the warrants are included as equity. The fair value of the convertible debt conversion liability and the convertible note hedges are estimated using a lattice model incorporating the terms and conditions of the notes and considering, for example, changes in the prices of the company's common shares, company stock price volatility, risk-free rates and changes in market rates. The valuations are, among other things, subject to changes in both the company's credit worthiness and the counter-parties to the instruments as well as change in general market conditions. While the change in fair value of the convertible debt conversion liability and the convertible note hedges are generally expected to move in opposite directions, the net change in any given period may be material.\nRECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS\nFor the company's disclosure regarding recently issued accounting pronouncements, see Accounting Policies - Recent Accounting Pronouncements in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.", "item_7_text": "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nOVERVIEW\nManagement's discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes that appear elsewhere in this annual report on Form 10-K.\nInvacare is a multi-national company with integrated capabilities to design, produce and distribute durable medical equipment. The company makes products that help people move, breathe, rest and perform essential hygiene, and with those products the company supports people with congenital, acquired and degenerative conditions. The company's products and solutions are important parts of care for people with a range of challenges, from those who are active and heading to work or school each day and may need additional mobility or respiratory support, to those who are cared for in residential care settings, at home and in rehabilitation centers. The company operates in facilities in North America, Europe and Asia/Pacific, which are the result of dozens of acquisitions made over the company's nearly forty-year history. Some of these acquisitions have been combined into integrated operating units, while others remain relatively independent.\nStrategy\nThe company had a strategy to be a leading provider of durable medical equipment to providers in global markets by providing the broadest portfolio available. This strategy has not kept pace with certain reimbursement changes, competitive dynamics and company-specific challenges. Since 2015, the company has made a major shift in its strategy. The company has since been aligning its resources to produce products and solutions that assist customers and end-users with their most clinically complex needs. By focusing the company's efforts to provide the best possible assistance and outcomes to the people and caregivers who use its products, the company aims to improve its financial condition for sustainable profit and growth. To execute this transformation, the company is undertaking a substantial three-phase multi-year transformation plan.\nTransformation\nThe company is executing a multi-year transformation to shift to its new strategy. This is expected to yield better financial results from the application of the company's resources to products and solutions that provide greater healthcare value in clinically complex rehabilitation and post-acute care. The transformation is divided into the following three phases:\nPhase One - Assess and Reorient\n \u2022 Increase commercial effectiveness; \n \u2022 Shift and narrow the product portfolio; \n \u2022 Align innovation resources to clinically complex solutions; \n \u2022 Accelerate quality efforts with culture of quality excellence; and \n \u2022 Develop and expand talent. \nPhase Two - Build and Align\n \u2022 Leverage commercial improvements; \n \u2022 Optimize the business for cost and efficiency; \n \u2022 Continue to improve quality systems; \n \u2022 Launch new clinical product platforms; and \n \u2022 Expand talent management and culture. \nPhase Three - Grow\n \u2022 Lead in quality culture and operations excellence; and \n \u2022 Grow above market. \nIn 2016, the company made significant progress on its Phase One work, most notably in North America, where some of the greatest improvement is needed. As expected, the 2016 financial results show the near-term impact of investments in commercial resources, new product development, and quality systems, ahead of accretion. The company will continue to make significant investments in this transformation, reduce sales in certain areas, refocus resources away from less accretive activities, and look at its global infrastructure for opportunities to drive efficiency. Phase One investments are in the early phases of providing returns.\nI-39\nThe company expects to begin seeing some results later in 2017 and more substantive results in 2018. In the meantime, the company has begun taking early Phase Two actions to streamline operations, resize and reshape the organization, especially in North America, around its new business mix and size. By executing this strategy and making these operational improvements, the company expects long-term benefits for the company's constituents.\nFavorable Long-term Demand\nUltimately, demand for the company's products and services is based on the need to provide care for people with certain conditions. The company's medical devices provide solutions for end-users and caregivers. Therefore, the demand for the company's medical equipment is largely driven by population growth and the incidence of certain conditions where treatment may be supplemented by the company's devices. The company also provides solutions to help equipment providers and residential care operators deliver cost-effective and high-quality care. The company believes that its commercial team, customer relationships, products and solutions, supply chain infrastructure, and strong research and development pipeline will create favorable business potential.\nDISCONTINUED AND DIVESTED OPERATIONS\nOn August 29, 2014, the company sold Altimate Medical, Inc. (Altimate), its manufacturer of stationary standing assistive devices for use in patient rehabilitation, to REP Acquisition Corporation for $23,000,000 in cash, which was subject to final post-closing adjustments. Altimate had been operated on a stand-alone basis and reported as part of the North America/HME segment of the company. The company recorded a gain of $17,069,000 pre-tax in the third quarter of 2014, which represented the excess of the net sales price over the book value of the assets and liabilities of Altimate. The sale of this business was dilutive to the company's results. The company utilized the proceeds from the sale to reduce debt outstanding under its revolving credit facility in the third quarter of 2014. The gain recorded by the company reflects the company's estimated final purchase adjustments.\nIn 2014, the net sales of the Altimate discontinued operations were $11,778,000 and earnings before income taxes were $2,796,000. Results for Altimate include an interest expense allocation from continuing operations to discontinued operations of $202,000 in 2014 as proceeds from the sale were required to be utilized to pay down debt. The interest allocation was based on the net proceeds assumed to pay down debt applying the company's average interest rates for the periods presented. The company has classified Altimate as a discontinued operation for all periods presented.\nThe company recorded total expenses related to all of its discontinued operations since 2012 of $8,801,000, of which $8,405,000 were paid as of December 31, 2016. The company recorded an incremental intra-period tax allocation expense to discontinued operations for 2015 and 2014 representing the cumulative intra-period allocation expense to discontinued operations based on the company's domestic taxable loss related to continuing operations for 2015 and 2014.\nOn July 2, 2015, the company sold its rentals businesses to Joerns Healthcare Parent, LLC, for approximately $15,500,000 in cash, which was subject to final post-closing adjustments. The rentals businesses had been operated on a stand-alone basis and reported as part of the IPG segment of the company. The company recorded a pre-tax gain of approximately $24,000 in the third quarter of 2015, which represented the excess of the net sales price over the book value of the assets and liabilities of the rentals businesses, as of the date of completion of the disposition. The company recorded expenses related to the sale of the rentals businesses totaling $1,792,000, of which $1,265,000 have been paid as of December 31, 2016. The sale of the rentals businesses was not dilutive to the company's results. The company utilized the net proceeds from the sale to reduce debt outstanding under its credit agreement. The company determined that the sale of the rentals businesses did not meet the criteria for classification as a discontinued operation in accordance with ASU 2014-08. The rentals businesses were treated as held for sale as of June 30, 2015 until sold on July 2, 2015. As such, the results of the rentals businesses are included in the Results from Continuing Operations discussion below.\nOn September 30, 2016, the company, completed the sale of GCM to Compass Health Brands Corp., for approximately $13,829,000 in cash, which is subject to final post-closing adjustments. The net proceeds from the transaction were $12,729,000, net of expenses. The company recorded a pre-tax gain of $7,386,000 in the third quarter of 2016, which represented the excess of the net sales price over the book value of the assets and liabilities of GCM. The company recorded expenses related to the sale of GCM totaling $1,100,000, of which $230,000 has been paid out as of December 31, 2016. The sale of GCM was dilutive to the company's results. The company utilized the net proceeds to fund operations. The company determined that the sale of GCM did not meet the criteria for classification as a discontinued operation in accordance with ASU 2014-08 but the \"held for sale\" criteria of ASC 360-10-45-9 were met and thus GCM was treated as held for sale for purposes of the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets as of December 31, 2015. As such, the results of the rentals businesses are included in the Results from Continuing Operations discussion below.\nI-40\nRESULTS OF CONTINUING OPERATIONS\n2016 Versus 2015\nNet Sales. Consolidated net sales for 2016 decreased 8.3% for the year, to $1,047,474,000 from $1,142,338,000 in 2015. Foreign currency translation decreased net sales by 1.6 percentage points. Constant currency net sales decreased 6.7% compared to 2015. Higher constant currency net sales in the Europe and Asia/Pacific segments were offset by lower constant currency net sales in the North America/HME and IPG segments. Constant currency net sales for the company, excluding the impact of all the divested businesses (GCM and rentals businesses), decreased 4.9% compared to 2015. Constant currency net sales is a non-GAAP financial measure - see \"Business Segment Net Sales\" on page I-49.\nEurope\nEuropean net sales increased 0.7% in 2016 compared to the prior year to $540,013,000 from $536,463,000 as foreign currency translation decreased net sales by 3.0 percentage points. Constant currency net sales increased 3.7% compared to 2015. The improvements in constant currency net sales were driven by increased sales of mobility and seating and lifestyle products. Changes in exchange rates have had, and may continue to have, a significant impact on sales in this segment.\nNorth America/Home Medical Equipment (North America/HME)\nNorth America/HME net sales decreased 16.1% in 2016 versus the prior year to $397,702,000 from $474,196,000 with foreign currency translation decreasing net sales by 0.2 of a percentage point. Constant currency net sales decreased 15.9% compared to the prior year. Excluding the net sales impact of the divested GCM business, reported net sales decreased by 15.5% and by 15.3% on a constant currency basis. The decreases in constant currency net sales were primarily driven by reduced sales of lifestyle and respiratory products while mobility and seating declined slightly.\nInstitutional Products Group (IPG)\nIPG net sales decreased 26.1% in 2016 over the prior year to $64,413,000 from $87,137,000 as foreign currency translation decreased sales by 0.2 of a percentage point. Excluding the net sales impact of the divested rentals businesses, reported net sales decreased by 11.5% and by 11.3% on a constant currency basis. The decreases in constant currency net sales of the non-rentals businesses were driven by sales declines in all major product categories.\nAsia/Pacific\nAsia/Pacific net sales increased 1.8% in 2016 from the prior year to $45,346,000 from $44,542,000. Foreign currency translation decreased net sales by 1.7 percentage points. Constant currency net sales increased 3.5% compared to 2015 due to net sales increases in the Australia and New Zealand distribution businesses and at the company's subsidiary that produces microprocessor controllers. Changes in exchange rates, particularly with the euro and U.S. dollar, have had, and may continue to have, a significant impact on sales in this segment.\nGross Profit. Consolidated gross profit as a percentage of net sales was 27.1% in 2016 as compared to 27.4% in 2015. Excluding the impact of all the divested businesses, gross margin as a percentage of net sales for 2016 increased by 0.2 of a percentage point as compared to 2015 driven by favorable sales mix principally offset by increased warranty expense. Gross margin as a percentage of net sales increased for the North America/HME and Asia/Pacific segments with declines in the Europe and IPG segments. Gross profit dollars declined in all segments, except for Asia/Pacific, with the largest declines in North America/HME and IPG. The decline in IPG was primarily impacted by the sale of the rentals businesses in 2015.\nGross profit in Europe as a percentage of net sales decreased 0.5 of a percentage point in 2016 from the prior year and gross margin dollars decreased by $1,721,000. The decrease in margin was principally due to unfavorable foreign currency, pricing, warranty and R&D expense. Incremental warranty recall expense of $1,490,000 was recorded in 2016 for a component of a lifestyles product.\nNorth America/HME gross profit as a percentage of net sales increased by 0.4 of a percentage point in 2016 from the prior year while gross margin dollars decreased by $14,106,000 driven by net sales declines and increased warranty expense. The 2016 gross margin reflects warranty recall expense of $1,366,000, or 0.3 of a percentage point, for a recall which was related to a component on a lifestyles product. In comparison, warranty recall expense reversals of $2,325,000, or 0.5 of a percentage point, were recorded in 2015.\nI-41\nIPG gross profit as a percentage of net sales decreased 9.9 percentage points in 2016 from the prior year and gross margin dollars decreased $14,090,000. The decrease in margin was primarily attributable to the sale of the rentals businesses ($11,359,000 or 8.5 percentage points) and to a lesser extent unfavorable sales mix and increased warranty expense.\nGross profit in Asia/Pacific as a percentage of net sales increased 1.8 percentage points in 2016 from the prior year and gross margin dollars increased $1,038,000. The increase was primarily related to favorable sales mix and reduced manufacturing costs, which were partially offset by R&D expense.\nSee Accrued Expenses\u201d in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this report for the total warranty provision amounts and a reconciliation of the changes in the warranty accrual.\nSelling, General and Administrative. Consolidated selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses as a percentage of net sales were 29.0% in 2016 and 27.9% in 2015. The overall dollar decrease was $14,865,000, or 4.7%, with foreign currency translation decreasing expense by $4,226,000 or 1.4 percentage points. Excluding the impact of foreign currency translation, SG&A expenses decreased $10,639,000, or 3.3%. Excluding the impacts of all the divested businesses and foreign currency translation, SG&A expense increased $2,212,000, or 0.7%, compared to 2015, primarily related to increased product liability and employment costs. The SG&A expense in 2015 included a write-off of costs related to a canceled legacy software program based on a change in the North America/HME IT strategy.\nEuropean SG&A expenses increased by 3.5%, or $4,079,000, in 2016 compared to 2015. Foreign currency translation decreased expense by approximately $3,224,000 or 2.7 percentage points. Excluding the foreign currency translation impact, SG&A expenses increased by $7,303,000, or 6.2%, principally related to increased employment costs.\nSG&A expenses for North America/HME decreased 4.0%, or $5,603,000, in 2016 compared to 2015 with foreign currency translation decreasing expense by $722,000 or 0.5 of a percentage point. Excluding the foreign currency translation, SG&A expense decreased $4,881,000, or 3.5%, principally as a result of reduced regulatory costs in 2016, a $4,031,000 2015 write-off of costs for a canceled legacy software program, and a reduction in expense in 2016 resulting from the GCM divestiture.\nSG&A expenses for IPG decreased by 50.7%, or $11,949,000, in 2016 compared to 2015. Excluding the impact of foreign currency translation, SG&A expenses decreased by $11,927,000, or 50.6%, primarily related to a reduction in expense for the rentals business divestiture ($11,239,000) and employment costs.\nAsia/Pacific SG&A expenses decreased 6.1%, or $1,018,000, in 2016 compared to 2015. Foreign currency translation decreased expense by $258,000 or 1.6 percentage points. Excluding the foreign currency translation impact, SG&A expenses decreased $760,000, or 4.5%, principally as a result of favorable foreign currency transactions and reduced employment costs.\nSG&A expenses related to the Other Segment decreased by 1.8% or $374,000 in 2016 as compared to 2015 primarily related to decreased legal expense in 2016.\nGain on Sale of Business. As a result of the sale of GCM on September 30, 2016, the company recorded a gain in 2016 of $7,386,000 on the sale, which represents the excess of the net sales price over the book value of the net assets of GCM. As a result of the sale of the rentals business on July 2, 2015, the company recorded a gain of $24,000 in 2015, which represented the excess of the net sales price over the book value of the assets and liabilities of the rentals businesses.\nCharge Related to Restructuring Activities. The company's restructuring charges were necessitated primarily by continued declines in Medicare and Medicaid reimbursement by the U.S. government, as well as similar healthcare reimbursement pressures abroad, which negatively affect the company's customers (e.g. home health care providers) and continued pricing pressures faced by the company as a result of outsourcing by competitors to lower cost locations. Restructuring decisions were also the result of reduced profitability in the North America/HME and Asia/Pacific segments impacted by the FDA consent decree. In addition, as a result of the company's transformation strategy, additional restructuring charges were incurred during 2016 and are expected to continue into 2017. While the company's restructuring efforts have been executed on a timely basis, and have resulted in operating cost savings, the savings have been more than offset by the general business decline, higher regulatory and compliance costs related to quality system improvements, and more recently, investments as a result of the company's transformation strategy and higher interest expense. The company expects any near-term cost savings from restructuring will be offset by other costs as a result of the company's transformation strategy and other pressures on the business.\nCharges for the year ended December 31, 2016 totaled $2,447,000 which were related to North America/HME segment ($2,347,000) and the Asia/Pacific segment ($100,000). In North America/HME, costs were incurred related to severance ($1,862,000) and lease termination costs ($485,000). The Asia/Pacific charges were for severance costs. The savings from these\nI-42\ncharges will be reflected primarily in reduced selling, general and administrative expenses and manufacturing expenses for the company. Payments for the year ended December 31, 2016 were $2,992,000 and the cash payments were funded with company's cash on hand. The majority of the 2016 charges are expected to be paid out within twelve months.\nCharges for the year ended December 31, 2015 totaled $1,971,000 including charges for severance ($1,678,000) and charges principally related to a building lease termination primarily in the North America/HME segment ($293,000). Severance charges were incurred in the North America/HME segment ($1,069,000), Europe segment ($510,000), IPG segment ($73,000) and Asia/Pacific segment ($26,000) related to the elimination of certain positions as a result of general restructuring efforts. The savings from these charges have been reflected primarily in reduced selling, general and administrative expenses and manufacturing expenses for the company. Payments for the year ended December 31, 2015 were $3,723,000 and were funded with operating cash flows and cash on hand. The 2015 charges have been paid out.\nTo date, the company's liquidity has not been materially impacted; however, the company's disclosure below in Liquidity and Capital Resources highlights risks that could negatively impact the company's liquidity. See also \"Charges Related to Restructuring Activities\" in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nAsset write-downs to intangible assets. In accordance with ASC 350, Intangibles - Goodwill and Other, the company reviews intangibles for impairment. As a result of the company's 2016 and 2015 intangible reviews, the company did not recognize any intangible write-down charges.\nNet Gain on Convertible Debt Derivatives. For 2016, the company recognized a loss of $2,504,000 related to the convertible note hedge derivative long-term asset and recognized a gain of $3,772,000 related to the convertible debt conversion liability derivative which resulted in a net gain of $1,268,000 related to the fair value of the convertible debt derivatives. See \"Long-Term Debt\" in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this report for more detail.\nInterest. Interest expense increased to $15,875,000 in 2016 from $4,136,000 in 2015, representing a 283.8% increase. This increase was due to the convertible debt issuance in the first quarter of 2016 and, to a lesser extent, capital lease interest expense as a result of the real estate sale and leaseback transaction completed during the second quarter of 2015. Interest income in 2016 was $265,000, as compared to $165,000 in 2015.\nIncome Taxes. The company had an effective tax rate of 45.0% in 2016 compared to an expected benefit of 35% on the continuing operations pre-tax loss and an effective tax rate of 125.3% in 2015 compared to an expected benefit of 35% on the pre-tax loss from continuing operations. The company's effective tax rates in 2016 and 2015 both were unfavorable to the expected U.S. federal statutory rate benefit for those years due to the negative impact of the company not being able to record tax benefits related to losses in those countries which had tax valuation allowances for the year, which more than offset the benefit of foreign income taxed at rates below the U.S. statutory rate. See Income Taxes\u201d in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this report for more detail.\nResearch and Development. The company continued to invest in research and development activities in 2016. The company dedicated funds to applied research activities to ensure that new and enhanced design concepts are available to its businesses. Research and development expenditures, which are included in costs of products sold, decreased to $17,123,000 in 2016 from $18,677,000 in 2015. The expenditures, as a percentage of net sales, were 1.6% and 1.6% in 2016 and 2015, respectively.\n2015 Versus 2014\nNet Sales. Consolidated net sales for 2015 decreased 10.1% for the year, to $1,142,338,000 from $1,270,163,000 in 2014. Foreign currency translation decreased net sales by 8.7 percentage points. Constant currency net sales decreased 1.4% compared to 2014. Higher constant currency net sales in the Europe and Asia/Pacific segments were offset by lower constant currency net sales in the North America/HME and IPG segments. Constant currency net sales for the company, excluding the impact of the divested rentals businesses in the IPG segment, were flat for the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to the prior year. Constant currency net sales is a non-GAAP financial measure - see \"Business Segment Net Sales\" on page I-49.\nEurope\nEuropean net sales decreased 12.1% in 2015 compared to the prior year to $536,463,000 from $610,555,000 as foreign currency translation decreased net sales by 15.6 percentage points. Constant currency net sales increased 3.5% compared to 2014 principally due to increases in sales of mobility and seating, respiratory and lifestyle products.\nI-43\nNorth America/Home Medical Equipment (North America/HME)\nNorth America/HME net sales decreased 6.6% in 2015 versus the prior year to $474,196,000 from $507,867,000, with foreign currency translation decreasing net sales by 1.0 percentage point. Constant currency net sales decreased 5.6% compared to the prior year, as increases in sales of mobility and seating products were more than offset by declines in sales of respiratory and lifestyle products. Net sales in the mobility and seating product category were impacted by the FDA consent decree, which limits production of custom power wheelchairs and seating systems at the Taylor Street manufacturing facility to products having properly completed verification of medical necessity (VMN) documentation. The VMN is a signed document from a clinician, and in some instances a physician, that certifies that the product is deemed medically necessary for a particular patient's condition, which cannot be adequately addressed by another manufacturer's product or which is a replacement of the patient's existing product. In an effort to position the company for improved sales results in the future, during 2015, the company began a transformation of its generalist sales force to one more focused on clinically complex products, which includes the mobility and seating product category. As a result, lifestyle and respiratory product net sales were de-emphasized contributing to lower net sales for these products.\nInstitutional Products Group (IPG)\nIPG net sales decreased 15.2% in 2015 over the prior year to $87,137,000 from $102,796,000 as foreign currency translation decreased sales by 0.8 of a percentage point. Excluding the net sales impact of the divested rentals businesses, constant currency net sales increased 3.7% driven primarily by increases in sales of beds and interior design projects. These increases were partially offset by sales declines in therapeutic support surfaces.\nAsia/Pacific\nAsia/Pacific net sales decreased 9.0% in 2015 from the prior year to $44,542,000 from $48,945,000. Foreign currency translation decreased net sales by 16.5 percentage points. Constant currency net sales increased 7.5% primarily due to sales increases at the company's New Zealand and Australian distribution businesses, and at the company's subsidiary that produces microprocessor controllers.\nGross Profit. Consolidated gross profit as a percentage of net sales was 27.4% in 2015 as compared to 27.3% in 2014. The 2015 gross margin reflects a warranty expense reversal related to recalls of $2,325,000 or 0.2 of a percentage point, recorded in the North America/HME segment. The company's warranty reserve is subject to adjustment as new developments change the company's estimates. The 2014 gross margin reflected an incremental warranty expense for three previously disclosed recalls of $11,493,000 or 0.9 of a percentage point. The incremental warranty expense was recorded in the North America/HME, Europe and Asia/Pacific reporting segments. Excluding the impact of the warranty expense amounts noted previously, the gross margin as a percentage of net sales was 27.2% in 2015 as compared to 28.2% in 2014. The margin decrease was principally related to unfavorable sales mix, foreign exchange and the impact of the divested rentals businesses. The rentals businesses had a higher gross margin as a percentage of net sales than the average gross margin as a percentage of net sales for the overall company. Gross profit as a percentage of net sales for the North America/HME and Asia/Pacific segments was favorable as compared to the prior year with the Europe and IPG segments unfavorable compared to the prior year.\nGross profit in Europe as a percentage of net sales decreased 1.9 percentage points in 2015 from the prior year. The decrease in margin was principally due to unfavorable foreign currency exchange and a negative sales mix, partially offset by reduced warranty expense. The 2014 gross margin reflected an incremental warranty expense of $3,395,000 or 0.6 of a percentage point for a previously disclosed recall.\nNorth America/HME gross profit as a percentage of net sales increased 2.7 percentage points in 2015 from the prior year. The increase in margins was principally due to reduced warranty expense, favorable sales mix and decreased manufacturing costs. The 2015 gross margin reflects a warranty recall expense reversal of $2,325,000 or 0.5 of a percentage point for three recalls compared to incremental warranty recall expense of $6,833,000 or 1.3 of a percentage point in 2014.\nIPG gross profit as a percentage of net sales decreased 7.9 percentage points in 2015 from the prior year. The decrease in margin is primarily attributable to the sale of the rentals businesses (5.4 percentage points) and increased freight costs.\nGross profit in Asia/Pacific as a percentage of net sales increased 1.9 percentage points in 2015 from the prior year. The increase was primarily as a result of reduced warranty expense and a favorable manufacturing costs. The 2014 gross margin included an incremental warranty expense for the power wheelchair joystick recall of $1,265,000, or 2.6 percentage points.\nI-44\nSee Accrued Expenses\u201d in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this report for the total provision amounts and a reconciliation of the changes in the warranty accrual.\nSelling, General and Administrative. Consolidated selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses as a percentage of net sales were 27.9% in 2015 and 30.1% in 2014. The overall dollar decrease was $63,419,000, or 16.6%, with foreign currency translation decreasing expense by $23,891,000 or 6.3 percentage points. Excluding the impact of foreign currency translation, SG&A expenses decreased $39,528,000, or 10.3%. This decrease was primarily attributable to the sale of the rentals businesses in the third quarter of 2015, which lowered SG&A expenses by $15,626,000, and by reduced consulting expense (including regulatory and compliance costs related to quality system improvements), employment costs and product liability expense. These were partially offset by a $4,031,000 write-off of costs associated with a canceled legacy software program based on a change in the North America/HME IT strategy.\nEuropean SG&A expenses decreased by 15.9%, or $22,254,000, in 2015 compared to 2014. Foreign currency translation decreased expense by approximately $18,709,000 or 13.4 percentage points. Excluding the foreign currency translation impact, SG&A expenses decreased by $3,545,000, or 2.5%, primarily in depreciation and amortization expense partially offset by increased employment costs.\nSG&A expenses for North America/HME decreased 9.5%, or $14,673,000, in 2015 compared to 2014, with foreign currency translation decreasing expense by $2,313,000 or 1.5 percentage points. Excluding the foreign currency translation, SG&A expense decreased $12,360,000, or 8.0%, due principally to reduced employment costs, product liability expense and consulting expense, including lower regulatory and compliance costs related to quality systems improvements. These were partially offset by a $4,031,000 write-off of costs in 2015 associated with a canceled legacy software program based on a change in the North America/HME IT strategy. In addition, 2014 included an incremental expense of $958,000 related to the retirement of an executive officer of the company.\nSG&A expenses for IPG decreased by 43.1%, or $17,874,000, in 2015 compared to 2014. Excluding the impact of foreign currency translation, SG&A expenses decreased by $17,881,000, or 43.1%, primarily due to the sale of the rentals businesses, which reduced SG&A expenses by $15,626,000, as well as reduced employment costs.\nAsia/Pacific SG&A expenses decreased 21.5%, or $4,580,000, in 2015 compared to 2014. Foreign currency translation decreased expense by $2,876,000 or 13.5 percentage points. Excluding the foreign currency translation impact, SG&A expenses decreased $1,704,000, or 8.0%, principally as a result of reduced employment costs and depreciation expense.\nSG&A expenses related to the Other Segment decreased by 16.3% or $4,038,000 in 2015 as compared to 2014. The decrease is attributable to lower legal and professional costs as well as decreased employment costs. In addition, 2014 included an incremental expense of $1,800,000 related to the retirement of an executive officer of the company.\nAsset write-downs to intangible assets. As a result of the company's 2015 intangible review, the company did not recognize any intangible write-down charges.\nAs a result of the company's review of intangible assets for 2014, the company recognized intangible write-down charges in the IPG segment of $13,041,000 comprised of a customer list impairment of $12,826,000 and a non-compete agreement of $215,000 as the actual and remaining cash flows associated with the intangibles were less than the cash flows originally used to value the intangibles, primarily driven by reduced net sales. The after-tax and pre-tax impairment amounts were the same for each of the above impairments.\nCharge Related to Restructuring Activities. Charges for the year ended December 31, 2015 totaled $1,971,000 including charges for severance ($1,678,000) and charges principally related to a building lease termination primarily in the North America/HME segment ($293,000). Severance charges were incurred in the North America/HME segment ($1,069,000), Europe segment ($510,000), IPG segment ($73,000) and Asia/Pacific segment ($26,000) related to the elimination of certain positions as a result of general restructuring efforts. The savings from these charges have been reflected primarily in reduced selling, general and administrative expenses and manufacturing expenses for the company. Payments for the year ended December 31, 2015 were $3,723,000 and were funded with operating cash flows and cash on hand. The 2015 charges have been paid out.\nCharges for the year ended December 31, 2014 totaled $11,112,000 including charges for severance ($9,841,000), other charges in IPG and Europe ($1,286,000) principally related to building write-downs and lease termination cost reversals ($15,000). Severance charges were incurred in the North America/HME segment ($4,404,000), Other ($2,978,000), IPG segment ($1,163,000), Asia/Pacific segment ($769,000) and Europe segment ($527,000). The North America/HME segment severance charges were principally related to additional positions eliminated due to lost sales volumes resulting from the impact of the FDA\nI-45\nconsent decree. The Other severance charges related to the elimination of two senior corporate executive positions. IPG segment severance charges related principally to the closure of the London, Ontario facility. Europe and Asia/Pacific severance charges related to the elimination of certain positions as a result of general restructuring efforts. The costs related to the building write-downs related to two plant closures. The savings from these charges have been reflected primarily in reduced selling, general and administrative expenses and manufacturing expenses for the company. Payments for the year ended December 31, 2014 were $11,131,000 and were funded with operating cash flows and the company's revolving credit facility. The majority of the 2014 charges have been paid out other than certain executive charge payments which will be paid out over the next few years.\nThe company's disclosure below in Liquidity and Capital Resources highlights risks that could negatively impact the company's liquidity. See also \"Charges Related to Restructuring Activities\" in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nInterest. Interest expense decreased to $4,136,000 in 2015 from $4,887,000 in 2014, representing a 15.4% decrease. This decrease was attributable primarily to lower average borrowings in 2015 versus 2014, despite an increase in interest expense related to capital leases. Interest income in 2015 was $165,000 as compared to $507,000 in 2014, primarily due to interest income earned in Europe on a VAT receivable in 2014 that did not recur in 2015.\nIncome Taxes. The company had an effective tax rate of 125.3% in 2015 compared to an expected benefit of 35% on the continuing operations pre-tax loss and an effective rate of 8.8% in 2014 compared to an expected benefit of 35% on the pre-tax loss from continuing operations. The company's effective tax rate in 2015 was unfavorable to the expected U.S. federal statutory rate benefit due to the negative impact of the company not being able to record tax benefits related to losses in those countries which had tax valuation allowances for the year, which more than offset the benefit of foreign income taxed at rates below the U.S. statutory rate. The company's effective tax rate in 2014 was unfavorable to the expected U.S. federal statutory rate benefit due to the same reasons, except the company recognized a benefit of $7,175,000 in the U.S. as an intra-period allocation with discontinued operations against a portion of the domestic taxable loss from continuing operations. See Income Taxes\u201d in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this report for more detail.\nResearch and Development. Research and development expenditures, which were included in costs of products sold, decreased to $18,677,000 in 2015 from $23,149,000 in 2014. The expenditures, as a percentage of net sales, were 1.6% and 1.8% in 2015 and 2014, respectively.\nINFLATION\nAlthough the company cannot determine the precise effects of inflation, management believes that inflation does continue to have an influence on the cost of materials, salaries and benefits, utilities and outside services. The company attempts to minimize or offset the effects through its review of pricing, capital expenditure programs designed to improve productivity, alternative sourcing of material and other cost control measures.\nLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\nThe company continues to maintain an adequate liquidity position through its unused bank lines of credit (see Long-Term Debt in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this report) and cash balances, as described below.\nThe company's total debt outstanding, inclusive of the debt discount related to the 4.125% Convertible Senior Subordinated Debentures due 2027 (the \"2027 Debentures\") included in equity in accordance with FSB APB 14-1 as well as the debt discount and fees associated with the 5.00% Convertible Senior Notes due 2021 (the \"2021 Notes\"), increased by $148,178,000 to $196,501,000 at December 31, 2016 from $48,323,000 as of December 31, 2015. The company's balance sheet reflects the impact of ASC 470-20, which reduced debt and increased equity by $311,000 and $1,203,000 as of December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively, related to the 2027 Debentures. The debt discount and fees associated with the 2021 Notes reduced the company's reported debt balance by $29,919,000 and $4,922,000, respectively, as of December 31, 2016. The debt increase in 2016 was principally a result of issuing $150,000,000 aggregate principal amount of 2021 Notes. The company's cash and cash equivalents were $124,234,000 at December 31, 2016, compared to $60,055,000 as of December 31, 2015. At December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the company had zero borrowings outstanding under its revolving credit facility. The increase in cash balances compared to December 31, 2015 was primarily the result of the net proceeds received from the issuance of the 2021 Notes in the first quarter of 2016 and the sale proceeds from the sale of GCM, partially offset by cash flow usage.\nOn February 2, 2017, the company repurchased all of the outstanding $13,350,000 principal amount of 2027 Debentures as the holders exercised their February 1, 2017 right to require the company to repurchase their 2027 Debentures (see Long-Term Debt and Subsequent Event in the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements included in this report).\nI-46\nThe company's borrowing capacity and cash balances were utilized for normal operations during the period ended December 31, 2016. Debt repayments, acquisitions, divestitures, the timing of vendor payments, the granting of extended payment terms to significant national accounts and other activity can have a significant impact on the company's cash flow and borrowings outstanding such that the debt reported at the end of a given period may be materially different than debt levels during a given period. While the company has cash balances in various jurisdictions around the world, there are no material restrictions regarding the use of such cash for dividends within the company, loans or other purposes, except in China where the cash balance as of December 31, 2016 was approximately $7,145,000.\nThe company has an asset-based lending Amended and Restated Revolving Credit and Security Agreement (the Credit Agreement\u201d), which provides for a revolving line of credit, letter of credit and swing line facility for the company's U.S. and Canadian borrowers in an aggregate principal amount of up to $100,000,000 (the \"U.S. and Canadian Credit Facility\") and a similar facility for European borrowers in an aggregate principal amount of up to $30,000,000 (the \"European Credit Facility\") each of which is subject to variable rates and availability based on a borrowing base formula. The initial borrowings under the Credit Agreement were used to repay approximately $17,000,000 in aggregate principal amount of borrowings and terminate the company's previous credit agreement, which was scheduled to mature in October 2015. As determined pursuant to the borrowing base formula for the U.S. and Canadian borrowers, the company's borrowing base including the period ending December 31, 2016 under the U.S. and Canadian Credit Facility of the Credit Agreement was approximately $52,761,000, with aggregate borrowing availability of approximately $32,031,000, taking into account the $5,000,000 minimum availability reserve, then-outstanding letters of credit, other reserves and the $11,250,000 dominion trigger amount noted below. As determined pursuant to the borrowing base formula for the European borrowers, the company's borrowing base including the period ending December 31, 2016 under the European Credit Facility of the Credit Agreement was approximately $18,604,000, with aggregate borrowing availability of approximately $12,229,000, considering the $3,000,000 minimum availability reserve and the $3,375,000 dominion trigger amount noted below. As of December 31, 2016, the combined aggregate borrowing availability under the U.S. and Canadian Credit Facility and the European Credit Facility of the Credit Agreement was $44,260,000. See Long-Term Debt in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more details regarding the Credit Agreement.\nAs a result of entering into the Credit Agreement, the company incurred $2,113,000 in fees, which were capitalized and are being amortized through January 16, 2021. In addition, as a result of terminating the previous credit agreement, which was scheduled to mature in October 2015, the company wrote-off $668,000 in previously capitalized fees in the first quarter of 2015, which is reflected in the expense of the North America / HME segment.\nAs of December 31, 2016, the company was in compliance with all covenant requirements under the Credit Agreement. The Credit Agreement contains customary representations, warranties and covenants including dominion triggers requiring the company to maintain borrowing capacity of not less than $11,250,000 on an given business day or $12,500,000 for five consecutive days related to the U.S. and Canadian borrowers, and $3,375,000 on an given business day or 12.5% of the maximum amount that may be drawn under the European Credit Facility for five consecutive days related to European borrowers, in order to avoid triggering full control by an agent for the lenders of the company's cash receipts for application to the company's obligations under the agreement.\nIf the company is unable to comply with the provisions in the Credit Agreement, it could result in a default, which could trigger acceleration of, or the right to accelerate, the related debt. Because of cross-default provisions in its agreements and instruments governing certain of the company's indebtedness, a default under the Credit Agreement could result in a default under, and the acceleration of, certain other company indebtedness. In addition, the company's lenders would be entitled to proceed against the collateral securing the indebtedness.\nBased on the company's current expectations, the company believes that its cash balances and available borrowing capacity under its Credit Agreement should be sufficient to meet working capital needs, capital requirements, and commitments for at least the next twelve months. Notwithstanding the company's expectations, if the company's operating results decline as the result of pressures on the business due to, for example, currency fluctuations or regulatory issues or the company's failure to execute its business plans, the company may be unable to comply with its obligations under the Credit Agreement, and its lenders could demand repayment of any amounts outstanding under the company's credit facilities.\nIn the first quarter of 2016, the company issued $150,000,000 aggregate principal amount of 2021 Notes in a private offering. The notes bear interest at a rate of 5.00% per year payable semi-annually and will mature in February 2021, unless repurchased or converted in accordance with their terms prior to such date. Prior to August 15, 2020, the notes will be convertible only upon satisfaction of certain conditions and during certain periods, and thereafter, at any time until the close of business on the second scheduled trading day immediately preceding the maturity date. Unless and until the company obtains shareholder approval under applicable New York Stock Exchange rules, the notes will be convertible, subject to certain conditions, into cash. If the company\nI-47\nobtains such shareholder approval, the notes may be settled in cash, the company's common shares or a combination of cash and the company's common shares, at the company's election.\nIn connection with the offering of the 2021 Notes, the company entered into privately negotiated convertible note hedge transactions with two financial institutions (the option counterparties\u201d). These transactions cover, subject to customary anti-dilution adjustments, the number of the company's common shares that will initially underlie the 2021 Notes, and are expected generally to reduce the potential equity dilution, and/or offset any cash payments in excess of the principal amount due, as the case may be, upon conversion of the 2021 Notes. The company entered into separate, privately negotiated warrant transactions with the option counterparties at a higher strike price relating to the same number of the company's common shares, subject to customary anti-dilution adjustments, pursuant to which the company sold warrants to the option counterparties. The warrants could have a dilutive effect on the company's outstanding common shares and the company's earnings per share to the extent that the price of the company's common shares exceeds the strike price of those warrants.\nThe initial net proceeds from the offering of the 2021 Notes were $144,034,000, after deducting fees and estimated offering expenses payable by the company. Approximately $5,000,000 of the net proceeds from the offering was used to repurchase the company's common shares, and $15,600,000 of the net proceeds was used to pay the net cost of the convertible note hedge and warrant transactions. The company incurred $5,966,000 in fees, which were capitalized and are being amortized as interest expense through February 2021, of which all $5,966,000 was paid by December 31, 2016. The company has used, and intends to continue to use the remaining net proceeds from the offering for working capital and general corporate purposes, which may include funding portions of the company's ongoing turnaround and addressing potential risks and contingencies. The net proceeds have allowed the company to invest in new products, people, marketing initiatives and working capital to transform the business and pursue growth.\nThe company also has an agreement with De Lage Landen, Inc. ( DLL\u201d), a third-party financing company, to provide lease financing to the company's U.S. customers. Either party could terminate this agreement with 180 days' notice or 90 days' notice by DLL upon the occurrence of certain events. Should this agreement be terminated, the company's borrowing needs under the Credit Agreement could increase.\nWhile there is general concern about the potential for rising interest rates, the company expects that it will be able to absorb modest rate increases in the months ahead without any material impact on its liquidity or capital resources. For 2016 and 2015, the weighted average interest rate on all borrowings, excluding capital leases, was 4.85% and 3.83%, respectively.\nCAPITAL EXPENDITURES\nThere were no individually material capital expenditure commitments outstanding as of December 31, 2016. The company estimates that capital investments for 2017 will be between $15,000,000 and $20,000,000 compared to actual capital expenditures of $10,151,000 in 2016. The anticipated increase relates primarily to the company's investments to transform the company. The company believes that its balances of cash and cash equivalents and existing borrowing facilities will be sufficient to meet its operating cash requirements and fund required capital expenditures (see \"Liquidity and Capital Resources\"). The Credit Agreement limits the company's annual capital expenditures to $35,000,000.\nCASH FLOWS\nCash flows used by operating activities were $56,613,000 in 2016, compared to cash used of $5,378,000 in the previous year. The 2016 operating cash flows were negatively impacted by net loss, declines in accrued expenses, including tax payments of approximately $12,500,000 related to a previously disclosed liability for uncertain tax positions and current taxes, and accounts payable as well as increased inventory. Operating cash flows in 2016 were positively impacted by a reduction in accounts receivable. Operating cash flows in 2015 were negatively impacted by retirement payments of $24,651,000 related to the retirement of two executive officers of the company.\nCash flows provided by investing activities were $3,649,000 in 2016, compared to $44,376,000 in 2015. Cash flows provided by investing activities in 2016 included net proceeds of $13,829,000 from the sale of GCM. Cash flows provided by investing activities in 2015 included the receipt of $23,000,000 in proceeds from the company's real estate sale leaseback transaction, surrender of corporate-owned life insurance of $11,902,000 to fund payments in 2015 related to the retirement of certain executive officers of the company in 2014 and net proceeds of $13,700,000 from the sale of its rental businesses in July 2015.\nCash flows provided by financing activities in 2016 were $118,549,000 compared to cash flows used of $14,346,000 in 2015. Cash flows provided in 2016 reflect net proceeds received as a result of the issuance of the 2021 Notes, including the net proceeds used for the related convertible note hedge transactions, repurchase of common shares and payment of financing costs.\nI-48\nDuring 2016, free cash flow was negative $66,722,000 compared to free cash flow generation of $10,217,000 in 2015. In 2016 and 2015, free cash flow was negatively impacted by the same items that affected cash flows used by operation activities. In addition, free cash flow in 2015 included a positive free cash flow impact of $23,000,000 as a result of the proceeds from the company's real estate sale leaseback transaction. Excluding the negative impact of $12,500,000 in tax payments, free cash flow in 2016 was negative $54,222,000. Excluding the $23,000,000 positive impact of the real estate sale and leaseback transaction and the $24,651,000 negative impact of the retirement payments noted above, free cash flow in 2015 was positive $11,868,000. Free cash flow is a non-GAAP financial measure that is comprised of net cash used by operating activities less purchases of property and equipment plus proceeds from sales of property and equipment. Management believes that this financial measure provides meaningful information for evaluating the overall financial performance of the company and its ability to repay debt or make future investments (including acquisitions, etc.). The non-GAAP financial measure is reconciled to the GAAP measure as follows (in thousands):\n\nBUSINESS SEGMENT NET SALES\nThe following tables provide net sales change for continuing operations as reported and as adjusted to exclude the impact of foreign exchange translation (constant currency net sales) as well as net sales further adjusted to exclude the impact of the sale of GCM on September 30, 2016 and the sale of the rentals businesses in July 2015, neither of which were deemed discontinued operations for financial reporting purposes. Constant currency net sales\" is a non-GAAP financial measure, which is defined as net sales excluding the impact of foreign currency translation. The current year's functional constant currency net sales are translated using the prior year's foreign exchange rates. These amounts are then compared to the prior year's sales to calculate the constant currency net sales change. Management believes that this financial measure provides meaningful information for evaluating the core operating performance of the company.\nI-49\nTwelve months ended December 31, 2016 compared to December 31, 2015:\n\nTwelve months ended December 31, 2015 compared to December 31, 2014:\n\nI-50\nCONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS\nThe company's contractual obligations as of December 31, 2016 are as follows (in thousands):\n\nThe table does not include any payments related to liabilities recorded for uncertain tax positions as the company cannot make a reasonably reliable estimate as to the timing of any other payments. See Income Taxes in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this report.\nDIVIDEND POLICY\nIt is the company's policy to pay a nominal dividend in order for its stock to be more attractive to a broader range of investors. For 2016, annualized dividends of $0.05 per Common Share and $0.045 per Class B Common Share were declared and paid. It is not anticipated that this annual dividend rate will change materially as the company believes that capital should be kept available for investments and growth opportunities as a result of its multi-year turnaround strategy.\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES\nThe Consolidated Financial Statements included in the report include accounts of the company and all majority-owned subsidiaries. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires management to make estimates and assumptions in certain circumstances that affect amounts reported in the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements and related footnotes. In preparing the financial statements, management has made its best estimates and judgments of certain amounts included in the financial statements, giving due consideration to materiality. However, application of these accounting policies involves the exercise of judgment and use of assumptions as to future uncertainties and, as a result, actual results could differ from these estimates.\nThe following critical accounting policies, among others, affect the more significant judgments and estimates used in preparation of the company's consolidated financial statements.\nRevenue Recognition\nInvacare's revenues are recognized when products are shipped or services provided to unaffiliated customers. Revenue Recognition, ASC 605, provides guidance on the application of generally accepted accounting principles to selected revenue recognition issues. The company has concluded that its revenue recognition policy is appropriate and in accordance with GAAP and ASC 605. Shipping and handling costs are included in cost of goods sold.\nSales are made only to customers with whom the company believes collection is reasonably assured based upon a credit analysis, which may include obtaining a credit application, a signed security agreement, personal guarantee and/or a cross corporate guarantee depending on the credit history of the customer. Credit lines are established for new customers after an evaluation of their credit report and/or other relevant financial information. Existing credit lines are regularly reviewed and adjusted with consideration given to any outstanding past due amounts.\nI-51\nThe company offers discounts and rebates, which are accounted for as reductions to revenue in the period in which the sale is recognized. Discounts offered include: cash discounts for prompt payment, base and trade discounts based on contract level for specific classes of customers. Volume discounts and rebates are given based on large purchases and the achievement of certain sales volumes. Product returns are accounted for as a reduction to reported sales with estimates recorded for anticipated returns at the time of sale. The company does not ship any goods on consignment.\nDistributed products sold by the company are accounted for in accordance with the revenue recognition guidance in ASC 605-45-05. The company records distributed product sales gross as a principal since the company takes title to the products and has the risks of loss for collections, delivery and returns.\nProduct sales that give rise to installment receivables are recorded at the time of sale when the risks and rewards of ownership are transferred. Interest income is recognized on installment agreements in accordance with the terms of the agreements. Installment accounts are monitored and if a customer defaults on payments, interest income is no longer recognized. All installment accounts are accounted for using the same methodology, regardless of duration of the installment agreements.\nAllowance for Uncollectible Accounts Receivable\nThe estimated allowance for uncollectible amounts is based primarily on management's evaluation of the financial condition of the customer. In addition, as a result of the third party financing arrangement, management monitors the collection status of these contracts in accordance with the company's limited recourse obligations and provides amounts necessary for estimated losses in the allowance for doubtful accounts and establishing reserves for specific customers as needed.\nThe company continues to closely monitor the credit-worthiness of its customers and adhere to tight credit policies. In 2013, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services announced new Medicare prices which became effective in July 2013 for the second round of the NCB program, which was expanded to include 91 additional MSAs. In January 2016, CMS began expanding NCB to rural areas which expanded the program to 100% of the Medicare population. While the current NCB program contract pricing continues through the end of 2018, the company believes the changes could have a significant impact on the collectability of accounts receivable for those customers which are in the rural locations impacted and which have a portion of their revenues tied to Medicare reimbursement. In addition, there is a risk that these precedent-setting price reductions could influence other non-CMS payors' reimbursement rates for the same product categories. As a result, this is an additional risk factor which the company considers when assessing the collectability of accounts receivable.\nThe company has an agreement with DLL, a third-party financing company, to provide lease financing to Invacare's U.S. customers. The DLL agreement provides for direct leasing between DLL and the Invacare customer. The company retains a recourse obligation for events of default under the contracts. The company monitors the collections status of these contracts and has provided amounts for estimated losses in its allowances for doubtful accounts.\nInventories and Related Allowance for Obsolete and Excess Inventory\nInventories are stated at the lower of cost or market with cost determined by the first-in, first-out method. Inventories have been reduced by an allowance for excess and obsolete inventories. The estimated allowance is based on management's review of inventories on hand compared to estimated future usage and sales. A provision for excess and obsolete inventory is recorded as needed based upon the discontinuation of products, redesigning of existing products, new product introductions, market changes and safety issues. Both raw materials and finished goods are reserved for on the balance sheet.\nIn general, Invacare reviews inventory turns as an indicator of obsolescence or slow moving product as well as the impact of new product introductions. Depending on the situation, the company may partially or fully reserve for the individual item. The company continues to increase its overseas sourcing efforts, increase its emphasis on the development and introduction of new products, and decrease the cycle time to bring new product offerings to market. These initiatives are potential sources of inventory obsolescence for both raw material and finished goods.\nGoodwill, Intangible and Other Long-Lived Assets\nProperty, equipment, intangibles and certain other long-lived assets are amortized over their useful lives. Useful lives are based on management's estimates of the period that the assets will generate revenue. Under Intangibles-Goodwill and Other, ASC 350, goodwill and intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives are subject to annual impairment tests. The company's measurement date for its annual goodwill impairment test is October 1 and the analysis is completed in the fourth quarter. Furthermore, goodwill and other long-lived assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances\nI-52\nindicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. The majority of the company's goodwill and intangible assets relate to the company's Europe and IPG segments which were profitable in 2016.\nTo review goodwill for impairment in accordance with ASC 350, the company first estimates the fair value of each reporting unit and compares the calculated fair value to the carrying value of each reporting unit. A reporting unit is defined as an operating segment or one level below. The company has determined that its reporting units are the same as its operating segments. The company completes its annual impairment tests in the fourth quarter of each year. To estimate the fair values of the reporting units, the company utilizes a discounted cash flow (DCF) method in which the company forecasts income statement and balance sheet amounts based on assumptions regarding future sales growth, profitability, inventory turns, days' sales outstanding, etc. to forecast future cash flows. The cash flows are discounted using a weighted average cost of capital discount rate where the cost of debt is based on quoted rates for 20-year debt of companies of similar credit risk and the cost of equity is based upon the 20-year treasury rate for the risk-free rate, a market risk premium, the industry average beta and a small cap stock adjustment. The discount rates used have a significant impact upon the discounted cash flow methodology utilized in the company's annual impairment testing as higher discount rates decrease the fair value estimates. The assumptions used are based on a market participant's point of view and yielded a discount rate of 8.67% in 2016 for the company's annual impairment analysis compared to 9.41% in 2015 and 9.89% in 2014.\nThe company also utilizes an Enterprise Value (EV) to Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization (EBITDA) Method to compute the fair value of its reporting units which considers potential acquirers and their EV to EBITDA multiples adjusted by an estimated premium. While more weight is given to the discounted cash flow method, the EV to EBITDA method does provide corroborative evidence of the reasonableness of the discounted cash flow method results.\nIn 2016, 2015 and 2014, the company performed a review for potential impairments of any other assets, including the company's Taylor Street facility which is subject to the FDA consent decree that limits the company's manufacture and distribution of custom power and manual wheelchairs, wheelchair components and wheelchair subassemblies at the Taylor Street facility. The company determined there was no impairment of the property, plant and equipment of the Taylor Street facility based on a comparison of the forecasted undiscounted cash flows to the carrying value of the net assets in accordance with ASC 360. In addition, the company determined there was no impairment of inventory associated with the facility.\nWhile there was no indication of impairment in 2016 related to goodwill for the Europe or IPG segments, a future potential impairment is possible for any of the company's segments should actual results differ materially from forecasted results used in the valuation analysis. Furthermore, the company's annual valuation of goodwill can differ materially if the market inputs used to determine the discount rate change significantly. For instance, higher interest rates or greater stock price volatility would increase the discount rate and thus increase the chance of impairment. In consideration of this potential, the company reviewed the results if the discount rate used were 100 basis points higher for the 2016 impairment analysis and determined that there still would not be any indicator of potential impairment for the segments with goodwill which are Europe and IPG.\nThe company's intangible assets consist of intangible assets with defined lives as well as intangible assets with indefinite lives. Defined-lived intangible assets consist principally of customer lists, developed technology, license agreements, patents and other miscellaneous intangibles such as non-compete agreements. The company's indefinite lived intangible assets consist entirely of trademarks.\nThe company evaluates the carrying value of definite-lived assets whenever events or circumstances indicate possible impairment. Definite-lived assets are determined to be impaired if the future un-discounted cash flows expected to be generated by the asset are less than the carrying value. Actual impairment amounts for definite-lived assets are then calculated using a discounted cash flow calculation. The company reviews indefinite-lived assets for impairment annually in the fourth quarter of each year and whenever events or circumstances indicate possible impairment. Any impairment amounts for indefinite-lived assets are calculated as the difference between the future discounted cash flows expected to be generated by the asset less than the carrying value for the asset.\nDuring 2014, the company recognized intangible write-down charges in the IPG segment of $13,041,000 comprised of a customer list impairment of $12,826,000 and a non-compete agreement of $215,000 as the actual and remaining cash flows associated with the intangibles were less than the cash flows originally used to value the intangibles, primarily driven by reduced net sales. The after-tax and pre-tax impairment amounts were the same for each of the above impairments. The fair value of the customer list was calculated using an excess earnings method, using a discounted cash flow model. Estimated cash flow returns to the customer relationship were reduced by the cash flows required to satisfy the return requirements of each of the assets employed with the residual cash flow then discounted to value the customer relationship. The write-down charges were the result of decisions to exit certain businesses as well as lower than anticipated sales.\nI-53\nProduct Liability\nThe company is self-insured in North America for product liability exposures through its captive insurance company, Invatection Insurance Company, which currently has a policy year that runs from September 1 to August 31 and insures annual policy losses up to $10,000,000 per occurrence and $13,000,000 in the aggregate. The company also has additional layers of external insurance coverage, related to all lines of insurance coverage, insuring up to $75,000,000 in aggregate losses per policy year arising from individual claims anywhere in the world that exceed the captive insurance company policy limits or the limits of the company's per country foreign liability limits, as applicable. There can be no assurance that Invacare's current insurance levels will continue to be adequate or available at affordable rates.\nProduct liability reserves are recorded for individual claims based upon historical experience, industry expertise and other indicators. Additional reserves, in excess of the specific individual case reserves, are provided for incurred but not reported claims based upon actuarial valuations at the time such valuations are conducted. Historical claims experience and other assumptions are taken into consideration by the company in estimating the ultimate reserves. For example, the actuarial analysis assumes that historical loss experience is an indicator of future experience, that the distribution of exposures by geographic area and nature of operations for ongoing operations is expected to be very similar to historical operations with no dramatic changes and that the government indices used to trend losses and exposures are appropriate. Estimates made are adjusted on a regular basis and can be impacted by actual loss awards and settlements on claims. While actuarial analysis is used to help determine adequate reserves, the company is responsible for the determination and recording of adequate reserves in accordance with accepted loss reserving standards and practices.\nWarranty\nGenerally, the company's products are covered by warranties against defects in material and workmanship for various periods depending on the product from the date of sale to the customer. Certain components carry a lifetime warranty. A provision for estimated warranty cost is recorded at the time of sale based upon actual experience. The company continuously assesses the adequacy of its product warranty accrual and makes adjustments as needed. Historical analysis is primarily used to determine the company's warranty reserves. Claims history is reviewed and provisions are adjusted as needed. However, the company does consider other events, such as a product recall, which could warrant additional warranty reserve provision. See Accrued Expenses in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a reconciliation of the changes in the warranty accrual.\nAccounting for Stock-Based Compensation\nThe company accounts for share based compensation under the provisions of Compensation-Stock Compensation, ASC 718. The company has not made any modifications to the terms of any previously granted options and no changes have been made regarding the valuation methodologies or assumptions used to determine the fair value of options granted and the company continues to use a Black-Scholes valuation model. As of December 31, 2016, there was $12,049,000 of total unrecognized compensation cost from stock-based compensation arrangements, which is related to non-vested options and shares, and includes $8,740,000 related to restricted stock awards, $3,134,000 related to performance awards and $175,000 related to non-qualified stock options.\nThe substantial majority of the options awarded have been granted at exercise prices equal to the market value of the underlying stock on the date of grant. Restricted stock awards granted without cost to the recipients are expensed on a straight-line basis over the vesting periods. Performance awards granted are expensed based on estimated achievement of the performance objectives over the relevant performance award periods.\nIncome Taxes\nAs part of the process of preparing its financial statements, the company is required to estimate income taxes in various jurisdictions. The process requires estimating the company's current tax liability, including assessing uncertainties related to tax return filing positions, as well as estimating temporary differences due to the different treatment of items for tax and accounting policies. The temporary differences are reported as deferred tax assets and or liabilities. The company also must estimate whether it will more likely than not realize its deferred tax assets and whether a valuation allowance should be established. Substantially all of the company's U.S., Australia, Switzerland and New Zealand deferred tax assets are offset by a valuation allowance. In the event that actual results differ from its estimates, the company's provision for income taxes could be materially impacted. The company does not believe that there is a substantial likelihood that materially different amounts would be reported related to its critical accounting policies.\nI-54\nAccounting for Convertible Debt and Related Derivatives\nIn the first quarter of 2016, the company issued $150,000,000 aggregate principal amount of the 2021 Notes. In connection with the offering of the 2021 Notes, the company entered into privately negotiated convertible note hedge transactions with two option counterparties. These transactions cover, subject to customary anti-dilution adjustments, the number of the company's common shares that will initially underlie the 2021 Notes, and are expected generally to reduce the potential equity dilution, and/or offset any cash payments in excess of the principal amount due, as the case may be, upon conversion of the 2021 Notes. The company entered into separate, privately negotiated warrant transactions with the option counterparties at a higher strike price relating to the same number of the company's common shares, subject to customary anti-dilution adjustments, pursuant to which the company sold warrants to the option counterparties. The warrants could have a dilutive effect on the company's outstanding common shares and the company's earnings per share to the extent that the price of the company's common shares exceeds the strike price of those warrants. The strike price of the warrants will initially be $22.4175 per share and is subject to certain adjustments under the terms of the warrant transactions.\nThe convertible debt conversion liability and the convertible note hedges are accounted for as derivatives that are fair valued quarterly while the warrants are included as equity. The fair value of the convertible debt conversion liability and the convertible note hedges are estimated using a lattice model incorporating the terms and conditions of the notes and considering, for example, changes in the prices of the company's common shares, company stock price volatility, risk-free rates and changes in market rates. The valuations are, among other things, subject to changes in both the company's credit worthiness and the counter-parties to the instruments as well as change in general market conditions. While the change in fair value of the convertible debt conversion liability and the convertible note hedges are generally expected to move in opposite directions, the net change in any given period may be material.\nRECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS\nFor the company's disclosure regarding recently issued accounting pronouncements, see Accounting Policies - Recent Accounting

key points from the MD&A report:\n\n- Invacare is a medical device company undergoing a multi-year transformation to refocus on more profitable clinically complex rehabilitation products. This has involved reorienting the product portfolio, improving quality systems, and developing talent.\n\n- In 2016, the company made progress on Phase One of the transformation but financial results declined due to investments in the transformation. Net sales decreased 8.3% and the company had a net loss. \n\n- The company issued $150 million in convertible debt in 2016 to provide capital for the transformation. Cash balances increased to $124 million at the end of 2016.\n\n- The company expects Phase One transformation efforts to begin yielding results in late 2017 and more substantive results in 2018. But the company continues to face challenges like regulatory issues, currency fluctuations, and competitive dynamics that could negatively impact liquidity.\n\n- The critical accounting estimates discussed relate to areas like revenue recognition, allowances for uncollectible accounts, inventory reserves, valuation of intangibles and goodwill, product liability reserves, warranties, stock compensation, and income taxes. \n\n- The report also provides details on contractual obligations, capital expenditures, cash flows, and recent accounting pronouncements.\n\nIn summary, the report provides an overview of Invacare's financial performance and position during a transitional period as it executes a turnaround strategy, along with insights into key accounting estimates and policies."}
