MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nYou should read the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations together with our financial statements and the related notes and other financial information included elsewhere in this annual report on Form 10-K. Some of the information contained in this discussion and analysis or set forth elsewhere in this annual report on Form 10-K, including information with respect to our plans and strategy for our business and financing, includes forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. You should carefully review the \"Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\" and \"Risk Factors\" sections of this annual report on Form 10-K for a discussion of important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the results described in or implied by the forward-looking statements contained in the following discussion and analysis.\nOverview\nProduct Portfolio\nWe are a global life sciences company seeking to protect and enhance life by focusing on providing specialty products for civilian and military populations that address accidental, intentional and naturally emerging public health threats. Our company is focused on developing, manufacturing and commercializing medical countermeasures, or MCM, that address public health threats, or PHTs. The PHTs we are addressing fall into two categories: Chemical, Biological, Radiological and Nuclear, or CBRN, as well as explosive-related threats; and emerging infectious diseases, or EID. We have a portfolio of six revenue-generating products, as well as a pipeline of various investigational stage product candidates addressing select aspects of CBRN and EID threats. The U.S. government is the primary purchaser of our products and provides us with substantial funding for the development of many of our product candidates.\nOur marketed products are:\nTable 194: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u00a7 </td> <td> BioThrax\u00ae (Anthrax Vaccine Adsorbed), the only vaccine licensed by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or the FDA, for the general use prophylaxis and post-exposure prophylaxis of anthrax disease.

We have responded to specific Task Order Requests issued by Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority, or BARDA, for the development and manufacture of specific countermeasures as part of our Center for Innovation in Advanced Development and Manufacturing, or CIADM, program focused on imminent public health threats, including a Zika vaccine and an Ebola monoclonal therapeutic.\nIn addition, we provide contract manufacturing services to third-party customers. The majority of these services are performed at our facilities located in Baltimore, Maryland. At these facilities we perform pharmaceutical product development and filling services for injectable and other sterile products, as well as process design, technical transfer, manufacturing validation, laboratory support, aseptic filling, lyophilization, final packaging and accelerated and ongoing stability studies. We manufacture both vial and pre-filled syringe formats for a wide variety of drug products - small molecule and biological - in all stages of development and commercialization, including 20 licensed products, which are currently sold in more than 50 countries. This facility produces finished units of clinical and commercial drugs for a variety of customers ranging from small biopharmaceutical companies to major multinationals. The facility is an approved or inspected manufacturing facility under the regulatory regimes in the United States, Canada, Japan, Brazil, the Middle East and several countries in the European Union.\nContracts and Grants\nWe seek to advance development of our product candidates through external funding arrangements. We may slow down development programs or place them on hold during periods that are not covered by external funding. We have received funding from the U.S. government for a number of our development programs. We continue to actively pursue additional government sponsored development contracts and grants and commercial collaborative relationships. Both governmental agencies and philanthropic organizations may provide development funding or conduct clinical studies of our product candidates.\nManufacturing Infrastructure\nOur Lansing, Michigan, manufacturing location is a vertically-integrated manufacturing facility and the location of our BioThrax manufacturing operations. Building 55 is our large-scale manufacturing facility, which was licensed by the FDA in August 2016 for the manufacture of BioThrax. This facility has the potential to manufacture up to 20 to 25 million doses of BioThrax annually on a single manufacturing train.\nOur manufacturing facilities in Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada are actively engaged in plasma-derived hyperimmune therapeutics manufacturing, chromatography-based plasma fractionation, bacterial fermentation, downstream processing, aseptic filling, packaging and warehousing, quality assurance and control, and include development laboratories and office space. Bulk manufacture of RSDL lotion also occurs in Winnipeg. At these facilities, we manufacture our hyperimmune specialty plasma products, including BAT, VIGIV and Anthrasil. We also manufacture other marketed hyperimmune products for contract manufacturing customers at these facilities.\nOur contract fill/finish services facility is located in Baltimore, Maryland, and is referred to as our \"Camden Site.\" The Camden Site provides pharmaceutical product development and filling services for injectable and other sterile products, as well as process design, technical transfer, manufacturing validations, laboratory support, aseptic filling, lyophilization, final packaging and accelerated and ongoing stability studies support. This facility is an approved or inspected manufacturing facility under the regulatory regimes in the United States, Canada, Japan, Brazil, the Middle East and several countries in the European Union. The facility includes warehousing space used for cold-storage and freezer capacity to support contract manufacturing customers.\nOur manufacturing facility focused on disposable manufacturing for viral and non-viral products is located in Baltimore, Maryland, and is referred to as our \"Bayview Site.\" This facility was designed to take advantage of single-use bioreactor technology and is capable of manufacturing several different products, including products derived from cell culture or microbial systems. In June 2012, we entered into a contract with BARDA, which established our Bayview Site as a Center for Innovation in Advanced Development and Manufacturing, or CIADM. We envision this facility supporting future CIADM development and manufacturing activities for chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear threat countermeasures, as well as our current and future non-CIADM product development and manufacturing needs.\nAptevo Spin-off\nOn August 1, 2016, we completed the spin-off of Aptevo Therapeutics Inc., or Aptevo. As a result of the spin-off, the operating results of Aptevo have been reflected as discontinued operations for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014. See Note 3. \"Discontinued operations\" for further details regarding the spin-off. Unless otherwise stated, financial results herein reflect continuing operations.\nLitigation\nOn July 19, 2016, Plaintiff William Sponn, or Sponn, filed a putative class action complaint in the United States District Court for the District of Maryland, or the Court, on behalf of purchasers of our common stock between January 11, 2016 and June 21, 2016, inclusive, or the Class Period, seeking to pursue remedies under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 against us and certain of our senior officers and directors, collectively, the Defendants. The complaint alleges, among other things, that we made materially false and misleading statements about the government's demand for BioThrax and expectations that our five-year exclusive procurement contract with HHS would be renewed and omitted certain material facts. Sponn is seeking unspecified damages, including legal costs. On October 25, 2016 the Court added City of Cape Coral Municipal Firefighters' Retirement Plan and City of Sunrise Police Officers' Retirement Plan as plaintiffs and appointed them Lead Plaintiffs and Robins Geller Rudman & Dowd LLP as Lead Counsel. On December 27, 2016, the plaintiffs filed an amended complaint that cites the same class period, names the same defendants and makes similar allegations to the original complaint. We filed a Motion to Dismiss on February 27, 2017.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nOur discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses.\nOn an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates and judgments, including those related to accrued expenses, income taxes, stock-based compensation, inventory, in-process research and development and goodwill. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.\nWe believe the following critical accounting policies affect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements.\nRevenue Recognition\nWe recognize revenues from product sales and contract manufacturing if four basic criteria have been met:\nTable 206: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\uf0a7 </td> <td> there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 207: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\uf0a7 </td> <td> delivery has occurred or title has passed to our customer based on contract terms;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 208: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\uf0a7 </td> <td> the fee is fixed or determinable; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 209: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\uf0a7 </td> <td> collectability is reasonably assured.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe have generated BioThrax sales revenues under U.S. government contracts with U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, or HHS and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, or the CDC. Under our current contract with the CDC, we invoice the CDC and recognize the related revenues upon acceptance by the government. At the delivery site the title to the product passes to the CDC.\nFrom time to time, we are awarded reimbursement contracts and grants for development services by government entities and philanthropic organizations. Under these contracts, we typically are reimbursed for our costs as we perform specific development activities, and we may also be entitled to additional fees. Revenue on our reimbursable contracts is recognized as costs are incurred, generally based on the allowable costs incurred during the period, plus any recognizable earned fee. The amounts that we receive under these contracts vary greatly from quarter to quarter, depending on the scope and nature of the work performed. We record the reimbursement of our costs and any associated fees as contracts and grants revenue and the associated costs as research and development expense.\nContracts and grants revenues are subject to the estimation processes to the extent that the reimbursable costs underlying these revenues are incurred but not billed and agreed to on a timely basis, and are subject to change in future periods when actual costs are known. To date we have not made material adjustments to these estimates.\nWe analyze our multiple element revenue-generating arrangements to determine whether the elements can be separated and accounted for individually as separate units of accounting. An item can generally be considered a separate unit of accounting if both of the following criteria are met: (1) the delivered item(s) has value to the customer on a stand-alone basis and (2) if the arrangement includes a general right of return and delivery or performance of the undelivered item(s) is considered probable and substantially in our control. Items that cannot be divided into separate units are combined with other units of accounting, as appropriate. Consideration received is allocated among the separate units based on the unit's relative selling price and is recognized in full when the appropriate revenue recognition criteria are met. We deem services to be rendered if no continuing obligation exists on our part.\nRevenue associated with non-refundable upfront license fees that can be treated as a single unit of accounting is recognized when all ongoing obligations have been delivered. Revenue associated with non-refundable upfront license fees under arrangements where the license fees and any research and development activities cannot be accounted for as separate units of accounting is deferred and recognized as revenue either on a straight-line basis over our continued involvement in the research and development process or based on the proportional performance of our expected future obligation under the contract. Revenues from the achievement of research and development milestones, if deemed substantive, are recognized as revenue when the milestones are achieved, and the milestone payments are due and collectible. If not deemed substantive, we recognize such milestone as revenue on a straight-line basis over the remaining expected term of continued involvement in the research and development process or based on the proportional performance of our expected future obligations under the contract.\nIn May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board, or the FASB, issued Accounting Standards Update, or ASU, No. 2014-09, Summary and Amendments That Create Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606) and Other Assets and Deferred Costs-Contracts with Customers (Subtopic 340-40) (\"ASU No. 2014-09\"). ASU No. 2014-09 supersedes the revenue recognition requirements in Topic 605, Revenue Recognition, as well as most industry-specific guidance, and significantly enhances comparability of revenue recognition practices across entities and industries by providing a principles-based, comprehensive framework for addressing revenue recognition issues. In order for a provider of promised goods or services to recognize as revenue the consideration that it expects to receive in exchange for the promised goods or services, the provider should apply the following five steps: (1) identify the contract with a customer(s); (2) identify the performance obligations in the contract; (3) determine the transaction price; (4) allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract; and (5) recognize revenue when (or as) the entity satisfies a performance obligation. ASU No. 2014-09 also specifies the accounting for some costs to obtain or fulfill a contract with a customer and provides enhanced disclosure requirements. The standard will be effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within that reporting period, which for the Company will be its 2018 first quarter. We are permitted to use either the retrospective or the modified retrospective method when adopting ASU No. 2014-09. We have begun an initial assessment of the potential impact that ASU No. 2014-09 will have on our financial statements and disclosures and believes that there could be changes to the revenue recognition related to our multiple element contracts, primarily those with the U.S. government.\nMergers and Acquisitions\nIn a business combination, the acquisition method of accounting requires that the assets acquired and liabilities assumed be recorded as of the date of the merger or acquisition at their respective fair values with limited exceptions. Assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination that arise from contingencies are recognized at fair value if fair value can reasonably be estimated. If the acquisition date fair value of an asset acquired or liability assumed that arises from a contingency cannot be determined, the asset or liability is recognized if probable and reasonably estimable; if these criteria are not met, no asset or liability is recognized. Fair value is defined as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. Accordingly, we may be required to value assets at fair value measures that do not reflect our intended use of those assets. Any excess of the purchase price (consideration transferred) over the estimated fair values of net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill. Transaction costs and costs to restructure the acquired company are expensed as incurred. The operating results of the acquired business are reflected in our consolidated financial statements after the date of the merger or acquisition. If we determine the assets acquired do not meet the definition of a business under the acquisition method of accounting, the transaction will be accounted for as an acquisition of assets rather than a business combination and, therefore, no goodwill will be recorded. The fair values of intangible assets, including acquired in-process research and development, or IPR&D, are determined utilizing information available near the merger or acquisition date based on expectations and assumptions that are deemed reasonable by management. Given the considerable judgment involved in determining fair values, we typically obtain assistance from third-party valuation specialists for significant items. Amounts allocated to acquired IPR&D are capitalized and accounted for as indefinite-lived intangible assets. Upon successful completion of each project, we will make a separate determination as to the then useful life of the asset and begin amortization. The judgments made in determining estimated fair values assigned to assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination, as well as asset lives, can materially affect our results of operations.\nThe fair values of identifiable intangible assets related to currently marketed products and product rights are primarily determined by using an \"income approach\" through which fair value is estimated based on each asset's discounted projected net cash flows. Our estimates of market participant net cash flows take into consideration the following factors: historical and projected pricing, margins and expense levels, the performance of competing products where applicable, relevant industry and therapeutic area growth drivers and factors, current and expected trends in technology and product life cycles, the time and investment that will be required to develop products and technologies, the ability to obtain marketing and regulatory approvals, the ability to manufacture and commercialize the products, the extent and timing of potential new product introductions by our competitors, and the life of each asset's underlying patent, if any. The net cash flows are then probability-adjusted where appropriate to consider the uncertainties associated with the underlying assumptions, as well as the risk profile of the net cash flows utilized in the valuation. The probability-adjusted future net cash flows of each product are then discounted to present value utilizing an appropriate discount rate.\nThe fair values of identifiable intangible assets related to IPR&D are determined using an income approach, through which fair value is estimated based on each asset's probability-adjusted future net cash flows, which reflect the different stages of development of each product and the associated probability of successful completion. The net cash flows are then discounted to present value using an appropriate discount rate. Intangible assets are tested for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that its carrying amount may not be recoverable.\nContingent Consideration\nWe record contingent consideration associated with both (a) sales based royalties and (b) development and regulatory milestones at fair value. The fair value model used to calculate this obligation is based on the income approach (a discounted cash flow model) that has been risk adjusted based on the probability of achievement of net sales and achievement of the milestones. The inputs we use for determining the fair value of the contingent consideration associated with sales based royalties and development and regulatory milestones are Level 3 fair value measurements. We re-evaluate the fair value on a quarterly basis. Changes in the fair value can result from adjustments to the discount rates and updates in the assumed timing of or achievement of net sales. Any future increase in the fair value of the contingent consideration associated with sales based royalties along with development and regulatory milestones are based on an increased likelihood that the underlying net sales or milestones will be achieved.\nThe associated payment or payments which will therefore become due and payable for sales based royalties associated with marketed products will result in a charge to cost of product sales and contract manufacturing in the period in which the increase is determined. Similarly, any future decrease in the fair value of contingent consideration associated with sales based royalties will result in a reduction in cost of product sales and contract manufacturing. The changes in fair value for potential future sales based royalties associated with product candidates in development will result in a charge to selling, general and administrative expense in the period in which the increase is determined. Similarly, any future decrease in the fair value of contingent consideration associated with potential future sales based royalties for products candidates will result in a reduction in selling, general and administrative expense.\nThe associated payment or payments which will therefore become due and payable for development and regulatory milestones will result in a charge to research and development expense in the period in which the increase is determined. Similarly, any future decrease in the fair value for development and regulatory milestones will result in a reduction in research and development expense.\nIncome Taxes\nUnder the asset and liability method of income tax accounting, deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the differences between the financial reporting and the tax basis of assets and liabilities and are measured using the tax rates and laws that are expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. A net deferred tax asset or liability is reported on the balance sheet. Our deferred tax assets include the unamortized portion of in-process research and development expenses, the anticipated future benefit of net operating losses and other timing differences between the financial reporting and tax basis of assets and liabilities.\nWe have historically incurred net operating losses for income tax purposes in some states and foreign jurisdictions. The amount of the deferred tax assets on our balance sheet reflects our expectations regarding our ability to use our net operating losses and research and development tax credit carryforwards, to offset future taxable income. The applicable tax rules in particular jurisdictions limit our ability to use net operating losses and research and development tax credit carryforwards as a result of ownership changes.\nWe review our deferred tax assets on an annual basis to assess our ability to realize the benefit from these deferred tax assets. If we determine that it is more likely than not that the amount of our expected future taxable income will not be sufficient to allow us to fully utilize our deferred tax assets, we increase our valuation allowance against deferred tax assets by recording a provision for income taxes on our income statement, which reduces net income or increases net loss for that period and reduces our deferred tax assets on our balance sheet. If we determine that the amount of our expected future taxable income will allow us to utilize net operating losses in excess of our net deferred tax assets, we reduce our valuation allowance by recording a benefit from income taxes on our income statement, which increases net income or reduces net loss for that period and increases our deferred tax assets on our balance sheet.\nUncertainty in income taxes is accounted for using a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. We recognize in our financial statements the impact of a tax position if that position is more likely than not of being sustained on audit, based on the technical merits of the position.\nFinancial Operations Overview\nRevenues\nWe have derived a majority of our historical product sales revenues from BioThrax sales to the U.S. government. We are focused on increasing the sales of our products to U.S. government customers and expanding the market for our product portfolio to other customers domestically and internationally. We were a party to a contract with the CDC, an operating division of the HHS, to supply up to approximately 44.75 million, doses of BioThrax to Strategic National Stockpile, or SNS, deliveries under this contract were complete in October 2016. On December 8, 2016, we signed a follow-on contract with the CDC, valued at up to $911 million, to supply approximately 29.4 million doses of BioThrax to the SNS, through September 2021. Also, BARDA issued a notice of intent to procure approximately $100 million of BioThrax for delivery into the SNS within 24 months from the date of contract award, which we anticipate will be in the first half of 2017. This contract will be separate from and in addition to the follow-on procurement contract with CDC. Our total revenues from BioThrax sales were $237.0 million, $293.9 million and $245.9 million for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. For at least the next two to three years, we expect to continue to derive a majority of our product sales revenues from sales of BioThrax to the U.S. government.\nOn September 30, 2016, we were awarded a multi-year contract with BARDA for the advanced development and delivery of NuThrax. The contract, valued at up to approximately $1.6 billion, consists of a five-year base period of performance valued at approximately $200 million to develop NuThrax for post-exposure prophylaxis of anthrax disease and to deliver to the SNS an initial two million doses following Emergency Use Authorization, or EUA, pre-approval by the FDA. We anticipate that the FDA could authorize NuThrax for emergency use as early as 2018, triggering deliveries of NuThrax to the SNS in 2019. The contract also includes procurement options for the delivery of an additional 7.5 million to 50 million doses of NuThrax to the SNS, valued from approximately $255 million to up to $1.4 billion, respectively, and options for an additional clinical study and post-marketing commitments valued at $48 million, which if both were to be exercised in full, would increase the total contract value to up to $1.6 billion.\nWe have received development funding from BARDA, the CDC, Defense Threat Reduction Agency, or DTRA, and National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, or NIAID, for the following development programs:\nTable 210: <table> <tr> <td> Development Programs\n</td> <td> Funding Source\n</td> <td> Award Date\n</td> <td> Performance Period\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Anthrasil\n</td> <td> BARDA\n</td> <td> Sep-05\n</td> <td> 9/2005 - 4/2021\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> BARDA\n</td> <td> Sep-13\n</td> <td> 9/2013 - 9/2018\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> BAT\n</td> <td> BARDA\n</td> <td> May-06\n</td> <td> 5/2006 - 5/2026\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> CIADM\n</td> <td> BARDA\n</td> <td> Jun-12\n</td> <td> 6/2012 - 6/2037\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> GC-072\n</td> <td> DTRA\n</td> <td> Aug-14\n</td> <td> 8/2014 - 8/2017\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Large-scale manufacturing for BioThrax\n</td> <td> BARDA\n</td> <td> Jul-10\n</td> <td> 7/2010 - 7/2017\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> NuThrax\n</td> <td> NIAID\n</td> <td> Aug-14\n</td> <td> 8/2014 - 10/2019\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> BARDA\n</td> <td> Mar-15\n</td> <td> 3/2015 - 8/2017\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> BARDA\n</td> <td> Sep-16\n</td> <td> 9/2016 - 9/2021\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> UV-4B\n</td> <td> NIAID\n</td> <td> Sep-11\n</td> <td> 9/2011 - 9/2017\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> VIGIV\n</td> <td> CDC\n</td> <td> Aug-12\n</td> <td> 8/2012 - 8/2017\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Zika\n</td> <td> BARDA\n</td> <td> Jun-16\n</td> <td> 6/2016 - 12/2018\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOur revenue, operating results and profitability have varied, and we expect that they will continue to vary on a quarterly basis, primarily due to the timing of our fulfilling orders for BioThrax and work done under new and existing grants and development contracts.\nCost of Product Sales and Contract Manufacturing\nThe primary expense that we incur to deliver to our customers our marketed vaccines and therapeutics and to perform for our customers our contract manufacturing operations is manufacturing costs consisting of fixed and variable costs. Variable manufacturing costs consist primarily of costs for materials and personnel-related expenses for direct and indirect manufacturing support staff, contract manufacturing and filling operations, and sales-based royalties. Fixed manufacturing costs include facilities, utilities and amortization of intangible assets. We determine the cost of product sales for products sold during a reporting period based on the average manufacturing cost per unit in the period those units were manufactured. In addition to the fixed and variable manufacturing costs described above, the cost of product sales depends on utilization of available manufacturing capacity.\nThe primary expense that we incur to deliver our medical devices to our customers is the cost per unit of production from our third-party contract manufacturers, costs for materials and personnel-related expenses for direct and indirect manufacturing support staff along with facilities and utilities costs. Other associated expenses include sales-based royalties (which includes fair value adjustments associated with contingent consideration), amortization of intangible assets, shipping, and logistics.\nResearch and Development Expenses\nWe expense research and development costs as incurred. Our research and development expenses consist primarily of:\nTable 211: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u00a7 </td> <td> personnel-related expenses;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 212: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u00a7 </td> <td> fees to professional service providers for, among other things, analytical testing, independent monitoring or other administration of our clinical trials and obtaining and evaluating data from our clinical trials and non-clinical studies;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 213: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u00a7 </td> <td> costs of contract manufacturing services for clinical trial material; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 214: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u00a7 </td> <td> costs of materials used in clinical trials and research and development.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe intend to focus our product development efforts on promising late-stage candidates that we believe satisfy well-defined criteria and seek to utilize collaborations or non-dilutive funding. We plan to seek funding for development activities from external sources and third parties, such as governments and non-governmental organizations, or through collaborative partnerships. We expect our research and development spending will be dependent upon such factors as the results from our clinical trials, the availability of reimbursement of research and development spending, the number of product candidates under development, the size, structure and duration of any clinical programs that we may initiate, the costs associated with manufacturing our product candidates on a large-scale basis for later stage clinical trials, and our ability to use or rely on data generated by government agencies, such as studies involving BioThrax conducted by the CDC.\nSelling, General and Administrative Expenses\nSelling, general and administrative expenses consist primarily of personnel-related costs and professional fees in support of our executive, sales and marketing, business development, government affairs, finance, accounting, information technology, legal and human resource functions. Other costs include facility costs not otherwise included in cost of product sales and contract manufacturing or research and development expense.\nResults of Operations\nYear Ended December 31, 2016 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2015\nRevenue\nTable 215: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> Year ended December 31,\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (in thousands)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Change\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> % Change\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Product sales:\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> BioThrax\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 237,030\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 293,921\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (56,891\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (19\n</td> <td> %)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 59,248\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 35,048\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 24,200\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total product sales\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 296,278\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 328,969\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (32,691\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (10\n</td> <td> %)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Contract manufacturing\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 49,138\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 42,968\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 6,170\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Contracts and grants\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 143,366\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 117,394\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 25,972\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total revenues\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 488,782\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 489,331\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (549\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nProduct sales:\nThe decrease in BioThrax sales was primarily due to the timing of deliveries under our contracts with the CDC, principally due to reduced deliveries in the fourth quarter of 2016 related to the timing of signing our new contract with CDC in December 2016. The increase in other product sales was primarily due to the timing of BAT and VIGIV sales to the SNS, as well as RSDL sales to the Department of Defense, or DoD. BioThrax product sales revenues during the year ended December 31, 2016 consisted of sales to the CDC of $235.8 million and aggregate international and other sales of $1.2 million. BioThrax product sales revenues during the year ended December 31, 2015 consisted primarily of BioThrax sales to the CDC of $292.8 million and aggregate international and other sales of $1.1 million.\nContract manufacturing:\nThe increase in Contract manufacturing revenues was primarily due to the increase of fill/finish services from our facility in Baltimore and our plasma based manufacturing facility in Winnipeg, partially offset by a decrease in contract manufacturing revenue related to the production of an MVA Ebola vaccine candidate in 2015.\nContracts and grants:\nThe increase in Contracts and grants revenues was primarily due to the following:\n\u00a7 increased development funding of $39.1 million related to our CIADM program, including $17.1 million from new CIADM task orders;\n\u00a7 increased development funding of $29.9 million for VIGIV related to plasma collection; and\n\u00a7 increased development funding of $9.4 million related for NuThrax related to preparation for a Phase III clinical trial.\nThese increases were partially offset by decreases in development funding for:\n\u00a7 the Anthrasil program of approximately $37.6 million related to the timing of plasma collection;\n\u00a7 PreviThrax of approximately $8.9 million due to reduced interest by the U.S. government for this product candidate; and\n\u00a7 Large-scale manufacturing of BioThrax of approximately $6.1 million due to completion of the program and FDA licensure of building 55 in August 2016.\nCost of Product Sales and Contract Manufacturing\nCost of product sales and contract manufacturing increased by $23.8 million, or 22%, to $131.3 million for 2016 from $107.5 million for 2015. The increase was attributable to an increase in the BioThrax cost per dose sold associated with lower production yield in the period in which the doses sold were produced along with increased costs associated with the increase Other product sales, partially offset by a decrease in BioThrax sales to the SNS.\nResearch and Development Expense\nResearch and development expenses decreased by $10.9 million, or 9%, to $108.3 million for 2016 from $119.2 million for 2015. This decrease primarily reflects lower contract service costs. Net of contracts and grants revenues, our research and development expenses were fully funded during 2016, resulting in a net contribution from funded development programs of $35.1 million. Net of contracts and grants revenues, we incurred net research and development expenses of $1.8 million during 2015.\nOur principal research and development expenses for 2016 and 2015 are shown in the following table:\nTable 216: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Year ended December 31,\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (in thousands)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Change\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> % Change\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Large-scale manufacturing for BioThrax\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 6,104\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 9,911\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (3,807\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (38\n</td> <td> %)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> BioThrax related programs\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 3,069\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 3,511\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (442\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (13\n</td> <td> %)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> PreviThrax\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 1,324\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 7,152\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (5,828\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (81\n</td> <td> %)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> NuThrax\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 22,478\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 12,560\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 9,918\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Pandemic influenza\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 1,710\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 6,583\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (4,873\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (74\n</td> <td> %)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Anthrasil\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 1,279\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 25,986\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (24,707\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (95\n</td> <td> %)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> BAT\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 3,904\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 4,867\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (963\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (20\n</td> <td> %)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> EV-035 series of molecules\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 6,801\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (6,475\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (95\n</td> <td> %)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> CIADM task orders\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 13,955\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 2,957\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 10,998\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> VIGIV\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 12,019\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 3,060\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 8,959\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Emergard\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 9,000\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 4,643\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 4,357\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 33,122\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 31,155\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 1,967\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 108,290\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 119,186\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (10,896\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (9\n</td> <td> %)\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe decrease in expense for large-scale manufacturing of BioThrax was primarily due to the timing of manufacturing development activities and due to the successful licensure of the large-scale manufacturing facility in August 2016. The decrease in spending for BioThrax related programs was primarily related to the timing of clinical studies to support applications for label expansion for BioThrax. The decrease in expense for PreviThrax was primarily due to the timing of non-clinical studies, and in light of reduced funding by the U.S. government for this product candidate, we determined to cease further development work on our PreviThrax vaccine and expect the spending for PreviThrax will be minimal in the future. The increase in expense for NuThrax was primarily due to the timing of non-clinical animal studies and manufacturing activities. The decrease in spending for Pandemic influenza was primarily due to a $5.0 million milestone payment to VaxInnate Corporation in the third quarter of 2015. The decrease in expense for our Anthrasil program was primarily due to the timing of plasma collection services. The decrease in expense for our BAT program was primarily related to stability testing and plasma collection. The decrease in expense for EV-035 series of molecules was primarily due to pharmacologic and formulation activities and a third quarter 2015 non-cash impairment charge of $9.8 million due to toxicity related issues, partially offset by a net decrease of $3.3 million (2016 vs. 2015) for the contingent consideration associated with the estimated timing and probability of achievement for certain development and regulatory milestones. The increase in expense for CIADM task orders awarded was primarily due to manufacturing development of Ebola monoclonal antibodies. The increase in expense for VIGIV was primarily due to the timing of plasma collection. The increase in expense for Emergard was primarily for device and cartridge supply development. The decrease in spending for our Other activities was primarily for manufacturing development activities.\nSelling, General and Administrative Expenses\nSelling, general and administrative expenses increased by $22.6 million, or 19%, to $143.7 million for 2016 from $121.1 million for 2015. The increase includes costs associated with the restructuring activities at our Lansing, Michigan site, increased professional services to support our strategic growth initiatives, and increased information technology investments.\nTotal Other Expense\nTotal net other expense increased by $0.5 million, or 9%, to $6.3 million for 2016 from $5.8 million for 2015. The increase was primarily attributable to a $0.5 million payment to the Internal Revenue Service for interest related to the audit of 2009 and 2010 federal income tax returns.\nIncome Taxes\nProvision for income taxes decreased by $7.6 million, or 17%, to $36.7 million for 2016 from $44.3 million for 2015. The provision for income taxes for 2016 resulted primarily from our income before provision for income taxes of $99.2 million and an effective annual tax rate of approximately 37%. The provision for income taxes for 2015 resulted primarily from our income before provision for income taxes of $135.7 million and an effective annual tax rate of approximately 33%. The provision for income taxes for 2016 and 2015 reflects net tax credits associated with research and developments activities of $1.6 million and $4.8 million, respectively. The increase in the effective annual tax rate is primarily related to tax on the sale, within our consolidated group, of assets from Canadian subsidiaries to U.S. subsidiaries in preparation of the spin-off of Aptevo, and a valuation allowance charge recorded in its continuing operations related to Aptevo deferred tax assets prior to the distribution. We determined that upon spin-off, the deferred tax assets of Aptevo would be unrealizable. The increase in the effective annual tax rate as a result of the above was partially offset by a release of valuation allowances associated with Canadian Scientific Research and Experimental Development tax credits.\nYear Ended December 31, 2015 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2014\nRevenues\nTable 217: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> Year ended December 31,\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (in thousands)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Change\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> % Change\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Product sales:\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> BioThrax\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 293,921\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 245,905\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 48,016\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 35,048\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 35,940\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (892\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (2\n</td> <td> %)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total product sales\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 328,969\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 281,845\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 47,124\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Contract manufacturing\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 42,968\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 30,944\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 12,024\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Contracts and grants\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 117,394\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 91,677\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 25,717\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total revenues\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 489,331\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 404,466\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 84,865\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nProduct sales:\nThe increase in BioThrax sales was primarily due to the timing of deliveries under our contract with the CDC. BioThrax product sales revenues during the year ended December 31, 2015 consisted of sales to the CDC of $292.8 million and aggregate international and other sales of $1.1 million. BioThrax product sales revenues during the year ended December 31, 2014 consisted primarily of BioThrax sales to the CDC of $242.2 million and aggregate international and other sales of $3.7 million.\nContract manufacturing:\nThe increase in contract manufacturing revenues was primarily due to a full year of revenues from our fill/finish facility in Baltimore and our plasma based manufacturing facility in Winnipeg, both of which we acquired in February 2014. In addition, contract manufacturing revenue increased by $3.8 million due to services related to the production of an MVA Ebola vaccine candidate.\nContracts and grants:\nThe increase in Contracts and grants revenues was primarily due to the following:\n\u00a7 increased development funding of $11.0 million for our Anthrasil program, related to plasma collection;\n\u00a7 increased development funding of $9.4 million related to our CIADM program, including a $5.0 million milestone payment from BARDA and $3.0 million from new CIADM task orders; and\n\u00a7 increased development funding of $4.3 million for VIGIV related to plasma collection.\nCost of Product Sales and Contract Manufacturing\nCost of product sales and contract manufacturing increased by $5.5 million, or 5%, to $107.5 million for 2015 from $102.0 million for 2014. Cost of product sales and contract manufacturing increased primarily due to an increase in the number of BioThrax doses delivered to the CDC, partially offset by decreased costs from RSDL due primarily to the related decrease in sales revenue.\nResearch and Development Expense\nResearch and development expenses increased by $14.5 million, or 14%, to $119.2 million for 2015 from $104.7 million for 2014. This increase primarily reflects higher contract service costs. Net of contracts and grants revenues, we incurred research and development expenses of $1.8 million and $13.0 million, during 2015 and 2014, respectively.\nOur principal research and development expenses for 2015 and 2014 are shown in the following table:\nTable 218: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Year ended December 31,\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (in thousands)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Change\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> % Change\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Large-scale manufacturing for BioThrax\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 9,911\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 13,625\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (3,714\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (27\n</td> <td> %)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> BioThrax related programs\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 3,511\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 7,157\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (3,646\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (51\n</td> <td> %)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> PreviThrax\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 7,152\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 10,737\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (3,585\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (33\n</td> <td> %)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> NuThrax\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 12,560\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 9,428\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 3,132\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Pandemic influenza\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 6,583\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 6,114\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 1,304\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Anthrasil\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 25,986\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 19,513\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 6,473\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> BAT\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 4,867\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 7,351\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (2,484\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (34\n</td> <td> %)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> EV-035 series of molecules\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 6,801\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> -\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 6,801\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> N/A\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> CIADM task orders\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 2,957\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> -\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 2,957\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> N/A\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> VIGIV\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 3,060\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 2,323\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Emergard\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 4,643\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> -\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 4,643\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> N/A\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 31,155\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 35,704\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (4,549\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (13\n</td> <td> %)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 119,186\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 104,721\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 14,465\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe decrease in expense for large-scale manufacturing for BioThrax was primarily due to the timing of manufacturing development activities.

The increase in expense for Pandemic influenza was primarily due to a milestone payment to VaxInnate Corporation. The increase in expense for our Anthrasil program was primarily due to plasma collection services. The decrease in expense for our Botulinum antitoxin program was primarily for stability testing and the timing of plasma collection. The expense for MVA Ebola was primarily due to process development. The expense for EV-035 series of molecules, acquired in December 2014, was primarily due to pharmacologic and formulation activities and a non-cash impairment charge of $9.8 million due to toxicity related issues, partially offset by a $6.3 million reduction of future contingent consideration payable, associated with the estimated timing and probability of achievement for certain development and regulatory milestones, and reduced projected future sales of EV-035. The expense for CIADM task orders awarded in 2015 was primarily due to manufacturing development for a monoclonal antibody. The increase in expense for VIGIV was primarily for plasma collection and stability testing. The expense for Emergard was primarily for device and cartridge supply development. The decrease in spending for our Other activities was primarily due to decreased expense related to our funded pre-clinical product candidates and manufacturing development activities.\nSelling, General and Administrative Expenses\nSelling, general and administrative expenses increased by $12.5 million, or 12%, to $121.1 million for 2015 from $108.6 million for 2014. The increase includes additional post-acquisition selling, general and administrative costs associated with the operations acquired through the acquisition of Cangene in February 2014, along with increased professional services to support our strategic growth initiatives.\nTotal Other Expense\nTotal net other expense increased by $0.8 million, or 16%, to $5.8 million for 2015 from $5.0 million for 2014. The increase was primarily attributable to a $2.7 million decrease in rental income partially offset by a $1.8 million charge for debt issuance costs associated with the termination of our $125 million term loan facility in 2014.\nIncome Taxes\nProvision for income taxes increased by $14.4 million, or 48%, to $44.3 million for 2015 from $29.9 million for 2014.

The provision for income taxes for 2015 and 2014 reflects net tax credits associated with research and developments activities of $4.8 million and $6.0 million, respectively.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nSources of Liquidity\nFrom inception through 2016, we have funded our cash requirements principally with a combination of revenues from sales of BioThrax, debt financing, development funding from government entities, non-government and philanthropic organizations, and collaborative partners, the net proceeds from our initial public offering and the sale of our common stock upon exercise of stock options. We have operated profitably for each of the five years ended December 31, 2016. As of December 31, 2016, we had cash and cash equivalents of $271.5 million.\nAt the closing of the spin-off of Aptevo, we provided to Aptevo cash of $45 million from our cash reserves, along with a commitment in the form of a promissory note to provide another $20 million in funding, which we paid in January 2017.\nCash Flows\nThe following table provides information regarding our cash flows for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014.\nTable 219: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> Year ended December 31,\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (in thousands)\n</td> <td> </td>

changes on cash and cash equivalents.\nNet cash provided by operating activities of $53.6 million in 2016 was primarily due to our net income of $51.8 million, non-cash charges of $38.2 million for depreciation and amortization and $18.5 million for stock-based compensation, partially offset by an increase in accounts receivable of $22.4 million related to the timing of collection of amounts billed primarily to the CDC, a decrease in accounts payable of $14.8 million due to unpaid balances associated with ADM and a $9.0 million increase in inventory primarily due to an increase in BioThrax inventory.\nNet cash provided by operating activities of $44.3 million in 2015 was primarily due to our net income of $62.9 million, non-cash charges of $35.3 million for depreciation and amortization, $15.8 million for stock-based compensation and an increase in accounts payable of $4.7 million associated with increased infrastructure activities and spin-off related liabilities, partially offset by an increase in accounts receivable of $64.4 million related to the timing of collection of amounts billed primarily to the CDC and a $11.3 million increase in inventory due to raw material purchases for RSDL.\nNet cash provided by operating activities of $112.3 million in 2014 was primarily due to our net income of $36.7 million, a decrease in accounts receivable of $21.4 million related to the timing of collection of amounts billed primarily to the CDC, along with the effect of non-cash charges of $12.8 million for stock-based compensation and $32.5 million for depreciation and amortization.\nNet cash used in investing activities of $76.3 million in 2016 was primarily due to our expansion at Bayview CIADM site along with software, infrastructure and equipment investments.\nNet cash used in investing activities of $45.5 million in 2015 was primarily due to software, infrastructure and equipment investments.\nNet cash used in investing activities of $210.1 million in 2014 was primarily due to the acquisition of Cangene for $177.9 million, which is net of $43.6 million of acquired cash, and capital expenditures of $30.7 million for infrastructure and equipment investments.\nNet cash used by financing activities of $18.6 million in 2016 was primarily due to $45.0 million in cash provided to Aptevo on date of distribution, August 1, 2016 that is partially offset by $17.1 million in proceeds from the issuance of common stock pursuant to employee equity plans and $10.6 million in excess tax benefits from exercise of stock options.\nNet cash provided by financing activities of $33.4 million in 2015 was primarily due to $26.0 million in proceeds from the issuance of common stock pursuant to employee equity plans, $11.3 million in excess tax benefits from the exercise of stock options and $2.0 million in proceeds from long-term indebtedness, partially offset by $5.7 million in contingent obligation payments.\nNet cash provided by financing activities of $198.9 million in 2014 was primarily due to net proceeds from our Notes of $241.6 million, $14.1 million in proceeds from the issuance of common stock pursuant to employee equity plans and $6.0 million in excess tax benefits from the exercise of stock options, partially offset by a principal payment on indebtedness of $62.0 million under our revolving credit facility.\nContractual Obligations\nThe following table summarizes our contractual obligations at December 31, 2016:\nTable 220: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Payments due by period\n</td>

prevent us from making a reasonable estimate of the cash obligations under our material license agreements. Because of these uncertainties, the preceding table excludes contingent contractual payments that we may become obligated to make under such agreements. These agreements typically provide for the payment of milestone fees upon achievement of specified research, development and commercialization milestones, such as the commencement of clinical trials, the receipt of funding awards, the receipt of regulatory approvals, and the achievement of sales milestones. The amount of contingent contractual milestone payments that we may become obligated to make is variable based on the actual achievement and timing of the applicable milestones and the characteristics of any products or product candidates that are developed, including factors such as number of products or product candidates developed, type and number of components of each product or product candidate, ownership of the various components and the specific markets affected. The aggregate payments could be as much as approximately $155 million. The success of our efforts to commercialize our product candidates is highly uncertain and depends on many factors, including those set forth in \"Risk Factors-Our business depends on our success in developing and commercializing our product candidates. If we are unable to commercialize these product candidates, or experience significant delays or unanticipated costs in doing so, our business would be materially and adversely affected.\" Even if these efforts are successful, the timing of success is highly unpredictable and variable. The same is true for any contingent contractual royalty payments that we may be obligated to make upon successful commercialization of these product candidates. We do not expect that any such payments would have an adverse effect on our financial position, operations and capital resources because, if payable, we expect that the benefits associated with the achievement of the relevant milestones or the achievement of revenue would offset the burden of making these payments. We are not obligated to pay any minimum royalties under our existing contracts. Deferred income taxes and liabilities for unrecognized income tax benefits are excluded from the above table since they are not contractually fixed as to timing and amount.\nDebt Financing\nOn January 29, 2014, the Company issued $250.0 million aggregate principal amount of 2.875% Convertible Senior Notes due 2021 (the \"Notes\"). The Notes mature on January 15, 2021, unless earlier purchased by the Company or converted. The original conversion rate was equal to 30.8821 shares of common stock per $1,000 principal amount of notes (which is equivalent to a conversion price of approximately $32.38 per share of common stock). The conversion rate is subject to adjustment upon the occurrence of certain specified events but will not be adjusted for accrued and unpaid interest. As of August 1, 2016, certain conversion features were triggered due to the completion of the Aptevo spin-off. The conversion rate under the Notes was adjusted in accordance with the terms of the indenture. Effective August 12, 2016, the conversion rate was adjusted to 32.3860 shares of common stock per $1,000 principal amount of notes (which is equivalent to a conversion price of approximately $30.88 per share of common stock).\nOn December 11, 2013, we entered into a senior secured credit agreement, or the Credit Agreement, with the three lending financial institutions. The Credit Agreement provides for a revolving credit facility of up to $100.0 million through December 11, 2018, or such earlier date required by the terms of the Credit Agreement. As of December 31, 2016 and 2015, no amounts were drawn under the revolving credit facility.\nOur payment obligations under the Credit Agreement are secured by a lien on substantially all of our assets, including the stock of all of the our subsidiaries, and the assets of the subsidiary guarantors, including mortgages over certain of their real properties, including our large-scale vaccine manufacturing facility in Lansing, Michigan and our CIADM facility in Baltimore, Maryland. Under the Credit Agreement, we are required to make quarterly interest payments calculated using a combination of conventional base-rate measures plus a margin over those rates. The base rates consist of LIBOR rates and prime rates. The actual rates will depend on the level of these underlying rates plus a margin based on our leverage, on a consolidated basis, from quarter to quarter.\nThe Credit Agreement, as amended, contains affirmative and negative covenants customary for financings of this type. Negative covenants in the Credit Agreement, among other things, limit our ability to incur indebtedness and liens; dispose of assets; make investments including loans, advances or guarantees; and enter into certain mergers or similar transactions. The Credit Agreement also contains financial covenants, tested quarterly and in connection with any triggering events under the Credit Agreement: (1) a minimum consolidated debt service coverage ratio of 2.50 to 1.00, (2) a maximum consolidated leverage ratio of 3.50 to 1.00 and (3) a minimum liquidity requirement of $50.0 million. Upon the occurrence and continuance of an event of default under the Credit Agreement, the commitments of the lenders to make loans under the Credit Agreement may be terminated and our payment obligations under the Credit Agreement may be accelerated. The events of default under the Credit Agreement include, among others, subject in some cases to specified cure periods, payment defaults; inaccuracy of representations and warranties in any material respect; defaults in the observance or performance of covenants; bankruptcy and insolvency related defaults; the entry of a final judgment in excess of a threshold amount; change of control; and the invalidity of loan documents relating to the Credit Agreement.\nFunding Requirements\nWe expect to continue to fund our anticipated operating expenses, capital expenditures, debt service requirements and any future repurchase of our common stock from the following sources: existing cash and cash equivalents; revenues from product sales; development contracts and grants funding; contract manufacturing services and our revolving credit facility and any other lines of credit we may establish from time to time. There are numerous risks and uncertainties associated with product sales and with the development and commercialization of our product candidates. We may seek additional external financing to provide additional financial flexibility. Our future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including (but not limited to):\nTable 221: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u00a7 </td> <td> our ability to deliver doses under our new BioThrax procurement contract;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 222: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u00a7 </td> <td> the level, timing and cost of product sales;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 223: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u00a7 </td> <td> the extent to which we acquire or invest in and integrate companies, businesses, products or technologies;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 224: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u00a7 </td> <td> the acquisition of new facilities and capital improvements to new or existing facilities;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 225: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u00a7 </td> <td> the payment obligations under our indebtedness;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 226: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u00a7 </td> <td> the scope, progress, results and costs of our development activities;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 227: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u00a7 </td> <td> our ability to obtain funding from collaborative partners, government entities and non-governmental organizations for our development programs;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 228: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u00a7 </td> <td> the extent to which we repurchase our common stock under our share repurchase program; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 229: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u00a7 </td> <td> the costs of commercialization activities, including product marketing, sales and distribution.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nIf our capital resources are insufficient to meet our future capital requirements, we will need to finance our cash needs through public or private equity or debt offerings, bank loans or collaboration and licensing arrangements. In May 2015, we filed an automatic shelf registration statement, which immediately became effective under SEC rules. For so long as we continue to satisfy the requirements to be deemed a \"well-known seasoned issuer\" under SEC rules, this shelf registration statement, effective until May 2018, allows us to issue an unrestricted amount of equity, debt and certain other types of securities through one or more future primary or secondary offerings. If we raise funds by issuing equity securities, our stockholders may experience dilution. Public or bank debt financing, if available, may involve agreements that include covenants, like those contained in our senior secured revolving credit facility, which could limit or restrict our ability to take specific actions, such as incurring additional debt, making capital expenditures, pursuing acquisition opportunities, buying back shares or declaring dividends. If we raise funds through collaboration and licensing arrangements with third parties, it may be necessary to relinquish valuable rights to our technologies or product candidates or grant licenses on terms that may not be favorable to us.\nWe are not restricted under the terms of the indenture governing our senior convertible notes from incurring additional debt, securing existing or future debt, recapitalizing our debt or taking a number of other actions that are not limited by the terms of the indenture governing our notes that could have the effect of diminishing our ability to make payments on our indebtedness. However, our credit facility restricts our ability to incur additional indebtedness, including secured indebtedness.\nCurrent economic conditions may make it difficult to obtain financing on attractive terms, or at all. If financing is unavailable or lost, our business, results of operations and financial condition would be adversely affected and we could be forced to delay, reduce the scope of or eliminate many of our planned activities.\nShare Repurchase Program\nOn July 14, 2016, our board of directors authorized our management to repurchase, from time to time, up to an aggregate of up to $50 million of our common stock under a board-approved share repurchase program. The timing, amount, and price of any repurchases will be made pursuant to one or more 10b5-1 plans. The term of the board authorization of the repurchase program is until December 31, 2017. The plan will permit shares to be repurchased when we might otherwise be precluded from doing so based upon insider trading laws. The repurchase program may be suspended or discontinued at any time. Any repurchased shares will be available for use in connection with our stock plans and for other corporate purposes. As of December 31, 2016, we have neither implemented a repurchase plan nor repurchased any shares under this program.", "item_7_truncated": "ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nYou should read the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations together with our financial statements and the related notes and other financial information included elsewhere in this annual report on Form 10-K. Some of the information contained in this discussion and analysis or set forth elsewhere in this annual report on Form 10-K, including information with respect to our plans and strategy for our business and financing, includes forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. You should carefully review the \"Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\" and \"Risk Factors\" sections of this annual report on Form 10-K for a discussion of important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the results described in or implied by the forward-looking statements contained in the following discussion and analysis.\nOverview\nProduct Portfolio\nWe are a global life sciences company seeking to protect and enhance life by focusing on providing specialty products for civilian and military populations that address accidental, intentional and naturally emerging public health threats. Our company is focused on developing, manufacturing and commercializing medical countermeasures, or MCM, that address public health threats, or PHTs. The PHTs we are addressing fall into two categories: Chemical, Biological, Radiological and Nuclear, or CBRN, as well as explosive-related threats; and emerging infectious diseases, or EID. We have a portfolio of six revenue-generating products, as well as a pipeline of various investigational stage product candidates addressing select aspects of CBRN and EID threats. The U.S. government is the primary purchaser of our products and provides us with substantial funding for the development of many of our product candidates.\nOur marketed products are:\n \u00a7 BioThrax\u00ae (Anthrax Vaccine Adsorbed), the only vaccine licensed by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or the FDA, for the general use prophylaxis and post-exposure prophylaxis of anthrax disease. BioThrax is also licensed by the Paul-Ehrlich-Institut of the German Federal Ministry of Health for general use prophylaxis of anthrax disease; \n \u00a7 Anthrasil\u00ae [Anthrax Immune Globulin Intravenous (Human)], the only polyclonal antibody therapeutic licensed by the FDA for the treatment of inhalational anthrax; \n \u00a7 BAT\u00ae [Botulism Antitoxin Heptavalent (A,B,C,D,E,F,G)- (Equine)], the only heptavalent therapeutic licensed by the FDA and Health Canada for the treatment of botulinum disease; \n \u00a7 VIGIV [Vaccinia Immune Globulin Intravenous (Human)], the only therapeutic licensed by the FDA to address certain complications from smallpox vaccination; \n \u00a7 RSDL\u00ae (Reactive Skin Decontamination Lotion Kit), the only device cleared by the FDA intended to remove or neutralize chemical warfare agents and T-2 toxin from the skin; and \n \u00a7 TrobigardTM (atropine sulfate, obidoxime chloride), an auto-injector device designed for intramuscular self-injection of atropine sulfate and obidoxime chloride, a nerve agent countermeasure. This product has not been approved by the FDA or any other regulatory agency, is not promoted or distributed in the U.S., and is only sold to non-U.S. authorized government buyers. \nOur investigational stage product candidates are:\n \u00a7 NuThraxTM (anthrax vaccine adsorbed with CPG 7909 adjuvant), a next generation anthrax vaccine; \n \u00a7 UV-4B, a novel antiviral being developed for dengue and influenza infections; \n \u00a7 GC-072, the lead compound in the EV-035 series of broad spectrum antibiotics, being developed for Burkholderia pseudomallei; \n \u00a7 FLU-IG (NP025), a human polyclonal antibody therapeutic being developed to treat seasonal influenza; \n \u00a7 ZIKA-IG (NP024), a human polyclonal antibody therapeutic being developed as a prophylaxis for Zika infections; and \n \u00a7 FILOV (NP026), an equine polyclonal antibody therapeutic being developed to treat Ebola infections. \nA unique attribute of our investigational stage product portfolio is that many of our candidates are under an active development contract with significant funding from the U.S. government.\nWe also have programs that leverage our proven manufacturing infrastructure and expertise. We have responded to specific Task Order Requests issued by Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority, or BARDA, for the development and manufacture of specific countermeasures as part of our Center for Innovation in Advanced Development and Manufacturing, or CIADM, program focused on imminent public health threats, including a Zika vaccine and an Ebola monoclonal therapeutic.\nIn addition, we provide contract manufacturing services to third-party customers. The majority of these services are performed at our facilities located in Baltimore, Maryland. At these facilities we perform pharmaceutical product development and filling services for injectable and other sterile products, as well as process design, technical transfer, manufacturing validation, laboratory support, aseptic filling, lyophilization, final packaging and accelerated and ongoing stability studies. We manufacture both vial and pre-filled syringe formats for a wide variety of drug products - small molecule and biological - in all stages of development and commercialization, including 20 licensed products, which are currently sold in more than 50 countries. This facility produces finished units of clinical and commercial drugs for a variety of customers ranging from small biopharmaceutical companies to major multinationals. The facility is an approved or inspected manufacturing facility under the regulatory regimes in the United States, Canada, Japan, Brazil, the Middle East and several countries in the European Union.\nContracts and Grants\nWe seek to advance development of our product candidates through external funding arrangements. We may slow down development programs or place them on hold during periods that are not covered by external funding. We have received funding from the U.S. government for a number of our development programs. We continue to actively pursue additional government sponsored development contracts and grants and commercial collaborative relationships. Both governmental agencies and philanthropic organizations may provide development funding or conduct clinical studies of our product candidates.\nManufacturing Infrastructure\nOur Lansing, Michigan, manufacturing location is a vertically-integrated manufacturing facility and the location of our BioThrax manufacturing operations. Building 55 is our large-scale manufacturing facility, which was licensed by the FDA in August 2016 for the manufacture of BioThrax. This facility has the potential to manufacture up to 20 to 25 million doses of BioThrax annually on a single manufacturing train.\nOur manufacturing facilities in Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada are actively engaged in plasma-derived hyperimmune therapeutics manufacturing, chromatography-based plasma fractionation, bacterial fermentation, downstream processing, aseptic filling, packaging and warehousing, quality assurance and control, and include development laboratories and office space. Bulk manufacture of RSDL lotion also occurs in Winnipeg. At these facilities, we manufacture our hyperimmune specialty plasma products, including BAT, VIGIV and Anthrasil. We also manufacture other marketed hyperimmune products for contract manufacturing customers at these facilities.\nOur contract fill/finish services facility is located in Baltimore, Maryland, and is referred to as our \"Camden Site.\" The Camden Site provides pharmaceutical product development and filling services for injectable and other sterile products, as well as process design, technical transfer, manufacturing validations, laboratory support, aseptic filling, lyophilization, final packaging and accelerated and ongoing stability studies support. This facility is an approved or inspected manufacturing facility under the regulatory regimes in the United States, Canada, Japan, Brazil, the Middle East and several countries in the European Union. The facility includes warehousing space used for cold-storage and freezer capacity to support contract manufacturing customers.\nOur manufacturing facility focused on disposable manufacturing for viral and non-viral products is located in Baltimore, Maryland, and is referred to as our \"Bayview Site.\" This facility was designed to take advantage of single-use bioreactor technology and is capable of manufacturing several different products, including products derived from cell culture or microbial systems. In June 2012, we entered into a contract with BARDA, which established our Bayview Site as a Center for Innovation in Advanced Development and Manufacturing, or CIADM. We envision this facility supporting future CIADM development and manufacturing activities for chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear threat countermeasures, as well as our current and future non-CIADM product development and manufacturing needs.\nAptevo Spin-off\nOn August 1, 2016, we completed the spin-off of Aptevo Therapeutics Inc., or Aptevo. As a result of the spin-off, the operating results of Aptevo have been reflected as discontinued operations for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014. See Note 3. \"Discontinued operations\" for further details regarding the spin-off. Unless otherwise stated, financial results herein reflect continuing operations.\nLitigation\nOn July 19, 2016, Plaintiff William Sponn, or Sponn, filed a putative class action complaint in the United States District Court for the District of Maryland, or the Court, on behalf of purchasers of our common stock between January 11, 2016 and June 21, 2016, inclusive, or the Class Period, seeking to pursue remedies under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 against us and certain of our senior officers and directors, collectively, the Defendants. The complaint alleges, among other things, that we made materially false and misleading statements about the government's demand for BioThrax and expectations that our five-year exclusive procurement contract with HHS would be renewed and omitted certain material facts. Sponn is seeking unspecified damages, including legal costs. On October 25, 2016 the Court added City of Cape Coral Municipal Firefighters' Retirement Plan and City of Sunrise Police Officers' Retirement Plan as plaintiffs and appointed them Lead Plaintiffs and Robins Geller Rudman & Dowd LLP as Lead Counsel. On December 27, 2016, the plaintiffs filed an amended complaint that cites the same class period, names the same defendants and makes similar allegations to the original complaint. We filed a Motion to Dismiss on February 27, 2017.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nOur discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses.\nOn an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates and judgments, including those related to accrued expenses, income taxes, stock-based compensation, inventory, in-process research and development and goodwill. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.\nWe believe the following critical accounting policies affect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements.\nRevenue Recognition\nWe recognize revenues from product sales and contract manufacturing if four basic criteria have been met:\n \uf0a7 there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement; \n \uf0a7 delivery has occurred or title has passed to our customer based on contract terms; \n \uf0a7 the fee is fixed or determinable; and \n \uf0a7 collectability is reasonably assured. \nWe have generated BioThrax sales revenues under U.S. government contracts with U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, or HHS and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, or the CDC. Under our current contract with the CDC, we invoice the CDC and recognize the related revenues upon acceptance by the government. At the delivery site the title to the product passes to the CDC.\nFrom time to time, we are awarded reimbursement contracts and grants for development services by government entities and philanthropic organizations. Under these contracts, we typically are reimbursed for our costs as we perform specific development activities, and we may also be entitled to additional fees. Revenue on our reimbursable contracts is recognized as costs are incurred, generally based on the allowable costs incurred during the period, plus any recognizable earned fee. The amounts that we receive under these contracts vary greatly from quarter to quarter, depending on the scope and nature of the work performed. We record the reimbursement of our costs and any associated fees as contracts and grants revenue and the associated costs as research and development expense.\nContracts and grants revenues are subject to the estimation processes to the extent that the reimbursable costs underlying these revenues are incurred but not billed and agreed to on a timely basis, and are subject to change in future periods when actual costs are known. To date we have not made material adjustments to these estimates.\nWe analyze our multiple element revenue-generating arrangements to determine whether the elements can be separated and accounted for individually as separate units of accounting. An item can generally be considered a separate unit of accounting if both of the following criteria are met: (1) the delivered item(s) has value to the customer on a stand-alone basis and (2) if the arrangement includes a general right of return and delivery or performance of the undelivered item(s) is considered probable and substantially in our control. Items that cannot be divided into separate units are combined with other units of accounting, as appropriate. Consideration received is allocated among the separate units based on the unit's relative selling price and is recognized in full when the appropriate revenue recognition criteria are met. We deem services to be rendered if no continuing obligation exists on our part.\nRevenue associated with non-refundable upfront license fees that can be treated as a single unit of accounting is recognized when all ongoing obligations have been delivered. Revenue associated with non-refundable upfront license fees under arrangements where the license fees and any research and development activities cannot be accounted for as separate units of accounting is deferred and recognized as revenue either on a straight-line basis over our continued involvement in the research and development process or based on the proportional performance of our expected future obligation under the contract. Revenues from the achievement of research and development milestones, if deemed substantive, are recognized as revenue when the milestones are achieved, and the milestone payments are due and collectible. If not deemed substantive, we recognize such milestone as revenue on a straight-line basis over the remaining expected term of continued involvement in the research and development process or based on the proportional performance of our expected future obligations under the contract.\nIn May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board, or the FASB, issued Accounting Standards Update, or ASU, No. 2014-09, Summary and Amendments That Create Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606) and Other Assets and Deferred Costs-Contracts with Customers (Subtopic 340-40) (\"ASU No. 2014-09\"). ASU No. 2014-09 supersedes the revenue recognition requirements in Topic 605, Revenue Recognition, as well as most industry-specific guidance, and significantly enhances comparability of revenue recognition practices across entities and industries by providing a principles-based, comprehensive framework for addressing revenue recognition issues. In order for a provider of promised goods or services to recognize as revenue the consideration that it expects to receive in exchange for the promised goods or services, the provider should apply the following five steps: (1) identify the contract with a customer(s); (2) identify the performance obligations in the contract; (3) determine the transaction price; (4) allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract; and (5) recognize revenue when (or as) the entity satisfies a performance obligation. ASU No. 2014-09 also specifies the accounting for some costs to obtain or fulfill a contract with a customer and provides enhanced disclosure requirements. The standard will be effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within that reporting period, which for the Company will be its 2018 first quarter. We are permitted to use either the retrospective or the modified retrospective method when adopting ASU No. 2014-09. We have begun an initial assessment of the potential impact that ASU No. 2014-09 will have on our financial statements and disclosures and believes that there could be changes to the revenue recognition related to our multiple element contracts, primarily those with the U.S. government.\nMergers and Acquisitions\nIn a business combination, the acquisition method of accounting requires that the assets acquired and liabilities assumed be recorded as of the date of the merger or acquisition at their respective fair values with limited exceptions. Assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination that arise from contingencies are recognized at fair value if fair value can reasonably be estimated. If the acquisition date fair value of an asset acquired or liability assumed that arises from a contingency cannot be determined, the asset or liability is recognized if probable and reasonably estimable; if these criteria are not met, no asset or liability is recognized. Fair value is defined as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. Accordingly, we may be required to value assets at fair value measures that do not reflect our intended use of those assets. Any excess of the purchase price (consideration transferred) over the estimated fair values of net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill. Transaction costs and costs to restructure the acquired company are expensed as incurred. The operating results of the acquired business are reflected in our consolidated financial statements after the date of the merger or acquisition. If we determine the assets acquired do not meet the definition of a business under the acquisition method of accounting, the transaction will be accounted for as an acquisition of assets rather than a business combination and, therefore, no goodwill will be recorded. The fair values of intangible assets, including acquired in-process research and development, or IPR&D, are determined utilizing information available near the merger or acquisition date based on expectations and assumptions that are deemed reasonable by management. Given the considerable judgment involved in determining fair values, we typically obtain assistance from third-party valuation specialists for significant items. Amounts allocated to acquired IPR&D are capitalized and accounted for as indefinite-lived intangible assets. Upon successful completion of each project, we will make a separate determination as to the then useful life of the asset and begin amortization. The judgments made in determining estimated fair values assigned to assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination, as well as asset lives, can materially affect our results of operations.\nThe fair values of identifiable intangible assets related to currently marketed products and product rights are primarily determined by using an \"income approach\" through which fair value is estimated based on each asset's discounted projected net cash flows. Our estimates of market participant net cash flows take into consideration the following factors: historical and projected pricing, margins and expense levels, the performance of competing products where applicable, relevant industry and therapeutic area growth drivers and factors, current and expected trends in technology and product life cycles, the time and investment that will be required to develop products and technologies, the ability to obtain marketing and regulatory approvals, the ability to manufacture and commercialize the products, the extent and timing of potential new product introductions by our competitors, and the life of each asset's underlying patent, if any. The net cash flows are then probability-adjusted where appropriate to consider the uncertainties associated with the underlying assumptions, as well as the risk profile of the net cash flows utilized in the valuation. The probability-adjusted future net cash flows of each product are then discounted to present value utilizing an appropriate discount rate.\nThe fair values of identifiable intangible assets related to IPR&D are determined using an income approach, through which fair value is estimated based on each asset's probability-adjusted future net cash flows, which reflect the different stages of development of each product and the associated probability of successful completion. The net cash flows are then discounted to present value using an appropriate discount rate. Intangible assets are tested for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that its carrying amount may not be recoverable.\nContingent Consideration\nWe record contingent consideration associated with both (a) sales based royalties and (b) development and regulatory milestones at fair value. The fair value model used to calculate this obligation is based on the income approach (a discounted cash flow model) that has been risk adjusted based on the probability of achievement of net sales and achievement of the milestones. The inputs we use for determining the fair value of the contingent consideration associated with sales based royalties and development and regulatory milestones are Level 3 fair value measurements. We re-evaluate the fair value on a quarterly basis. Changes in the fair value can result from adjustments to the discount rates and updates in the assumed timing of or achievement of net sales. Any future increase in the fair value of the contingent consideration associated with sales based royalties along with development and regulatory milestones are based on an increased likelihood that the underlying net sales or milestones will be achieved.\nThe associated payment or payments which will therefore become due and payable for sales based royalties associated with marketed products will result in a charge to cost of product sales and contract manufacturing in the period in which the increase is determined. Similarly, any future decrease in the fair value of contingent consideration associated with sales based royalties will result in a reduction in cost of product sales and contract manufacturing. The changes in fair value for potential future sales based royalties associated with product candidates in development will result in a charge to selling, general and administrative expense in the period in which the increase is determined. Similarly, any future decrease in the fair value of contingent consideration associated with potential future sales based royalties for products candidates will result in a reduction in selling, general and administrative expense.\nThe associated payment or payments which will therefore become due and payable for development and regulatory milestones will result in a charge to research and development expense in the period in which the increase is determined. Similarly, any future decrease in the fair value for development and regulatory milestones will result in a reduction in research and development expense.\nIncome Taxes\nUnder the asset and liability method of income tax accounting, deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the differences between the financial reporting and the tax basis of assets and liabilities and are measured using the tax rates and laws that are expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. A net deferred tax asset or liability is reported on the balance sheet. Our deferred tax assets include the unamortized portion of in-process research and development expenses, the anticipated future benefit of net operating losses and other timing differences between the financial reporting and tax basis of assets and liabilities.\nWe have historically incurred net operating losses for income tax purposes in some states and foreign jurisdictions. The amount of the deferred tax assets on our balance sheet reflects our expectations regarding our ability to use our net operating losses and research and development tax credit carryforwards, to offset future taxable income. The applicable tax rules in particular jurisdictions limit our ability to use net operating losses and research and development tax credit carryforwards as a result of ownership changes.\nWe review our deferred tax assets on an annual basis to assess our ability to realize the benefit from these deferred tax assets. If we determine that it is more likely than not that the amount of our expected future taxable income will not be sufficient to allow us to fully utilize our deferred tax assets, we increase our valuation allowance against deferred tax assets by recording a provision for income taxes on our income statement, which reduces net income or increases net loss for that period and reduces our deferred tax assets on our balance sheet. If we determine that the amount of our expected future taxable income will allow us to utilize net operating losses in excess of our net deferred tax assets, we reduce our valuation allowance by recording a benefit from income taxes on our income statement, which increases net income or reduces net loss for that period and increases our deferred tax assets on our balance sheet.\nUncertainty in income taxes is accounted for using a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. We recognize in our financial statements the impact of a tax position if that position is more likely than not of being sustained on audit, based on the technical merits of the position.\nFinancial Operations Overview\nRevenues\nWe have derived a majority of our historical product sales revenues from BioThrax sales to the U.S. government. We are focused on increasing the sales of our products to U.S. government customers and expanding the market for our product portfolio to other customers domestically and internationally. We were a party to a contract with the CDC, an operating division of the HHS, to supply up to approximately 44.75 million, doses of BioThrax to Strategic National Stockpile, or SNS, deliveries under this contract were complete in October 2016. On December 8, 2016, we signed a follow-on contract with the CDC, valued at up to $911 million, to supply approximately 29.4 million doses of BioThrax to the SNS, through September 2021. Also, BARDA issued a notice of intent to procure approximately $100 million of BioThrax for delivery into the SNS within 24 months from the date of contract award, which we anticipate will be in the first half of 2017. This contract will be separate from and in addition to the follow-on procurement contract with CDC. Our total revenues from BioThrax sales were $237.0 million, $293.9 million and $245.9 million for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. For at least the next two to three years, we expect to continue to derive a majority of our product sales revenues from sales of BioThrax to the U.S. government.\nOn September 30, 2016, we were awarded a multi-year contract with BARDA for the advanced development and delivery of NuThrax. The contract, valued at up to approximately $1.6 billion, consists of a five-year base period of performance valued at approximately $200 million to develop NuThrax for post-exposure prophylaxis of anthrax disease and to deliver to the SNS an initial two million doses following Emergency Use Authorization, or EUA, pre-approval by the FDA. We anticipate that the FDA could authorize NuThrax for emergency use as early as 2018, triggering deliveries of NuThrax to the SNS in 2019. The contract also includes procurement options for the delivery of an additional 7.5 million to 50 million doses of NuThrax to the SNS, valued from approximately $255 million to up to $1.4 billion, respectively, and options for an additional clinical study and post-marketing commitments valued at $48 million, which if both were to be exercised in full, would increase the total contract value to up to $1.6 billion.\nWe have received development funding from BARDA, the CDC, Defense Threat Reduction Agency, or DTRA, and National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, or NIAID, for the following development programs:\nTable 210: <table> <tr> <td> Development Programs\n</td> <td> Funding Source\n</td> <td> Award Date\n</td> <td> Performance Period\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Anthrasil\n</td> <td> BARDA\n</td> <td> Sep-05\n</td> <td> 9/2005 - 4/2021\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> BARDA\n</td> <td> Sep-13\n</td> <td> 9/2013 - 9/2018\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> BAT\n</td> <td> BARDA\n</td> <td> May-06\n</td> <td> 5/2006 - 5/2026\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> CIADM\n</td> <td> BARDA\n</td> <td> Jun-12\n</td> <td> 6/2012 - 6/2037\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> GC-072\n</td> <td> DTRA\n</td> <td> Aug-14\n</td> <td> 8/2014 - 8/2017\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Large-scale manufacturing for BioThrax\n</td> <td> BARDA\n</td> <td> Jul-10\n</td> <td> 7/2010 - 7/2017\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> NuThrax\n</td> <td> NIAID\n</td> <td> Aug-14\n</td> <td> 8/2014 - 10/2019\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> BARDA\n</td> <td> Mar-15\n</td> <td> 3/2015 - 8/2017\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> BARDA\n</td> <td> Sep-16\n</td> <td> 9/2016 - 9/2021\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> UV-4B\n</td> <td> NIAID\n</td> <td> Sep-11\n</td> <td> 9/2011 - 9/2017\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> VIGIV\n</td> <td> CDC\n</td> <td> Aug-12\n</td> <td> 8/2012 - 8/2017\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Zika\n</td> <td> BARDA\n</td> <td> Jun-16\n</td> <td> 6/2016 - 12/2018\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOur revenue, operating results and profitability have varied, and we expect that they will continue to vary on a quarterly basis, primarily due to the timing of our fulfilling orders for BioThrax and work done under new and existing grants and development contracts.\nCost of Product Sales and Contract Manufacturing\nThe primary expense that we incur to deliver to our customers our marketed vaccines and therapeutics and to perform for our customers our contract manufacturing operations is manufacturing costs consisting of fixed and variable costs. Variable manufacturing costs consist primarily of costs for materials and personnel-related expenses for direct and indirect manufacturing support staff, contract manufacturing and filling operations, and sales-based royalties. Fixed manufacturing costs include facilities, utilities and amortization of intangible assets. We determine the cost of product sales for products sold during a reporting period based on the average manufacturing cost per unit in the period those units were manufactured. In addition to the fixed and variable manufacturing costs described above, the cost of product sales depends on utilization of available manufacturing capacity.\nThe primary expense that we incur to deliver our medical devices to our customers is the cost per unit of production from our third-party contract manufacturers, costs for materials and personnel-related expenses for direct and indirect manufacturing support staff along with facilities and utilities costs. Other associated expenses include sales-based royalties (which includes fair value adjustments associated with contingent consideration), amortization of intangible assets, shipping, and logistics.\nResearch and Development Expenses\nWe expense research and development costs as incurred. Our research and development expenses consist primarily of:\n \u00a7 personnel-related expenses; \n \u00a7 fees to professional service providers for, among other things, analytical testing, independent monitoring or other administration of our clinical trials and obtaining and evaluating data from our clinical trials and non-clinical studies; \n \u00a7 costs of contract manufacturing services for clinical trial material; and \n \u00a7 costs of materials used in clinical trials and research and development. \nWe intend to focus our product development efforts on promising late-stage candidates that we believe satisfy well-defined criteria and seek to utilize collaborations or non-dilutive funding. We plan to seek funding for development activities from external sources and third parties, such as governments and non-governmental organizations, or through collaborative partnerships. We expect our research and development spending will be dependent upon such factors as the results from our clinical trials, the availability of reimbursement of research and development spending, the number of product candidates under development, the size, structure and duration of any clinical programs that we may initiate, the costs associated with manufacturing our product candidates on a large-scale basis for later stage clinical trials, and our ability to use or rely on data generated by government agencies, such as studies involving BioThrax conducted by the CDC.\nSelling, General and Administrative Expenses\nSelling, general and administrative expenses consist primarily of personnel-related costs and professional fees in support of our executive, sales and marketing, business development, government affairs, finance, accounting, information technology, legal and human resource functions. Other costs include facility costs not otherwise included in cost of product sales and contract manufacturing or research and development expense.\nResults of Operations\nYear Ended December 31, 2016 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2015\nRevenue\nTable 215: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> Year ended December 31,\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (in thousands)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Change\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> % Change\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Product sales:\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> BioThrax\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 237,030\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 293,921\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (56,891\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (19\n</td> <td> %)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 59,248\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 35,048\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 24,200\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total product sales\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 296,278\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 328,969\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (32,691\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (10\n</td> <td> %)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Contract manufacturing\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 49,138\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 42,968\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 6,170\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Contracts and grants\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 143,366\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 117,394\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 25,972\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total revenues\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 488,782\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 489,331\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (549\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nProduct sales:\nThe decrease in BioThrax sales was primarily due to the timing of deliveries under our contracts with the CDC, principally due to reduced deliveries in the fourth quarter of 2016 related to the timing of signing our new contract with CDC in December 2016. The increase in other product sales was primarily due to the timing of BAT and VIGIV sales to the SNS, as well as RSDL sales to the Department of Defense, or DoD. BioThrax product sales revenues during the year ended December 31, 2016 consisted of sales to the CDC of $235.8 million and aggregate international and other sales of $1.2 million. BioThrax product sales revenues during the year ended December 31, 2015 consisted primarily of BioThrax sales to the CDC of $292.8 million and aggregate international and other sales of $1.1 million.\nContract manufacturing:\nThe increase in Contract manufacturing revenues was primarily due to the increase of fill/finish services from our facility in Baltimore and our plasma based manufacturing facility in Winnipeg, partially offset by a decrease in contract manufacturing revenue related to the production of an MVA Ebola vaccine candidate in 2015.\nContracts and grants:\nThe increase in Contracts and grants revenues was primarily due to the following:\n\u00a7 increased development funding of $39.1 million related to our CIADM program, including $17.1 million from new CIADM task orders;\n\u00a7 increased development funding of $29.9 million for VIGIV related to plasma collection; and\n\u00a7 increased development funding of $9.4 million related for NuThrax related to preparation for a Phase III clinical trial.\nThese increases were partially offset by decreases in development funding for:\n\u00a7 the Anthrasil program of approximately $37.6 million related to the timing of plasma collection;\n\u00a7 PreviThrax of approximately $8.9 million due to reduced interest by the U.S. government for this product candidate; and\n\u00a7 Large-scale manufacturing of BioThrax of approximately $6.1 million due to completion of the program and FDA licensure of building 55 in August 2016.\nCost of Product Sales and Contract Manufacturing\nCost of product sales and contract manufacturing increased by $23.8 million, or 22%, to $131.3 million for 2016 from $107.5 million for 2015. The increase was attributable to an increase in the BioThrax cost per dose sold associated with lower production yield in the period in which the doses sold were produced along with increased costs associated with the increase Other product sales, partially offset by a decrease in BioThrax sales to the SNS.\nResearch and Development Expense\nResearch and development expenses decreased by $10.9 million, or 9%, to $108.3 million for 2016 from $119.2 million for 2015. This decrease primarily reflects lower contract service costs. Net of contracts and grants revenues, our research and development expenses were fully funded during 2016, resulting in a net contribution from funded development programs of $35.1 million. Net of contracts and grants revenues, we incurred net research and development expenses of $1.8 million during 2015.\nOur principal research and development expenses for 2016 and 2015 are shown in the following table:\nTable 216: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Year ended December 31,\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (in thousands)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Change\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> % Change\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Large-scale manufacturing for BioThrax\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 6,104\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 9,911\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (3,807\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (38\n</td> <td> %)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> BioThrax related programs\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 3,069\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 3,511\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (442\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (13\n</td> <td> %)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> PreviThrax\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 1,324\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 7,152\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (5,828\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (81\n</td> <td> %)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> NuThrax\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 22,478\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 12,560\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 9,918\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Pandemic influenza\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 1,710\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 6,583\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (4,873\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (74\n</td> <td> %)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Anthrasil\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 1,279\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 25,986\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (24,707\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (95\n</td> <td> %)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> BAT\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 3,904\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 4,867\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (963\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (20\n</td> <td> %)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> EV-035 series of molecules\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 6,801\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (6,475\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (95\n</td> <td> %)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> CIADM task orders\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 13,955\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 2,957\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 10,998\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> VIGIV\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 12,019\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 3,060\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 8,959\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Emergard\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 9,000\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 4,643\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 4,357\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 33,122\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 31,155\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 1,967\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 108,290\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 119,186\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (10,896\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (9\n</td> <td> %)\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe decrease in expense for large-scale manufacturing of BioThrax was primarily due to the timing of manufacturing development activities and due to the successful licensure of the large-scale manufacturing facility in August 2016. The decrease in spending for BioThrax related programs was primarily related to the timing of clinical studies to support applications for label expansion for BioThrax. The decrease in expense for PreviThrax was primarily due to the timing of non-clinical studies, and in light of reduced funding by the U.S. government for this product candidate, we determined to cease further development work on our PreviThrax vaccine and expect the spending for PreviThrax will be minimal in the future. The increase in expense for NuThrax was primarily due to the timing of non-clinical animal studies and manufacturing activities. The decrease in spending for Pandemic influenza was primarily due to a $5.0 million milestone payment to VaxInnate Corporation in the third quarter of 2015. The decrease in expense for our Anthrasil program was primarily due to the timing of plasma collection services. The decrease in expense for our BAT program was primarily related to stability testing and plasma collection. The decrease in expense for EV-035 series of molecules was primarily due to pharmacologic and formulation activities and a third quarter 2015 non-cash impairment charge of $9.8 million due to toxicity related issues, partially offset by a net decrease of $3.3 million (2016 vs. 2015) for the contingent consideration associated with the estimated timing and probability of achievement for certain development and regulatory milestones. The increase in expense for CIADM task orders awarded was primarily due to manufacturing development of Ebola monoclonal antibodies. The increase in expense for VIGIV was primarily due to the timing of plasma collection. The increase in expense for Emergard was primarily for device and cartridge supply development. The decrease in spending for our Other activities was primarily for manufacturing development activities.\nSelling, General and Administrative Expenses\nSelling, general and administrative expenses increased by $22.6 million, or 19%, to $143.7 million for 2016 from $121.1 million for 2015. The increase includes costs associated with the restructuring activities at our Lansing, Michigan site, increased professional services to support our strategic growth initiatives, and increased information technology investments.\nTotal Other Expense\nTotal net other expense increased by $0.5 million, or 9%, to $6.3 million for 2016 from $5.8 million for 2015. The increase was primarily attributable to a $0.5 million payment to the Internal Revenue Service for interest related to the audit of 2009 and 2010 federal income tax returns.\nIncome Taxes\nProvision for income taxes decreased by $7.6 million, or 17%, to $36.7 million for 2016 from $44.3 million for 2015. The provision for income taxes for 2016 resulted primarily from our income before provision for income taxes of $99.2 million and an effective annual tax rate of approximately 37%. The provision for income taxes for 2015 resulted primarily from our income before provision for income taxes of $135.7 million and an effective annual tax rate of approximately 33%. The provision for income taxes for 2016 and 2015 reflects net tax credits associated with research and developments activities of $1.6 million and $4.8 million, respectively. The increase in the effective annual tax rate is primarily related to tax on the sale, within our consolidated group, of assets from Canadian subsidiaries to U.S. subsidiaries in preparation of the spin-off of Aptevo, and a valuation allowance charge recorded in its continuing operations related to Aptevo deferred tax assets prior to the distribution. We determined that upon spin-off, the deferred tax assets of Aptevo would be unrealizable. The increase in the effective annual tax rate as a result of the above was partially offset by a release of valuation allowances associated with Canadian Scientific Research and Experimental Development tax credits.\nYear Ended December 31, 2015 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2014\nRevenues\nTable 217: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> Year ended December 31,\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (in thousands)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Change\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> % Change\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Product sales:\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> BioThrax\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 293,921\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 245,905\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 48,016\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 35,048\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 35,940\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (892\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (2\n</td> <td> %)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total product sales\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 328,969\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 281,845\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 47,124\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Contract manufacturing\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 42,968\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 30,944\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 12,024\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Contracts and grants\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 117,394\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 91,677\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 25,717\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total revenues\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 489,331\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 404,466\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 84,865\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nProduct sales:\nThe increase in BioThrax sales was primarily due to the timing of deliveries under our contract with the CDC. BioThrax product sales revenues during the year ended December 31, 2015 consisted of sales to the CDC of $292.8 million and aggregate international and other sales of $1.1 million. BioThrax product sales revenues during the year ended December 31, 2014 consisted primarily of BioThrax sales to the CDC of $242.2 million and aggregate international and other sales of $3.7 million.\nContract manufacturing:\nThe increase in contract manufacturing revenues was primarily due to a full year of revenues from our fill/finish facility in Baltimore and our plasma based manufacturing facility in Winnipeg, both of which we acquired in February 2014. In addition, contract manufacturing revenue increased by $3.8 million due to services related to the production of an MVA Ebola vaccine candidate.\nContracts and grants:\nThe increase in Contracts and grants revenues was primarily due to the following:\n\u00a7 increased development funding of $11.0 million for our Anthrasil program, related to plasma collection;\n\u00a7 increased development funding of $9.4 million related to our CIADM program, including a $5.0 million milestone payment from BARDA and $3.0 million from new CIADM task orders; and\n\u00a7 increased development funding of $4.3 million for VIGIV related to plasma collection.\nCost of Product Sales and Contract Manufacturing\nCost of product sales and contract manufacturing increased by $5.5 million, or 5%, to $107.5 million for 2015 from $102.0 million for 2014. Cost of product sales and contract manufacturing increased primarily due to an increase in the number of BioThrax doses delivered to the CDC, partially offset by decreased costs from RSDL due primarily to the related decrease in sales revenue.\nResearch and Development Expense\nResearch and development expenses increased by $14.5 million, or 14%, to $119.2 million for 2015 from $104.7 million for 2014. This increase primarily reflects higher contract service costs. Net of contracts and grants revenues, we incurred research and development expenses of $1.8 million and $13.0 million, during 2015 and 2014, respectively.\nOur principal research and development expenses for 2015 and 2014 are shown in the following table:\nTable 218: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Year ended December 31,\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (in thousands)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Change\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> % Change\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Large-scale manufacturing for BioThrax\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 9,911\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 13,625\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (3,714\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (27\n</td> <td> %)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> BioThrax related programs\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 3,511\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 7,157\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (3,646\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (51\n</td> <td> %)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> PreviThrax\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 7,152\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 10,737\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (3,585\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (33\n</td> <td> %)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> NuThrax\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 12,560\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 9,428\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 3,132\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Pandemic influenza\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 6,583\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 6,114\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 1,304\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Anthrasil\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 25,986\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 19,513\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 6,473\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> BAT\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 4,867\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 7,351\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (2,484\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (34\n</td> <td> %)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> EV-035 series of molecules\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 6,801\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> -\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 6,801\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> N/A\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> CIADM task orders\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 2,957\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> -\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 2,957\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> N/A\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> VIGIV\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 3,060\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 2,323\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Emergard\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 4,643\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> -\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 4,643\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> N/A\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 31,155\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 35,704\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (4,549\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (13\n</td> <td> %)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 119,186\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 104,721\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 14,465\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe decrease in expense for large-scale manufacturing for BioThrax was primarily due to the timing of manufacturing development activities. The decrease in expense for BioThrax related programs primarily reflects the timing of clinical studies to support applications for label expansion for BioThrax. The decrease in expense for PreviThrax was primarily due to the timing of non-clinical studies and in light of reduced funding by the U.S. government for this product candidate, we determined to cease further development work on our PreviThrax vaccine and expect the spending for PreviThrax will be minimal in the future. The increase in expense for NuThrax was primarily due to increased clinical trial activities. The increase in expense for Pandemic influenza was primarily due to a milestone payment to VaxInnate Corporation. The increase in expense for our Anthrasil program was primarily due to plasma collection services. The decrease in expense for our Botulinum antitoxin program was primarily for stability testing and the timing of plasma collection. The expense for MVA Ebola was primarily due to process development. The expense for EV-035 series of molecules, acquired in December 2014, was primarily due to pharmacologic and formulation activities and a non-cash impairment charge of $9.8 million due to toxicity related issues, partially offset by a $6.3 million reduction of future contingent consideration payable, associated with the estimated timing and probability of achievement for certain development and regulatory milestones, and reduced projected future sales of EV-035. The expense for CIADM task orders awarded in 2015 was primarily due to manufacturing development for a monoclonal antibody. The increase in expense for VIGIV was primarily for plasma collection and stability testing. The expense for Emergard was primarily for device and cartridge supply development. The decrease in spending for our Other activities was primarily due to decreased expense related to our funded pre-clinical product candidates and manufacturing development activities.\nSelling, General and Administrative Expenses\nSelling, general and administrative expenses increased by $12.5 million, or 12%, to $121.1 million for 2015 from $108.6 million for 2014. The increase includes additional post-acquisition selling, general and administrative costs associated with the operations acquired through the acquisition of Cangene in February 2014, along with increased professional services to support our strategic growth initiatives.\nTotal Other Expense\nTotal net other expense increased by $0.8 million, or 16%, to $5.8 million for 2015 from $5.0 million for 2014. The increase was primarily attributable to a $2.7 million decrease in rental income partially offset by a $1.8 million charge for debt issuance costs associated with the termination of our $125 million term loan facility in 2014.\nIncome Taxes\nProvision for income taxes increased by $14.4 million, or 48%, to $44.3 million for 2015 from $29.9 million for 2014. The provision for income taxes for 2015 resulted primarily from our income before provision for income taxes of $135.7 million and an effective annual tax rate of approximately 33%. The provision for income taxes for 2014 resulted primarily from our income before provision for income taxes of $84.2 million and an effective annual tax rate of approximately 36%. The provision for income taxes for 2015 and 2014 reflects net tax credits associated with research and developments activities of $4.8 million and $6.0 million, respectively.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nSources of Liquidity\nFrom inception through 2016, we have funded our cash requirements principally with a combination of revenues from sales of BioThrax, debt financing, development funding from government entities, non-government and philanthropic organizations, and collaborative partners, the net proceeds from our initial public offering and the sale of our common stock upon exercise of stock options. We have operated profitably for each of the five years ended December 31, 2016. As of December 31, 2016, we had cash and cash equivalents of $271.5 million.\nAt the closing of the spin-off of Aptevo, we provided to Aptevo cash of $45 million from our cash reserves, along with a commitment in the form of a promissory note to provide another $20 million in funding, which we paid in January 2017.\nCash Flows\nThe following table provides information regarding our cash flows for

changes on cash and cash equivalents.\nNet cash provided by operating activities of $53.6 million in 2016 was primarily due to our net income of $51.8 million, non-cash charges of $38.2 million for depreciation and amortization and $18.5 million for stock-based compensation, partially offset by an increase in accounts receivable of $22.4 million related to the timing of collection of amounts billed primarily to the CDC, a decrease in accounts payable of $14.8 million due to unpaid balances associated with ADM and a $9.0 million increase in inventory primarily due to an increase in BioThrax inventory.\nNet cash provided by operating activities of $44.3 million in 2015 was primarily due to our net income of $62.9 million, non-cash charges of $35.3 million for depreciation and amortization, $15.8 million for stock-based compensation and an increase in accounts payable of $4.7 million associated with increased infrastructure activities and spin-off related liabilities, partially offset by an increase in accounts receivable of $64.4 million related to the timing of collection of amounts billed primarily to the CDC and a $11.3 million increase in inventory due to raw material purchases for RSDL.\nNet cash provided by operating activities of $112.3 million in 2014 was primarily due to our net income of $36.7 million, a decrease in accounts receivable of $21.4 million related to the timing of collection of amounts billed primarily to the CDC, along with the effect of non-cash charges of $12.8 million for stock-based compensation and $32.5 million for depreciation and amortization.\nNet cash used in investing activities of $76.3 million in 2016 was primarily due to our expansion at Bayview CIADM site along with software, infrastructure and equipment investments.\nNet cash used in investing activities of $45.5 million in 2015 was primarily due to software, infrastructure and equipment investments.\nNet cash used in investing activities of $210.1 million in 2014 was primarily due to the acquisition of Cangene for $177.9 million, which is net of $43.6 million of acquired cash, and capital expenditures of $30.7 million for infrastructure and equipment investments.\nNet cash used by financing activities of $18.6 million in 2016 was primarily due to $45.0 million in cash provided to Aptevo on date of distribution, August 1, 2016 that is partially offset by $17.1 million in proceeds from the issuance of common stock pursuant to employee equity plans and $10.6 million in excess tax benefits from exercise of stock options.\nNet cash provided by financing activities of $33.4 million in 2015 was primarily due to $26.0 million in proceeds from the issuance of common stock pursuant to employee equity plans, $11.3 million in excess tax benefits from the exercise of stock options and $2.0 million in proceeds from long-term indebtedness, partially offset by $5.7 million in contingent obligation payments.\nNet cash provided by financing activities of $198.9 million in 2014 was primarily due to net proceeds from our Notes of $241.6 million, $14.1 million in proceeds from the issuance of common stock pursuant to employee equity plans and $6.0 million in excess tax benefits from the exercise of stock options, partially offset by a principal payment on indebtedness of $62.0 million under our revolving credit

prevent us from making a reasonable estimate of the cash obligations under our material license agreements. Because of these uncertainties, the preceding table excludes contingent contractual payments that we may become obligated to make under such agreements. These agreements typically provide for the payment of milestone fees upon achievement of specified research, development and commercialization milestones, such as the commencement of clinical trials, the receipt of funding awards, the receipt of regulatory approvals, and the achievement of sales milestones. The amount of contingent contractual milestone payments that we may become obligated to make is variable based on the actual achievement and timing of the applicable milestones and the characteristics of any products or product candidates that are developed, including factors such as number of products or product candidates developed, type and number of components of each product or product candidate, ownership of the various components and the specific markets affected. The aggregate payments could be as much as approximately $155 million. The success of our efforts to commercialize our product candidates is highly uncertain and depends on many factors, including those set forth in \"Risk Factors-Our business depends on our success in developing and commercializing our product candidates. If we are unable to commercialize these product candidates, or experience significant delays or unanticipated costs in doing so, our business would be materially and adversely affected.\" Even if these efforts are successful, the timing of success is highly unpredictable and variable. The same is true for any contingent contractual royalty payments that we may be obligated to make upon successful commercialization of these product candidates. We do not expect that any such payments would have an adverse effect on our financial position, operations and capital resources because, if payable, we expect that the benefits associated with the achievement of the relevant milestones or the achievement of revenue would offset the burden of making these payments. We are not obligated to pay any minimum royalties under our existing contracts. Deferred income taxes and liabilities for unrecognized income tax benefits are excluded from the above table since they are not contractually fixed as to timing and amount.\nDebt Financing\nOn January 29, 2014, the Company issued $250.0 million aggregate principal amount of 2.875% Convertible Senior Notes due 2021 (the \"Notes\"). The Notes mature on January 15, 2021, unless earlier purchased by the Company or converted. The original conversion rate was equal to 30.8821 shares of common stock per $1,000 principal amount of notes (which is equivalent to a conversion price of approximately $32.38 per share of common stock). The conversion rate is subject to adjustment upon the occurrence of certain specified events but will not be adjusted for accrued and unpaid interest. As of August 1, 2016, certain conversion features were triggered due to the completion of the Aptevo spin-off. The conversion rate under the Notes was adjusted in accordance with the terms of the indenture. Effective August 12, 2016, the conversion rate was adjusted to 32.3860 shares of common stock per $1,000 principal amount of notes (which is equivalent to a conversion price of approximately $30.88 per share of common stock).\nOn December 11, 2013, we entered into a senior secured credit agreement, or the Credit Agreement, with the three lending financial institutions. The Credit Agreement provides for a revolving credit facility of up to $100.0 million through December 11, 2018, or such earlier date required by the terms of the Credit Agreement. As of December 31, 2016 and 2015, no amounts were drawn under the revolving credit facility.\nOur payment obligations under the Credit Agreement are secured by a lien on substantially all of our assets, including the stock of all of the our subsidiaries, and the assets of the subsidiary guarantors, including mortgages over certain of their real properties, including our large-scale vaccine manufacturing facility in Lansing, Michigan and our CIADM facility in Baltimore, Maryland. Under the Credit Agreement, we are required to make quarterly interest payments calculated using a combination of conventional base-rate measures plus a margin over those rates. The base rates consist of LIBOR rates and prime rates. The actual rates will depend on the level of these underlying rates plus a margin based on our leverage, on a consolidated basis, from quarter to quarter.\nThe Credit Agreement, as amended, contains affirmative and negative covenants customary for financings of this type. Negative covenants in the Credit Agreement, among other things, limit our ability to incur indebtedness and liens; dispose of assets; make investments including loans, advances or guarantees; and enter into certain mergers or similar transactions. The Credit Agreement also contains financial covenants, tested quarterly and in connection with any triggering events under the Credit Agreement: (1) a minimum consolidated debt service coverage ratio of 2.50 to 1.00, (2) a maximum consolidated leverage ratio of 3.50 to 1.00 and (3) a minimum liquidity requirement of $50.0 million. Upon the occurrence and continuance of an event of default under the Credit Agreement, the commitments of the lenders to make loans under the Credit Agreement may be terminated and our payment obligations under the Credit Agreement may be accelerated. The events of default under the Credit Agreement include, among others, subject in some cases to specified cure periods, payment defaults; inaccuracy of representations and warranties in any material respect; defaults in the observance or performance of covenants; bankruptcy and insolvency related defaults; the entry of a final judgment in excess of a threshold amount; change of control; and the invalidity of loan documents relating to the Credit Agreement.\nFunding Requirements\nWe expect to continue to fund our anticipated operating expenses, capital expenditures, debt service requirements and any future repurchase of our common stock from the following sources: existing cash and cash equivalents; revenues from product sales; development contracts and grants funding; contract manufacturing services and our revolving credit facility and any other lines of credit we may establish from time to time. There are numerous risks and uncertainties associated with product sales and with the development and commercialization of our product candidates. We may seek additional external financing to provide additional financial flexibility. Our future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including (but not limited to):\n \u00a7 our ability to deliver doses under our new BioThrax procurement contract; \n \u00a7 the level, timing and cost of product sales; \n \u00a7 the extent to which we acquire or invest in and integrate companies, businesses, products or technologies; \n \u00a7 the acquisition of new facilities and capital improvements to new or existing facilities; \n \u00a7 the payment obligations under our indebtedness; \n \u00a7 the scope, progress, results and costs of our development activities; \n \u00a7 our ability to obtain funding from collaborative partners, government entities and non-governmental organizations for our development programs; \n \u00a7 the extent to which we repurchase our common stock under our share repurchase program; and \n \u00a7 the costs of commercialization activities, including product marketing, sales and distribution. \nIf our capital resources are insufficient to meet our future capital requirements, we will need to finance our cash needs through public or private equity or debt offerings, bank loans or collaboration and licensing arrangements. In May 2015, we filed an automatic shelf registration statement, which immediately became effective under SEC rules. For so long as we continue to satisfy the requirements to be deemed a \"well-known seasoned issuer\" under SEC rules, this shelf registration statement, effective until May 2018, allows us to issue an unrestricted amount of equity, debt and certain other types of securities through one or more future primary or secondary offerings. If we raise funds by issuing equity securities, our stockholders may experience dilution. Public or bank debt financing, if available, may involve agreements that include covenants, like those contained in our senior secured revolving credit facility, which could limit or restrict our ability to take specific actions, such as incurring additional debt, making capital expenditures, pursuing acquisition opportunities, buying back shares or declaring dividends. If we raise funds through collaboration and licensing arrangements with third parties, it may be necessary to relinquish valuable rights to our technologies or product candidates or grant licenses on terms that may not be favorable to us.\nWe are not restricted under the terms of the indenture governing our senior convertible notes from incurring additional debt, securing existing or future debt, recapitalizing our debt or taking a number of other actions that are not limited by the terms of the indenture governing our notes that could have the effect of diminishing our ability to make payments on our indebtedness. However, our credit facility restricts our ability to incur additional indebtedness, including secured indebtedness.\nCurrent economic conditions may make it difficult to obtain financing on attractive terms, or at all. If financing is unavailable or lost, our business, results of operations and financial condition would be adversely affected and we could be forced to delay, reduce the scope of or eliminate many of our planned activities.\nShare Repurchase Program\nOn July 14, 2016, our board of directors authorized our management to repurchase, from time to time, up to an aggregate of up to $50 million of our common stock under a board-approved share repurchase program. The timing, amount, and price of any repurchases will be made pursuant to one or more 10b5-1 plans. The term of the board authorization of the repurchase program is until December 31, 2017. The plan will permit shares to be repurchased when we might otherwise be precluded from doing so based upon insider trading laws. The repurchase program may be suspended or discontinued at any time. Any repurchased shares will be available for use in connection with our stock plans and for other corporate purposes. As of December 31, 2016, we have neither implemented a repurchase plan nor repurchased any shares under this program.", "item_7_text": "ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nYou should read the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations together with our financial statements and the related notes and other financial information included elsewhere in this annual report on Form 10-K. Some of the information contained in this discussion and analysis or set forth elsewhere in this annual report on Form 10-K, including information with respect to our plans and strategy for our business and financing, includes forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. You should carefully review the \"Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\" and \"Risk Factors\" sections of this annual report on Form 10-K for a discussion of important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the results described in or implied by the forward-looking statements contained in the following discussion and analysis.\nOverview\nProduct Portfolio\nWe are a global life sciences company seeking to protect and enhance life by focusing on providing specialty products for civilian and military populations that address accidental, intentional and naturally emerging public health threats. Our company is focused on developing, manufacturing and commercializing medical countermeasures, or MCM, that address public health threats, or PHTs. The PHTs we are addressing fall into two categories: Chemical, Biological, Radiological and Nuclear, or CBRN, as well as explosive-related threats; and emerging infectious diseases, or EID. We have a portfolio of six revenue-generating products, as well as a pipeline of various investigational stage product candidates addressing select aspects of CBRN and EID threats. The U.S. government is the primary purchaser of our products and provides us with substantial funding for the development of many of our product candidates.\nOur marketed products are:\n \u00a7 BioThrax\u00ae (Anthrax Vaccine Adsorbed), the only vaccine licensed by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or the FDA, for the general use prophylaxis and post-exposure prophylaxis of anthrax disease. BioThrax is also licensed by the Paul-Ehrlich-Institut of the German Federal Ministry of Health for general use prophylaxis of anthrax disease; \n \u00a7 Anthrasil\u00ae [Anthrax Immune Globulin Intravenous (Human)], the only polyclonal antibody therapeutic licensed by the FDA for the treatment of inhalational anthrax; \n \u00a7 BAT\u00ae [Botulism Antitoxin Heptavalent (A,B,C,D,E,F,G)- (Equine)], the only heptavalent therapeutic licensed by the FDA and Health Canada for the treatment of botulinum disease; \n \u00a7 VIGIV [Vaccinia Immune Globulin Intravenous (Human)], the only therapeutic licensed by the FDA to address certain complications from smallpox vaccination; \n \u00a7 RSDL\u00ae (Reactive Skin Decontamination Lotion Kit), the only device cleared by the FDA intended to remove or neutralize chemical warfare agents and T-2 toxin from the skin; and \n \u00a7 TrobigardTM (atropine sulfate, obidoxime chloride), an auto-injector device designed for intramuscular self-injection of atropine sulfate and obidoxime chloride, a nerve agent countermeasure. This product has not been approved by the FDA or any other regulatory agency, is not promoted or distributed in the U.S., and is only sold to non-U.S. authorized government buyers. \nOur investigational stage product candidates are:\n \u00a7 NuThraxTM (anthrax vaccine adsorbed with CPG 7909 adjuvant), a next generation anthrax vaccine; \n \u00a7 UV-4B, a novel antiviral being developed for dengue and influenza infections; \n \u00a7 GC-072, the lead compound in the EV-035 series of broad spectrum antibiotics, being developed for Burkholderia pseudomallei; \n \u00a7 FLU-IG (NP025), a human polyclonal antibody therapeutic being developed to treat seasonal influenza; \n \u00a7 ZIKA-IG (NP024), a human polyclonal antibody therapeutic being developed as a prophylaxis for Zika infections; and \n \u00a7 FILOV (NP026), an equine polyclonal antibody therapeutic being developed to treat Ebola infections. \nA unique attribute of our investigational stage product portfolio is that many of our candidates are under an active development contract with significant funding from the U.S. government.\nWe also have programs that leverage our proven manufacturing infrastructure and expertise. We have responded to specific Task Order Requests issued by Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority, or BARDA, for the development and manufacture of specific countermeasures as part of our Center for Innovation in Advanced Development and Manufacturing, or CIADM, program focused on imminent public health threats, including a Zika vaccine and an Ebola monoclonal therapeutic.\nIn addition, we provide contract manufacturing services to third-party customers. The majority of these services are performed at our facilities located in Baltimore, Maryland. At these facilities we perform pharmaceutical product development and filling services for injectable and other sterile products, as well as process design, technical transfer, manufacturing validation, laboratory support, aseptic filling, lyophilization, final packaging and accelerated and ongoing stability studies. We manufacture both vial and pre-filled syringe formats for a wide variety of drug products - small molecule and biological - in all stages of development and commercialization, including 20 licensed products, which are currently sold in more than 50 countries. This facility produces finished units of clinical and commercial drugs for a variety of customers ranging from small biopharmaceutical companies to major multinationals. The facility is an approved or inspected manufacturing facility under the regulatory regimes in the United States, Canada, Japan, Brazil, the Middle East and several countries in the European Union.\nContracts and Grants\nWe seek to advance development of our product candidates through external funding arrangements. We may slow down development programs or place them on hold during periods that are not covered by external funding. We have received funding from the U.S. government for a number of our development programs. We continue to actively pursue additional government sponsored development contracts and grants and commercial collaborative relationships. Both governmental agencies and philanthropic organizations may provide development funding or conduct clinical studies of our product candidates.\nManufacturing Infrastructure\nOur Lansing, Michigan, manufacturing location is a vertically-integrated manufacturing facility and the location of our BioThrax manufacturing operations. Building 55 is our large-scale manufacturing facility, which was licensed by the FDA in August 2016 for the manufacture of BioThrax. This facility has the potential to manufacture up to 20 to 25 million doses of BioThrax annually on a single manufacturing train.\nOur manufacturing facilities in Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada are actively engaged in plasma-derived hyperimmune therapeutics manufacturing, chromatography-based plasma fractionation, bacterial fermentation, downstream processing, aseptic filling, packaging and warehousing, quality assurance and control, and include development laboratories and office space. Bulk manufacture of RSDL lotion also occurs in Winnipeg. At these facilities, we manufacture our hyperimmune specialty plasma products, including BAT, VIGIV and Anthrasil. We also manufacture other marketed hyperimmune products for contract manufacturing customers at these facilities.\nOur contract fill/finish services facility is located in Baltimore, Maryland, and is referred to as our \"Camden Site.\" The Camden Site provides pharmaceutical product development and filling services for injectable and other sterile products, as well as process design, technical transfer, manufacturing validations, laboratory support, aseptic filling, lyophilization, final packaging and accelerated and ongoing stability studies support. This facility is an approved or inspected manufacturing facility under the regulatory regimes in the United States, Canada, Japan, Brazil, the Middle East and several countries in the European Union. The facility includes warehousing space used for cold-storage and freezer capacity to support contract manufacturing customers.\nOur manufacturing facility focused on disposable manufacturing for viral and non-viral products is located in Baltimore, Maryland, and is referred to as our \"Bayview Site.\" This facility was designed to take advantage of single-use bioreactor technology and is capable of manufacturing several different products, including products derived from cell culture or microbial systems. In June 2012, we entered into a contract with BARDA, which established our Bayview Site as a Center for Innovation in Advanced Development and Manufacturing, or CIADM. We envision this facility supporting future CIADM development and manufacturing activities for chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear threat countermeasures, as well as our current and future non-CIADM product development and manufacturing needs.\nAptevo Spin-off\nOn August 1, 2016, we completed the spin-off of Aptevo Therapeutics Inc., or Aptevo. As a result of the spin-off, the operating results of Aptevo have been reflected as discontinued operations for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014. See Note 3. \"Discontinued operations\" for further details regarding the spin-off. Unless otherwise stated, financial results herein reflect continuing operations.\nLitigation\nOn July 19, 2016, Plaintiff William Sponn, or Sponn, filed a putative class action complaint in the United States District Court for the District of Maryland, or the Court, on behalf of purchasers of our common stock between January 11, 2016 and June 21, 2016, inclusive, or the Class Period, seeking to pursue remedies under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 against us and certain of our senior officers and directors, collectively, the Defendants. The complaint alleges, among other things, that we made materially false and misleading statements about the government's demand for BioThrax and expectations that our five-year exclusive procurement contract with HHS would be renewed and omitted certain material facts. Sponn is seeking unspecified damages, including legal costs. On October 25, 2016 the Court added City of Cape Coral Municipal Firefighters' Retirement Plan and City of Sunrise Police Officers' Retirement Plan as plaintiffs and appointed them Lead Plaintiffs and Robins Geller Rudman & Dowd LLP as Lead Counsel. On December 27, 2016, the plaintiffs filed an amended complaint that cites the same class period, names the same defendants and makes similar allegations to the original complaint. We filed a Motion to Dismiss on February 27, 2017.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nOur discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses.\nOn an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates and judgments, including those related to accrued expenses, income taxes, stock-based compensation, inventory, in-process research and development and goodwill. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.\nWe believe the following critical accounting policies affect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements.\nRevenue Recognition\nWe recognize revenues from product sales and contract manufacturing if four basic criteria have been met:\n \uf0a7 there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement; \n \uf0a7 delivery has occurred or title has passed to our customer based on contract terms; \n \uf0a7 the fee is fixed or determinable; and \n \uf0a7 collectability is reasonably assured. \nWe have generated BioThrax sales revenues under U.S. government contracts with U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, or HHS and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, or the CDC. Under our current contract with the CDC, we invoice the CDC and recognize the related revenues upon acceptance by the government. At the delivery site the title to the product passes to the CDC.\nFrom time to time, we are awarded reimbursement contracts and grants for development services by government entities and philanthropic organizations. Under these contracts, we typically are reimbursed for our costs as we perform specific development activities, and we may also be entitled to additional fees. Revenue on our reimbursable contracts is recognized as costs are incurred, generally based on the allowable costs incurred during the period, plus any recognizable earned fee. The amounts that we receive under these contracts vary greatly from quarter to quarter, depending on the scope and nature of the work performed. We record the reimbursement of our costs and any associated fees as contracts and grants revenue and the associated costs as research and development expense.\nContracts and grants revenues are subject to the estimation processes to the extent that the reimbursable costs underlying these revenues are incurred but not billed and agreed to on a timely basis, and are subject to change in future periods when actual costs are known. To date we have not made material adjustments to these estimates.\nWe analyze our multiple element revenue-generating arrangements to determine whether the elements can be separated and accounted for individually as separate units of accounting. An item can generally be considered a separate unit of accounting if both of the following criteria are met: (1) the delivered item(s) has value to the customer on a stand-alone basis and (2) if the arrangement includes a general right of return and delivery or performance of the undelivered item(s) is considered probable and substantially in our control. Items that cannot be divided into separate units are combined with other units of accounting, as appropriate. Consideration received is allocated among the separate units based on the unit's relative selling price and is recognized in full when the appropriate revenue recognition criteria are met. We deem services to be rendered if no continuing obligation exists on our part.\nRevenue associated with non-refundable upfront license fees that can be treated as a single unit of accounting is recognized when all ongoing obligations have been delivered. Revenue associated with non-refundable upfront license fees under arrangements where the license fees and any research and development activities cannot be accounted for as separate units of accounting is deferred and recognized as revenue either on a straight-line basis over our continued involvement in the research and development process or based on the proportional performance of our expected future obligation under the contract. Revenues from the achievement of research and development milestones, if deemed substantive, are recognized as revenue when the milestones are achieved, and the milestone payments are due and collectible. If not deemed substantive, we recognize such milestone as revenue on a straight-line basis over the remaining expected term of continued involvement in the research and development process or based on the proportional performance of our expected future obligations under the contract.\nIn May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board, or the FASB, issued Accounting Standards Update, or ASU, No. 2014-09, Summary and Amendments That Create Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606) and Other Assets and Deferred Costs-Contracts with Customers (Subtopic 340-40) (\"ASU No. 2014-09\"). ASU No. 2014-09 supersedes the revenue recognition requirements in Topic 605, Revenue Recognition, as well as most industry-specific guidance, and significantly enhances comparability of revenue recognition practices across entities and industries by providing a principles-based, comprehensive framework for addressing revenue recognition issues. In order for a provider of promised goods or services to recognize as revenue the consideration that it expects to receive in exchange for the promised goods or services, the provider should apply the following five steps: (1) identify the contract with a customer(s); (2) identify the performance obligations in the contract; (3) determine the transaction price; (4) allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract; and (5) recognize revenue when (or as) the entity satisfies a performance obligation. ASU No. 2014-09 also specifies the accounting for some costs to obtain or fulfill a contract with a customer and provides enhanced disclosure requirements. The standard will be effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within that reporting period, which for the Company will be its 2018 first quarter. We are permitted to use either the retrospective or the modified retrospective method when adopting ASU No. 2014-09. We have begun an initial assessment of the potential impact that ASU No. 2014-09 will have on our financial statements and disclosures and believes that there could be changes to the revenue recognition related to our multiple element contracts, primarily those with the U.S. government.\nMergers and Acquisitions\nIn a business combination, the acquisition method of accounting requires that the assets acquired and liabilities assumed be recorded as of the date of the merger or acquisition at their respective fair values with limited exceptions. Assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination that arise from contingencies are recognized at fair value if fair value can reasonably be estimated. If the acquisition date fair value of an asset acquired or liability assumed that arises from a contingency cannot be determined, the asset or liability is recognized if probable and reasonably estimable; if these criteria are not met, no asset or liability is recognized. Fair value is defined as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. Accordingly, we may be required to value assets at fair value measures that do not reflect our intended use of those assets. Any excess of the purchase price (consideration transferred) over the estimated fair values of net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill. Transaction costs and costs to restructure the acquired company are expensed as incurred. The operating results of the acquired business are reflected in our consolidated financial statements after the date of the merger or acquisition. If we determine the assets acquired do not meet the definition of a business under the acquisition method of accounting, the transaction will be accounted for as an acquisition of assets rather than a business combination and, therefore, no goodwill will be recorded. The fair values of intangible assets, including acquired in-process research and development, or IPR&D, are determined utilizing information available near the merger or acquisition date based on expectations and assumptions that are deemed reasonable by management. Given the considerable judgment involved in determining fair values, we typically obtain assistance from third-party valuation specialists for significant items. Amounts allocated to acquired IPR&D are capitalized and accounted for as indefinite-lived intangible assets. Upon successful completion of each project, we will make a separate determination as to the then useful life of the asset and begin amortization. The judgments made in determining estimated fair values assigned to assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination, as well as asset lives, can materially affect our results of operations.\nThe fair values of identifiable intangible assets related to currently marketed products and product rights are primarily determined by using an \"income approach\" through which fair value is estimated based on each asset's discounted projected net cash flows. Our estimates of market participant net cash flows take into consideration the following factors: historical and projected pricing, margins and expense levels, the performance of competing products where applicable, relevant industry and therapeutic area growth drivers and factors, current and expected trends in technology and product life cycles, the time and investment that will be required to develop products and technologies, the ability to obtain marketing and regulatory approvals, the ability to manufacture and commercialize the products, the extent and timing of potential new product introductions by our competitors, and the life of each asset's underlying patent, if any. The net cash flows are then probability-adjusted where appropriate to consider the uncertainties associated with the underlying assumptions, as well as the risk profile of the net cash flows utilized in the valuation. The probability-adjusted future net cash flows of each product are then discounted to present value utilizing an appropriate discount rate.\nThe fair values of identifiable intangible assets related to IPR&D are determined using an income approach, through which fair value is estimated based on each asset's probability-adjusted future net cash flows, which reflect the different stages of development of each product and the associated probability of successful completion. The net cash flows are then discounted to present value using an appropriate discount rate. Intangible assets are tested for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that its carrying amount may not be recoverable.\nContingent Consideration\nWe record contingent consideration associated with both (a) sales based royalties and (b) development and regulatory milestones at fair value. The fair value model used to calculate this obligation is based on the income approach (a discounted cash flow model) that has been risk adjusted based on the probability of achievement of net sales and achievement of the milestones. The inputs we use for determining the fair value of the contingent consideration associated with sales based royalties and development and regulatory milestones are Level 3 fair value measurements. We re-evaluate the fair value on a quarterly basis. Changes in the fair value can result from adjustments to the discount rates and updates in the assumed timing of or achievement of net sales. Any future increase in the fair value of the contingent consideration associated with sales based royalties along with development and regulatory milestones are based on an increased likelihood that the underlying net sales or milestones will be achieved.\nThe associated payment or payments which will therefore become due and payable for sales based royalties associated with marketed products will result in a charge to cost of product sales and contract manufacturing in the period in which the increase is determined. Similarly, any future decrease in the fair value of contingent consideration associated with sales based royalties will result in a reduction in cost of product sales and contract manufacturing. The changes in fair value for potential future sales based royalties associated with product candidates in development will result in a charge to selling, general and administrative expense in the period in which the increase is determined. Similarly, any future decrease in the fair value of contingent consideration associated with potential future sales based royalties for products candidates will result in a reduction in selling, general and administrative expense.\nThe associated payment or payments which will therefore become due and payable for development and regulatory milestones will result in a charge to research and development expense in the period in which the increase is determined. Similarly, any future decrease in the fair value for development and regulatory milestones will result in a reduction in research and development expense.\nIncome Taxes\nUnder the asset and liability method of income tax accounting, deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the differences between the financial reporting and the tax basis of assets and liabilities and are measured using the tax rates and laws that are expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. A net deferred tax asset or liability is reported on the balance sheet. Our deferred tax assets include the unamortized portion of in-process research and development expenses, the anticipated future benefit of net operating losses and other timing differences between the financial reporting and tax basis of assets and liabilities.\nWe have historically incurred net operating losses for income tax purposes in some states and foreign jurisdictions. The amount of the deferred tax assets on our balance sheet reflects our expectations regarding our ability to use our net operating losses and research and development tax credit carryforwards, to offset future taxable income. The applicable tax rules in particular jurisdictions limit our ability to use net operating losses and research and development tax credit carryforwards as a result of ownership changes.\nWe review our deferred tax assets on an annual basis to assess our ability to realize the benefit from these deferred tax assets. If we determine that it is more likely than not that the amount of our expected future taxable income will not be sufficient to allow us to fully utilize our deferred tax assets, we increase our valuation allowance against deferred tax assets by recording a provision for income taxes on our income statement, which reduces net income or increases net loss for that period and reduces our deferred tax assets on our balance sheet. If we determine that the amount of our expected future taxable income will allow us to utilize net operating losses in excess of our net deferred tax assets, we reduce our valuation allowance by recording a benefit from income taxes on our income statement, which increases net income or reduces net loss for that period and increases our deferred tax assets on our balance sheet.\nUncertainty in income taxes is accounted for using a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. We recognize in our financial statements the impact of a tax position if that position is more likely than not of being sustained on audit, based on the technical merits of the position.\nFinancial Operations Overview\nRevenues\nWe have derived a majority of our historical product sales revenues from BioThrax sales to the U.S. government. We are focused on increasing the sales of our products to U.S. government customers and expanding the market for our product portfolio to other customers domestically and internationally. We were a party to a contract with the CDC, an operating division of the HHS, to supply up to approximately 44.75 million, doses of BioThrax to Strategic National Stockpile, or SNS, deliveries under this contract were complete in October 2016. On December 8, 2016, we signed a follow-on contract with the CDC, valued at up to $911 million, to supply approximately 29.4 million doses of BioThrax to the SNS, through September 2021. Also, BARDA issued a notice of intent to procure approximately $100 million of BioThrax for delivery into the SNS within 24 months from the date of contract award, which we anticipate will be in the first half of 2017. This contract will be separate from and in addition to the follow-on procurement contract with CDC. Our total revenues from BioThrax sales were $237.0 million, $293.9 million and $245.9 million for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. For at least the next two to three years, we expect to continue to derive a majority of our product sales revenues from sales of BioThrax to the U.S. government.\nOn September 30, 2016, we were awarded a multi-year contract with BARDA for the advanced development and delivery of NuThrax. The contract, valued at up to approximately $1.6 billion, consists of a five-year base period of performance valued at approximately $200 million to develop NuThrax for post-exposure prophylaxis of anthrax disease and to deliver to the SNS an initial two million doses following Emergency Use Authorization, or EUA, pre-approval by the FDA. We anticipate that the FDA could authorize NuThrax for emergency use as early as 2018, triggering deliveries of NuThrax to the SNS in 2019. The contract also includes procurement options for the delivery of an additional 7.5 million to 50 million doses of NuThrax to the SNS, valued from approximately $255 million to up to $1.4 billion, respectively, and options for an additional clinical study and post-marketing commitments valued at $48 million, which if both were to be exercised in full, would increase the total contract value to up to $1.6 billion.\nWe have received development funding from BARDA, the CDC, Defense Threat Reduction Agency, or DTRA, and National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, or NIAID, for the following development programs:\n\nOur revenue, operating results and profitability have varied, and we expect that they will continue to vary on a quarterly basis, primarily due to the timing of our fulfilling orders for BioThrax and work done under new and existing grants and development contracts.\nCost of Product Sales and Contract Manufacturing\nThe primary expense that we incur to deliver to our customers our marketed vaccines and therapeutics and to perform for our customers our contract manufacturing operations is manufacturing costs consisting of fixed and variable costs. Variable manufacturing costs consist primarily of costs for materials and personnel-related expenses for direct and indirect manufacturing support staff, contract manufacturing and filling operations, and sales-based royalties. Fixed manufacturing costs include facilities, utilities and amortization of intangible assets. We determine the cost of product sales for products sold during a reporting period based on the average manufacturing cost per unit in the period those units were manufactured. In addition to the fixed and variable manufacturing costs described above, the cost of product sales depends on utilization of available manufacturing capacity.\nThe primary expense that we incur to deliver our medical devices to our customers is the cost per unit of production from our third-party contract manufacturers, costs for materials and personnel-related expenses for direct and indirect manufacturing support staff along with facilities and utilities costs. Other associated expenses include sales-based royalties (which includes fair value adjustments associated with contingent consideration), amortization of intangible assets, shipping, and logistics.\nResearch and Development Expenses\nWe expense research and development costs as incurred. Our research and development expenses consist primarily of:\n \u00a7 personnel-related expenses; \n \u00a7 fees to professional service providers for, among other things, analytical testing, independent monitoring or other administration of our clinical trials and obtaining and evaluating data from our clinical trials and non-clinical studies; \n \u00a7 costs of contract manufacturing services for clinical trial material; and \n \u00a7 costs of materials used in clinical trials and research and development. \nWe intend to focus our product development efforts on promising late-stage candidates that we believe satisfy well-defined criteria and seek to utilize collaborations or non-dilutive funding. We plan to seek funding for development activities from external sources and third parties, such as governments and non-governmental organizations, or through collaborative partnerships. We expect our research and development spending will be dependent upon such factors as the results from our clinical trials, the availability of reimbursement of research and development spending, the number of product candidates under development, the size, structure and duration of any clinical programs that we may initiate, the costs associated with manufacturing our product candidates on a large-scale basis for later stage clinical trials, and our ability to use or rely on data generated by government agencies, such as studies involving BioThrax conducted by the CDC.\nSelling, General and Administrative Expenses\nSelling, general and administrative expenses consist primarily of personnel-related costs and professional fees in support of our executive, sales and marketing, business development, government affairs, finance, accounting, information technology, legal and human resource functions. Other costs include facility costs not otherwise included in cost of product sales and contract manufacturing or research and development expense.\nResults of Operations\nYear Ended December 31, 2016 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2015\nRevenue\n\nProduct sales:\nThe decrease in BioThrax sales was primarily due to the timing of deliveries under our contracts with the CDC, principally due to reduced deliveries in the fourth quarter of 2016 related to the timing of signing our new contract with CDC in December 2016. The increase in other product sales was primarily due to the timing of BAT and VIGIV sales to the SNS, as well as RSDL sales to the Department of Defense, or DoD. BioThrax product sales revenues during the year ended December 31, 2016 consisted of sales to the CDC of $235.8 million and aggregate international and other sales of $1.2 million. BioThrax product sales revenues during the year ended December 31, 2015 consisted primarily of BioThrax sales to the CDC of $292.8 million and aggregate international and other sales of $1.1 million.\nContract manufacturing:\nThe increase in Contract manufacturing revenues was primarily due to the increase of fill/finish services from our facility in Baltimore and our plasma based manufacturing facility in Winnipeg, partially offset by a decrease in contract manufacturing revenue related to the production of an MVA Ebola vaccine candidate in 2015.\nContracts and grants:\nThe increase in Contracts and grants revenues was primarily due to the following:\n\u00a7 increased development funding of $39.1 million related to our CIADM program, including $17.1 million from new CIADM task orders;\n\u00a7 increased development funding of $29.9 million for VIGIV related to plasma collection; and\n\u00a7 increased development funding of $9.4 million related for NuThrax related to preparation for a Phase III clinical trial.\nThese increases were partially offset by decreases in development funding for:\n\u00a7 the Anthrasil program of approximately $37.6 million related to the timing of plasma collection;\n\u00a7 PreviThrax of approximately $8.9 million due to reduced interest by the U.S. government for this product candidate; and\n\u00a7 Large-scale manufacturing of BioThrax of approximately $6.1 million due to completion of the program and FDA licensure of building 55 in August 2016.\nCost of Product Sales and Contract Manufacturing\nCost of product sales and contract manufacturing increased by $23.8 million, or 22%, to $131.3 million for 2016 from $107.5 million for 2015. The increase was attributable to an increase in the BioThrax cost per dose sold associated with lower production yield in the period in which the doses sold were produced along with increased costs associated with the increase Other product sales, partially offset by a decrease in BioThrax sales to the SNS.\nResearch and Development Expense\nResearch and development expenses decreased by $10.9 million, or 9%, to $108.3 million for 2016 from $119.2 million for 2015. This decrease primarily reflects lower contract service costs. Net of contracts and grants revenues, our research and development expenses were fully funded during 2016, resulting in a net contribution from funded development programs of $35.1 million. Net of contracts and grants revenues, we incurred net research and development expenses of $1.8 million during 2015.\nOur principal research and development expenses for 2016 and 2015 are shown in the following table:\n\nThe decrease in expense for large-scale manufacturing of BioThrax was primarily due to the timing of manufacturing development activities and due to the successful licensure of the large-scale manufacturing facility in August 2016. The decrease in spending for BioThrax related programs was primarily related to the timing of clinical studies to support applications for label expansion for BioThrax. The decrease in expense for PreviThrax was primarily due to the timing of non-clinical studies, and in light of reduced funding by the U.S. government for this product candidate, we determined to cease further development work on our PreviThrax vaccine and expect the spending for PreviThrax will be minimal in the future. The increase in expense for NuThrax was primarily due to the timing of non-clinical animal studies and manufacturing activities. The decrease in spending for Pandemic influenza was primarily due to a $5.0 million milestone payment to VaxInnate Corporation in the third quarter of 2015. The decrease in expense for our Anthrasil program was primarily due to the timing of plasma collection services. The decrease in expense for our BAT program was primarily related to stability testing and plasma collection. The decrease in expense for EV-035 series of molecules was primarily due to pharmacologic and formulation activities and a third quarter 2015 non-cash impairment charge of $9.8 million due to toxicity related issues, partially offset by a net decrease of $3.3 million (2016 vs. 2015) for the contingent consideration associated with the estimated timing and probability of achievement for certain development and regulatory milestones. The increase in expense for CIADM task orders awarded was primarily due to manufacturing development of Ebola monoclonal antibodies. The increase in expense for VIGIV was primarily due to the timing of plasma collection. The increase in expense for Emergard was primarily for device and cartridge supply development. The decrease in spending for our Other activities was primarily for manufacturing development activities.\nSelling, General and Administrative Expenses\nSelling, general and administrative expenses increased by $22.6 million, or 19%, to $143.7 million for 2016 from $121.1 million for 2015. The increase includes costs associated with the restructuring activities at our Lansing, Michigan site, increased professional services to support our strategic growth initiatives, and increased information technology investments.\nTotal Other Expense\nTotal net other expense increased by $0.5 million, or 9%, to $6.3 million for 2016 from $5.8 million for 2015. The increase was primarily attributable to a $0.5 million payment to the Internal Revenue Service for interest related to the audit of 2009 and 2010 federal income tax returns.\nIncome Taxes\nProvision for income taxes decreased by $7.6 million, or 17%, to $36.7 million for 2016 from $44.3 million for 2015. The provision for income taxes for 2016 resulted primarily from our income before provision for income taxes of $99.2 million and an effective annual tax rate of approximately 37%. The provision for income taxes for 2015 resulted primarily from our income before provision for income taxes of $135.7 million and an effective annual tax rate of approximately 33%. The provision for income taxes for 2016 and 2015 reflects net tax credits associated with research and developments activities of $1.6 million and $4.8 million, respectively. The increase in the effective annual tax rate is primarily related to tax on the sale, within our consolidated group, of assets from Canadian subsidiaries to U.S. subsidiaries in preparation of the spin-off of Aptevo, and a valuation allowance charge recorded in its continuing operations related to Aptevo deferred tax assets prior to the distribution. We determined that upon spin-off, the deferred tax assets of Aptevo would be unrealizable. The increase in the effective annual tax rate as a result of the above was partially offset by a release of valuation allowances associated with Canadian Scientific Research and Experimental Development tax credits.\nYear Ended December 31, 2015 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2014\nRevenues\n\nProduct sales:\nThe increase in BioThrax sales was primarily due to the timing of deliveries under our contract with the CDC. BioThrax product sales revenues during the year ended December 31, 2015 consisted of sales to the CDC of $292.8 million and aggregate international and other sales of $1.1 million. BioThrax product sales revenues during the year ended December 31, 2014 consisted primarily of BioThrax sales to the CDC of $242.2 million and aggregate international and other sales of $3.7 million.\nContract manufacturing:\nThe increase in contract manufacturing revenues was primarily due to a full year of revenues from our fill/finish facility in Baltimore and our plasma based manufacturing facility in Winnipeg, both of which we acquired in February 2014. In addition, contract manufacturing revenue increased by $3.8 million due to services related to the production of an MVA Ebola vaccine candidate.\nContracts and grants:\nThe increase in Contracts and grants revenues was primarily due to the following:\n\u00a7 increased development funding of $11.0 million for our Anthrasil program, related to plasma collection;\n\u00a7 increased development funding of $9.4 million related to our CIADM program, including a $5.0 million milestone payment from BARDA and $3.0 million from new CIADM task orders; and\n\u00a7 increased development funding of $4.3 million for VIGIV related to plasma collection.\nCost of Product Sales and Contract Manufacturing\nCost of product sales and contract manufacturing increased by $5.5 million, or 5%, to $107.5 million for 2015 from $102.0 million for 2014. Cost of product sales and contract manufacturing increased primarily due to an increase in the number of BioThrax doses delivered to the CDC, partially offset by decreased costs from RSDL due primarily to the related decrease in sales revenue.\nResearch and Development Expense\nResearch and development expenses increased by $14.5 million, or 14%, to $119.2 million for 2015 from $104.7 million for 2014. This increase primarily reflects higher contract service costs. Net of contracts and grants revenues, we incurred research and development expenses of $1.8 million and $13.0 million, during 2015 and 2014, respectively.\nOur principal research and development expenses for 2015 and 2014 are shown in the following table:\n\nThe decrease in expense for large-scale manufacturing for BioThrax was primarily due to the timing of manufacturing development activities. The decrease in expense for BioThrax related programs primarily reflects the timing of clinical studies to support applications for label expansion for BioThrax. The decrease in expense for PreviThrax was primarily due to the timing of non-clinical studies and in light of reduced funding by the U.S. government for this product candidate, we determined to cease further development work on our PreviThrax vaccine and expect the spending for PreviThrax will be minimal in the future. The increase in expense for NuThrax was primarily due to increased clinical trial activities. The increase in expense for Pandemic influenza was primarily due to a milestone payment to VaxInnate Corporation. The increase in expense for our Anthrasil program was primarily due to plasma collection services. The decrease in expense for our Botulinum antitoxin program was primarily for stability testing and the timing of plasma collection. The expense for MVA Ebola was primarily due to process development. The expense for EV-035 series of molecules, acquired in December 2014, was primarily due to pharmacologic and formulation activities and a non-cash impairment charge of $9.8 million due to toxicity related issues, partially offset by a $6.3 million reduction of future contingent consideration payable, associated with the estimated timing and probability of achievement for certain development and regulatory milestones, and reduced projected future sales of EV-035. The expense for CIADM task orders awarded in 2015 was primarily due to manufacturing development for a monoclonal antibody. The increase in expense for VIGIV was primarily for plasma collection and stability testing. The expense for Emergard was primarily for device and cartridge supply development. The decrease in spending for our Other activities was primarily due to decreased expense related to our funded pre-clinical product candidates and manufacturing development activities.\nSelling, General and Administrative Expenses\nSelling, general and administrative expenses increased by $12.5 million, or 12%, to $121.1 million for 2015 from $108.6 million for 2014. The increase includes additional post-acquisition selling, general and administrative costs associated with the operations acquired through the acquisition of Cangene in February 2014, along with increased professional services to support our strategic growth initiatives.\nTotal Other Expense\nTotal net other expense increased by $0.8 million, or 16%, to $5.8 million for 2015 from $5.0 million for 2014. The increase was primarily attributable to a $2.7 million decrease in rental income partially offset by a $1.8 million charge for debt issuance costs associated with the termination of our $125 million term loan facility in 2014.\nIncome Taxes\nProvision for income taxes increased by $14.4 million, or 48%, to $44.3 million for 2015 from $29.9 million for 2014. The provision for income taxes for 2015 resulted primarily from our income before provision for income taxes of $135.7 million and an effective annual tax rate of approximately 33%. The provision for income taxes for 2014 resulted primarily from our income before provision for income taxes of $84.2 million and an effective annual tax rate of approximately 36%. The provision for income taxes for 2015 and 2014 reflects net tax credits associated with research and developments activities of $4.8 million and $6.0 million, respectively.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nSources of Liquidity\nFrom inception through 2016, we have funded our cash requirements principally with a combination of revenues from sales of BioThrax, debt financing, development funding from government entities, non-government and philanthropic organizations, and collaborative partners, the net proceeds from our initial public offering and the sale of our common stock upon exercise of stock options. We have operated profitably for each of the five years ended December 31, 2016. As of December 31, 2016, we had cash and cash equivalents of $271.5 million.\nAt the closing of the spin-off of Aptevo, we provided to Aptevo cash of $45 million from our cash reserves, along with a commitment in the form of a promissory note to provide another $20 million in funding, which we paid in January 2017.\nCash Flows\nThe following table provides information regarding our cash flows for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014.\n\n(1) Includes the effect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents.\nNet cash provided by operating activities of $53.6 million in 2016 was primarily due to our net income of $51.8 million, non-cash charges of $38.2 million for depreciation and amortization and $18.5 million for stock-based compensation, partially offset by an increase in accounts receivable of $22.4 million related to the timing of collection of amounts billed primarily to the CDC, a decrease in accounts payable of $14.8 million due to unpaid balances associated with ADM and a $9.0 million increase in inventory primarily due to an increase in BioThrax inventory.\nNet cash provided by operating activities of $44.3 million in 2015 was primarily due to our net income of $62.9 million, non-cash charges of $35.3 million for depreciation and amortization, $15.8 million for stock-based compensation and an increase in accounts payable of $4.7 million associated with increased infrastructure activities and spin-off related liabilities, partially offset by an increase in accounts receivable of $64.4 million related to the timing of collection of amounts billed primarily to the CDC and a $11.3 million increase in inventory due to raw material purchases for RSDL.\nNet cash provided by operating activities of $112.3 million in 2014 was primarily due to our net income of $36.7 million, a decrease in accounts receivable of $21.4 million related to the timing of collection of amounts billed primarily to the CDC, along with the effect of non-cash charges of $12.8 million for stock-based compensation and $32.5 million for depreciation and amortization.\nNet cash used in investing activities of $76.3 million in 2016 was primarily due to our expansion at Bayview CIADM site along with software, infrastructure and equipment investments.\nNet cash used in investing activities of $45.5 million in 2015 was primarily due to software, infrastructure and equipment investments.\nNet cash used in investing activities of $210.1 million in 2014 was primarily due to the acquisition of Cangene for $177.9 million, which is net of $43.6 million of acquired cash, and capital expenditures of $30.7 million for infrastructure and equipment investments.\nNet cash used by financing activities of $18.6 million in 2016 was primarily due to $45.0 million in cash provided to Aptevo on date of distribution, August 1, 2016 that is partially offset by $17.1 million in proceeds from the issuance of common stock pursuant to employee equity plans and $10.6 million in excess tax benefits from exercise of stock options.\nNet cash provided by financing activities of $33.4 million in 2015 was primarily due to $26.0 million in proceeds from the issuance of common stock pursuant to employee equity plans, $11.3 million in excess tax benefits from the exercise of stock options and $2.0 million in proceeds from long-term indebtedness, partially offset by $5.7 million in contingent obligation payments.\nNet cash provided by financing activities of $198.9 million in 2014 was primarily due to net proceeds from our Notes of $241.6 million, $14.1 million in proceeds from the issuance of common stock pursuant to employee equity plans and $6.0 million in excess tax benefits from the exercise of stock options, partially offset by a principal payment on indebtedness of $62.0 million under our revolving credit facility.\nContractual Obligations\nThe following table summarizes our contractual obligations at December 31, 2016:\n\nThere are a number of uncertainties that we face in the development of new product candidates that prevent us from making a reasonable estimate of the cash obligations under our material license agreements. Because of these uncertainties, the preceding table excludes contingent contractual payments that we may become obligated to make under such agreements. These agreements typically provide for the payment of milestone fees upon achievement of specified research, development and commercialization milestones, such as the commencement of clinical trials, the receipt of funding awards, the receipt of regulatory approvals, and the achievement of sales milestones. The amount of contingent contractual milestone payments that we may become obligated to make is variable based on the actual achievement and timing of the applicable milestones and the characteristics of any products or product candidates that are developed, including factors such as number of products or product candidates developed, type and number of components of each product or product candidate, ownership of the various components and the specific markets affected. The aggregate payments could be as much as approximately $155 million. The success of our efforts to commercialize our product candidates is highly uncertain and depends on many factors, including those set forth in \"Risk Factors-Our business depends on our success in developing and commercializing our product candidates. If we are unable to commercialize these product candidates, or experience significant delays or unanticipated costs in doing so, our business would be materially and adversely affected.\" Even if these efforts are successful, the timing of success is highly unpredictable and variable. The same is true for any contingent contractual royalty payments that we may be obligated to make upon successful commercialization of these product candidates. We do not expect that any such payments would have an adverse effect on our financial position, operations and capital resources because, if payable, we expect that the benefits associated with the achievement of the relevant milestones or the achievement of revenue would offset the burden of making these payments. We are not obligated to pay any minimum royalties under our existing contracts. Deferred income taxes and liabilities for unrecognized income tax benefits are excluded from the above table since they are not contractually fixed as to timing and amount.\nDebt Financing\nOn January 29, 2014, the Company issued $250.0 million aggregate principal amount of 2.875% Convertible Senior Notes due 2021 (the \"Notes\"). The Notes mature on January 15, 2021, unless earlier purchased by the Company or converted. The original conversion rate was equal to 30.8821 shares of common stock per $1,000 principal amount of notes (which is equivalent to a conversion price of approximately $32.38 per share of common stock). The conversion rate is subject to adjustment upon the occurrence of certain specified events but will not be adjusted for accrued and unpaid interest. As of August 1, 2016, certain conversion features were triggered due to the completion of the Aptevo spin-off. The conversion rate under the Notes was adjusted in accordance with the terms of the indenture. Effective August 12, 2016, the conversion rate was adjusted to 32.3860 shares of common stock per $1,000 principal amount of notes (which is equivalent to a conversion price of approximately $30.88 per share of common stock).\nOn December 11, 2013, we entered into a senior secured credit agreement, or the Credit Agreement, with the three lending financial institutions. The Credit Agreement provides for a revolving credit facility of up to $100.0 million through December 11, 2018, or such earlier date required by the terms of the Credit Agreement. As of December 31, 2016 and 2015, no amounts were drawn under the revolving credit facility.\nOur payment obligations under the Credit Agreement are secured by a lien on substantially all of our assets, including the stock of all of the our subsidiaries, and the assets of the subsidiary guarantors, including mortgages over certain of their real properties, including our large-scale vaccine manufacturing facility in Lansing, Michigan and our CIADM facility in Baltimore, Maryland. Under the Credit Agreement, we are required to make quarterly interest payments calculated using a combination of conventional base-rate measures plus a margin over those rates. The base rates consist of LIBOR rates and prime rates. The actual rates will depend on the level of these underlying rates plus a margin based on our leverage, on a consolidated basis, from quarter to quarter.\nThe Credit Agreement, as amended, contains affirmative and negative covenants customary for financings of this type. Negative covenants in the Credit Agreement, among other things, limit our ability to incur indebtedness and liens; dispose of assets; make investments including loans, advances or guarantees; and enter into certain mergers or similar transactions. The Credit Agreement also contains financial covenants, tested quarterly and in connection with any triggering events under the Credit Agreement: (1) a minimum consolidated debt service coverage ratio of 2.50 to 1.00, (2) a maximum consolidated leverage ratio of 3.50 to 1.00 and (3) a minimum liquidity requirement of $50.0 million. Upon the occurrence and continuance of an event of default under the Credit Agreement, the commitments of the lenders to make loans under the Credit Agreement may be terminated and our payment obligations under the Credit Agreement may be accelerated. The events of default under the Credit Agreement include, among others, subject in some cases to specified cure periods, payment defaults; inaccuracy of representations and warranties in any material respect; defaults in the observance or performance of covenants; bankruptcy and insolvency related defaults; the entry of a final judgment in excess of a threshold amount; change of control; and the invalidity of loan documents relating to the Credit Agreement.\nFunding Requirements\nWe expect to continue to fund our anticipated operating expenses, capital expenditures, debt service requirements and any future repurchase of our common stock from the following sources: existing cash and cash equivalents; revenues from product sales; development contracts and grants funding; contract manufacturing services and our revolving credit facility and any other lines of credit we may establish from time to time. There are numerous risks and uncertainties associated with product sales and with the development and commercialization of our product candidates. We may seek additional external financing to provide additional financial flexibility. Our future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including (but not limited to):\n \u00a7 our ability to deliver doses under our new BioThrax procurement contract; \n \u00a7 the level, timing and cost of product sales; \n \u00a7 the extent to which we acquire or invest in and integrate companies, businesses, products or technologies; \n \u00a7 the acquisition of new facilities and capital improvements to new or existing facilities; \n \u00a7 the payment obligations under our indebtedness; \n \u00a7 the scope, progress, results and costs of our development activities; \n \u00a7 our ability to obtain funding from collaborative partners, government entities and non-governmental organizations for our development programs; \n \u00a7 the extent to which we repurchase our common stock under our share repurchase program; and \n \u00a7 the costs of commercialization activities, including product marketing, sales and distribution. \nIf our capital resources are insufficient to meet our future capital requirements, we will need to finance our cash needs through public or private equity or debt offerings, bank loans or collaboration and licensing arrangements. In May 2015, we filed an automatic shelf registration statement, which immediately became effective under SEC rules. For so long as we continue to satisfy the requirements to be deemed a \"well-known seasoned issuer\" under SEC rules, this shelf registration statement, effective until May 2018, allows us to issue an unrestricted amount of equity, debt and certain other types of securities through one or more future primary or secondary offerings. If we raise funds by issuing equity securities, our stockholders may experience dilution. Public or bank debt financing, if available, may involve agreements that include covenants, like those contained in our senior secured revolving credit facility, which could limit or restrict our ability to take specific actions, such as incurring additional debt, making capital expenditures, pursuing acquisition opportunities, buying back shares or declaring dividends. If we raise funds through collaboration and licensing arrangements with third parties, it may be necessary to relinquish valuable rights to our technologies or product candidates or grant licenses on terms that may not be favorable to us.\nWe are not restricted under the terms of the indenture governing our senior convertible notes from incurring additional debt, securing existing or future debt, recapitalizing our debt or taking a number of other actions that are not limited by the terms of the indenture governing our notes that could have the effect of diminishing our ability to make payments on our indebtedness. However, our credit facility restricts our ability to incur additional indebtedness, including secured indebtedness.\nCurrent economic conditions may make it difficult to obtain financing on attractive terms, or at all. If financing is unavailable or lost, our business, results of operations and financial condition would be adversely affected and we could be forced to delay, reduce the scope of or eliminate many of our planned activities.\nShare Repurchase Program\nOn July 14, 2016, our board of directors authorized our management to repurchase, from time to time, up to an aggregate of up to $50 million of our common stock under a board-approved share repurchase program. The timing, amount, and price of any repurchases will be made pursuant to one or more 10b5-1 plans. The term of the board authorization of the repurchase program is until December 31, 2017. The plan will permit shares to be repurchased when we might otherwise be precluded from doing so based upon insider trading laws. The repurchase program may be suspended or discontinued at any time. Any repurchased shares will be available for use in connection with our stock plans and for other corporate purposes. As of December 31, 2016, we have neither implemented a repurchase plan nor repurchased any shares under this program.", "item_7_tables": "Table 210: <table> <tr> <td> Development Programs\n</td> <td>
