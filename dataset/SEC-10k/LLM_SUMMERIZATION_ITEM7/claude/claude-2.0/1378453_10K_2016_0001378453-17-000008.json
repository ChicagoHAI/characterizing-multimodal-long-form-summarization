Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThe following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes included in Item 15 of this Annual Report. Amounts are in thousands of dollars or gallons unless indicated otherwise.\nExecutive Summary\nOur revenues and income are subject to material changes as a result of market prices and the availability of diesel fuel and gasoline. These factors are subject to the worldwide petroleum products supply chain, which historically has experienced price and supply volatility as a result of, among other things, severe weather, terrorism, political crises, military actions and variations in demand that are often the result of changes in the macroeconomic environment. Also, concerted efforts by major oil producing countries and cartels to limit oil supply can impact prices.\nOver the past few years there have been significant changes in the cost of fuel. Fuel prices generally trended upward for the year, ending at a higher price than at the start of the year. During the year ended December 31, 2016, the average fuel price was 15.9% below the average fuel price during the year ended December 31, 2015. Some current economic forecasts reflect continued low prices for fuel; although other economic forecasts indicate an expectation of economic growth and inflation in the U.S. and elsewhere, which may impact demand for fuel and fuel prices. As noted above, various factors and events can cause fuel prices to change, sometimes suddenly and sharply.\nDue to the volatility of our fuel costs and our pricing to fuel customers, we believe that fuel revenue is not a reliable metric for analyzing our results of operations from period to period. As a result solely of changes in fuel prices, our fuel revenue may materially increase or decrease, in both absolute amounts and on a percentage basis, without a comparable change in fuel sales volumes or in fuel gross margin. We therefore consider fuel sales volume and fuel gross margin to be better measures of our performance.\nWe generally are able to pass changes in our cost for fuel products to customers, but typically with a delay, such that during periods of rising fuel commodity prices fuel gross margins per gallon tend to be lower than they otherwise may have been and during periods of falling fuel commodity prices fuel gross margins per gallon tend to be higher than they otherwise may have been. Increases and volatility in the prices we pay for fuel can have negative effects on our sales and profitability and increase our working capital requirements. For more information about fuel market risks that may affect us and our actions to mitigate those risks, see Item 7A, \"Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk\" elsewhere in this Annual Report.\nWe believe that demand for diesel fuel by trucking companies for any given level of trucking activity will be reduced over time by technological innovations that permit, and regulations that encourage or require, improved fuel efficiency of motor vehicle engines and other fuel conservation practices. We believe these factors combined with adjusting our fuel sales pricing to manage fuel sales volume and profitability and lower levels of freight activity, were contributors to decreases in the level of fuel sales volumes we realized on a same site basis for 2016, as compared to 2015, despite generally improving economic conditions during 2016. Although fuel sales volume declined on a same site basis, it increased on a total basis due to the number of new locations we added to our business during 2015 and 2016.\nDespite higher fuel sales volume in 2016 compared to 2015, our fuel gross margin and fuel gross margin per gallon were lower in 2016 than in 2015, primarily due to an inordinately favorable purchasing environment in the first four months of 2015 that did not recur in 2016.\nThe net loss attributable to common shareholders we experienced for 2016, as compared to the income we achieved during 2015, was primarily due to increases in depreciation and amortization expenses, and expenses related to financing and managing our newly acquired and developed locations (including real estate rent, interest and selling, general and administrative expenses), a decrease in fuel gross margin, and increased competition. These decreases were partially offset by an increase in nonfuel gross margin in excess of site level operating expenses generated by our locations.\nAs described under the heading \"Other Disputes\" in Note 13 to the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 15 of this Annual Report, Comdata has purported to terminate its merchant agreement with us and, beginning February 1, 2017, unilaterally increased the fees it withholds from the transaction settlement payments due to us. We believe that Comdata has wrongfully terminated our agreement and raised the fees we pay Comdata, and we are pursuing litigation against Comdata. However, if we do not prevail in our pending litigation against Comdata, we may not be able to recover the increased fees Comdata charges us through higher prices to customers, and our operating expenses may increase.\nFactors Affecting Comparability\nTransaction Agreement with HPT\nOn June 1, 2015, we entered a transaction agreement with HPT, which we and HPT amended on June 22, 2016. We refer to this amended transaction agreement as the Transaction Agreement. Under the Transaction Agreement, among other things, we agreed to sell to HPT 16 existing travel centers we owned and certain assets at 11 properties currently leased from HPT, plus four additional travel centers upon our completion of their development, and HPT agreed to lease back these properties and assets to us under the HPT Leases. We also agreed to purchase from HPT five travel centers we previously leased from HPT.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2015, we sold 14 travel centers and certain assets at 11 properties currently leased from HPT for an aggregate of $279,383 and purchased five travel centers from HPT for $45,042. The resulting net increase of our minimum annual rent under our TA Leases was $20,153.\nOn March 31, 2016, we sold one of the development properties to HPT for $19,683, and our minimum annual rent due to HPT increased by $1,673.\nOn June 22, 2016, we sold two existing travel centers for an aggregate of $23,876, and our minimum annual rent due to HPT increased by $2,029.\nOn June 30, 2016, we sold one of the development properties to HPT for $22,297, and our minimum annual rent due to HPT increased by $1,895.\nOn September 30, 2016, we sold one of the development properties to HPT for $16,557, and our minimum annual rent due to HPT increased by $1,407.\nSee Notes 7 and 12 to the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 15 of this Annual Report for more information about our Transaction Agreement with HPT.\nAcquired and Developed Sites\nSince the beginning of 2011, when we began our acquisition program, to December 31, 2016, we have invested $855,003 to develop, purchase and improve 318 travel centers, convenience stores and standalone restaurants. For the year ended December 31, 2016, these investments produced site level gross margin in excess of site level operating expenses of $99,957, or, on a sequential basis, $8,253, or 9.0%, greater than site level gross margin in excess of site level operating expenses for the twelve months ended September 30, 2016.\nWe believe that our investments require a period after they are developed or acquired and upgrades are completed to reach their expected stabilized financial results, generally three years for travel centers and one year for convenience stores.\nWe acquired or developed 39 travel centers during the 2011 to 2016 period. Of those, 36 are included in the \"Travel Centers Segment Same Site Operating Data\" for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015. As of December 31, 2016, we have invested $312,139 (including improvements) in these 36 locations, and they generated $54,271 of gross margin in excess of site level operating expenses during the year ended December 31, 2016. The remaining three locations were developed by us for a total investment of $64,862; and they generated $3,526 of gross margin in excess of site level operating expenses during the year ended December 31, 2016; however, we have operated these locations for less than the full year 2016 (one opened in each of January, March and May).\nWe acquired 228 convenience stores during the 2013 to 2016 period. Of these, 31 are included in the \"Convenience Store Segment Same Site Operating Data\" for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015. As of December 31, 2016, we have invested $66,491 (including improvements) in these 31 locations, and they generated $11,608 of gross margin in excess of site level operating expenses during the year ended December 31, 2016. The remaining 197 locations were acquired by us in 2015 or 2016 for a total investment of $376,854 (including improvements), and these convenience stores generated $23,237 of gross margin in excess of site level operating expenses during the year ended December 31, 2016. The 29 convenience stores we acquired during 2016 were operated by us for an average of nine months during 2016 and some of these were fully or partially out of service while being renovated.\nWe acquired one standalone restaurant during 2015 and 50 during 2016. As of December 31, 2016, we have invested $34,657 (including improvements) in these 51 locations, and they generated $7,315 of gross margin in excess of site level operating expenses during the year ended December 31, 2016.\nOur growth activities have also contributed to growth in our selling, general and administrative expenses, which were $139,052 for the year ended December 31, 2016, a $17,285, or 14.2%, increase over the amount for the year ended December 31, 2015. We estimate that approximately $10,000 of this increase can be attributed to the increase in our number of sites, including such items as marketing, advertising, regional management personnel and centralized support costs.\nAs of December 31, 2016, we had agreements to acquire one travel center and six standalone restaurants from two of our franchisees for an aggregate purchase price of $19,050, and since December 31, 2016, we have entered into an agreement to acquire an additional travel center for a purchase price of $4,175. During January 2017, we completed the purchase of six standalone restaurants for an aggregate purchase price of $6,000. We expect to complete the remaining acquisitions in the first half of 2017, but these purchases are subject to conditions that may not occur, may be delayed or the terms may change. We currently intend to continue to selectively acquire additional locations and to otherwise expand our business.\nResults of Operations\nConsolidated Financial Results\nThe following table presents changes in our operating results for the year ended December 31, 2016, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2015 and for the year ended December 31, 2015, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2014.\nTable 126: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td>

Fuel gross margin for 2016 decreased by $9,717, or 2.3%, as compared to 2015. This decrease in fuel gross margin was primarily due to an unusually favorable purchasing environment in the first four months of 2015 that did not recur in 2016.\nNonfuel gross margin. Nonfuel gross margin for 2016 increased by $90,311, or 9.4%, as compared to 2015 due primarily to acquired locations and our pricing and marketing initiatives. Nonfuel gross margin as a percentage of nonfuel revenues was 53.6% and 54.0% for 2016 and 2015, respectively. The nonfuel gross margin percentage decreased primarily due to the acquisition of additional convenience stores since the beginning of 2015. Nonfuel gross margin percentage in our convenience store operations is typically lower than the nonfuel gross margin percentage for our travel center operations.\nSite level operating expenses. Site level operating expenses for 2016 increased by $73,761, or 8.3%, as compared to 2015 due primarily to acquired locations. Site level operating expenses as a percentage of nonfuel revenues were 48.9% and 49.7% for 2016 and 2015, respectively. The improved expense ratio reflects both a larger portion of our operations conducted at convenience stores and the continued stabilization of our acquired convenience store locations.\nSelling, general and administrative expenses. Selling, general and administrative expenses for 2016 increased by $17,285, or 14.2%, as compared to 2015. The increase was primarily attributable to increased personnel required to support the growth of our business, as well as increased spending on marketing and promotional activities.\nReal estate rent expense. Rent expense for 2016 increased by $30,707, or 13.3%, as compared to 2015. The increase in real estate rent expense was primarily a result of the sale to, and lease back from, HPT of travel centers and improvements at leased sites since the beginning of 2015, including the sales pursuant to the Transaction Agreement with HPT.\nDepreciation and amortization expense. Depreciation and amortization expense for 2016 increased by $20,006, or 27.6%, as compared to 2015. The increase in depreciation and amortization expense primarily resulted from the locations we acquired and capital investments at our owned sites that we completed since the beginning of 2015.\nInterest expense, net. Interest expense, net for 2016 increased by $5,270, or 23.4%, as compared to 2015, primarily as a result of our issuance of $100,000 of the 2030 Senior Notes in October 2015.\nProvision for income taxes. For 2016, we had an income tax benefit of $1,733 as a result of a pretax loss. In 2015, we had an income tax provision of $16,539 as a result of pretax income. See Note 9 to the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 15 of this Annual Report for more information about our income taxes.\nYear ended December 31, 2015, as compared to December 31, 2014\nRevenues. Fuel revenues for 2015 decreased by $2,094,001, or 34.1%, as compared to 2014. The table below shows the change in sales volumes and fuel revenues by segment. Corporate and other fuel gallons and fuel revenues represent wholesale sales to the joint venture we operate and to other retailers.\nTable 128: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Fuel Gallons Sold\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Fuel Revenues\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Change\nfrom 2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Change\nfrom 2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Travel centers\n</td> <td>1,974,744\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.8\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,958,512\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,763,536\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(36.9\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>5,961,985\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Convenience stores\n</td> <td>121,604\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>203.6\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>40,048\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>224,894\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>98.6\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>113,221\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Corporate and other\n</td> <td>33,755\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>28.7\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>26,230\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>67,018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(9.7\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>74,243\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Consolidated totals\n</td> <td>2,130,103\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5.2\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,024,790\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>4,055,448\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(34.1\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>6,149,449\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe decreases in fuel revenue for 2015 as compared to 2014 were due to significant decreases in market prices for fuel partially offset by increases in sales volume in both the travel center and convenience store segments primarily due to locations acquired in 2014 and 2015. Wholesale fuel sales increased primarily as a result of our acquisitions in the second half of 2015.\nNonfuel revenues for 2015 increased by $165,959, or 10.3%, as compared to 2014, primarily as a result of locations acquired in 2014 and 2015.\nFuel gross margin. Fuel gross margin for 2015 decreased by $14,006, or 3.3%, as compared to 2014. The decrease in fuel gross margin was primarily due to an inordinately favorable purchasing environment in the 2014 fourth quarter that did not recur in 2015, partially offset by an increase of $4,999 in 2015 compared to 2014 related to amounts owed to us in connection with certain biodiesel purchases we made during 2015 as a result of the reinstatement during the fourth quarter of 2015 of biodiesel and renewable energy fuel tax credits. The legislation authorizing these tax credits was passed and the credits were retroactively applied in December of each of 2015 and 2014.\nNonfuel gross margin. Nonfuel gross margin for 2015 increased by $84,835, or 9.7%, as compared to 2014, due to locations acquired in 2014 and 2015 and our pricing and marketing initiatives. Nonfuel gross margin as a percentage of nonfuel revenues was 54.0% and 54.3% for 2015 and 2014, respectively. The nonfuel gross margin percentage decreased primarily due to the inclusion of additional convenience stores, as a result of acquisitions since the beginning of 2015. Nonfuel gross margin percentage in our convenience store operations is typically lower than the nonfuel gross margin percentage for our travel center operations.\nSite level operating expenses. Site level operating expenses for 2015 increased by $70,035, or 8.6%, as compared to 2014 primarily due to locations acquired in 2014 and 2015. Site level operating expenses as a percentage of nonfuel revenues were 49.7% and 50.4% for 2015 and 2014, respectively. The improved expense ratio reflects both a larger portion of our operations conducted at convenience stores and the continued stabilization of our locations acquired in 2014 and 2015.\nSelling, general and administrative expenses. Selling, general and administrative expenses for 2015 increased by $14,944, or 14.0%, as compared to 2014. The increase was primarily attributable to increased personnel to support the growth of our business, especially the significant growth in our convenience store segment. These increases were partially offset by lower audit and consultant fees.\nReal estate rent expense. Real estate rent expense for 2015 increased by $14,436, or 6.6%, as compared to 2014. The increase in real estate rent expense was primarily a result of the sale to, and lease back from, HPT in June 2015 and September 2015 of 14 owned travel centers and certain assets we owned at 11 properties leased from HPT, as well as improvements at leased sites we sold to HPT during 2015 and 2014.\nDepreciation and amortization expense. Depreciation and amortization expense for 2015 increased by $6,799, or 10.4%, as compared to 2014. The increase in depreciation and amortization expense primarily resulted from the acquisitions and other capital investments we completed during 2014 and 2015. The increase was partially offset by the reduction in our depreciable assets as a result of the sale to, and lease back from, HPT in June 2015 and September 2015 of 14 owned travel centers and certain assets we owned at 11 properties leased from HPT.\nInterest expense, net. Interest expense, net for 2015 increased by $5,833, or 34.9%, as compared to 2014, primarily as a result of our issuances of $100,000 of our 2030 Senior Notes in October 2015 and $120,000 of our 2029 Senior Notes in December 2014.\nProvision for income taxes. The income tax provisions for 2015 and 2014 were $16,539 and $38,023, respectively. The decrease in the income tax provision for 2015 was primarily due to an increase in the utilization of various tax credits and incentives. See Note 9 to the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 15 of this Annual Report for more information about our income taxes.\nSegment Results of Operations\nThe following is a discussion of fuel and nonfuel revenues and site level gross margin in excess of site level operating expenses by reportable segment.\nAs part of this discussion and analysis of our reportable segment operating results we refer to increases and decreases in results on a same site basis. We include a location in the same site comparisons only if we continuously operated it for the entire period since the beginning of the earliest comparative period presented. Locations we operate that are owned by an unconsolidated joint venture are not included in our same site comparisons. Same site data also excludes revenues and expenses that were not generated at locations we operate, such as rent and royalties from franchisees, revenues from a dealer operated convenience store and corporate selling, general and administrative expenses. We do not exclude locations from the same site comparisons as a result of capital improvements to the site or changes in the services offered.\nTravel Centers\nThe following table presents changes in the operating results of our travel center segment for the year ended December 31, 2016, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2015, and for the year ended December 31, 2015, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2014.\nTable 129: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>

On a same site basis, fuel sales volume decreased by 84,141 gallons, or 4.3%, during 2016 as compared to 2015. We believe the decrease in same site fuel sales volume was primarily due to our efforts to adjust fuel sales profitability by managing pricing and the effects of truck engine fuel efficiency improvements and other fuel conservation efforts, lower levels of freight activity and competition.\nNonfuel revenues for 2016 increased by $17,765, or 1.1%, as compared to 2015. The increase in nonfuel revenues was primarily due to nonfuel sales at acquired locations partially offset by decreases in nonfuel sales on a same site basis. The decrease on a same site basis was primarily due to lower revenue at full service restaurants due to closing certain of our restaurants during slower night time periods and a decrease in tire sales revenue primarily due to increased competition.\nSite level gross margin in excess of site level operating expenses. Site level gross margin in excess of site level operating expenses for 2016 decreased by $14,652, or 3.0%, as compared to 2015, due to a decrease of $20,725, or 4.4%, on a same site basis partially offset by an increase due to acquired locations.\nOn a same site basis, site level gross margin in excess of site level operating expenses decreased for 2016 as compared to 2015 as a result of a decrease in fuel gross margin, primarily due to our unusually favorable purchasing experience in the first four months of 2015 that did not recur during 2016.\nYear ended December 31, 2015, as compared to December 31, 2014\nRevenues. Fuel revenues for 2015 decreased by $2,198,449, or 36.9%, as compared to 2014.

Our principal sources of liquidity to meet these requirements are our:\nTable 137: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>cash balance;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 138: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>operating cash flow;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 139: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>our Credit Facility, with a current maximum availability of $200,000, or our Credit Facility, subject to limits based on our qualified collateral;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 140: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>sales to HPT of improvements we make to the sites we lease from HPT and the development site to be sold to HPT under the Transaction Agreement;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 141: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>potential issuances of new debt and equity securities; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 142: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>potential financing or selling of unencumbered real estate that we own.\n</td> </tr>\n</table> We believe that the primary risks we currently face with respect to our operating cash flow are:\nTable 143: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>continuing decreased demand for our fuel products resulting from regulatory and market efforts for improved engine fuel efficiency and fuel conservation generally;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 144: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>decreased demand for our products and services that we may experience as a result of competition;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 145: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>a significant portion of our expenses are fixed in nature, which may restrict our ability to realize a sufficient reduction in our expenses to offset a reduction in our revenues;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 146: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>the possible inability of recently acquired or developed properties to generate the stabilized financial results we expect;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 147: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>the risk of an economic slowdown or recession; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 148: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>the negative impacts on our gross margins and working capital requirements if there were a return to the higher level of prices for petroleum products we experienced during the first half of 2014 and in prior years, as well as the increased volatility of those prices.\n</td> </tr>\n</table> Our business requires substantial amounts of working capital, including cash liquidity, and our working capital requirements can be especially large because of the volatility of fuel prices. Our growth strategy of selectively acquiring additional properties and businesses and developing new sites requires us to expend substantial capital. In addition, our properties are high traffic sites with many customers and large trucks entering and exiting our properties daily, requiring us to expend capital to improve, repair and maintain our properties. Although we had a cash balance of $61,312 on December 31, 2016, and net cash provided by operating activities in 2016, there can be no assurance that we will maintain similar amounts of cash, that we will generate future profits or positive cash flows or that we will be able to obtain additional financing, if and when it becomes necessary or desirable to pursue business opportunities.\nLiquidity Aspects of Transactions with HPT\nPursuant to the Transaction Agreement, HPT agreed to purchase from us, for our cost, four travel centers then being or to be developed, on land parcels we then owned, upon their completion, if such development were completed prior to June 30, 2017. As of December 31, 2016, we had completed construction of three of these travel centers and one of these travel centers was under construction. On each of March 31, 2016, June 30, 2016, and September 30, 2016, we sold to HPT for $19,683, $22,297 and $16,557, respectively, and leased back from HPT, one of the completed travel centers. Also, on June 22, 2016, pursuant to the Transaction Agreement, we sold to, and leased back from, HPT two existing travel centers owned by us for an aggregate of $23,876. We expect to sell to HPT the remaining development property during the first half of 2017. As of December 31, 2016, we had invested $26,429 (including land costs) for the remaining development property and we estimate the remaining development cost will be approximately $1,813.\nRevolving Credit Facility\nWe have a Credit Facility with a group of commercial banks that matures on December 19, 2019. Under the Credit Facility, a maximum of $200,000 may be drawn, repaid and redrawn until maturity. The availability of this maximum amount is subject to limits based on qualified collateral. Subject to available collateral and lender participation, the maximum amount of this Credit Facility may be increased to $300,000. The Credit Facility may be used for general business purposes and permits for the issuance of letters of credit. Generally, no principal payments are due until maturity. Borrowings under the Credit Facility bear interest at a rate based on, at our option, LIBOR or a base rate, plus a premium (which premium is subject to adjustment based upon facility availability, utilization and other matters). At December 31, 2016, based on our qualified collateral, a total of $102,625 was available to us for loans and letters of credit under the Credit Facility. At December 31, 2016, there were no loans outstanding under the Credit Facility but we had outstanding $23,128 of letters of credit issued under that facility, which reduces the amount available for borrowing under the Credit Facility, leaving $79,497 available for our use as of that date.\nSenior Notes\nOn October 5, 2015, we issued in an underwritten public offering $100,000 aggregate principal amount of our 8.00% Senior Notes due on October 15, 2030, or the 2030 Senior Notes. Our net proceeds from this issuance were $95,494 after underwriters' discount and commission and other costs of the offering. The 2030 Senior Notes require that we pay interest at 8.00% per annum, payable quarterly in arrears on January 15, April 15, July 15 and October 15 of each year, beginning on January 15, 2016, and no principal payments are required prior to maturity on October 15, 2030. The 2030 Senior Notes are callable by us at par plus accrued interest, if any, and without penalty at any time on or after October 15, 2018.\nOn December 16, 2014, we issued in an underwritten public offering $120,000 aggregate principal amount of our 8.00% Senior Notes due on December 15, 2029, or the 2029 Senior Notes. Our net proceeds from this issuance were $114,448 after underwriters' discount and commission and other costs of the offering. The 2029 Senior Notes require that we pay interest at 8.00% per annum, payable quarterly in arrears on February 28, May 31, August 31 and November 30 of each year, beginning on February 28, 2015, and no principal payments are required prior to maturity on December 15, 2029. The 2029 Senior Notes are callable by us at par plus accrued interest, if any, and without penalty at any time on or after December 15, 2017.\nOn January 15, 2013, we issued in an underwritten public offering $110,000 aggregate principal amount of our 8.25% Senior Notes due on January 15, 2028, or the 2028 Senior Notes. Our net proceeds from this issuance were $105,250 after underwriters' discount and commission and other costs of the offering. The 2028 Senior Notes require that we pay interest at 8.25% per annum, payable quarterly in arrears on January 15, April 15, July 15 and October 15 of each year, beginning on April 15, 2013, and no principal payments are required prior to maturity on January 15, 2028. The 2028 Senior Notes are callable by us at par plus accrued interest, if any, and without penalty at any time on or after January 15, 2016.\nWe refer to the 2030 Senior Notes, 2029 Senior Notes and 2028 Senior Notes collectively as our Senior Notes, which are our senior unsecured obligations. The total annual cash payments for interest expense on the current outstanding aggregate principal amount under our Senior Notes is $26,675.\nThe indenture governing our Senior Notes does not limit the amount of indebtedness we may incur. We may issue additional debt from time to time.\nSee Note 6 to the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 15 of this Annual Report for more information about our Credit Facility or our Senior Notes.\nSources and Uses of Cash Flow\nCash Flow from Operating Activities\nIn 2016, we had net cash inflows from operating activities of $110,777, a decrease of $26,111 compared to $136,888 in 2015. The decrease was primarily due a decrease in cash from the net income attributable to common shareholders in 2015 to net loss attributable to common shareholders in 2016, partially offset by lower working capital in 2016 as compared to 2015.\nIn 2015, we had net cash inflows from operating activities of $136,888, a decrease of $24,237 compared to $161,125 in 2014. The decrease was primarily due to lower net income partially offset by lower net working capital in 2015 as compared to 2014.\nCash Flow from Investing Activities\nIn 2016, we had cash outflows from investing activities of $220,038, a decrease of $17,439 compared to $237,477 in 2015. The decrease was primarily due to a reduction in our acquisition activities, partially offset by lower proceeds from asset sales to HPT and higher capital expenditures in 2016 than in 2015. In 2016, we invested $71,935 for the acquisition of 29 convenience stores, 11 standalone restaurants and franchise agreements for an additional 39 standalone restaurants and invested $329,997 for other capital improvements to our properties. In 2016, we received $193,082 of proceeds from the sales of five properties and assets to HPT, including improvements to properties we lease from HPT.\nIn 2015, we had cash outflows from investing activities of $237,477, an increase of $103,059 compared to $134,418 in 2014. The increase was primarily due to capital expenditures and cash invested for acquisitions, partially offset by proceeds from the sale of assets to HPT. In 2015, we invested $320,290 for the acquisition of three travel centers and 169 convenience stores, and we made investments of $295,437 for other capital improvements to our properties. In 2015, we received $378,250 of proceeds from our sales of properties and assets to HPT, including improvements to properties we lease from HPT.\nAs of December 31, 2016, we had entered agreements to acquire one travel center from a franchisee for a purchase price of $13,050 and six standalone restaurants from a franchisee for an aggregate purchase price of $6,000, and we expect to invest an approximate $1,534 to expand and renovate these locations. Since December 31, 2016, we entered into an agreement to acquire an additional travel center for a purchase price of $4,175 and we expect to invest an approximate $1,950 to renovate this location. During 2017, as of the date of this Annual Report, we have completed the purchase of the six standalone restaurants for an aggregate purchase price of $6,000. We expect to complete the remaining acquisitions in the first half of 2017, but these purchases are subject to conditions and may not occur, may be delayed or the terms may change.\nWe consider sustaining capital to be the amount of investments required to maintain our existing business. We estimate that during 2017 our sustaining capital expenditures will be approximately $55,000 to $60,000. We may also make additional investments in our business for expansion or other projects and at substantial costs.\nSee Notes 2, 7 and 12 to our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 15 of this Annual Report for more information about our acquisitions and our transactions with HPT.\nCash Flow from Financing Activities\nIn 2016, we had cash outflows from financing activities of $1,035, a change of $49,530 compared to the cash inflows from financing activities of $48,495 in 2015. Our cash used in financing activities for 2016 resulted primarily from $1,394 spent to acquire treasury shares. In 2015, we had cash inflows from financing activities of $48,495, a decrease of $63,446 compared to $111,941 in 2014. The cash inflow in 2015 resulted primarily from $95,494 net cash proceeds we received in 2015 from issuance of our 2030 Senior Notes, partially offset by repayment of a financing obligation during 2015 of $45,042 for five properties we purchased from HPT that we had previously leased. In 2014, financing cash flow consisted primarily of $114,448 of net proceeds we received from issuance of our 2029 Senior Notes.\nOff Balance Sheet Arrangements\nAs of December 31, 2016, we had no off balance sheet arrangements that have had or are reasonably likely to have a current or future material effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources, other than with respect to the debt owed by Petro Travel Plaza Holdings LLC, or PTP, an entity in which we own a noncontrolling interest. See Note 10 to the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 15 of this Annual Report for more information about our investment in PTP.\nRelated Party Transactions\nRelationships with HPT, RMR and AIC\nWe have relationships and historical and continuing transactions with HPT, RMR, and its managing member, The RMR Group Inc., AIC, other companies to which RMR provides management services and others affiliated with them. For example:\nTable 149: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>HPT is our former parent company, our principal landlord and our largest shareholder and RMR provides management services to both us and HPT;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 150: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>As of December 31, 2016, we, HPT and five other companies to which RMR provides management services each owned 14.3% of AIC, which arranges and insures or reinsures in part a combined property insurance program for us and its six other shareholders; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 151: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>RMR employs our President and Chief Executive Officer; our Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer; our Executive Vice President and General Counsel; and both of our Managing Directors; one of our Managing Directors is a controlling shareholder of The RMR Group Inc., and owns direct and indirect interests in RMR through ABP Trust, of which he is a beneficial owner; RMR, assists us with various aspects of our business pursuant to a business management agreement and provides building management services at our headquarters office building pursuant to a property management agreement.\n</td> </tr>\n</table> For further information about these and other such relationships and related person transactions, see Notes 7 and 12 to the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 15 of this Annual Report and the section captioned \"Business-Our Leases with HPT\" above in Part I, Item 1 of this Annual Report, which are incorporated herein by reference, our other filings with the SEC and our definitive Proxy Statement for our 2017 Annual Meeting of Shareholders to be filed with the SEC within 120 days after the close of the fiscal year ended December 31, 2016. For further information about these transactions and relationships and about the risks that may arise as a result of these and other related person transactions and relationships, see elsewhere in this Annual Report, including \"Warning Concerning Forward Looking Statements\" and Part I, Item 1A, \"Risk Factors\". Copies of certain of our agreements with these related persons, including our leases and related amendments with HPT, our business and property management agreements with RMR, certain other agreements with HPT and our shareholders agreement with AIC and its shareholders, are available as exhibits to our public filings with the SEC and accessible at the SEC's website, www.sec.gov. We may engage in additional transactions with related persons, including HPT and businesses to which RMR or its affiliates provide management services.\nCritical Accounting Policies\nThe preparation of our financial statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires us to make reasonable estimates and assumptions that may involve the exercise of significant judgment. For any estimate or assumption used, there may be other reasonable estimates or assumptions that may have been used. However, based on the available facts and circumstances inherent in the estimates and assumptions reflected in our consolidated financial statements, management believes it is unlikely that applying other reasonable estimates and assumptions would have caused materially different amounts to have been reported. Actual results may differ from these estimates.\nImpairment of long lived assets. We perform a test for impairment of our property and equipment at the individual site level, since this is the lowest grouping of assets and liabilities at which the related cash flows are largely independent of other assets and liabilities. We recognize impairment charges when (i) the carrying value of a long lived asset or asset group to be held and used in the business is not recoverable and exceeds its fair value and (ii) when the carrying value of a long lived asset or asset group to be disposed of exceeds the estimated fair value of the asset less the estimated cost to sell the asset. Our estimates of fair value are based on our estimates of likely market participant assumptions. Key assumptions include our current expectations for projected fuel sales volumes, nonfuel revenues, fuel and nonfuel gross margins, site level operating expenses and real estate rent expense. If the business climate deteriorates, our actual results may not be consistent with these assumptions and estimates. The discount rate, which is used to measure the present value of the projected future cash flows, is set using a weighted average cost of capital method that considers market and industry data as well as our specific risk factors and that we believe is likely to be used by a market participant. The weighted average cost of capital is our estimate of the overall after tax rate of return required by equity and debt holders of a business enterprise. We use a number of assumptions and methods in preparing valuations underlying impairment tests, including estimates of future cash flows and discount rates. During 2016, we did not record any impairment charges relating to our property and equipment. Applying significantly different assumptions or valuation methods could result in different results from these impairment tests.\nImpairment of indefinite lived intangible assets and goodwill. We assess intangible assets with indefinite lives for impairment annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount may not be recoverable using either a quantitative or qualitative analysis. Indefinite lived intangible assets consisted of trademarks and their fair value was determined using a relief from royalty method. For 2016, indefinite lived intangible assets were assessed using a qualitative analysis that was performed by assessing certain trends and factors, including projected growth rates and actual sales and operating profit margins, discount rates, industry data and other relevant qualitative factors. These trends and factors were compared to, and based on, the assumptions used in the most recent quantitative assessment.\nWe evaluate goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level as of July 31. Goodwill impairment testing for 2016 was performed using a quantitative analysis under which the fair value of our goodwill was estimated using both an income approach and a market approach. The income approach considered discounted forecasted cash flows that were based on our long term operating plan. If the business climate deteriorates, our actual results may not be consistent with these assumptions and estimates. A terminal value was used to estimate the cash flows beyond the period covered by the operating plan. The discount rate is an estimate of the overall after tax rate of return required by equity and debt market holders of a business enterprise. The market approach considered comparable publicly traded guideline companies' respective business values. For each comparable publicly traded guideline company, value indicators, or pricing multiples, were considered to estimate the value of our business enterprise. These analyses require the exercise of significant judgments, including judgments about appropriate discount rates, perpetual growth rates and the timing of expected future cash flows. During 2016, we did not record any impairment charges related to our indefinite lived intangible assets or goodwill. Applying significantly different assumptions or valuation methods could result in different results from this impairment test.\nCustomer loyalty programs. We have accruals for the customer loyalty programs we offer, similar to frequent shopper programs offered by other retailers. Drivers enrolled in these programs earn points for certain fuel and nonfuel purchases that can be redeemed for discounts on future nonfuel products and services at our travel centers. In determining these accruals, we must estimate redemption rates and future expected point expirations. These estimates are based on historical point expiration patterns, adjusted for expected future changes. To the extent an estimate is inaccurate, our liabilities, expenses and net income attributable to common shareholders may be understated or overstated.\nIncome tax matters. As part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements, we estimate income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate. This process involves estimating actual current tax expense along with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for financial statement and tax reporting purposes. These temporary differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities, which are recorded in our consolidated balance sheets. We are required to record a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets if we are not able to conclude that it is more likely than not these assets will be realized. In measuring our deferred tax assets, we consider all available evidence, both positive and negative, to determine whether, based on the weight of that evidence, a valuation allowance is needed for all or a portion of the deferred tax assets. Judgment is required in considering the relative impact of negative and positive evidence. The weight given to the potential effect of negative and positive evidence is commensurate with the extent to which it can be objectively verified. We continue to maintain a valuation allowance against the deferred tax assets related to certain net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards in certain federal, state and foreign jurisdictions. To the extent our estimates and assumptions prove inaccurate we may need to recognize additional amounts of valuation allowance, which would increase our income tax expense and reduce our net income attributable to common shareholders in future periods.\nWe are also required to evaluate uncertain tax positions that benefit our income tax returns. The two step process of recognition and measurement required with respect to uncertain tax positions can require a great deal of management judgment regarding the probability that a tax position, based solely on its technical merits, will be sustained upon examination by the taxing authority, and the measurement of the amount of benefit that is more likely than not to be realized upon ultimate resolution. Many assumptions and estimates may be taken into account in the determination of whether a tax position will be recognized in the financial statements and, if the tax position is to be recognized, the amount of benefit to be recognized. These assumptions and estimates are subject to change due to many factors. To the extent our estimates and assumptions prove inaccurate we may need to adjust the amounts recognized in our financial statements, which could increase or decrease our assets, liabilities, income tax expense and net income attributable to common shareholders in future periods.\nAccounting for leases. With respect to accounting for leases, each time we enter a new lease or materially modify an existing lease we evaluate its classification as either a capital lease or an operating lease. The classification of a lease as capital or operating affects whether and how the transaction is reflected in our balance sheets, as well as our recognition of rental payments as rent or interest expense. These evaluations require us to make estimates of, among other things, the remaining useful life and residual value of leased properties, appropriate discount rates and future cash flows that may be realized from the leased properties. Incorrect assumptions or estimates may result in misclassification of our leases. Other aspects of our lease accounting policies relate to the accounting for sale leaseback transactions, including the appropriate amortization of related deferred liabilities and any deferred gains or losses, and the accounting for lease incentives. Our lease accounting policies involve significant judgments based upon our experience, including judgments about current valuations, estimated useful lives and salvage or residual values. In the future we may need to revise our assessments to incorporate information which is not known at the time of our previous assessments, and such revisions could increase or decrease our depreciation expense related to properties that we lease, result in the classification of some of our leases as other than operating leases or decrease the carrying values of some of our assets.\nBusiness combinations. We account for our acquisitions of businesses as business combinations, which requires that the assets acquired and liabilities assumed be recognized at their respective fair values as of the acquisition date. Fair value is defined as the price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the acquisition date. We record any excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair value of the net assets as goodwill. Our accounting for business combinations involves significant judgments about valuations of assets and liabilities in the current market and the assignment of estimated useful lives. We may adjust our accounting for business combinations to reflect information that is unknown at the time of our respective acquisitions for up to one year after each purchase. Acquisition related transaction costs, such as legal fees, due diligence costs and closing costs, are not included as a component of consideration transferred in an acquisition but are expensed as incurred. The operating results of acquired businesses are reflected in our consolidated financial statements from the date of the acquisition.\nSelf insurance accruals. We are exposed to losses under insurance programs for which we pay deductibles and for which we are partially self insured up to certain stop loss amounts, including claims under our general liability, workers' compensation, motor vehicle and group health benefits policies and programs. Accruals are established under these insurance programs for both estimated losses on known claims and potential claims incurred but not asserted, based on claims histories and using actuarial methods. The most significant risk of this methodology is its dependence on claims histories, which are not always indicative of future claims. To the extent an estimate is inaccurate, our liabilities, expenses and net income attributable to common shareholders may be understated or overstated.\nContingencies. We establish or adjust environmental contingency accruals when the responsibility to remediate becomes probable and the amount of associated costs is reasonably determinable and we record legal contingency accruals when our liability becomes probable and when we can reasonably estimate the amount of our contingent loss. We also have a receivable for expected recoveries of certain of our estimated future environmental expenditures. The process of determining both our estimated future costs of environmental remediation and our estimated future recoveries of costs from insurers or others involves a high degree of management judgment based on past experiences and current and expected regulatory and insurance market conditions. The process of estimating our liability for legal matters involves a high degree of management judgment, which is based on facts and circumstances specific to each matter and our prior experiences with similar matters that may not be indicative of future results. To the extent an estimate is inaccurate, our liabilities, expenses and net income attributable to common shareholders may be understated or overstated.\nSummary of Contractual Obligations and Commitments\nAt December 31, 2016, our primary outstanding trade commitments were $23,128 for letters of credit.

For instance, federal and state governmental requirements addressing emissions from trucks and other motor vehicles, such as the EPA's gasoline and diesel sulfur control requirements that limit the concentration of sulfur in motor fuel, as well as new fuel efficiency standards for medium and heavy duty commercial trucks, has caused us to add certain services and provide certain products to our customers at a cost to us that we may be unable to pass through to our customers. Also, various private initiatives and government regulations to promote fuel efficiency that raise the cost of trucking as compared to other types of freight transport, may decrease the demand for our fuel products and negatively impact our business. For example, in August 2016 the EPA and the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration established final regulations that will phase in more stringent greenhouse gas emission and fuel efficiency standards for medium and heavy duty trucks beginning in model year 2021 (model year 2018 for certain trailers) through model year 2027, and these regulations are estimated to reduce fuel usage between 9% and 25% (depending on vehicle category) by model year 2027. We may not be able to completely offset the loss of business we may suffer as a result of increasing engine efficiency and other fuel conservation efforts.\nSome observers believe severe weather activities in different parts of the country over the last few years evidence global climate change. Such severe weather that may result from climate change may have an adverse effect on individual properties we own, lease or operate. We mitigate these risks by owning, leasing and operating a diversified portfolio of properties, by procuring insurance coverage we believe adequately protects us from material damages and losses and by attempting to monitor and be prepared for such events. However, there can be no assurance that our mitigation efforts will be sufficient or that storms that may occur due to future climate change or otherwise could not have a material adverse effect on our business.\nFor further information about these and other environmental and climate change matters, and the related risks that may arise, see the disclosure under the heading \"Environmental Contingencies\" in Note 13 to the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 15 of this Annual Report, \"Warning Concerning Forward Looking Statements,\" \"Regulatory Environment-Environmental Regulation\" in Item 1 and Item 1A, \"Risk Factors.\"", "item_7_truncated": "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThe following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes included in Item 15 of this Annual Report. Amounts are in thousands of dollars or gallons unless indicated otherwise.\nExecutive Summary\nOur revenues and income are subject to material changes as a result of market prices and the availability of diesel fuel and gasoline. These factors are subject to the worldwide petroleum products supply chain, which historically has experienced price and supply volatility as a result of, among other things, severe weather, terrorism, political crises, military actions and variations in demand that are often the result of changes in the macroeconomic environment. Also, concerted efforts by major oil producing countries and cartels to limit oil supply can impact prices.\nOver the past few years there have been significant changes in the cost of fuel. Fuel prices generally trended upward for the year, ending at a higher price than at the start of the year. During the year ended December 31, 2016, the average fuel price was 15.9% below the average fuel price during the year ended December 31, 2015. Some current economic forecasts reflect continued low prices for fuel; although other economic forecasts indicate an expectation of economic growth and inflation in the U.S. and elsewhere, which may impact demand for fuel and fuel prices. As noted above, various factors and events can cause fuel prices to change, sometimes suddenly and sharply.\nDue to the volatility of our fuel costs and our pricing to fuel customers, we believe that fuel revenue is not a reliable metric for analyzing our results of operations from period to period. As a result solely of changes in fuel prices, our fuel revenue may materially increase or decrease, in both absolute amounts and on a percentage basis, without a comparable change in fuel sales volumes or in fuel gross margin. We therefore consider fuel sales volume and fuel gross margin to be better measures of our performance.\nWe generally are able to pass changes in our cost for fuel products to customers, but typically with a delay, such that during periods of rising fuel commodity prices fuel gross margins per gallon tend to be lower than they otherwise may have been and during periods of falling fuel commodity prices fuel gross margins per gallon tend to be higher than they otherwise may have been. Increases and volatility in the prices we pay for fuel can have negative effects on our sales and profitability and increase our working capital requirements. For more information about fuel market risks that may affect us and our actions to mitigate those risks, see Item 7A, \"Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk\" elsewhere in this Annual Report.\nWe believe that demand for diesel fuel by trucking companies for any given level of trucking activity will be reduced over time by technological innovations that permit, and regulations that encourage or require, improved fuel efficiency of motor vehicle engines and other fuel conservation practices. We believe these factors combined with adjusting our fuel sales pricing to manage fuel sales volume and profitability and lower levels of freight activity, were contributors to decreases in the level of fuel sales volumes we realized on a same site basis for 2016, as compared to 2015, despite generally improving economic conditions during 2016. Although fuel sales volume declined on a same site basis, it increased on a total basis due to the number of new locations we added to our business during 2015 and 2016.\nDespite higher fuel sales volume in 2016 compared to 2015, our fuel gross margin and fuel gross margin per gallon were lower in 2016 than in 2015, primarily due to an inordinately favorable purchasing environment in the first four months of 2015 that did not recur in 2016.\nThe net loss attributable to common shareholders we experienced for 2016, as compared to the income we achieved during 2015, was primarily due to increases in depreciation and amortization expenses, and expenses related to financing and managing our newly acquired and developed locations (including real estate rent, interest and selling, general and administrative expenses), a decrease in fuel gross margin, and increased competition. These decreases were partially offset by an increase in nonfuel gross margin in excess of site level operating expenses generated by our locations.\nAs described under the heading \"Other Disputes\" in Note 13 to the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 15 of this Annual Report, Comdata has purported to terminate its merchant agreement with us and, beginning February 1, 2017, unilaterally increased the fees it withholds from the transaction settlement payments due to us. We believe that Comdata has wrongfully terminated our agreement and raised the fees we pay Comdata, and we are pursuing litigation against Comdata. However, if we do not prevail in our pending litigation against Comdata, we may not be able to recover the increased fees Comdata charges us through higher prices to customers, and our operating expenses may increase.\nFactors Affecting Comparability\nTransaction Agreement with HPT\nOn June 1, 2015, we entered a transaction agreement with HPT, which we and HPT amended on June 22, 2016. We refer to this amended transaction agreement as the Transaction Agreement. Under the Transaction Agreement, among other things, we agreed to sell to HPT 16 existing travel centers we owned and certain assets at 11 properties currently leased from HPT, plus four additional travel centers upon our completion of their development, and HPT agreed to lease back these properties and assets to us under the HPT Leases. We also agreed to purchase from HPT five travel centers we previously leased from HPT.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2015, we sold 14 travel centers and certain assets at 11 properties currently leased from HPT for an aggregate of $279,383 and purchased five travel centers from HPT for $45,042. The resulting net increase of our minimum annual rent under our TA Leases was $20,153.\nOn March 31, 2016, we sold one of the development properties to HPT for $19,683, and our minimum annual rent due to HPT increased by $1,673.\nOn June 22, 2016, we sold two existing travel centers for an aggregate of $23,876, and our minimum annual rent due to HPT increased by $2,029.\nOn June 30, 2016, we sold one of the development properties to HPT for $22,297, and our minimum annual rent due to HPT increased by $1,895.\nOn September 30, 2016, we sold one of the development properties to HPT for $16,557, and our minimum annual rent due to HPT increased by $1,407.\nSee Notes 7 and 12 to the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 15 of this Annual Report for more information about our Transaction Agreement with HPT.\nAcquired and Developed Sites\nSince the beginning of 2011, when we began our acquisition program, to December 31, 2016, we have invested $855,003 to develop, purchase and improve 318 travel centers, convenience stores and standalone restaurants. For the year ended December 31, 2016, these investments produced site level gross margin in excess of site level operating expenses of $99,957, or, on a sequential basis, $8,253, or 9.0%, greater than site level gross margin in excess of site level operating expenses for the twelve months ended September 30, 2016.\nWe believe that our investments require a period after they are developed or acquired and upgrades are completed to reach their expected stabilized financial results, generally three years for travel centers and one year for convenience stores.\nWe acquired or developed 39 travel centers during the 2011 to 2016 period. Of those, 36 are included in the \"Travel Centers Segment Same Site Operating Data\" for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015. As of December 31, 2016, we have invested $312,139 (including improvements) in these 36 locations, and they generated $54,271 of gross margin in excess of site level operating expenses during the year ended December 31, 2016. The remaining three locations were developed by us for a total investment of $64,862; and they generated $3,526 of gross margin in excess of site level operating expenses during the year ended December 31, 2016; however, we have operated these locations for less than the full year 2016 (one opened in each of January, March and May).\nWe acquired 228 convenience stores during the 2013 to 2016 period. Of these, 31 are included in the \"Convenience Store Segment Same Site Operating Data\" for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015. As of December 31, 2016, we have invested $66,491 (including improvements) in these 31 locations, and they generated $11,608 of gross margin in excess of site level operating expenses during the year ended December 31, 2016. The remaining 197 locations were acquired by us in 2015 or 2016 for a total investment of $376,854 (including improvements), and these convenience stores generated $23,237 of gross margin in excess of site level operating expenses during the year ended December 31, 2016. The 29 convenience stores we acquired during 2016 were operated by us for an average of nine months during 2016 and some of these were fully or partially out of service while being renovated.\nWe acquired one standalone restaurant during 2015 and 50 during 2016. As of December 31, 2016, we have invested $34,657 (including improvements) in these 51 locations, and they generated $7,315 of gross margin in excess of site level operating expenses during the year ended December 31, 2016.\nOur growth activities have also contributed to growth in our selling, general and administrative expenses, which were $139,052 for the year ended December 31, 2016, a $17,285, or 14.2%, increase over the amount for the year ended December 31, 2015. We estimate that approximately $10,000 of this increase can be attributed to the increase in our number of sites, including such items as marketing, advertising, regional management personnel and centralized support costs.\nAs of December 31, 2016, we had agreements to acquire one travel center and six standalone restaurants from two of our franchisees for an aggregate purchase price of $19,050, and since December 31, 2016, we have entered into an agreement to acquire an additional travel center for a purchase price of $4,175. During January 2017, we completed the purchase of six standalone restaurants for an aggregate purchase price of $6,000. We expect to complete the remaining acquisitions in the first half of 2017, but these purchases are subject to conditions that may not occur, may be delayed or the terms may change. We currently intend to continue to selectively acquire additional locations and to otherwise expand our business.\nResults of Operations\nConsolidated Financial Results\nThe following table presents changes in our operating results for the year ended December 31, 2016, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2015 and for the year ended December 31, 2015, as compared to the year ended December

Fuel gross margin for 2016 decreased by $9,717, or 2.3%, as compared to 2015. This decrease in fuel gross margin was primarily due to an unusually favorable purchasing environment in the first four months of 2015 that did not recur in 2016.\nNonfuel gross margin. Nonfuel gross margin for 2016 increased by $90,311, or 9.4%, as compared to 2015 due primarily to acquired locations and our pricing and marketing initiatives. Nonfuel gross margin as a percentage of nonfuel revenues was 53.6% and 54.0% for 2016 and 2015, respectively. The nonfuel gross margin percentage decreased primarily due to the acquisition of additional convenience stores since the beginning of 2015. Nonfuel gross margin percentage in our convenience store operations is typically lower than the nonfuel gross margin percentage for our travel center operations.\nSite level operating expenses. Site level operating expenses for 2016 increased by $73,761, or 8.3%, as compared to 2015 due primarily to acquired locations. Site level operating expenses as a percentage of nonfuel revenues were 48.9% and 49.7% for 2016 and 2015, respectively. The improved expense ratio reflects both a larger portion of our operations conducted at convenience stores and the continued stabilization of our acquired convenience store locations.\nSelling, general and administrative expenses. Selling, general and administrative expenses for 2016 increased by $17,285, or 14.2%, as compared to 2015. The increase was primarily attributable to increased personnel required to support the growth of our business, as well as increased spending on marketing and promotional activities.\nReal estate rent expense. Rent expense for 2016 increased by $30,707, or 13.3%, as compared to 2015. The increase in real estate rent expense was primarily a result of the sale to, and lease back from, HPT of travel centers and improvements at leased sites since the beginning of 2015, including the sales pursuant to the Transaction Agreement with HPT.\nDepreciation and amortization expense. Depreciation and amortization expense for 2016 increased by $20,006, or 27.6%, as compared to 2015. The increase in depreciation and amortization expense primarily resulted from the locations we acquired and capital investments at our owned sites that we completed since the beginning of 2015.\nInterest expense, net. Interest expense, net for 2016 increased by $5,270, or 23.4%, as compared to 2015, primarily as a result of our issuance of $100,000 of the 2030 Senior Notes in October 2015.\nProvision for income taxes. For 2016, we had an income tax benefit of $1,733 as a result of a pretax loss. In 2015, we had an income tax provision of $16,539 as a result of pretax income.

Wholesale fuel sales increased primarily as a result of our acquisitions in the second half of 2015.\nNonfuel revenues for 2015 increased by $165,959, or 10.3%, as compared to 2014, primarily as a result of locations acquired in 2014 and 2015.\nFuel gross margin. Fuel gross margin for 2015 decreased by $14,006, or 3.3%, as compared to 2014. The decrease in fuel gross margin was primarily due to an inordinately favorable purchasing environment in the 2014 fourth quarter that did not recur in 2015, partially offset by an increase of $4,999 in 2015 compared to 2014 related to amounts owed to us in connection with certain biodiesel purchases we made during 2015 as a result of the reinstatement during the fourth quarter of 2015 of biodiesel and renewable energy fuel tax credits. The legislation authorizing these tax credits was passed and the credits were retroactively applied in December of each of 2015 and 2014.\nNonfuel gross margin. Nonfuel gross margin for 2015 increased by $84,835, or 9.7%, as compared to 2014, due to locations acquired in 2014 and 2015 and our pricing and marketing initiatives. Nonfuel gross margin as a percentage of nonfuel revenues was 54.0% and 54.3% for 2015 and 2014, respectively. The nonfuel gross margin percentage decreased primarily due to the inclusion of additional convenience stores, as a result of acquisitions since the beginning of 2015. Nonfuel gross margin percentage in our convenience store operations is typically lower than the nonfuel gross margin percentage for our travel center operations.\nSite level operating expenses. Site level operating expenses for 2015 increased by $70,035, or 8.6%, as compared to 2014 primarily due to locations acquired in 2014 and 2015. Site level operating expenses as a percentage of nonfuel revenues were 49.7% and 50.4% for 2015 and 2014, respectively. The improved expense ratio reflects both a larger portion of our operations conducted at convenience stores and the continued stabilization of our locations acquired in 2014 and 2015.\nSelling, general and administrative expenses. Selling, general and administrative expenses for 2015 increased by $14,944, or 14.0%, as compared to 2014. The increase was primarily attributable to increased personnel to support the growth of our business, especially the significant growth in our convenience store segment. These increases were partially offset by lower audit and consultant fees.\nReal estate rent expense. Real estate rent expense for 2015 increased by $14,436, or 6.6%, as compared to 2014. The increase in real estate rent expense was primarily a result of the sale to, and lease back from, HPT in June 2015 and September 2015 of 14 owned travel centers and certain assets we owned at 11 properties leased from HPT, as well as improvements at leased sites we sold to HPT during 2015 and 2014.\nDepreciation and amortization expense. Depreciation and amortization expense for 2015 increased by $6,799, or 10.4%, as compared to 2014. The increase in depreciation and amortization expense primarily resulted from the acquisitions and other capital investments we completed during 2014 and 2015. The increase was partially offset by the reduction in our depreciable assets as a result of the sale to, and lease back from, HPT in June 2015 and September 2015 of 14 owned travel centers and certain assets we owned at 11 properties leased from HPT.\nInterest expense, net. Interest expense, net for 2015 increased by $5,833, or 34.9%, as compared to 2014, primarily as a result of our issuances of $100,000 of our 2030 Senior Notes in October 2015 and $120,000 of our 2029 Senior Notes in December 2014.\nProvision for income taxes. The income tax provisions for 2015 and 2014 were $16,539 and $38,023, respectively. The decrease in the income tax provision for 2015 was primarily due to an increase in the utilization of various tax credits and incentives. See Note 9 to the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 15 of this Annual Report for more information about our income taxes.\nSegment Results of Operations\nThe following is a discussion of fuel and nonfuel revenues and site level gross margin in excess of site level operating expenses by reportable segment.\nAs part of this discussion and analysis of our reportable segment operating results we refer to increases and decreases in results on a same site basis. We include a location in the same site comparisons only if we continuously operated it for the entire period since the beginning of the earliest comparative period presented. Locations we operate that are owned by an unconsolidated joint venture are not included in our same site comparisons. Same site data also excludes revenues and expenses that were not generated at locations we operate, such as rent and royalties from franchisees, revenues from a dealer operated convenience store and corporate selling, general and administrative expenses. We do not exclude locations from the same site comparisons as a result of capital improvements to the site or changes in the services offered.\nTravel Centers\nThe following table presents changes in the operating results of our travel center segment for the year ended December 31, 2016, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2015, and for the year ended December 31, 2015, as compared to the

On a same site basis, fuel sales volume decreased by 84,141 gallons, or 4.3%, during 2016 as compared to 2015. We believe the decrease in same site fuel sales volume was primarily due to our efforts to adjust fuel sales profitability by managing pricing and the effects of truck engine fuel efficiency improvements and other fuel conservation efforts, lower levels of freight activity and competition.\nNonfuel revenues for 2016 increased by $17,765, or 1.1%, as compared to 2015. The increase in nonfuel revenues was primarily due to nonfuel sales at acquired locations partially offset by decreases in nonfuel sales on a same site basis. The decrease on a same site basis was primarily due to lower revenue at full service restaurants due to closing certain of our restaurants during slower night time periods and a decrease in tire sales revenue primarily due to increased competition.\nSite level gross margin in excess of site level operating expenses. Site level gross margin in excess of site level operating expenses for 2016 decreased by $14,652, or 3.0%, as compared to 2015, due to a decrease of $20,725, or 4.4%, on a same site basis partially offset by an increase due to acquired locations.\nOn a same site basis, site level gross margin in excess of site level operating expenses decreased for 2016 as compared to 2015 as a result of a decrease in fuel gross margin, primarily due to our unusually favorable purchasing experience in the first four months of 2015 that did not recur during 2016.\nYear ended December 31, 2015, as compared to December 31, 2014\nRevenues.

On a same site basis, fuel sales volume for 2015 increased by 12,657 gallons, or 0.7%, as compared to 2014. The increase in fuel sales volume on a same site basis was primarily due to our continued focus on adjusting fuel sales pricing to manage profitability and certain marketing initiatives.\nNonfuel revenues for 2015 increased by $86,650, or 5.6%, as compared to 2014. The increase in nonfuel revenue was primarily due to same sites and from locations acquired during 2014 and 2015. On a same site basis, nonfuel revenues for 2015 increased by $81,498, or 5.4%, as compared to 2014. We believe this same site increase is primarily due to favorable effects of certain of our marketing initiatives.\nSite level gross margin in excess of site level operating expenses.

On a same site basis, fuel sales volume for 2016 decreased by 632 gallons, or 1.5%, as compared to 2015. The decrease in same site fuel sales volume was primarily due to our adjusting fuel sales pricing to manage fuel sales volume and profitability and the effects of competition.\nNonfuel revenues for 2016 increased by $139,655, or 90.0%, as compared to 2015. The increase in nonfuel revenues was primarily due to acquired locations. On a same site basis, nonfuel revenues increased modestly as operations at acquired sites continue to stabilize.\nSite level gross margin in excess of site level operating expenses. Site level gross margin in excess of site level operating expenses for 2016 increased by $19,401, or 112.4%, as compared to 2015, primarily due to acquired locations.\nOn a same site basis, site level gross margin in excess of site level operating expenses for 2016 increased as compared to 2015 due to an increase in nonfuel gross margin due to a favorable change in the mix of products and services sold and an increase in fuel gross margin primarily resulting from our continued focus on adjusting our fuel sales pricing to manage profitability.\nYear ended December 31, 2015, as compared to December 31, 2014\nRevenues.

On a same site basis, fuel sales volume for 2015 increased by 1,642 gallons, or 4.1%, from 2014.\nNonfuel revenues for 2015 increased by $78,563, or 102.5%, from 2014. The increase in nonfuel revenues was primarily due to the sites we acquired during 2015. On a same site basis, nonfuel revenues increased by $3,023, or 3.9%, for 2015, as compared to 2014, primarily due to the favorable effects of certain of our marketing initiatives.\nSite level gross margin in excess of site level operating expenses. Site level gross margin in excess of site level operating expenses for 2015 increased by $8,425, or 95.4%, from 2014, due to locations acquired in 2015 and a $3,550, or 40.2%, increase on a same site basis.\nOn a same site basis, site level gross margin in excess of site level operating expenses increased for 2015 as compared to 2014, due to an increase in nonfuel gross margin due to a favorable change in the mix or products and services sold, an increase in fuel gross margin primarily resulting from our continued focus on adjusting our fuel sales pricing to manage fuel sales volume and profitability, partially offset by an increase in site level operating expenses.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nOur principal liquidity requirements are to meet our operating and financing costs and to fund our capital expenditures, acquisitions and working capital requirements. Our principal sources of liquidity to meet these requirements are our:\n \u2022 cash balance; \n \u2022 operating cash flow; \n \u2022 our Credit Facility, with a current maximum availability of $200,000, or our Credit Facility, subject to limits based on our qualified collateral; \n \u2022 sales to HPT of improvements we make to the sites we lease from HPT and the development site to be sold to HPT under the Transaction Agreement; \n \u2022 potential issuances of new debt and equity securities; and \n \u2022 potential financing or selling of unencumbered real estate that we own.  We believe that the primary risks we currently face with respect to our operating cash flow are:\n \u2022 continuing decreased demand for our fuel products resulting from regulatory and market efforts for improved engine fuel efficiency and fuel conservation generally; \n \u2022 decreased demand for our products and services that we may experience as a result of competition; \n \u2022 a significant portion of our expenses are fixed in nature, which may restrict our ability to realize a sufficient reduction in our expenses to offset a reduction in our revenues; \n \u2022 the possible inability of recently acquired or developed properties to generate the stabilized financial results we expect; \n \u2022 the risk of an economic slowdown or recession; and \n \u2022 the negative impacts on our gross margins and working capital requirements if there were a return to the higher level of prices for petroleum products we experienced during the first half of 2014 and in prior years, as well as the increased volatility of those prices.  Our business requires substantial amounts of working capital, including cash liquidity, and our working capital requirements can be especially large because of the volatility of fuel prices. Our growth strategy of selectively acquiring additional properties and businesses and developing new sites requires us to expend substantial capital. In addition, our properties are high traffic sites with many customers and large trucks entering and exiting our properties daily, requiring us to expend capital to improve, repair and maintain our properties. Although we had a cash balance of $61,312 on December 31, 2016, and net cash provided by operating activities in 2016, there can be no assurance that we will maintain similar amounts of cash, that we will generate future profits or positive cash flows or that we will be able to obtain additional financing, if and when it becomes necessary or desirable to pursue business opportunities.\nLiquidity Aspects of Transactions with HPT\nPursuant to the Transaction Agreement, HPT agreed to purchase from us, for our cost, four travel centers then being or to be developed, on land parcels we then owned, upon their completion, if such development were completed prior to June 30, 2017. As of December 31, 2016, we had completed construction of three of these travel centers and one of these travel centers was under construction. On each of March 31, 2016, June 30, 2016, and September 30, 2016, we sold to HPT for $19,683, $22,297 and $16,557, respectively, and leased back from HPT, one of the completed travel centers. Also, on June 22, 2016, pursuant to the Transaction Agreement, we sold to, and leased back from, HPT two existing travel centers owned by us for an aggregate of $23,876. We expect to sell to HPT the remaining development property during the first half of 2017. As of December 31, 2016, we had invested $26,429 (including land costs) for the remaining development property and we estimate the remaining development cost will be approximately $1,813.\nRevolving Credit Facility\nWe have a Credit Facility with a group of commercial banks that matures on December 19, 2019. Under the Credit Facility, a maximum of $200,000 may be drawn, repaid and redrawn until maturity. The availability of this maximum amount is subject to limits based on qualified collateral. Subject to available collateral and lender participation, the maximum amount of this Credit Facility may be increased to $300,000. The Credit Facility may be used for general business purposes and permits for the issuance of letters of credit. Generally, no principal payments are due until maturity. Borrowings under the Credit Facility bear interest at a rate based on, at our option, LIBOR or a base rate, plus a premium (which premium is subject to adjustment based upon facility availability, utilization and other matters). At December 31, 2016, based on our qualified collateral, a total of $102,625 was available to us for loans and letters of credit under the Credit Facility. At December 31, 2016, there were no loans outstanding under the Credit Facility but we had outstanding $23,128 of letters of credit issued under that facility, which reduces the amount available for borrowing under the Credit Facility, leaving $79,497 available for our use as of that date.\nSenior Notes\nOn October 5, 2015, we issued in an underwritten public offering $100,000 aggregate principal amount of our 8.00% Senior Notes due on October 15, 2030, or the 2030 Senior Notes. Our net proceeds from this issuance were $95,494 after underwriters' discount and commission and other costs of the offering. The 2030 Senior Notes require that we pay interest at 8.00% per annum, payable quarterly in arrears on January 15, April 15, July 15 and October 15 of each year, beginning on January 15, 2016, and no principal payments are required prior to maturity on October 15, 2030. The 2030 Senior Notes are callable by us at par plus accrued interest, if any, and without penalty at any time on or after October 15, 2018.\nOn December 16, 2014, we issued in an underwritten public offering $120,000 aggregate principal amount of our 8.00% Senior Notes due on December 15, 2029, or the 2029 Senior Notes. Our net proceeds from this issuance were $114,448 after underwriters' discount and commission and other costs of the offering. The 2029 Senior Notes require that we pay interest at 8.00% per annum, payable quarterly in arrears on February 28, May 31, August 31 and November 30 of each year, beginning on February 28, 2015, and no principal payments are required prior to maturity on December 15, 2029. The 2029 Senior Notes are callable by us at par plus accrued interest, if any, and without penalty at any time on or after December 15, 2017.\nOn January 15, 2013, we issued in an underwritten public offering $110,000 aggregate principal amount of our 8.25% Senior Notes due on January 15, 2028, or the 2028 Senior Notes. Our net proceeds from this issuance were $105,250 after underwriters' discount and commission and other costs of the offering. The 2028 Senior Notes require that we pay interest at 8.25% per annum, payable quarterly in arrears on January 15, April 15, July 15 and October 15 of each year, beginning on April 15, 2013, and no principal payments are required prior to maturity on January 15, 2028. The 2028 Senior Notes are callable by us at par plus accrued interest, if any, and without penalty at any time on or after January 15, 2016.\nWe refer to the 2030 Senior Notes, 2029 Senior Notes and 2028 Senior Notes collectively as our Senior Notes, which are our senior unsecured obligations. The total annual cash payments for interest expense on the current outstanding aggregate principal amount under our Senior Notes is $26,675.\nThe indenture governing our Senior Notes does not limit the amount of indebtedness we may incur. We may issue additional debt from time to time.\nSee Note 6 to the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 15 of this Annual Report for more information about our Credit Facility or our Senior Notes.\nSources and Uses of Cash Flow\nCash Flow from Operating Activities\nIn 2016, we had net cash inflows from operating activities of $110,777, a decrease of $26,111 compared to $136,888 in 2015. The decrease was primarily due a decrease in cash from the net income attributable to common shareholders in 2015 to net loss attributable to common shareholders in 2016, partially offset by lower working capital in 2016 as compared to 2015.\nIn 2015, we had net cash inflows from operating activities of $136,888, a decrease of $24,237 compared to $161,125 in 2014. The decrease was primarily due to lower net income partially offset by lower net working capital in 2015 as compared to 2014.\nCash Flow from Investing Activities\nIn 2016, we had cash outflows from investing activities of $220,038, a decrease of $17,439 compared to $237,477 in 2015. The decrease was primarily due to a reduction in our acquisition activities, partially offset by lower proceeds from asset sales to HPT and higher capital expenditures in 2016 than in 2015. In 2016, we invested $71,935 for the acquisition of 29 convenience stores, 11 standalone restaurants and franchise agreements for an additional 39 standalone restaurants and invested $329,997 for other capital improvements to our properties. In 2016, we received $193,082 of proceeds from the sales of five properties and assets to HPT, including improvements to properties we lease from HPT.\nIn 2015, we had cash outflows from investing activities of $237,477, an increase of $103,059 compared to $134,418 in 2014. The increase was primarily due to capital expenditures and cash invested for acquisitions, partially offset by proceeds from the sale of assets to HPT. In 2015, we invested $320,290 for the acquisition of three travel centers and 169 convenience stores, and we made investments of $295,437 for other capital improvements to our properties. In 2015, we received $378,250 of proceeds from our sales of properties and assets to HPT, including improvements to properties we lease from HPT.\nAs of December 31, 2016, we had entered agreements to acquire one travel center from a franchisee for a purchase price of $13,050 and six standalone restaurants from a franchisee for an aggregate purchase price of $6,000, and we expect to invest an approximate $1,534 to expand and renovate these locations. Since December 31, 2016, we entered into an agreement to acquire an additional travel center for a purchase price of $4,175 and we expect to invest an approximate $1,950 to renovate this location. During 2017, as of the date of this Annual Report, we have completed the purchase of the six standalone restaurants for an aggregate purchase price of $6,000. We expect to complete the remaining acquisitions in the first half of 2017, but these purchases are subject to conditions and may not occur, may be delayed or the terms may change.\nWe consider sustaining capital to be the amount of investments required to maintain our existing business. We estimate that during 2017 our sustaining capital expenditures will be approximately $55,000 to $60,000. We may also make additional investments in our business for expansion or other projects and at substantial costs.\nSee Notes 2, 7 and 12 to our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 15 of this Annual Report for more information about our acquisitions and our transactions with HPT.\nCash Flow from Financing Activities\nIn 2016, we had cash outflows from financing activities of $1,035, a change of $49,530 compared to the cash inflows from financing activities of $48,495 in 2015. Our cash used in financing activities for 2016 resulted primarily from $1,394 spent to acquire treasury shares. In 2015, we had cash inflows from financing activities of $48,495, a decrease of $63,446 compared to $111,941 in 2014. The cash inflow in 2015 resulted primarily from $95,494 net cash proceeds we received in 2015 from issuance of our 2030 Senior Notes, partially offset by repayment of a financing obligation during 2015 of $45,042 for five properties we purchased from HPT that we had previously leased. In 2014, financing cash flow consisted primarily of $114,448 of net proceeds we received from issuance of our 2029 Senior Notes.\nOff Balance Sheet Arrangements\nAs of December 31, 2016, we had no off balance sheet arrangements that have had or are reasonably likely to have a current or future material effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources, other than with respect to the debt owed by Petro Travel Plaza Holdings LLC, or PTP, an entity in which we own a noncontrolling interest. See Note 10 to the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 15 of this Annual Report for more information about our investment in PTP.\nRelated Party Transactions\nRelationships with HPT, RMR and AIC\nWe have relationships and historical and continuing transactions with HPT, RMR, and its managing member, The RMR Group Inc., AIC, other companies to which RMR provides management services and others affiliated with them. For example:\n \u2022 HPT is our former parent company, our principal landlord and our largest shareholder and RMR provides management services to both us and HPT; \n \u2022 As of December 31, 2016, we, HPT and five other companies to which RMR provides management services each owned 14.3% of AIC, which arranges and insures or reinsures in part a combined property insurance program for us and its six other shareholders; and \n \u2022 RMR employs our President and Chief Executive Officer; our Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer; our Executive Vice President and General Counsel; and both of our Managing Directors; one of our Managing Directors is a controlling shareholder of The RMR Group Inc., and owns direct and indirect interests in RMR through ABP Trust, of which he is a beneficial owner; RMR, assists us with various aspects of our business pursuant to a business management agreement and provides building management services at our headquarters office building pursuant to a property management agreement.  For further information about these and other such relationships and related person transactions, see Notes 7 and 12 to the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 15 of this Annual Report and the section captioned \"Business-Our Leases with HPT\" above in Part I, Item 1 of this Annual Report, which are incorporated herein by reference, our other filings with the SEC and our definitive Proxy Statement for our 2017 Annual Meeting of Shareholders to be filed with the SEC within 120 days after the close of the fiscal year ended December 31, 2016. For further information about these transactions and relationships and about the risks that may arise as a result of these and other related person transactions and relationships, see elsewhere in this Annual Report, including \"Warning Concerning Forward Looking Statements\" and Part I, Item 1A, \"Risk Factors\". Copies of certain of our agreements with these related persons, including our leases and related amendments with HPT, our business and property management agreements with RMR, certain other agreements with HPT and our shareholders agreement with AIC and its shareholders, are available as exhibits to our public filings with the SEC and accessible at the SEC's website, www.sec.gov. We may engage in additional transactions with related persons, including HPT and businesses to which RMR or its affiliates provide management services.\nCritical Accounting Policies\nThe preparation of our financial statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires us to make reasonable estimates and assumptions that may involve the exercise of significant judgment. For any estimate or assumption used, there may be other reasonable estimates or assumptions that may have been used. However, based on the available facts and circumstances inherent in the estimates and assumptions reflected in our consolidated financial statements, management believes it is unlikely that applying other reasonable estimates and assumptions would have caused materially different amounts to have been reported. Actual results may differ from these estimates.\nImpairment of long lived assets. We perform a test for impairment of our property and equipment at the individual site level, since this is the lowest grouping of assets and liabilities at which the related cash flows are largely independent of other assets and liabilities. We recognize impairment charges when (i) the carrying value of a long lived asset or asset group to be held and used in the business is not recoverable and exceeds its fair value and (ii) when the carrying value of a long lived asset or asset group to be disposed of exceeds the estimated fair value of the asset less the estimated cost to sell the asset. Our estimates of fair value are based on our estimates of likely market participant assumptions. Key assumptions include our current expectations for projected fuel sales volumes, nonfuel revenues, fuel and nonfuel gross margins, site level operating expenses and real estate rent expense. If the business climate deteriorates, our actual results may not be consistent with these assumptions and estimates. The discount rate, which is used to measure the present value of the projected future cash flows, is set using a weighted average cost of capital method that considers market and industry data as well as our specific risk factors and that we believe is likely to be used by a market participant. The weighted average cost of capital is our estimate of the overall after tax rate of return required by equity and debt holders of a business enterprise. We use a number of assumptions and methods in preparing valuations underlying impairment tests, including estimates of future cash flows and discount rates. During 2016, we did not record any impairment charges relating to our property and equipment. Applying significantly different assumptions or valuation methods could result in different results from these impairment tests.\nImpairment of indefinite lived intangible assets and goodwill. We assess intangible assets with indefinite lives for impairment annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount may not be recoverable using either a quantitative or qualitative analysis. Indefinite lived intangible assets consisted of trademarks and their fair value was determined using a relief from royalty method. For 2016, indefinite lived intangible assets were assessed using a qualitative analysis that was performed by assessing certain trends and factors, including projected growth rates and actual sales and operating profit margins, discount rates, industry data and other relevant qualitative factors. These trends and factors were compared to, and based on, the assumptions used in the most recent quantitative assessment.\nWe evaluate goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level as of July 31. Goodwill impairment testing for 2016 was performed using a quantitative analysis under which the fair value of our goodwill was estimated using both an income approach and a market approach. The income approach considered discounted forecasted cash flows that were based on our long term operating plan. If the business climate deteriorates, our actual results may not be consistent with these assumptions and estimates. A terminal value was used to estimate the cash flows beyond the period covered by the operating plan. The discount rate is an estimate of the overall after tax rate of return required by equity and debt market holders of a business enterprise. The market approach considered comparable publicly traded guideline companies' respective business values. For each comparable publicly traded guideline company, value indicators, or pricing multiples, were considered to estimate the value of our business enterprise. These analyses require the exercise of significant judgments, including judgments about appropriate discount rates, perpetual growth rates and the timing of expected future cash flows. During 2016, we did not record any impairment charges related to our indefinite lived intangible assets or goodwill. Applying significantly different assumptions or valuation methods could result in different results from this impairment test.\nCustomer loyalty programs. We have accruals for the customer loyalty programs we offer, similar to frequent shopper programs offered by other retailers. Drivers enrolled in these programs earn points for certain fuel and nonfuel purchases that can be redeemed for discounts on future nonfuel products and services at our travel centers. In determining these accruals, we must estimate redemption rates and future expected point expirations. These estimates are based on historical point expiration patterns, adjusted for expected future changes. To the extent an estimate is inaccurate, our liabilities, expenses and net income attributable to common shareholders may be understated or overstated.\nIncome tax matters. As part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements, we estimate income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate. This process involves estimating actual current tax expense along with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for financial statement and tax reporting purposes. These temporary differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities, which are recorded in our consolidated balance sheets. We are required to record a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets if we are not able to conclude that it is more likely than not these assets will be realized. In measuring our deferred tax assets, we consider all available evidence, both positive and negative, to determine whether, based on the weight of that evidence, a valuation allowance is needed for all or a portion of the deferred tax assets. Judgment is required in considering the relative impact of negative and positive evidence. The weight given to the potential effect of negative and positive evidence is commensurate with the extent to which it can be objectively verified. We continue to maintain a valuation allowance against the deferred tax assets related to certain net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards in certain federal, state and foreign jurisdictions. To the extent our estimates and assumptions prove inaccurate we may need to recognize additional amounts of valuation allowance, which would increase our income tax expense and reduce our net income attributable to common shareholders in future periods.\nWe are also required to evaluate uncertain tax positions that benefit our income tax returns. The two step process of recognition and measurement required with respect to uncertain tax positions can require a great deal of management judgment regarding the probability that a tax position, based solely on its technical merits, will be sustained upon examination by the taxing authority, and the measurement of the amount of benefit that is more likely than not to be realized upon ultimate resolution. Many assumptions and estimates may be taken into account in the determination of whether a tax position will be recognized in the financial statements and, if the tax position is to be recognized, the amount of benefit to be recognized. These assumptions and estimates are subject to change due to many factors. To the extent our estimates and assumptions prove inaccurate we may need to adjust the amounts recognized in our financial statements, which could increase or decrease our assets, liabilities, income tax expense and net income attributable to common shareholders in future periods.\nAccounting for leases. With respect to accounting for leases, each time we enter a new lease or materially modify an existing lease we evaluate its classification as either a capital lease or an operating lease. The classification of a lease as capital or operating affects whether and how the transaction is reflected in our balance sheets, as well as our recognition of rental payments as rent or interest expense. These evaluations require us to make estimates of, among other things, the remaining useful life and residual value of leased properties, appropriate discount rates and future cash flows that may be realized from the leased properties. Incorrect assumptions or estimates may result in misclassification of our leases. Other aspects of our lease accounting policies relate to the accounting for sale leaseback transactions, including the appropriate amortization of related deferred liabilities and any deferred gains or losses, and the accounting for lease incentives. Our lease accounting policies involve significant judgments based upon our experience, including judgments about current valuations, estimated useful lives and salvage or residual values. In the future we may need to revise our assessments to incorporate information which is not known at the time of our previous assessments, and such revisions could increase or decrease our depreciation expense related to properties that we lease, result in the classification of some of our leases as other than operating leases or decrease the carrying values of some of our assets.\nBusiness combinations. We account for our acquisitions of businesses as business combinations, which requires that the assets acquired and liabilities assumed be recognized at their respective fair values as of the acquisition date. Fair value is defined as the price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the acquisition date. We record any excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair value of the net assets as goodwill. Our accounting for business combinations involves significant judgments about valuations of assets and liabilities in the current market and the assignment of estimated useful lives. We may adjust our accounting for business combinations to reflect information that is unknown at the time of our respective acquisitions for up to one year after each purchase. Acquisition related transaction costs, such as legal fees, due diligence costs and closing costs, are not included as a component of consideration transferred in an acquisition but are expensed as incurred. The operating results of acquired businesses are reflected in our consolidated financial statements from the date of the acquisition.\nSelf insurance accruals. We are exposed to losses under insurance programs for which we pay deductibles and for which we are partially self insured up to certain stop loss amounts, including claims under our general liability, workers' compensation, motor vehicle and group health benefits policies and programs. Accruals are established under these insurance programs for both estimated losses on known claims and potential claims incurred but not asserted, based on claims histories and using actuarial methods. The most significant risk of this methodology is its dependence on claims histories, which are not always indicative of future claims. To the extent an estimate is inaccurate, our liabilities, expenses and net income attributable to common shareholders may be understated or overstated.\nContingencies. We establish or adjust environmental contingency accruals when the responsibility to remediate becomes probable and the amount of associated costs is reasonably determinable and we record legal contingency accruals when our liability becomes probable and when we can reasonably estimate the amount of our contingent loss. We also have a receivable for expected recoveries of certain of our estimated future environmental expenditures. The process of determining both our estimated future costs of environmental remediation and our estimated future recoveries of costs from insurers or others involves a high degree of management judgment based on past experiences and current and expected regulatory and insurance market conditions. The process of estimating our liability for legal matters involves a high degree of management judgment, which is based on facts and circumstances specific to each matter and our prior experiences with similar matters that may not be indicative of future results. To the extent an estimate is inaccurate, our liabilities, expenses and net income attributable to common shareholders may be understated or overstated.\nSummary of Contractual Obligations and Commitments\nAt December 31, 2016, our primary outstanding trade commitments were $23,128 for letters of credit. The following table summarizes our obligations to make future payments under various agreements as of December 31, 2016:\nTable 152: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Payments Due by Period\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Less than\none year\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1 - 3 years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3 - 5 years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>More than\n5 years\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Leases with HPT(1)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,781,806\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>281,516\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>560,052\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>554,837\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,385,401\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other operating leases\n</td> <td>57,692\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10,831\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>15,690\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9,249\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>21,922\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2028 Senior Notes(2)\n</td> <td>110,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>110,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2029 Senior Notes(3)\n</td> <td>120,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>120,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2030 Senior Notes(4)\n</td> <td>100,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>100,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest payments on\nlong term debt\n</td> <td>335,200\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>26,725\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>53,437\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>53,418\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>201,620\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Purchase obligations(5)\n</td> <td>19,050\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>19,050\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other long term liabilities(6)\n</td> <td>36,541\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>14,837\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12,524\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,975\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,205\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total contractual obligations\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>4,560,289\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>352,959\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>641,703\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>622,479\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,943,148\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n (1) The amounts shown for lease payments to HPT include payments due to HPT for the sites we account for as operating leases and for the sites we account for as a financing under a sale leaseback financing obligation and also include the payments of the deferred rent obligation of $42,915, $29,324, $29,107, $27,421 and $21,233 in June 2024 and December 2026, 2028, 2029, and 2030, respectively, as well as the amounts payable to HPT at the end of the lease terms for the estimated cost of removing underground storage tanks. Interest is not payable on the deferred rent obligation balance unless we default on certain covenants or certain events occur, such as a change in control of us. \n (2) Our 2028 Senior Notes require us to pay interest at 8.25% quarterly and the 2028 Senior Notes mature (unless previously redeemed) on January 15, 2028. We may, at our option, at any time on or after January 15, 2016, redeem some or all of the 2028 Senior Notes by paying 100% of the principal amount of the 2028 Senior Notes to be redeemed plus accrued but unpaid interest, if any, to, but not including, the redemption date. \n (3) Our 2029 Senior Notes require us to pay interest at 8.00% quarterly and the 2029 Senior Notes mature (unless previously redeemed) on December 15, 2029. We may, at our option, at any time on or after December 15, 2017, redeem some or all of the 2029 Senior Notes by paying 100% of the principal amount of the 2029 Senior Notes to be redeemed plus accrued but unpaid interest, if any, to, but not including, the redemption date. \n (4) Our 2030 Senior Notes require us to pay interest at 8.00% quarterly and the 2030 Senior Notes mature (unless previously redeemed) on October 15, 2030. We may, at our option, at any time on or after October 15, 2018, redeem some or all of the 2030 Senior Notes by paying 100% of the principal amount of the 2030 Senior Notes to be redeemed plus accrued but unpaid interest, if any, to, but not including, the redemption date. \n (5) As of December 31, 2016, we had entered agreements to acquire one travel center for a purchase price of $13,050 and six standalone restaurants for an aggregate purchase price of $6,000, and since December 31, 2016, we entered into an agreement to acquire an additional travel center for a purchase price of $4,175. During 2017, as of the date of this Annual Report, we have completed the purchase of six standalone restaurants for an aggregate purchase price of $6,000. The remaining acquisitions are subject to conditions and may not occur, may be delayed or the terms may change. \n (6) The other long term liabilities included in the table above include accrued liabilities related to our partial self insurance programs, including for general liability, workers' compensation, motor vehicle and group health benefits claims, as well as a loan secured by a mortgage on one of our standalone restaurants. \nEnvironmental and Climate Change Matters\nLegislation and regulation regarding climate change, including greenhouse gas emissions, and other environmental matters and market reaction to any such legislation or regulation or to climate change concerns, may decrease the demand for our fuel products, may require us to expend significant amounts and may negatively impact our business. For instance, federal and state governmental requirements addressing emissions from trucks and other motor vehicles, such as the EPA's gasoline and diesel sulfur control requirements that limit the concentration of sulfur in motor fuel, as well as new fuel efficiency standards for medium and heavy duty commercial trucks, has caused us to add certain services and provide certain products to our customers at a cost to us that we may be unable to pass through to our customers. Also, various private initiatives and government regulations to promote fuel efficiency that raise the cost of trucking as compared to other types of freight transport, may decrease the demand for our fuel products and negatively impact our business. For example, in August 2016 the EPA and the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration established final regulations that will phase in more stringent greenhouse gas emission and fuel efficiency standards for medium and heavy duty trucks beginning in model year 2021 (model year 2018 for certain trailers) through model year 2027, and these regulations are estimated to reduce fuel usage between 9% and 25% (depending on vehicle category) by model year 2027. We may not be able to completely offset the loss of business we may suffer as a result of increasing engine efficiency and other fuel conservation efforts.\nSome observers believe severe weather activities in different parts of the country over the last few years evidence global climate change. Such severe weather that may result from climate change may have an adverse effect on individual properties we own, lease or operate. We mitigate these risks by owning, leasing and operating a diversified portfolio of properties, by procuring insurance coverage we believe adequately protects us from material damages and losses and by attempting to monitor and be prepared for such events. However, there can be no assurance that our mitigation efforts will be sufficient or that storms that may occur due to future climate change or otherwise could not have a material adverse effect on our business.\nFor further information about these and other environmental and climate change matters, and the related risks that may arise, see the disclosure under the heading \"Environmental Contingencies\" in Note 13 to the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 15 of this Annual Report, \"Warning Concerning Forward Looking Statements,\" \"Regulatory Environment-Environmental Regulation\" in Item 1 and Item 1A, \"Risk Factors.\"", "item_7_text": "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThe following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes included in Item 15 of this Annual Report. Amounts are in thousands of dollars or gallons unless indicated otherwise.\nExecutive Summary\nOur revenues and income are subject to material changes as a result of market prices and the availability of diesel fuel and gasoline. These factors are subject to the worldwide petroleum products supply chain, which historically has experienced price and supply volatility as a result of, among other things, severe weather, terrorism, political crises, military actions and variations in demand that are often the result of changes in the macroeconomic environment. Also, concerted efforts by major oil producing countries and cartels to limit oil supply can impact prices.\nOver the past few years there have been significant changes in the cost of fuel. Fuel prices generally trended upward for the year, ending at a higher price than at the start of the year. During the year ended December 31, 2016, the average fuel price was 15.9% below the average fuel price during the year ended December 31, 2015. Some current economic forecasts reflect continued low prices for fuel; although other economic forecasts indicate an expectation of economic growth and inflation in the U.S. and elsewhere, which may impact demand for fuel and fuel prices. As noted above, various factors and events can cause fuel prices to change, sometimes suddenly and sharply.\nDue to the volatility of our fuel costs and our pricing to fuel customers, we believe that fuel revenue is not a reliable metric for analyzing our results of operations from period to period. As a result solely of changes in fuel prices, our fuel revenue may materially increase or decrease, in both absolute amounts and on a percentage basis, without a comparable change in fuel sales volumes or in fuel gross margin. We therefore consider fuel sales volume and fuel gross margin to be better measures of our performance.\nWe generally are able to pass changes in our cost for fuel products to customers, but typically with a delay, such that during periods of rising fuel commodity prices fuel gross margins per gallon tend to be lower than they otherwise may have been and during periods of falling fuel commodity prices fuel gross margins per gallon tend to be higher than they otherwise may have been. Increases and volatility in the prices we pay for fuel can have negative effects on our sales and profitability and increase our working capital requirements. For more information about fuel market risks that may affect us and our actions to mitigate those risks, see Item 7A, \"Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk\" elsewhere in this Annual Report.\nWe believe that demand for diesel fuel by trucking companies for any given level of trucking activity will be reduced over time by technological innovations that permit, and regulations that encourage or require, improved fuel efficiency of motor vehicle engines and other fuel conservation practices. We believe these factors combined with adjusting our fuel sales pricing to manage fuel sales volume and profitability and lower levels of freight activity, were contributors to decreases in the level of fuel sales volumes we realized on a same site basis for 2016, as compared to 2015, despite generally improving economic conditions during 2016. Although fuel sales volume declined on a same site basis, it increased on a total basis due to the number of new locations we added to our business during 2015 and 2016.\nDespite higher fuel sales volume in 2016 compared to 2015, our fuel gross margin and fuel gross margin per gallon were lower in 2016 than in 2015, primarily due to an inordinately favorable purchasing environment in the first four months of 2015 that did not recur in 2016.\nThe net loss attributable to common shareholders we experienced for 2016, as compared to the income we achieved during 2015, was primarily due to increases in depreciation and amortization expenses, and expenses related to financing and managing our newly acquired and developed locations (including real estate rent, interest and selling, general and administrative expenses), a decrease in fuel gross margin, and increased competition. These decreases were partially offset by an increase in nonfuel gross margin in excess of site level operating expenses generated by our locations.\nAs described under the heading \"Other Disputes\" in Note 13 to the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 15 of this Annual Report, Comdata has purported to terminate its merchant agreement with us and, beginning February 1, 2017, unilaterally increased the fees it withholds from the transaction settlement payments due to us. We believe that Comdata has wrongfully terminated our agreement and raised the fees we pay Comdata, and we are pursuing litigation against Comdata. However, if we do not prevail in our pending litigation against Comdata, we may not be able to recover the increased fees Comdata charges us through higher prices to customers, and our operating expenses may increase.\nFactors Affecting Comparability\nTransaction Agreement with HPT\nOn June 1, 2015, we entered a transaction agreement with HPT, which we and HPT amended on June 22, 2016. We refer to this amended transaction agreement as the Transaction Agreement. Under the Transaction Agreement, among other things, we agreed to sell to HPT 16 existing travel centers we owned and certain assets at 11 properties currently leased from HPT, plus four additional travel centers upon our completion of their development, and HPT agreed to lease back these properties and assets to us under the HPT Leases. We also agreed to purchase from HPT five travel centers we previously leased from HPT.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2015, we sold 14 travel centers and certain assets at 11 properties currently leased from HPT for an aggregate of $279,383 and purchased five travel centers from HPT for $45,042. The resulting net increase of our minimum annual rent under our TA Leases was $20,153.\nOn March 31, 2016, we sold one of the development properties to HPT for $19,683, and our minimum annual rent due to HPT increased by $1,673.\nOn June 22, 2016, we sold two existing travel centers for an aggregate of $23,876, and our minimum annual rent due to HPT increased by $2,029.\nOn June 30, 2016, we sold one of the development properties to HPT for $22,297, and our minimum annual rent due to HPT increased by $1,895.\nOn September 30, 2016, we sold one of the development properties to HPT for $16,557, and our minimum annual rent due to HPT increased by $1,407.\nSee Notes 7 and 12 to the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 15 of this Annual Report for more information about our Transaction Agreement with HPT.\nAcquired and Developed Sites\nSince the beginning of 2011, when we began our acquisition program, to December 31, 2016, we have invested $855,003 to develop, purchase and improve 318 travel centers, convenience stores and standalone restaurants. For the year ended December 31, 2016, these investments produced site level gross margin in excess of site level operating expenses of $99,957, or, on a sequential basis, $8,253, or 9.0%, greater than site level gross margin in excess of site level operating expenses for the twelve months ended September 30, 2016.\nWe believe that our investments require a period after they are developed or acquired and upgrades are completed to reach their expected stabilized financial results, generally three years for travel centers and one year for convenience stores.\nWe acquired or developed 39 travel centers during the 2011 to 2016 period. Of those, 36 are included in the \"Travel Centers Segment Same Site Operating Data\" for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015. As of December 31, 2016, we have invested $312,139 (including improvements) in these 36 locations, and they generated $54,271 of gross margin in excess of site level operating expenses during the year ended December 31, 2016. The remaining three locations were developed by us for a total investment of $64,862; and they generated $3,526 of gross margin in excess of site level operating expenses during the year ended December 31, 2016; however, we have operated these locations for less than the full year 2016 (one opened in each of January, March and May).\nWe acquired 228 convenience stores during the 2013 to 2016 period. Of these, 31 are included in the \"Convenience Store Segment Same Site Operating Data\" for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015. As of December 31, 2016, we have invested $66,491 (including improvements) in these 31 locations, and they generated $11,608 of gross margin in excess of site level operating expenses during the year ended December 31, 2016. The remaining 197 locations were acquired by us in 2015 or 2016 for a total investment of $376,854 (including improvements), and these convenience stores generated $23,237 of gross margin in excess of site level operating expenses during the year ended December 31, 2016. The 29 convenience stores we acquired during 2016 were operated by us for an average of nine months during 2016 and some of these were fully or partially out of service while being renovated.\nWe acquired one standalone restaurant during 2015 and 50 during 2016. As of December 31, 2016, we have invested $34,657 (including improvements) in these 51 locations, and they generated $7,315 of gross margin in excess of site level operating expenses during the year ended December 31, 2016.\nOur growth activities have also contributed to growth in our selling, general and administrative expenses, which were $139,052 for the year ended December 31, 2016, a $17,285, or 14.2%, increase over the amount for the year ended December 31, 2015. We estimate that approximately $10,000 of this increase can be attributed to the increase in our number of sites, including such items as marketing, advertising, regional management personnel and centralized support costs.\nAs of December 31, 2016, we had agreements to acquire one travel center and six standalone restaurants from two of our franchisees for an aggregate purchase price of $19,050, and since December 31, 2016, we have entered into an agreement to acquire an additional travel center for a purchase price of $4,175. During January 2017, we completed the purchase of six standalone restaurants for an aggregate purchase price of $6,000. We expect to complete the remaining acquisitions in the first half of 2017, but these purchases are subject to conditions that may not occur, may be delayed or the terms may change. We currently intend to continue to selectively acquire additional locations and to otherwise expand our business.\nResults of Operations\nConsolidated Financial Results\nThe following table presents changes in our operating results for the year ended December 31, 2016, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2015 and for the year ended December 31, 2015, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2014.\n\nYear ended December 31, 2016, as compared to December 31, 2015\nRevenues. Fuel revenues for 2016 decreased by $525,299, or 13.0%, as compared to 2015. The table below shows the change in sales volumes and fuel revenues by segment. Corporate and other fuel gallons and fuel revenues represent wholesale sales to the joint venture we operate and to other retailers.\n\nThe decrease in fuel revenue for 2016 as compared to 2015 was due to significant decreases in market prices for fuel and lower fuel sales volume in our travel center segment as a result of fuel conservation methods adopted by our customers and due to increased competition, partially offset by increases in sales volume in our convenience store segment as a result of acquired locations.\nNonfuel revenues for 2016 increased by $181,143, or 10.2%, as compared to 2015, primarily as a result of acquired locations.\nFuel gross margin. Fuel gross margin for 2016 decreased by $9,717, or 2.3%, as compared to 2015. This decrease in fuel gross margin was primarily due to an unusually favorable purchasing environment in the first four months of 2015 that did not recur in 2016.\nNonfuel gross margin. Nonfuel gross margin for 2016 increased by $90,311, or 9.4%, as compared to 2015 due primarily to acquired locations and our pricing and marketing initiatives. Nonfuel gross margin as a percentage of nonfuel revenues was 53.6% and 54.0% for 2016 and 2015, respectively. The nonfuel gross margin percentage decreased primarily due to the acquisition of additional convenience stores since the beginning of 2015. Nonfuel gross margin percentage in our convenience store operations is typically lower than the nonfuel gross margin percentage for our travel center operations.\nSite level operating expenses. Site level operating expenses for 2016 increased by $73,761, or 8.3%, as compared to 2015 due primarily to acquired locations. Site level operating expenses as a percentage of nonfuel revenues were 48.9% and 49.7% for 2016 and 2015, respectively. The improved expense ratio reflects both a larger portion of our operations conducted at convenience stores and the continued stabilization of our acquired convenience store locations.\nSelling, general and administrative expenses. Selling, general and administrative expenses for 2016 increased by $17,285, or 14.2%, as compared to 2015. The increase was primarily attributable to increased personnel required to support the growth of our business, as well as increased spending on marketing and promotional activities.\nReal estate rent expense. Rent expense for 2016 increased by $30,707, or 13.3%, as compared to 2015. The increase in real estate rent expense was primarily a result of the sale to, and lease back from, HPT of travel centers and improvements at leased sites since the beginning of 2015, including the sales pursuant to the Transaction Agreement with HPT.\nDepreciation and amortization expense. Depreciation and amortization expense for 2016 increased by $20,006, or 27.6%, as compared to 2015. The increase in depreciation and amortization expense primarily resulted from the locations we acquired and capital investments at our owned sites that we completed since the beginning of 2015.\nInterest expense, net. Interest expense, net for 2016 increased by $5,270, or 23.4%, as compared to 2015, primarily as a result of our issuance of $100,000 of the 2030 Senior Notes in October 2015.\nProvision for income taxes. For 2016, we had an income tax benefit of $1,733 as a result of a pretax loss. In 2015, we had an income tax provision of $16,539 as a result of pretax income. See Note 9 to the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 15 of this Annual Report for more information about our income taxes.\nYear ended December 31, 2015, as compared to December 31, 2014\nRevenues. Fuel revenues for 2015 decreased by $2,094,001, or 34.1%, as compared to 2014. The table below shows the change in sales volumes and fuel revenues by segment. Corporate and other fuel gallons and fuel revenues represent wholesale sales to the joint venture we operate and to other retailers.\n\nThe decreases in fuel revenue for 2015 as compared to 2014 were due to significant decreases in market prices for fuel partially offset by increases in sales volume in both the travel center and convenience store segments primarily due to locations acquired in 2014 and 2015. Wholesale fuel sales increased primarily as a result of our acquisitions in the second half of 2015.\nNonfuel revenues for 2015 increased by $165,959, or 10.3%, as compared to 2014, primarily as a result of locations acquired in 2014 and 2015.\nFuel gross margin. Fuel gross margin for 2015 decreased by $14,006, or 3.3%, as compared to 2014. The decrease in fuel gross margin was primarily due to an inordinately favorable purchasing environment in the 2014 fourth quarter that did not recur in 2015, partially offset by an increase of $4,999 in 2015 compared to 2014 related to amounts owed to us in connection with certain biodiesel purchases we made during 2015 as a result of the reinstatement during the fourth quarter of 2015 of biodiesel and renewable energy fuel tax credits. The legislation authorizing these tax credits was passed and the credits were retroactively applied in December of each of 2015 and 2014.\nNonfuel gross margin. Nonfuel gross margin for 2015 increased by $84,835, or 9.7%, as compared to 2014, due to locations acquired in 2014 and 2015 and our pricing and marketing initiatives. Nonfuel gross margin as a percentage of nonfuel revenues was 54.0% and 54.3% for 2015 and 2014, respectively. The nonfuel gross margin percentage decreased primarily due to the inclusion of additional convenience stores, as a result of acquisitions since the beginning of 2015. Nonfuel gross margin percentage in our convenience store operations is typically lower than the nonfuel gross margin percentage for our travel center operations.\nSite level operating expenses. Site level operating expenses for 2015 increased by $70,035, or 8.6%, as compared to 2014 primarily due to locations acquired in 2014 and 2015. Site level operating expenses as a percentage of nonfuel revenues were 49.7% and 50.4% for 2015 and 2014, respectively. The improved expense ratio reflects both a larger portion of our operations conducted at convenience stores and the continued stabilization of our locations acquired in 2014 and 2015.\nSelling, general and administrative expenses. Selling, general and administrative expenses for 2015 increased by $14,944, or 14.0%, as compared to 2014. The increase was primarily attributable to increased personnel to support the growth of our business, especially the significant growth in our convenience store segment. These increases were partially offset by lower audit and consultant fees.\nReal estate rent expense. Real estate rent expense for 2015 increased by $14,436, or 6.6%, as compared to 2014. The increase in real estate rent expense was primarily a result of the sale to, and lease back from, HPT in June 2015 and September 2015 of 14 owned travel centers and certain assets we owned at 11 properties leased from HPT, as well as improvements at leased sites we sold to HPT during 2015 and 2014.\nDepreciation and amortization expense. Depreciation and amortization expense for 2015 increased by $6,799, or 10.4%, as compared to 2014. The increase in depreciation and amortization expense primarily resulted from the acquisitions and other capital investments we completed during 2014 and 2015. The increase was partially offset by the reduction in our depreciable assets as a result of the sale to, and lease back from, HPT in June 2015 and September 2015 of 14 owned travel centers and certain assets we owned at 11 properties leased from HPT.\nInterest expense, net. Interest expense, net for 2015 increased by $5,833, or 34.9%, as compared to 2014, primarily as a result of our issuances of $100,000 of our 2030 Senior Notes in October 2015 and $120,000 of our 2029 Senior Notes in December 2014.\nProvision for income taxes. The income tax provisions for 2015 and 2014 were $16,539 and $38,023, respectively. The decrease in the income tax provision for 2015 was primarily due to an increase in the utilization of various tax credits and incentives. See Note 9 to the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 15 of this Annual Report for more information about our income taxes.\nSegment Results of Operations\nThe following is a discussion of fuel and nonfuel revenues and site level gross margin in excess of site level operating expenses by reportable segment.\nAs part of this discussion and analysis of our reportable segment operating results we refer to increases and decreases in results on a same site basis. We include a location in the same site comparisons only if we continuously operated it for the entire period since the beginning of the earliest comparative period presented. Locations we operate that are owned by an unconsolidated joint venture are not included in our same site comparisons. Same site data also excludes revenues and expenses that were not generated at locations we operate, such as rent and royalties from franchisees, revenues from a dealer operated convenience store and corporate selling, general and administrative expenses. We do not exclude locations from the same site comparisons as a result of capital improvements to the site or changes in the services offered.\nTravel Centers\nThe following table presents changes in the operating results of our travel center segment for the year ended December 31, 2016, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2015, and for the year ended December 31, 2015, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2014.\n\nThe following table presents our same site operating results for our travel center segment for the year ended December 31, 2016, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2015, and for the year ended December 31, 2015, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2014.\n\nYear ended December 31, 2016, as compared to December 31, 2015\nRevenues. Fuel revenues for 2016 decreased by $726,675, or 19.3%, as compared to 2015. The table below shows the changes in total fuel revenues for our travel center segment based on price and volume changes between periods.\n\nFuel revenues primarily reflected decreases in market prices for fuel and sales volume from same sites. On a same site basis, fuel sales volume decreased by 84,141 gallons, or 4.3%, during 2016 as compared to 2015. We believe the decrease in same site fuel sales volume was primarily due to our efforts to adjust fuel sales profitability by managing pricing and the effects of truck engine fuel efficiency improvements and other fuel conservation efforts, lower levels of freight activity and competition.\nNonfuel revenues for 2016 increased by $17,765, or 1.1%, as compared to 2015. The increase in nonfuel revenues was primarily due to nonfuel sales at acquired locations partially offset by decreases in nonfuel sales on a same site basis. The decrease on a same site basis was primarily due to lower revenue at full service restaurants due to closing certain of our restaurants during slower night time periods and a decrease in tire sales revenue primarily due to increased competition.\nSite level gross margin in excess of site level operating expenses. Site level gross margin in excess of site level operating expenses for 2016 decreased by $14,652, or 3.0%, as compared to 2015, due to a decrease of $20,725, or 4.4%, on a same site basis partially offset by an increase due to acquired locations.\nOn a same site basis, site level gross margin in excess of site level operating expenses decreased for 2016 as compared to 2015 as a result of a decrease in fuel gross margin, primarily due to our unusually favorable purchasing experience in the first four months of 2015 that did not recur during 2016.\nYear ended December 31, 2015, as compared to December 31, 2014\nRevenues. Fuel revenues for 2015 decreased by $2,198,449, or 36.9%, as compared to 2014. The table below shows the changes in total fuel revenues for our travel center segment based on price and volume changes between periods.\n\nFuel revenues primarily reflected decreases in market prices for fuel, partially offset by increases in sales volume from same sites and from sites acquired during 2014 and 2015. On a same site basis, fuel sales volume for 2015 increased by 12,657 gallons, or 0.7%, as compared to 2014. The increase in fuel sales volume on a same site basis was primarily due to our continued focus on adjusting fuel sales pricing to manage profitability and certain marketing initiatives.\nNonfuel revenues for 2015 increased by $86,650, or 5.6%, as compared to 2014. The increase in nonfuel revenue was primarily due to same sites and from locations acquired during 2014 and 2015. On a same site basis, nonfuel revenues for 2015 increased by $81,498, or 5.4%, as compared to 2014. We believe this same site increase is primarily due to favorable effects of certain of our marketing initiatives.\nSite level gross margin in excess of site level operating expenses. Site level gross margin in excess of site level operating expenses for 2015 decreased by $9,214, or 1.9%, as compared to 2014 due to a decrease of $8,829, or 1.9 %, on a same site basis.\nOn a same site basis, site level gross margin in excess of site level operating expenses decreased for 2015 as compared to 2014, as a result of a decrease in fuel gross margin primarily due to an unusually favorable purchasing environment experienced in 2014 that did not recur in the last eight months of 2015.\nConvenience Stores\nThe following table presents changes in the operating results of our convenience store segment for the year ended December 31, 2016, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2015 and for the year ended December 31, 2015, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2014.\n\nThe following table presents our same site operating results for our convenience store segment for the year ended December 31, 2016, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2015, and for the year ended December 31, 2015, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2014.\n\nYear ended December 31, 2016, as compared to December 31, 2015\nRevenues. Fuel revenues for 2016 increased by $195,853, or 87.1%, as compared to 2015. The table below shows the changes in total fuel revenues for our convenience store segment based on price and volume changes between periods.\n\nThe increase in fuel revenues in our convenience store segment was due to sales volume at acquired locations, partially offset by decreases in market prices for fuel and a decrease in fuel sales volume on a same site basis. On a same site basis, fuel sales volume for 2016 decreased by 632 gallons, or 1.5%, as compared to 2015. The decrease in same site fuel sales volume was primarily due to our adjusting fuel sales pricing to manage fuel sales volume and profitability and the effects of competition.\nNonfuel revenues for 2016 increased by $139,655, or 90.0%, as compared to 2015. The increase in nonfuel revenues was primarily due to acquired locations. On a same site basis, nonfuel revenues increased modestly as operations at acquired sites continue to stabilize.\nSite level gross margin in excess of site level operating expenses. Site level gross margin in excess of site level operating expenses for 2016 increased by $19,401, or 112.4%, as compared to 2015, primarily due to acquired locations.\nOn a same site basis, site level gross margin in excess of site level operating expenses for 2016 increased as compared to 2015 due to an increase in nonfuel gross margin due to a favorable change in the mix of products and services sold and an increase in fuel gross margin primarily resulting from our continued focus on adjusting our fuel sales pricing to manage profitability.\nYear ended December 31, 2015, as compared to December 31, 2014\nRevenues. Fuel revenues for 2015 increased by $111,673, or 98.6% as compared to 2014. The table below shows the changes in total fuel revenues for our convenience store segment based on price and volume changes between periods.\n\nThe increase in fuel revenues at our convenience store segment reflected increases in sales volume from both sites we acquired during 2015 and same sites, partially offset by decreases in market prices for fuel. On a same site basis, fuel sales volume for 2015 increased by 1,642 gallons, or 4.1%, from 2014.\nNonfuel revenues for 2015 increased by $78,563, or 102.5%, from 2014. The increase in nonfuel revenues was primarily due to the sites we acquired during 2015. On a same site basis, nonfuel revenues increased by $3,023, or 3.9%, for 2015, as compared to 2014, primarily due to the favorable effects of certain of our marketing initiatives.\nSite level gross margin in excess of site level operating expenses. Site level gross margin in excess of site level operating expenses for 2015 increased by $8,425, or 95.4%, from 2014, due to locations acquired in 2015 and a $3,550, or 40.2%, increase on a same site basis.\nOn a same site basis, site level gross margin in excess of site level operating expenses increased for 2015 as compared to 2014, due to an increase in nonfuel gross margin due to a favorable change in the mix or products and services sold, an increase in fuel gross margin primarily resulting from our continued focus on adjusting our fuel sales pricing to manage fuel sales volume and profitability, partially offset by an increase in site level operating expenses.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nOur principal liquidity requirements are to meet our operating and financing costs and to fund our capital expenditures, acquisitions and working capital requirements. Our principal sources of liquidity to meet these requirements are our:\n \u2022 cash balance; \n \u2022 operating cash flow; \n \u2022 our Credit Facility, with a current maximum availability of $200,000, or our Credit Facility, subject to limits based on our qualified collateral; \n \u2022 sales to HPT of improvements we make to the sites we lease from HPT and the development site to be sold to HPT under the Transaction Agreement; \n \u2022 potential issuances of new debt and equity securities; and \n \u2022 potential financing or selling of unencumbered real estate that we own.  We believe that the primary risks we currently face with respect to our operating cash flow are:\n \u2022 continuing decreased demand for our fuel products resulting from regulatory and market efforts for improved engine fuel efficiency and fuel conservation generally; \n \u2022 decreased demand for our products and services that we may experience as a result of competition; \n \u2022 a significant portion of our expenses are fixed in nature, which may restrict our ability to realize a sufficient reduction in our expenses to offset a reduction in our revenues; \n \u2022 the possible inability of recently acquired or developed properties to generate the stabilized financial results we expect; \n \u2022 the risk of an economic slowdown or recession; and \n \u2022 the negative impacts on our gross margins and working capital requirements if there were a return to the higher level of prices for petroleum products we experienced during the first half of 2014 and in prior years, as well as the increased volatility of those prices.  Our business requires substantial amounts of working capital, including cash liquidity, and our working capital requirements can be especially large because of the volatility of fuel prices. Our growth strategy of selectively acquiring additional properties and businesses and developing new sites requires us to expend substantial capital. In addition, our properties are high traffic sites with many customers and large trucks entering and exiting our properties daily, requiring us to expend capital to improve, repair and maintain our properties. Although we had a cash balance of $61,312 on December 31, 2016, and net cash provided by operating activities in 2016, there can be no assurance that we will maintain similar amounts of cash, that we will generate future profits or positive cash flows or that we will be able to obtain additional financing, if and when it becomes necessary or desirable to pursue business opportunities.\nLiquidity Aspects of Transactions with HPT\nPursuant to the Transaction Agreement, HPT agreed to purchase from us, for our cost, four travel centers then being or to be developed, on land parcels we then owned, upon their completion, if such development were completed prior to June 30, 2017. As of December 31, 2016, we had completed construction of three of these travel centers and one of these travel centers was under construction. On each of March 31, 2016, June 30, 2016, and September 30, 2016, we sold to HPT for $19,683, $22,297 and $16,557, respectively, and leased back from HPT, one of the completed travel centers. Also, on June 22, 2016, pursuant to the Transaction Agreement, we sold to, and leased back from, HPT two existing travel centers owned by us for an aggregate of $23,876. We expect to sell to HPT the remaining development property during the first half of 2017. As of December 31, 2016, we had invested $26,429 (including land costs) for the remaining development property and we estimate the remaining development cost will be approximately $1,813.\nRevolving Credit Facility\nWe have a Credit Facility with a group of commercial banks that matures on December 19, 2019. Under the Credit Facility, a maximum of $200,000 may be drawn, repaid and redrawn until maturity. The availability of this maximum amount is subject to limits based on qualified collateral. Subject to available collateral and lender participation, the maximum amount of this Credit Facility may be increased to $300,000. The Credit Facility may be used for general business purposes and permits for the issuance of letters of credit. Generally, no principal payments are due until maturity. Borrowings under the Credit Facility bear interest at a rate based on, at our option, LIBOR or a base rate, plus a premium (which premium is subject to adjustment based upon facility availability, utilization and other matters). At December 31, 2016, based on our qualified collateral, a total of $102,625 was available to us for loans and letters of credit under the Credit Facility. At December 31, 2016, there were no loans outstanding under the Credit Facility but we had outstanding $23,128 of letters of credit issued under that facility, which reduces the amount available for borrowing under the Credit Facility, leaving $79,497 available for our use as of that date.\nSenior Notes\nOn October 5, 2015, we issued in an underwritten public offering $100,000 aggregate principal amount of our 8.00% Senior Notes due on October 15, 2030, or the 2030 Senior Notes. Our net proceeds from this issuance were $95,494 after underwriters' discount and commission and other costs of the offering. The 2030 Senior Notes require that we pay interest at 8.00% per annum, payable quarterly in arrears on January 15, April 15, July 15 and October 15 of each year, beginning on January 15, 2016, and no principal payments are required prior to maturity on October 15, 2030. The 2030 Senior Notes are callable by us at par plus accrued interest, if any, and without penalty at any time on or after October 15, 2018.\nOn December 16, 2014, we issued in an underwritten public offering $120,000 aggregate principal amount of our 8.00% Senior Notes due on December 15, 2029, or the 2029 Senior Notes. Our net proceeds from this issuance were $114,448 after underwriters' discount and commission and other costs of the offering. The 2029 Senior Notes require that we pay interest at 8.00% per annum, payable quarterly in arrears on February 28, May 31, August 31 and November 30 of each year, beginning on February 28, 2015, and no principal payments are required prior to maturity on December 15, 2029. The 2029 Senior Notes are callable by us at par plus accrued interest, if any, and without penalty at any time on or after December 15, 2017.\nOn January 15, 2013, we issued in an underwritten public offering $110,000 aggregate principal amount of our 8.25% Senior Notes due on January 15, 2028, or the 2028 Senior Notes. Our net proceeds from this issuance were $105,250 after underwriters' discount and commission and other costs of the offering. The 2028 Senior Notes require that we pay interest at 8.25% per annum, payable quarterly in arrears on January 15, April 15, July 15 and October 15 of each year, beginning on April 15, 2013, and no principal payments are required prior to maturity on January 15, 2028. The 2028 Senior Notes are callable by us at par plus accrued interest, if any, and without penalty at any time on or after January 15, 2016.\nWe refer to the 2030 Senior Notes, 2029 Senior Notes and 2028 Senior Notes collectively as our Senior Notes, which are our senior unsecured obligations. The total annual cash payments for interest expense on the current outstanding aggregate principal amount under our Senior Notes is $26,675.\nThe indenture governing our Senior Notes does not limit the amount of indebtedness we may incur. We may issue additional debt from time to time.\nSee Note 6 to the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 15 of this Annual Report for more information about our Credit Facility or our Senior Notes.\nSources and Uses of Cash Flow\nCash Flow from Operating Activities\nIn 2016, we had net cash inflows from operating activities of $110,777, a decrease of $26,111 compared to $136,888 in 2015. The decrease was primarily due a decrease in cash from the net income attributable to common shareholders in 2015 to net loss attributable to common shareholders in 2016, partially offset by lower working capital in 2016 as compared to 2015.\nIn 2015, we had net cash inflows from operating activities of $136,888, a decrease of $24,237 compared to $161,125 in 2014. The decrease was primarily due to lower net income partially offset by lower net working capital in 2015 as compared to 2014.\nCash Flow from Investing Activities\nIn 2016, we had cash outflows from investing activities of $220,038, a decrease of $17,439 compared to $237,477 in 2015. The decrease was primarily due to a reduction in our acquisition activities, partially offset by lower proceeds from asset sales to HPT and higher capital expenditures in 2016 than in 2015. In 2016, we invested $71,935 for the acquisition of 29 convenience stores, 11 standalone restaurants and franchise agreements for an additional 39 standalone restaurants and invested $329,997 for other capital improvements to our properties. In 2016, we received $193,082 of proceeds from the sales of five properties and assets to HPT, including improvements to properties we lease from HPT.\nIn 2015, we had cash outflows from investing activities of $237,477, an increase of $103,059 compared to $134,418 in 2014. The increase was primarily due to capital expenditures and cash invested for acquisitions, partially offset by proceeds from the sale of assets to HPT. In 2015, we invested $320,290 for the acquisition of three travel centers and 169 convenience stores, and we made investments of $295,437 for other capital improvements to our properties. In 2015, we received $378,250 of proceeds from our sales of properties and assets to HPT, including improvements to properties we lease from HPT.\nAs of December 31, 2016, we had entered agreements to acquire one travel center from a franchisee for a purchase price of $13,050 and six standalone restaurants from a franchisee for an aggregate purchase price of $6,000, and we expect to invest an approximate $1,534 to expand and renovate these locations. Since December 31, 2016, we entered into an agreement to acquire an additional travel center for a purchase price of $4,175 and we expect to invest an approximate $1,950 to renovate this location. During 2017, as of the date of this Annual Report, we have completed the purchase of the six standalone restaurants for an aggregate purchase price of $6,000. We expect to complete the remaining acquisitions in the first half of 2017, but these purchases are subject to conditions and may not occur, may be delayed or the terms may change.\nWe consider sustaining capital to be the amount of investments required to maintain our existing business. We estimate that during 2017 our sustaining capital expenditures will be approximately $55,000 to $60,000. We may also make additional investments in our business for expansion or other projects and at substantial costs.\nSee Notes 2, 7 and 12 to our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 15 of this Annual Report for more information about our acquisitions and our transactions with HPT.\nCash Flow from Financing Activities\nIn 2016, we had cash outflows from financing activities of $1,035, a change of $49,530 compared to the cash inflows from financing activities of $48,495 in 2015. Our cash used in financing activities for 2016 resulted primarily from $1,394 spent to acquire treasury shares. In 2015, we had cash inflows from financing activities of $48,495, a decrease of $63,446 compared to $111,941 in 2014. The cash inflow in 2015 resulted primarily from $95,494 net cash proceeds we received in 2015 from issuance of our 2030 Senior Notes, partially offset by repayment of a financing obligation during 2015 of $45,042 for five properties we purchased from HPT that we had previously leased. In 2014, financing cash flow consisted primarily of $114,448 of net proceeds we received from issuance of our 2029 Senior Notes.\nOff Balance Sheet Arrangements\nAs of December 31, 2016, we had no off balance sheet arrangements that have had or are reasonably likely to have a current or future material effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources, other than with respect to the debt owed by Petro Travel Plaza Holdings LLC, or PTP, an entity in which we own a noncontrolling interest. See Note 10 to the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 15 of this Annual Report for more information about our investment in PTP.\nRelated Party Transactions\nRelationships with HPT, RMR and AIC\nWe have relationships and historical and continuing transactions with HPT, RMR, and its managing member, The RMR Group Inc., AIC, other companies to which RMR provides management services and others affiliated with them. For example:\n \u2022 HPT is our former parent company, our principal landlord and our largest shareholder and RMR provides management services to both us and HPT; \n \u2022 As of December 31, 2016, we, HPT and five other companies to which RMR provides management services each owned 14.3% of AIC, which arranges and insures or reinsures in part a combined property insurance program for us and its six other shareholders; and \n \u2022 RMR employs our President and Chief Executive Officer; our Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer; our Executive Vice President and General Counsel; and both of our Managing Directors; one of our Managing Directors is a controlling shareholder of The RMR Group Inc., and owns direct and indirect interests in RMR through ABP Trust, of which he is a beneficial owner; RMR, assists us with various aspects of our business pursuant to a business management agreement and provides building management services at our headquarters office building pursuant to a property management agreement.  For further information about these and other such relationships and related person transactions, see Notes 7 and 12 to the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 15 of this Annual Report and the section captioned \"Business-Our Leases with HPT\" above in Part I, Item 1 of this Annual Report, which are incorporated herein by reference, our other filings with the SEC and our definitive Proxy Statement for our 2017 Annual Meeting of Shareholders to be filed with the SEC within 120 days after the close of the fiscal year ended December 31, 2016. For further information about these transactions and relationships and about the risks that may arise as a result of these and other related person transactions and relationships, see elsewhere in this Annual Report, including \"Warning Concerning Forward Looking Statements\" and Part I, Item 1A, \"Risk Factors\". Copies of certain of our agreements with these related persons, including our leases and related amendments with HPT, our business and property management agreements with RMR, certain other agreements with HPT and our shareholders agreement with AIC and its shareholders, are available as exhibits to our public filings with the SEC and accessible at the SEC's website, www.sec.gov. We may engage in additional transactions with related persons, including HPT and businesses to which RMR or its affiliates provide management services.\nCritical Accounting Policies\nThe preparation of our financial statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires us to make reasonable estimates and assumptions that may involve the exercise of significant judgment. For any estimate or assumption used, there may be other reasonable estimates or assumptions that may have been used. However, based on the available facts and circumstances inherent in the estimates and assumptions reflected in our consolidated financial statements, management believes it is unlikely that applying other reasonable estimates and assumptions would have caused materially different amounts to have been reported. Actual results may differ from these estimates.\nImpairment of long lived assets. We perform a test for impairment of our property and equipment at the individual site level, since this is the lowest grouping of assets and liabilities at which the related cash flows are largely independent of other assets and liabilities. We recognize impairment charges when (i) the carrying value of a long lived asset or asset group to be held and used in the business is not recoverable and exceeds its fair value and (ii) when the carrying value of a long lived asset or asset group to be disposed of exceeds the estimated fair value of the asset less the estimated cost to sell the asset. Our estimates of fair value are based on our estimates of likely market participant assumptions. Key assumptions include our current expectations for projected fuel sales volumes, nonfuel revenues, fuel and nonfuel gross margins, site level operating expenses and real estate rent expense. If the business climate deteriorates, our actual results may not be consistent with these assumptions and estimates. The discount rate, which is used to measure the present value of the projected future cash flows, is set using a weighted average cost of capital method that considers market and industry data as well as our specific risk factors and that we believe is likely to be used by a market participant. The weighted average cost of capital is our estimate of the overall after tax rate of return required by equity and debt holders of a business enterprise. We use a number of assumptions and methods in preparing valuations underlying impairment tests, including estimates of future cash flows and discount rates. During 2016, we did not record any impairment charges relating to our property and equipment. Applying significantly different assumptions or valuation methods could result in different results from these impairment tests.\nImpairment of indefinite lived intangible assets and goodwill. We assess intangible assets with indefinite lives for impairment annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount may not be recoverable using either a quantitative or qualitative analysis. Indefinite lived intangible assets consisted of trademarks and their fair value was determined using a relief from royalty method. For 2016, indefinite lived intangible assets were assessed using a qualitative analysis that was performed by assessing certain trends and factors, including projected growth rates and actual sales and operating profit margins, discount rates, industry data and other relevant qualitative factors. These trends and factors were compared to, and based on, the assumptions used in the most recent quantitative assessment.\nWe evaluate goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level as of July 31. Goodwill impairment testing for 2016 was performed using a quantitative analysis under which the fair value of our goodwill was estimated using both an income approach and a market approach. The income approach considered discounted forecasted cash flows that were based on our long term operating plan. If the business climate deteriorates, our actual results may not be consistent with these assumptions and estimates. A terminal value was used to estimate the cash flows beyond the period covered by the operating plan. The discount rate is an estimate of the overall after tax rate of return required by equity and debt market holders of a business enterprise. The market approach considered comparable publicly traded guideline companies' respective business values. For each comparable publicly traded guideline company, value indicators, or pricing multiples, were considered to estimate the value of our business enterprise. These analyses require the exercise of significant judgments, including judgments about appropriate discount rates, perpetual growth rates and the timing of expected future cash flows. During 2016, we did not record any impairment charges related to our indefinite lived intangible assets or goodwill. Applying significantly different assumptions or valuation methods could result in different results from this impairment test.\nCustomer loyalty programs. We have accruals for the customer loyalty programs we offer, similar to frequent shopper programs offered by other retailers. Drivers enrolled in these programs earn points for certain fuel and nonfuel purchases that can be redeemed for discounts on future nonfuel products and services at our travel centers. In determining these accruals, we must estimate redemption rates and future expected point expirations. These estimates are based on historical point expiration patterns, adjusted for expected future changes. To the extent an estimate is inaccurate, our liabilities, expenses and net income attributable to common shareholders may be understated or overstated.\nIncome tax matters. As part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements, we estimate income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate. This process involves estimating actual current tax expense along with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for financial statement and tax reporting purposes. These temporary differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities, which are recorded in our consolidated balance sheets. We are required to record a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets if we are not able to conclude that it is more likely than not these assets will be realized. In measuring our deferred tax assets, we consider all available evidence, both positive and negative, to determine whether, based on the weight of that evidence, a valuation allowance is needed for all or a portion of the deferred tax assets. Judgment is required in considering the relative impact of negative and positive evidence. The weight given to the potential effect of negative and positive evidence is commensurate with the extent to which it can be objectively verified. We continue to maintain a valuation allowance against the deferred tax assets related to certain net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards in certain federal, state and foreign jurisdictions. To the extent our estimates and assumptions prove inaccurate we may need to recognize additional amounts of valuation allowance, which would increase our income tax expense and reduce our net income attributable to common shareholders in future periods.\nWe are also required to evaluate uncertain tax positions that benefit our income tax returns. The two step process of recognition and measurement required with respect to uncertain tax positions can require a great deal of management judgment regarding the probability that a tax position, based solely on its technical merits, will be sustained upon examination by the taxing authority, and the measurement of the amount of benefit that is more likely than not to be realized upon ultimate resolution. Many assumptions and estimates may be taken into account in the determination of whether a tax position will be recognized in the financial statements and, if the tax position is to be recognized, the amount of benefit to be recognized. These assumptions and estimates are subject to change due to many factors. To the extent our estimates and assumptions prove inaccurate we may need to adjust the amounts recognized in our financial statements, which could increase or decrease our assets, liabilities, income tax expense and net income attributable to common shareholders in future periods.\nAccounting for leases. With respect to accounting for leases, each time we enter a new lease or materially modify an existing lease we evaluate its classification as either a capital lease or an operating lease. The classification of a lease as capital or operating affects whether and how the transaction is reflected in our balance sheets, as well as our recognition of rental payments as rent or interest expense. These evaluations require us to make estimates of, among other things, the remaining useful life and residual value of leased properties, appropriate discount rates and future cash flows that may be realized from the leased properties. Incorrect assumptions or estimates may result in misclassification of our leases. Other aspects of our lease accounting policies relate to the accounting for sale leaseback transactions, including the appropriate amortization of related deferred liabilities and any deferred gains or losses, and the accounting for lease incentives. Our lease accounting policies involve significant judgments based upon our experience, including judgments about current valuations, estimated useful lives and salvage or residual values. In the future we may need to revise our assessments to incorporate information which is not known at the time of our previous assessments, and such revisions could increase or decrease our depreciation expense related to properties that we lease, result in the classification of some of our leases as other than operating leases or decrease the carrying values of some of our assets.\nBusiness combinations. We account for our acquisitions of businesses as business combinations, which requires that the assets acquired and liabilities assumed be recognized at their respective fair values as of the acquisition date. Fair value is defined as the price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the acquisition date. We record any excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair value of the net assets as goodwill. Our accounting for business combinations involves significant judgments about valuations of assets and liabilities in the current market and the assignment of estimated useful lives. We may adjust our accounting for business combinations to reflect information that is unknown at the time of our respective acquisitions for up to one year after each purchase. Acquisition related transaction costs, such as legal fees, due diligence costs and closing costs, are not included as a component of consideration transferred in an acquisition but are expensed as incurred. The operating results of acquired businesses are reflected in our consolidated financial statements from the date of the acquisition.\nSelf insurance accruals. We are exposed to losses under insurance programs for which we pay deductibles and for which we are partially self insured up to certain stop loss amounts, including claims under our general liability, workers' compensation, motor vehicle and group health benefits policies and programs. Accruals are established under these insurance programs for both estimated losses on known claims and potential claims incurred but not asserted, based on claims histories and using actuarial methods. The most significant risk of this methodology is its dependence on claims histories, which are not always indicative of future claims. To the extent an estimate is inaccurate, our liabilities, expenses and net income attributable to common shareholders may be understated or overstated.\nContingencies. We establish or adjust environmental contingency accruals when the responsibility to remediate becomes probable and the amount of associated costs is reasonably determinable and we record legal contingency accruals when our liability becomes probable and when we can reasonably estimate the amount of our contingent loss. We also have a receivable for expected recoveries of certain of our estimated future environmental expenditures. The process of determining both our estimated future costs of environmental remediation and our estimated future recoveries of costs from insurers or others involves a high degree of management judgment based on past experiences and current and expected regulatory and insurance market conditions. The process of estimating our liability for legal matters involves a high degree of management judgment, which is based on facts and circumstances specific to each matter and our prior experiences with similar matters that may not be indicative of future results. To the extent an estimate is inaccurate, our liabilities, expenses and net income attributable to common shareholders may be understated or overstated.\nSummary of Contractual Obligations and Commitments\nAt December 31, 2016, our primary outstanding trade commitments were $23,128 for letters of credit. The following table summarizes our obligations to make future payments under various agreements as of December 31, 2016:\n\n (1) The amounts shown for lease payments to HPT include payments due to HPT for the sites we account for as operating leases and for the sites we account for as a financing under a sale leaseback financing obligation and also include the payments of the deferred rent obligation of $42,915, $29,324, $29,107, $27,421 and $21,233 in June 2024 and December 2026, 2028, 2029, and 2030, respectively, as well as the amounts payable to HPT at the end of the lease terms for the estimated cost of removing underground storage tanks. Interest is not payable on the deferred rent obligation balance unless we default on certain covenants or certain events occur, such as a change in control of us. \n (2) Our 2028 Senior Notes require us to pay interest at 8.25% quarterly and the 2028 Senior Notes mature (unless previously redeemed) on January 15, 2028. We may, at our option, at any time on or after January 15, 2016, redeem some or all of the 2028 Senior Notes by paying 100% of the principal amount of the 2028 Senior Notes to be redeemed plus accrued but unpaid interest, if any, to, but not including, the redemption date. \n (3) Our 2029 Senior Notes require us to pay interest at 8.00% quarterly and the 2029 Senior Notes mature (unless previously redeemed) on December 15, 2029. We may, at our option, at any time on or after December 15, 2017, redeem some or all of the 2029 Senior Notes by paying 100% of the principal amount of the 2029 Senior Notes to be redeemed plus accrued but unpaid interest, if any, to, but not including, the redemption date. \n (4) Our 2030 Senior Notes require us to pay interest at 8.00% quarterly and the 2030 Senior Notes mature (unless previously redeemed) on October 15, 2030. We may, at our option, at any time on or after October 15, 2018, redeem some or all of the 2030 Senior Notes by paying 100% of the principal amount of the 2030 Senior Notes to be redeemed plus accrued but unpaid interest, if any, to, but not including, the redemption date. \n (5) As of December 31, 2016, we had entered agreements to acquire one travel center for a purchase price of $13,050 and six standalone restaurants for an aggregate purchase price of $6,000, and since December 31, 2016, we entered into an agreement to acquire an additional travel center for a purchase price of $4,175. During 2017, as of the date of this Annual Report, we have completed the purchase of six standalone restaurants for an aggregate purchase price of $6,000. The remaining acquisitions are subject to conditions and may not occur, may be delayed or the terms may change. \n (6) The other long term liabilities included in the table above include accrued liabilities related to our partial self insurance programs, including for general liability, workers' compensation, motor vehicle and group health benefits claims, as well as a loan secured by a mortgage on one of our standalone restaurants. \nEnvironmental and Climate Change Matters\nLegislation and regulation regarding climate change, including greenhouse gas emissions, and other environmental matters and market reaction to any such legislation or regulation or to climate change concerns, may decrease the demand for our fuel products, may require us to expend significant amounts and may negatively impact our business. For instance, federal and state governmental requirements addressing emissions from trucks and other motor vehicles, such as the EPA's gasoline and diesel sulfur control requirements that limit the concentration of sulfur in motor fuel, as well as new fuel efficiency standards for medium and heavy duty commercial trucks, has caused us to add certain services and provide certain products to our customers at a cost to us that we may be unable to pass through to our customers. Also, various private initiatives and government regulations to promote fuel efficiency that raise the cost of trucking as compared to other types of freight transport, may decrease the demand for our fuel products and negatively impact our business. For example, in August 2016 the EPA and the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration established final regulations that will phase in more stringent greenhouse gas emission and fuel efficiency standards for medium and heavy duty trucks beginning in model year 2021 (model year 2018 for certain trailers) through model year 2027, and these regulations are estimated to reduce fuel usage between 9% and 25% (depending on vehicle category) by model year 2027. We may not be able to completely offset the loss of business we may suffer as a result of increasing engine efficiency and other fuel conservation efforts.\nSome observers believe severe weather activities in different parts of the country over the last few years evidence global climate change. Such severe weather that may result from climate change may have an adverse effect on individual properties we own, lease or operate. We mitigate these risks by owning, leasing and operating a diversified portfolio of properties, by procuring insurance coverage we believe adequately protects us from material damages and losses and by attempting to monitor and be prepared for such events. However, there can be no assurance that our mitigation efforts will be sufficient or that storms that may occur due to future climate change or otherwise could not have a material adverse effect on our business.\nFor further information about these and other environmental and climate change matters, and the related risks that may arise, see the disclosure under the heading \"Environmental Contingencies\" in Note 13 to the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 15 of this Annual Report, \"Warning Concerning Forward Looking Statements,\" \"Regulatory Environment-Environmental Regulation\" in Item 1 and Item 1A, \"Risk Factors.\"", "item_7_tables": "Table 126: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td>

decreased 5.8% in 2016 compared to 2015, primarily due to lower fuel revenues as a result of decreases in fuel prices and volumes. Nonfuel revenues increased due to acquisitions.\n\n- Net loss in 2016 compared to net income in 2015 was primarily due to increases in depreciation, interest expense, and costs related to new locations, as well as decreased fuel gross margin. \n\n- Cash flow from operations decreased in 2016 compared to 2015, primarily due to the net loss versus net income.\n\n- Cash used in investing activities decreased due to lower acquisition activity, partially offset by lower asset sale proceeds and higher capital expenditures.\n\n- The company has $3.8 billion in future minimum lease payments to HPT, its main landlord and former parent company. It also has $330 million in senior notes outstanding.\n\n- The company plans to continue selectively acquiring and developing additional locations. Key risks include decreased fuel demand, competition, inability of new locations to reach expected financial results, economic conditions, and volatility in fuel prices.\n\n- The company is exposed to risks related to environmental and climate change matters, including regulations that could decrease demand for fuel. Severe weather attributed to climate change could also negatively impact properties."}
