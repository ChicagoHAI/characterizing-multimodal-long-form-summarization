MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nYou should read the following discussion and analysis in conjunction with the information set forth under Selected Financial Data\u201d and our consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The statements in this discussion regarding our expectations of our future performance, liquidity, and capital resources; our plans, estimates, beliefs, and expectations that involve risks and uncertainties; and other non-historical statements in this discussion are forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties, including, but not limited to, the risks and uncertainties described under Risk Factors\u201d and elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Our actual results may differ materially from those contained in or implied by any forward-looking statements.\nOverview\nWe started Square in February 2009 to enable businesses (sellers) to accept card payments, an important capability that was previously inaccessible to many businesses. However, sellers need many innovative solutions to thrive, and we have expanded to provide them additional products and services and to give them access to a cohesive ecosystem of tools to help them manage and grow their businesses. Similarly, with Cash App, we have built a parallel ecosystem of financial services to help individuals manage their money.\nOur Seller ecosystem is a cohesive commerce ecosystem that helps sellers start, run and grow their businesses, and consists of over 30 distinct software, hardware, and financial services products. We monetize these products through a combination of transaction, subscription, and service fees. Our suite of cloud-based software solutions are integrated to create a seamless experience and enable a holistic view of sales, customers, employees, and locations. With our offering, a seller can accept payments in person via swipe, dip, or tap of a card or online via Square Invoices, Square Virtual Terminal, or the seller's website. We also provide hardware to facilitate commerce for sellers, which includes magstripe readers, contactless and chip readers, Square Stand, Square Register, Square Terminal, and third-party peripherals. Square Card is a business prepaid card that enables sellers to spend the balance they have stored with Square. Sellers can also deposit funds into their Square stored balance so they can manage all of their business expenses in one place. Sellers also gain access to business loans through Square Capital based on the seller's payment processing history. We recognize revenue upon the sale of the loans to third-party investors or over time as the sellers pay down the outstanding amounts for the loans that we hold as available for sale. We have grown rapidly to serve millions of sellers that represent a diverse set of industries (including services, food-related business, and retail businesses) and sizes, ranging from a single vendor at a farmers' market to multi-location businesses. Square sellers also span geographies, including the United States, Canada, Japan, Australia, and the United Kingdom.\nOur Cash App ecosystem provides financial tools for individuals to store, send, receive, spend and invest money. With Cash App, customers can fund their account with a bank account or debit card, send and receive P2P (peer-to-peer) payments, and receive direct deposit payments. Customers can make purchases with their Cash Card, a Visa prepaid card that is linked to the balance stored in Cash App. With Cash Boost, customers receive instant discounts when they make Cash Card purchases at designated merchants. Customers can also use their stored funds to buy and sell bitcoin and equity investments within Cash App. In the fourth quarter of 2020, we acquired Credit Karma Tax, which adds a tax filing product for individuals to Cash App's ecosystem which provides a seamless, mobile-first solution for individuals to file their taxes for free.\nEffective June 30, 2020, we changed from one reportable segment to two reportable segments to reflect the way management and our chief operating decision maker ( CODM\u201d) review and assess performance of the business. Our two reportable segments are Seller and Cash App. Seller includes managed payment services, software solutions, hardware and financial services products offered to sellers, while Cash App includes financial tools available to individuals such as P2P (peer-to-peer) payments, Cash Card transactions, bitcoin and stock investing.\nIn April 2020, we were licensed to participate in the Paycheck Protection Program ( PPP\u201d) administered by the Small Business Administration ( SBA\u201d) that was enacted in March 2020 under the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (\"CARES Act\") in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. The PPP is intended to provide relief to eligible businesses impacted by COVID-19, and to incentivize businesses to keep their workers on the payroll. For the year ended\nDecember 31, 2020, we facilitated the issuance of $857 million of PPP loans, excluding cancelled loans, through an external bank partner, of which we sold $399.0 million to an investor. These loans are guaranteed by the U.S. government. Additionally, the loans are eligible for forgiveness if the borrowers meet certain criteria. As of December 31, 2020, approximately $46.4 million in PPP loans held for sale on our consolidated balance sheet have been forgiven by the SBA. In February 2021, we began participating in the second round of the PPP program by accepting applications from certain existing Square customers who received a loan in the spring of 2020. Similar to the loans issued in the first round of PPP, the loans are guaranteed by the U.S. government and will be eligible for forgiveness if the borrowers meet certain criteria.\nOn June 2, 2020, we entered into the Paycheck Protection Program Liquidity Facility agreement with the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco ( First PPPLF Agreement\u201d) to secure additional credit in an aggregate principal amount of up to $500.0 million. The program was established by the Federal Reserve to supplement the SBA's PPP to support the economy in response to the COVID-19 crisis. The facility is intended to bolster the effectiveness of the PPP and provide liquidity to credit markets, helping to stabilize financial institutions supporting COVID-19 relief efforts. Borrowings under the facility accrue interest at a rate of 0.35% and advances must be collateralized with loans originated under the PPP. The maturity date of any PPPLF advance will be the maturity date of the PPP loan pledged to secure the advance, and will be accelerated upon the occurrence of certain events of default. The advances under this facility are also repayable if the associated PPP loans are forgiven, repaid by the customer, or settled by the government guarantee. As of December 31, 2020, $464.1 million of PPPLF advances were outstanding and collateralized by the same value of the PPP loans held for sale on our consolidated balance sheet. On January 29, 2021, we entered into a second PPPLF agreement with the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco ( Second PPPLF Agreement\u201d and together with the First PPPLF Agreement, PPPLF Agreements\u201d) to secure additional credit, collateralized by loans from the second round of the PPP program, in an aggregate principal amount of up to $1.0 billion under both PPPLF Agreements.\nOn March 5, 2020, we issued $1.0 billion in aggregate principal amount of convertible senior notes that mature on March 1, 2025 (2025 Notes), unless earlier converted or repurchased pursuant to their terms, and bear interest at a rate of 0.1250% payable semi-annually on March 1 and September 1 of each year. On November 13, 2020, we issued an aggregate principal amount of $1.150 billion of convertible senior notes comprised of $575 million of convertible senior notes that mature on May 1, 2026 (2026 Notes) with a 0.0% coupon interest rate, and $575 million of convertible senior notes that mature on November 1, 2027 (2027 Notes) with a 0.25% coupon interest rate. The 2026 Notes and 2027 Notes will mature on each of its respective dates, unless earlier converted or repurchased. The 2027 Notes will bear interest at a rate of 0.25% payable semi-annually on May 1 and November 1 of each year beginning on May 1, 2021. We intend to use the net proceeds from our 2025, 2026 and 2027 Notes offerings for general corporate purposes, which may include capital expenditures, investments, working capital, and potential acquisitions and strategic transactions.\nImpact of COVID-19 on Current Trends and Outlook\nBy March 2020, the World Health Organization declared the COVID-19 pandemic a global pandemic following which, many local governments issued various mandates and public health guidelines requiring the closure of non-essential businesses and the curtailing of all unnecessary travel. These orders also required individuals to comply with various shelter-in-place and social distancing orders. As a result, the vast majority of our customers in those affected areas experienced a significant decline in sales in the first half of 2020. In the second half of 2020, as some shelter-in-place orders were relaxed, we saw modest improvements in certain areas including positive growth from higher priced card-not-present transactions as sellers adapted their businesses to contactless commerce, new sellers that joined Square, and the positive impact of various government assistance programs that led to an increase in consumer spending. However, Seller GPV trends have continued to vary by region and depended on regional shelter-in-place restrictions and COVID-19 guidelines. We also experienced an increase in Cash App engagement as a result of customer adoption of multiple products and the deposit of government stimulus funds and unemployment benefits into Cash App customer accounts.\nIn response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we took measures to assist our customers that we believed were in the best interests of our sellers in the long term, including refunding software subscription fees during the months of March and April 2020 as well as introducing options for sellers to temporarily pause and resume their subscriptions. While we continue to actively monitor the worldwide spread of COVID-19, the extent to which COVID-19 will ultimately impact our business remains difficult to predict. Growth trends continued to vary by region, product, and vertical, depending primarily on differences in the timing and phases of reopenings, which we expect will have a significant impact on overall GPV trends. Our priority remains the safety of our employees, customers and the communities in which we live and operate. We continue to remain in close and regular contact with our employees, customers, business partners and communities to help navigate these challenging times.\nAreas in which we continuously evaluate the potential impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our financial statements, include, and are not limited to, accrued transaction losses and fair value of loans, and to a lesser extent, the impairment of goodwill and intangible assets, impairment of long-lived assets including operating lease right-of-use assets, and property and equipment. We have concluded that our goodwill and other long lived assets are not impaired as of December 31, 2020. We continue to revise our estimates and assumptions to reflect any changes in transaction and loan losses in our financial statements. Where applicable, we have incorporated judgments and estimates of the expected impact of COVID-19 in the preparation of the financial statements based on information currently available. These judgments and estimates are subject to change, as new developments occur and additional information is obtained and are recognized in the consolidated financial statements as they become known.\nComponents of Results of Operations\nRevenue\nTransaction-based revenue. We charge our sellers a transaction fee that is generally calculated based on a percentage of the total transaction amount processed. We also selectively offer custom pricing for certain larger sellers. Transaction-based revenue also includes amounts we charge our Cash App customers for peer-to-peer transactions to business accounts and payments sent from a credit card.\nSubscription and services-based revenue. Revenue from Cash App, Square Capital, and Instant Transfers for sellers currently comprise the majority of our subscription and services-based revenue. Cash App subscription and services-based revenue is primarily comprised of transaction fees from both Cash App Instant Deposit and Cash Card. Our other subscription and services-based products include website hosting and domain name registration services, Gift Cards, Square Appointments, Customer Engagement, Employee Management, Payroll, Square Card, and other product offerings. Prior to 2020, subscriptions and services-based revenue also included revenue generated from Caviar, a food ordering and delivery platform that we sold in the fourth quarter of 2019.\nInstant Deposit is a functionality within the Cash App and our managed payment solutions that enables customers to instantly deposit funds into their bank accounts, while Cash Card offers Cash App customers the ability use their stored funds via a Visa prepaid card that is linked to the balance the customer stores in Cash App. We charge a per transaction fee which we recognize as revenue when customers instantly deposit funds to their bank account, use their Cash Card to make a purchase, or withdraw funds.\nSquare Capital facilitates loans to sellers that are offered through a partnership bank and are generally repaid through withholding a percentage of the collections of the seller's receivables processed by us. We also facilitate loans to the customers of certain sellers as well as to the sellers of its partners who do not process payments with us. The loans are generally originated by a bank partner, from whom we purchase the loans obtaining all rights, title, and interest. Our intention is to sell the rights, title, and interest in certain loans to third-party investors for an upfront fee when the loans are sold. We are retained by the third-party investors to service the loans and earn a servicing fee for facilitating the repayment of these receivables through our payments solutions. In April 2020, Square Capital was licensed to participate in the Paycheck Protection Program ( PPP\u201d) administered by the Small Business Administration. These loans are guaranteed by the U.S. government and are eligible for forgiveness if the borrowers meet certain criteria.\nHardware revenue. Hardware revenue includes revenue from sales of contactless and chip readers, Square Stand, Square Register, Square Terminal, and third-party peripherals. Third-party peripherals include cash drawers, receipt printers, and barcode scanners, all of which can be integrated with Square Stand, Square Register, or Square Terminal to provide a comprehensive point-of-sale solution.\nBitcoin revenue. Our Cash App customers have the ability to purchase bitcoin, a cryptocurrency. We recognize revenue when customers purchase bitcoin and it is transferred to the customer's account. We purchase bitcoin from private broker dealers or from Cash App customers and apply a small margin before selling it to our customers. The sale amounts received from our customers are recorded as revenue on a gross basis and the associated bitcoin cost as cost of revenues, as we are the principal in the bitcoin sale transaction. We have determined we are the principal because we control the bitcoin before delivery to the customer, we are primarily responsible for the delivery of the bitcoin to the customer, we are exposed\nto risks arising from fluctuations of the market price of bitcoin before delivery to the customer, and we have discretion in setting prices charged to the customer. Bitcoin revenue may fluctuate as a result of changes in customer demand or the market price of bitcoin.\nCost of Revenue and Gross Margin\nTransaction-based costs. Transaction-based costs consist primarily of interchange and assessment fees, processing fees, and bank settlement fees paid to third-party payment processors and financial institutions.\nSubscription and services-based costs. Subscription and services-based costs consist primarily of costs related to Cash App including Instant Deposit and Cash Card as well as Instant Transfer for sellers. Caviar costs were also a significant component of the subscription and services-based costs, prior to the sale of Caviar on October 31, 2019.\nHardware costs. Hardware costs consist primarily of product costs associated with contactless and chip readers, Square Terminal, Square Stand, Square Register, and third-party peripherals. Product costs include manufacturing-related overhead and personnel costs, certain royalties, packaging, and fulfillment costs. Hardware is sold primarily as a means to grow our transaction-based revenue and, as a result, generating positive gross margins from hardware sales is not the primary goal of the hardware business.\nBitcoin costs. Bitcoin cost of revenue is comprised of the amounts we pay to purchase bitcoin, which will fluctuate in line with the price of bitcoin in the market. We purchase bitcoin to facilitate customers' access to bitcoin.\nAmortization of acquired technology. These costs consist of amortization related to technologies acquired through acquisitions. These amounts were not material to our financial statements.\nOperating Expenses\nOperating expenses consist of product development, sales and marketing, general and administrative expenses, transaction and loan losses, and amortization of acquired customer assets. For product development and general and administrative expenses, the largest single component is personnel-related expenses, including salaries, commissions and bonuses, employee benefit costs, and share-based compensation. In the case of sales and marketing expenses, a significant portion is related to the Cash App peer-to-peer transactions and Cash Card issuance costs, in addition to paid advertising and personnel-related expenses. Operating expenses also include allocated overhead costs for facilities, human resources, and IT.\nProduct development. Product development expenses currently represent the largest component of our operating expenses and consist primarily of expenses related to our engineering, data science, and design personnel; fees and supply costs related to maintenance at third-party data center facilities; hardware related development and tooling costs; and fees for software licenses, consulting, legal, and other services that are directly related to growing and maintaining our portfolio of products and services. Additionally, product development expenses include the depreciation of product-related infrastructure and tools, including data center equipment, internally developed software, and computer equipment. We continue to focus our product development efforts on adding new features and apps, and on enhancing the functionality and ease of use of our offerings. Our ability to realize returns on these investments is substantially dependent upon our ability to successfully address current and emerging requirements of sellers, buyers, and customers through the development and introduction of these new products and services.\nSales and marketing. Sales and marketing expenses are aggregated into two main components. The first component consists of traditional advertising costs incurred such as direct sales expense, account management, local and product marketing, retail and e-commerce, partnerships, and communications personnel. The second component of sales and marketing expense consists of costs incurred for services, incentives and other costs that are not directly related to revenue generating transactions that we consider to be marketing costs to encourage the usage of Cash App. These expenses include, but are not limited to, Cash App peer-to-peer processing costs and transaction losses, card issuance costs, customer referral bonuses, and promotional giveaways that are expensed as incurred.\nGeneral and administrative. General and administrative expenses consist primarily of expenses related to our customer support, finance, legal, risk operations, human resources, and administrative personnel. General and administrative expenses also include costs related to fees paid for professional services, including legal, tax, and accounting services.\nTransaction and loan losses. We are exposed to transaction losses due to chargebacks as a result of fraud or uncollectibility. We incur loan losses whenever the amortized cost of loans that have been retained exceeds their fair value.\nTransaction losses include chargebacks for unauthorized credit card use and inability to collect on disputes between buyers and sellers over the delivery of goods or services, as well as losses on Cash App activity related to peer-to-peer payments sent from a credit card, Cash for Business, and Cash Card. We base our reserve estimates on prior chargeback history and current period data points indicative of transaction loss. We reflect additions to the reserve in current operating results, while realized losses are offset against the reserve. The establishment of appropriate reserves for transaction losses is an inherently uncertain process, and ultimate losses may vary from the current estimates. We regularly update our reserve estimates as new facts become known and events occur that may affect the settlement or recovery of losses.\nLoan losses are recorded at the lower of amortized cost or fair value determined on an individual loan basis. To determine the fair value the Company utilizes industry-standard valuation modeling, such as discounted cash flow models, taking into account the estimated timing and amounts of periodic repayments. The Company recognizes a charge whenever the amortized cost of a loan exceeds its fair value, with such charges being reversed for subsequent increases in fair value, but only to the extent that such reversals do not result in the amortized cost of a loan exceeding its fair value.\nAmortization of acquired customer assets. Amortization of acquired customer assets includes customer relationships, restaurant relationships, courier relationships, subscriber relationships, and partner relationships. These amounts were not material to our financial statements.\nGain on sale of asset group\nGain on sale of asset group in 2019 represents the excess of the consideration received from the disposal of the Caviar business less the carrying values of the net assets sold.\nInterest and Other Income and Expense, net\nInterest and other income and expense, net consists primarily of gains or losses arising from marking to market of equity investments, interest expense related to our long-term debt, interest income on our investment in marketable debt securities, and foreign currency-related gains and losses.\nProvision for Income Taxes\nThe provision for income taxes consists primarily of federal, state, local, and foreign tax. Our effective tax rate fluctuates from period to period due to changes in the mix of income and losses in jurisdictions with a wide range of tax rates, the effect of acquisitions, changes resulting from the amount of recorded valuation allowance, permanent differences between U.S. generally accepted accounting principles and local tax laws, certain one-time items, and changes in tax contingencies.\nResults of Operations\nRevenue (in thousands, except for percentages)\nTable 13: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Year Ended December 31, </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>$ Change </td> <td> </td> <td>% Change </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Transaction-based revenue </td> <td>$ </td> <td>3,294,978 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>3,081,074 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>213,904 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>7 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Subscription and services-based revenue </td> <td>1,539,403 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,031,456 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>507,947 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>49 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Hardware revenue </td> <td>91,654 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>84,505 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>7,149 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>8 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Bitcoin revenue </td> <td>4,571,543 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>516,465 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4,055,078 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>785 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total net revenue </td> <td>$ </td> <td>9,497,578 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>4,713,500 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>4,784,078 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>101 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTotal net revenue for the year ended December 31, 2020, increased by $4.8 billion, or 101%, compared to the year ended December 31, 2019. Bitcoin revenue increased by $4.1 billion, and represented 85% of the increase in total net revenue. Excluding bitcoin revenue, total net revenue increased by $729.0 million, or 17%, in the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to the year ended December 31, 2019.\nTransaction-based revenue for the year ended December 31, 2020 increased by $213.9 million or 7%, compared to the year ended December 31, 2019. This increase was in line with the increase in GPV of 6% for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase was primarily attributable to and affected by the following events and factors:\n\u2022In January and February of 2020, we benefited from the growth in payment volume processed by existing sellers, in addition to meaningful contributions from new sellers, compared to the same period in the prior year, which included a benefit from the impact of the leap year;\n\u2022In the second half of March through mid-April, 2020, as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and subsequent shelter-in-place restrictions, we experienced a significant decline in transaction-based revenue, with GPV generated by our Seller business decreasing compared to the prior year;\n\u2022Beginning in mid-April 2020, we started to experience improving trends in GPV generated by our Seller business, as some states started to relax shelter-in-place measures, sellers adapted their businesses to contactless commerce, new sellers joined Square and various government assistance programs led to an increase in consumer spending;\n\u2022In the third and fourth quarters of 2020, we have experienced positive growth of GPV and revenue compared to the third and fourth quarters of 2019, primarily driven by higher priced card-not-present transactions as sellers continued to shift their businesses to adapt to the COVID-19 pandemic.\nDespite the decrease in transaction-based revenue as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, the overall increase in transaction-based revenue for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the same period in 2019 was primarily driven by growth in higher-priced card-not-present transactions as sellers shifted their businesses to adapt to the COVID-19 pandemic, and the impact from our November 2019 card-present price change, as well as Cash App GPV which includes Cash for Business and peer-to-peer payments sent from a credit card. Cash for Business activity includes peer-to-peer transactions to business accounts using Cash App. The factors and events above had varying impacts on the GPV growth and may continue to impact our revenues in the future. In particular, card-present growth varies by region and product, depending primarily on differences in the timing and phases of reopenings, which we expect will have a significant impact on overall GPV trends.\nSubscription and services-based revenue for the year ended December 31, 2020 increased by $507.9 million or 49%, compared to the year ended December 31, 2019. On October 31, 2019, we completed the sale of the Caviar business, and, accordingly, Caviar no longer contributes to subscription and services-based revenue. Excluding Caviar, subscription and services-based revenue grew by $653.9 million, or 74%, in the year ended year ended December 31, 2020, compared to the year ended December 31, 2019 driven predominantly by Cash App, and to a lesser extent Square Card and Instant Transfers for sellers, partially offset by a decrease in Square Capital loan volumes. Cash App subscription and services-based revenue is primarily comprised of transaction fees from both Cash App Instant Deposit and Cash Card, with a small portion generated from interest earned on customer funds. In an effort to support our sellers, we temporarily suspended charging customers\nsoftware subscription fees and refunded fees collected in March and April 2020. We resumed charging such fees in May 2020. Square Capital, which has historically been a significant component of the subscriptions and services revenue, suspended facilitating loans to sellers, other than PPP loans, in March 2020 but resumed facilitating such loans at the end of July 2020. Loan volumes remain lower than in 2019, and there is substantial uncertainty about when loan volumes will return to pre-COVID-19 levels.\nHardware revenue for the year ended December 31, 2020 increased by $7.1 million or 8%, compared to the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase was primarily a result of an increase in sales of hardware in our international markets, as well as sales of contactless hardware as a result of certain promotions offered in the second and third quarter of 2020.\nBitcoin revenue for the year ended December 31, 2020 increased by $4.1 billion or 785% compared to the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase was due to the market price of bitcoin, growth in the number of active bitcoin customers, as well as volume per customer. The amount of bitcoin revenue recognized will fluctuate depending on customer demand as well as changes in the market price of bitcoin. During the year ended December 31, 2020, we saw a significant growth in bitcoin revenue as compared to the year ended December 31, 2019. While bitcoin contributed 48% of the total revenue in 2020, and 85% of the increase in revenues in 2020, gross margin generated from bitcoin was only 3.5% of the total gross margin.\nCost of Revenue (in thousands, except for percentages)\nTable 14: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Year Ended December 31, </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>$ Change </td> <td> </td> <td>% Change </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Transaction-based costs </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,911,848 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,937,971 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(26,123) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(1) </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Subscription and services-based costs </td> <td>222,712 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>234,270 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(11,558) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(5) </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Hardware costs </td> <td>143,901 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>136,385 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>7,516 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Bitcoin costs </td> <td>4,474,534 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>508,239 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3,966,295 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>780 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Amortization of acquired technology </td> <td>11,174 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6,950 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4,224 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>61 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total cost of revenue </td> <td>$ </td> <td>6,764,169 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2,823,815 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>3,940,354 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>140 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTotal cost of revenue for the year ended December 31, 2020, increased by $3.9 billion, or 140%, compared to the year ended December 31, 2019. Bitcoin costs of revenue increased by $4.0 billion, and represented 101% of the increase in the total cost of revenue. Excluding bitcoin costs of revenue, total cost of revenue decreased by approximately $25.9 million, or 1%, in the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to the year ended December 31, 2019.\nDespite an increase in GPV of 6% for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to the year ended December 31, 2019, transaction-based costs decreased by $26.1 million or 1% for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to the year ended December 31, 2019. The decrease in transaction-based costs in the year ended December 31, 2020 was primarily attributable to growth in debit card transactions and increase in average transaction sizes, which lowered the average cost per transaction, partially offset by the increase in GPV. We recognize that the recent shifts in the percentage of debit card transactions, proportion of card-not-present volumes, and average value per transaction size relative to historical periods are in part, a result of changes to consumer behaviors related to COVID-19, which may not continue in future quarters.\nSubscription and services-based costs for the year ended December 31, 2020 decreased by $11.6 million or 5% compared to the year ended December 31, 2019, primarily as a result of the sale of the Caviar business on October 31, 2019. Caviar contributed approximately 45% total subscription and services-based costs in year ended December 31, 2019. Excluding Caviar, subscription and services-based costs increased by $92.7 million or 71%, in the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to the year ended December 31, 2019, driven mainly by growth in costs associated with Cash Card and Instant Deposit.\nHardware costs for the year ended December 31, 2020 increased by $7.5 million or 6%, compared to the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase was primarily due to the same drivers for the increase in hardware revenue discussed above.\nBitcoin costs for the year ended December 31, 2020 increased by $4.0 billion or 780%, compared to the year ended December 31, 2019. Bitcoin costs of revenue comprises of the total amounts we pay to purchase bitcoin, which will fluctuate in line with bitcoin revenue.\nProduct Development (in thousands, except for percentages)\nTable 15: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Year Ended December 31, </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>$ Change </td> <td> </td> <td>% Change </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Product development </td> <td>$ </td> <td>881,826 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>670,606 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>211,220 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>31 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Percentage of total net revenue </td> <td>9 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>14 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nProduct development expenses for the year ended December 31, 2020, increased by $211.2 million, or 31%, compared to the year ended December 31, 2019, due primarily to the following:\n\u2022an increase of $155.4 million in personnel costs for the year ended December 31, 2020, related to an increase in headcount among our engineering, data science, and design teams, as we continue to improve and diversify our products.

The increase in Cash App marketing relates to a $355.6 million increase in processing costs and related transaction losses associated with the increased volume of activity with our Cash App peer-to-peer service, increased card issuance costs and increased incentives to customers that are not directly related to revenue generating transactions. We offer services such as stock investing, and certain Cash Card and peer-to-peer services to our Cash App customers for free, and various incentives to customers that we consider to be marketing tools to encourage the usage of Cash App. Additionally, Cash App advertising costs increased by $52.5 million;\n\u2022an increase of $29.6 million in advertising costs for our Seller Ecosystem services for the year ended December 31, 2020, primarily from increased online and television marketing campaigns;\n\u2022an increase of $28.3 million in Seller and Cash App sales and marketing personnel costs for the year ended December 31, 2020, to enable growth initiatives.

The increase in personnel related costs includes an increase in share-based compensation expense of $10.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2020; and\n\u2022the remaining increase was primarily due to the commencement of new leases, software and subscription costs, local business-related taxes, third-party legal and other professional fees and other administrative expenses, as well as impact of our statutory reserves.\nTransaction and Loan Losses (in thousands, except for percentages)\nTable 18: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Year Ended December 31, </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>$ Change </td> <td> </td> <td>% Change </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Transaction and loan losses </td> <td>$ </td> <td>177,670 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>126,959 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>50,711 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>40 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTransaction and loan losses for the year ended December 31, 2020, increased by $50.7 million, or 40%, compared to the year ended December 31, 2019, primarily due to the following:\n\u2022transaction losses increased by $44.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 due to growth in our Cash App business, as well as increased provisions for transaction losses for our Seller business due to the expected impact of the COVID-19 pandemic that resulted in a significant slowdown in business for many sellers.\n\u2022an increase of $6.0 million in loan losses for the year ended December 31, 2020 due to incremental provisions for loan losses associated with the COVID-19 pandemic, and to a lesser extent the aging of our Square Capital loan portfolio. The increases in loan losses were offset by decreases in loan volumes as we suspended offers for new loans, other than PPP loans, in March 2020 and resumed offering such loans at the end of July 2020 at lower volumes.\nGain on Sale of Asset Group, Interest Expense, Net, and Other Expense (Income), Net (in thousands, except for percentages)\nTable 19: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Year Ended December 31, </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>$ Change </td> <td> </td> <td>% Change </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gain on sale of asset group </td> <td>$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(373,445) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>373,445 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>NM </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest expense, net </td> <td>56,943 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>21,516 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>35,427 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>165 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other expense (income), net </td> <td>(291,725) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>273 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(291,998) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>NM </td> </tr>\n</table>\nGain on sale of asset group represents the excess of the consideration received from the sale of the Caviar business in October, 2019, of $410 million less the carrying value of the net assets sold and selling expenses, as analyzed in Note 8, Sale of Asset Group, of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nInterest expense, net, for the year ended December 31, 2020 increased by $35.4 million compared to the year ended December 31, 2019. The increases were primarily due to higher interest expense related to our convertible notes as a result of the issuance of the 2025 Notes in March 2020, as well as the 2026 Notes and 2027 Notes in November 2020, in addition to a decrease in interest income earned on our investments in marketable debt securities due to lower interest rates prevailing in the market.\nOther expense (income), net was primarily driven by the amounts of gains or losses arising from the revaluation of our equity investments. In November 2020, upon DoorDash's initial public offering, the preferred shares held by the Company converted into common shares of DoorDash. As of December 31, 2020, the Company revalued this investment and recorded a gain of $276.3 million in the year ended December 31, 2020. Additionally, in the fourth quarter of 2020, we recorded a gain on investment in a privately held entity of $19.0 million based on observable prices for similar equity instruments issued by\nthe same entity. In the year ended December 31, 2019, we recorded a loss of $12.3 million on the revaluation of our equity investment Eventbrite, Inc. (\"Eventbrite\"), offset by the amortization of and realized gains on the sale of investments in marketable securities of $9.7 million, foreign exchange gains of $1.7 million, and other sources of income. In December 2019, the Company sold its entire equity investment in Eventbrite and as a result this investment will not impact the results in future periods.\nSegment Results\nSeller Results\nThe following tables provide a summary of the revenue and gross profit for our Seller segment for the year ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 (in thousands):\nTable 20: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Year Ended December 31, </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>$ Change </td> <td> </td> <td>% Change </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net revenue </td> <td>$ </td> <td>3,529,192 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>3,461,988 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>67,204 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cost of revenue </td> <td>2,021,361 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,071,561 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(50,200) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(2) </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gross profit </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,507,831 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,390,427 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>117,404 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>8 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table>\nRevenue\nRevenue for the Seller segment for the year ended December 31, 2020 increased by $67.2 million compared to the year ended December 31, 2019.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic and the subsequent shelter-in-place orders resulted in a material decline in Seller revenues in the latter half of March 2020 through mid-April 2020 due to lower GPV processed. Additionally, Square Capital suspended facilitating loans to sellers from mid-March 2020 through the end of July 2020, other than PPP loans, further negatively impacting Seller revenues. Excluding the impact of Square Capital, other Seller subscription and services-based revenue increased due to growth in software subscriptions, Instant Transfers, and Square Card. This was offset by the recovery and improvements in GPV processed from mid-April through the fourth quarter of 2020 as states started relaxing the shelter-in-place orders and businesses started to adapt to the COVID-19 pandemic. Additionally, we saw a higher percentage of card-not-present transactions from the second quarter through to the fourth quarter of 2020, which have a higher transaction price, as well as the impact of our November 2019 card-present price change. Recent increases in the percentage of debit, proportion of card-not-present volumes, and average transaction size relative to historical periods are in part a result of changes to consumer behaviors related to COVID-19, which may not continue in future quarters.\nCost of revenue\nCost of revenue for the Seller segment for the year ended December 31, 2020 decreased by $50.2 million compared to the year ended December 31, 2019. Seller costs benefited from a higher percentage of debit card transactions and increase in average value per transaction which have lower costs.\nCash App Results\nThe following tables provide a summary of the revenue and gross profit for our Cash App segment for the year ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 (in thousands):\nTable 21: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Year Ended December 31, </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>$ Change </td> <td> </td> <td>% Change </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net revenue </td> <td>$ </td> <td>5,968,386 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,105,599 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>4,862,787 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>440 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cost of revenue </td> <td>4,742,808 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>647,931 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4,094,877 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>632 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gross profit </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,225,578 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>457,668 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>767,910 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>168 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table>\nRevenue\nRevenue for the Cash App segment for the year ended December 31, 2020 increased by $4.9 billion compared to the year ended December 31, 2019. The primary drivers were growth in bitcoin revenue, and to a lesser extent, Cash App Instant Deposit, Cash Card, and Cash for Business. Bitcoin revenue increased primarily due to an increase in the number of active bitcoin customers, as well as growth in customer demand and bitcoin prices. Additionally, Cash App revenue benefited from increased numbers of transacting active Cash App customers and from disbursements of the CARES Act stimulus programs and unemployment benefits, including a portion of customers who direct deposited these payments into their Cash App accounts. Cash App revenue growth may not be sustained at the same levels in future quarters and may be impacted by the enactment of further stimulus relief and benefit programs, as well as the demand and market prices for bitcoin, amongst other factors.\nCost of revenue\nCost of revenue for the Cash App segment for the year ended December 31, 2020 increased by $4.1 billion compared to the year ended December 31, 2019. The primary drivers for the increase were growth in bitcoin revenue, and to a lesser extent, Cash App Instant Deposit, Cash Card, and Cash for Business.\nComparison of Years Ended December 31, 2019 and 2018\nFor a discussion of the 2019 Results of Operations, including a discussion of the financial results for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2019 compared to the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018, refer to Part I, Item 7 of our Form 10-K filed with the SEC on February 26, 2020.\nQuarterly Results of Operations\nThe following tables set forth selected unaudited quarterly statements of operations data for the last eight quarters.

</tr>\n</table>\nQuarterly Trends\nTransaction-based revenue is highly correlated with the level of GPV generated by sellers using our managed payments services. The increase in transaction-based revenue in 2020 was primarily attributable to and affected by the COVID-19 pandemic and subsequent shelter in place orders as discussed in more detail under results of operations.\nSubscription and services-based revenue generally demonstrates less seasonality than transaction-based revenue. The sequential increases were primarily driven by continued growth of Cash App which has benefited from increased engagement by customers as well as an increase from government stimulus funds deposited into customer accounts. On October 31, 2019, we completed the sale of the Caviar business, and accordingly we will no longer recognize any revenue from Caviar.\nBitcoin revenue comprises the total sale amount we receive from bitcoin sales to customers and is recorded upon transfer of bitcoin to the customer's account. The sale amount generally includes a small margin added to the price we pay to purchase bitcoin and accordingly, the amount of bitcoin revenue will fluctuate depending on the volatility of market bitcoin prices and customer demand. We saw unprecedented growth in bitcoin revenues in the second and third quarter of 2020. Various factors impact customer demand and as such, the recent periods' performance may not be indicative of future quarters.\nChanges in product development expenses primarily reflect the timing of additions of engineering, product, and design personnel. To a lesser extent, they also reflect the timing of fees and supply costs related to maintenance and capacity\nexpansion at third-party data center facilities, development and tooling costs related to the design, testing, and shipping of our hardware products, and fees for software licenses, consulting, legal, and other services that are directly related to growing and maintaining our products and services.\nChanges in sales and marketing expenses reflect the variable nature of the timing and magnitude of paid marketing and customer acquisition initiatives across our advertising channels. Changes in sales and marketing expenses are also affected by the timing of additions of direct sales, account management, local, product and paid marketing, retail and e-commerce, partnerships, and communications personnel. Additionally, sales and marketing expenses are affected by the timing and magnitude of processing costs and transaction losses related to our Cash App peer-to-peer transfer service and Cash Card issuance costs. We offer the Cash Card and certain peer-to-peer services to our Cash App customers for free and we consider these to be marketing tools intended to encourage the usage of Cash App. We saw a substantial increase in sales and marketing expenses in the second and third quarter of 2020 associated with the increased volume of activity with our Cash App peer-to-peer service.\nChanges in general and administrative expenses primarily reflect the timing of additions of finance, legal, risk operations, human resources, and administrative personnel, as well as the timing of non income tax payments and reserves. They also reflect the timing of costs related to support personnel and systems, as well as fees paid for professional services, including legal and financial services.\nWe recorded incremental provisions for transaction and loan losses in the first quarter of 2020 for our Seller business due to the expected impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and the related subsequent shelter-in-place orders that resulted in a significant slowdown in the business of many sellers. During the second quarter of 2020, we revised and lowered our estimate of transaction loss reserves recorded in the first quarter of 2020 due to better than expected realized transaction losses. Provision for transaction losses declined during the third quarter as a result of better than expected performance, and as we released previously established risk loss provisions for the first and second quarter of 2020. During the fourth quarter of 2020, we revised and lowered our estimate of transaction loss reserves recorded in the second and third quarter of 2020 due to better than expected realized transaction losses. For loan losses, during the second quarter of 2020, we noted improvements in our sellers as some states started reopening and relaxing the shelter-in place measures and have accordingly adjusted the provisions for loan losses. Additionally, other than PPP loans, we suspended offers for new loans in the second quarter of 2020 which contributed to the decrease in loan losses. During the third and fourth quarters of 2020, we continued to experience loan losses in line with the second quarter provisions for loan losses. Provisions for transaction losses increased approximately 106% in the fourth quarter of 2020, compared to the fourth quarter of 2019.\nGain on sale of asset group represents the net gain we made on the sale of the Caviar business in the fourth quarter of 2019.\nChanges in interest expense (income), net are driven by interest expense related to our convertible notes and interest income earned on our investment in marketable debt securities.\nChanges in other expense (income), net was primarily due to gains or losses arising from revaluation of our publicly traded and privately held equity investments. In the fourth quarter of 2020, we recorded a gain from the revaluation of our DoorDash investment as a result of its initial public offering in December 2020, as well as a gain in the fourth quarter of 2020 due to the revaluation of our investment in a privately held entity. In 2019, we recorded losses in the mark to market revaluation of our Eventbrite investment. In December 2019, the Company sold the investment in Eventbrite and as a result will not be impacted by mark to market revaluations related to this investment in future periods. To a lesser extent this balance is also impacted by foreign exchange gains or losses.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nThe uncertainty caused by the COVID-19 pandemic continues both in the United States and globally, with the duration and severity of the pandemic and the overall impact on consumer demand and overall economy still unknown. We are unable to forecast the full impact on our business; however, this represents a known area of uncertainty and we continue to expect the COVID-19 pandemic and its related economic disruption may have a material impact on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. We continue to evaluate our investment plans and discretionary expenditures and will make adjustments accordingly.\nAs of December 31, 2020, we had approximately $4.9 billion in available funds, including undrawn amounts available under our revolving credit facility, as described in Note 13, Indebtedness, of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. We intend to continue focusing on our long-term business initiatives and believe that our available funds are sufficient to meet our liquidity needs for the foreseeable future. We are carefully monitoring and managing our cash position in light of ongoing conditions and levels of operations.\nThe following table summarizes our cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash, and investments in marketable debt securities (in thousands):\nLiquidity Sources\nTable 27: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Year Ended December 31, </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cash and cash equivalents </td> <td>$ </td> <td>3,158,058 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,047,118 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Short-term restricted cash </td> <td>30,279 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>38,873 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Long-term restricted cash </td> <td>13,526 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>12,715 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash </td> <td>3,201,863 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,098,706 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Investments in short-term debt securities </td> <td>695,112 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>492,456 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Investments in long-term debt securities </td> <td>463,950 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>537,303 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash and investments in marketable debt securities </td> <td>$ </td> <td>4,360,925 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2,128,465 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nOur principal sources of liquidity are our cash and cash equivalents, and investments in marketable debt securities. As of December 31, 2020, we had $4.4 billion of cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash and investments in marketable debt securities, which were held primarily in cash deposits, money market funds, U.S. government and agency securities, commercial paper, and corporate bonds. We consider all highly liquid investments with an original maturity of three months or less when purchased to be cash equivalents. Our investments in marketable debt securities are classified as available-for-sale. From time to time, we have raised capital by issuing equity, equity-linked, or debt securities such as our convertible senior notes.\nAs of December 31, 2020, we held $3.0 billion in aggregate principal amount of convertible senior notes, comprised of $8.5 million in aggregate principal amount of outstanding convertible senior notes that mature on March 1, 2022 (2022 Notes), $862.5 million in aggregate principal amount of convertible senior notes that mature on May 15, 2023 (2023 Notes), $1.0 billion in aggregate amount of convertible senior notes that mature on March 1, 2025 (2025 Notes), and $575.0 million and $575.0 million in aggregate amount of convertible senior notes that mature on May 1, 2026, and November 1, 2027, respectively (2026 and 2027 Notes). The 2022 Notes bear interest at a rate of 0.375% payable semi-annually on March 1 and September 1 of each year, while the 2023 Notes bear interest at a rate of 0.50% payable semi-annually on May 15 and November 15 of each year, and the 2025 Notes bear interest at a rate of 0.125% payable semi-annually on March 1 and September 1 of each year. The 2026 Notes bear no interest, whereas, the 2027 notes bear interest at a rate of 0.25% payable semi-annually on May 1 and November 1 of each year. These notes can be converted or repurchased prior to maturity if certain conditions are met.\nWe purchased $50 million in bitcoin in October 2020 and another $170 million in February 2021, as we believe cryptocurrency is an instrument of economic empowerment that aligns with our corporate purpose. We expect to hold these investments for the long term but will continue to reassess our investment in bitcoin relative to our balance sheet. As bitcoin is considered an indefinite lived intangible asset, under the accounting policy for such assets we will be required to recognize\nany decreases in market prices below cost as an impairment charge, with any mark up in value prohibited if the market price of bitcoin subsequently increases.\nIn September 2020, we announced our intent to invest $100 million in supporting underserved communities, particularly, racial and ethnic minority groups who have been disproportionately affected by COVID-19. This initiative further deepens our commitment toward economic empowerment to help broaden such communities' access to financial services.\nIn June 2020, we entered into the Paycheck Protection Program Liquidity Facility agreement with the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco (\"First PPPLF Agreement\") to secure additional credit collateralized by PPP loans. As of December 31, 2020, $464.1 million of PPPLF advances were outstanding and collateralized by the same value of PPP loans. The advances under this facility are repayable if the associated PPP loans are forgiven, repaid by a customer or settled by the government guarantee. As of February 23, 2021, approximately $376.3 million of PPPLF advances were outstanding and collateralized by the same value of the PPP loans. On January 29, 2021, we entered into a Second PPPLF Agreement with the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco to secure additional credit, collateralized by loans from the second round of the PPP program, in an aggregate principal amount of up to $1.0 billion under both PPPLF Agreements.\nIn May 2020, we entered into a new revolving credit agreement with certain lenders, which provides a $500 million senior unsecured revolving credit facility (the \"2020 Credit Facility\") maturing in May 2023. Loans under the 2020 Credit Facility bear interest at our option of (i) a base rate based on the highest of the prime rate, the federal funds rate plus 0.50%, and the adjusted LIBOR rate plus 1.00%, in each case, plus a margin ranging from 0.25% to 0.75% or (ii) an adjusted LIBOR rate plus a margin ranging from 1.25% to 1.75%. The margin is determined based on our total net leverage ratio, as defined in the agreement. We are obligated to pay other customary fees for a credit facility of this size and type including an unused commitment fee of 0.15%. To date, no funds have been drawn and no letters of credit have been issued under the 2020 Credit Facility.\nSee Note 13, Indebtedness, of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more details on these transactions.\nWe believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents, investment in marketable debt securities, and availability under our line of credit will be sufficient to meet our working capital needs, including any expenditures related to strategic transactions and investment commitments that we may from time to time enter into, and planned capital expenditures for at least the next 12 months. From time to time, we may seek to raise additional capital through equity, equity-linked, and debt financing arrangements. We cannot provide assurance that any additional financing will be available to us on acceptable terms or at all.\nShort-term restricted cash of $30.3 million as of December 31, 2020 reflects pledged cash deposited into savings accounts at the financial institutions that process our sellers' payments transactions and as collateral pursuant to an agreement with the originating bank for the Company's Square Capital loan product. We use the restricted cash to secure letters of credit with these financial institutions to provide collateral for liabilities arising from cash flow timing differences in the processing of these payments. We have recorded this amount as a current asset on our consolidated balance sheets given the short-term nature of these cash flow timing differences and that there is no minimum time frame during which the cash must remain restricted. Additionally, this balance includes certain amounts held as collateral pursuant to multi-year lease agreements, discussed in the paragraph below, which we expect to become unrestricted within the next year.\nLong-term restricted cash of $13.5 million as of December 31, 2020 is primarily related to cash deposited into money market funds that is used as collateral pursuant to multi-year lease agreements. The Company has recorded this amount as a non-current asset on the consolidated balance sheets as the lease terms extend beyond one year.\nWe experience significant day-to-day fluctuations in our cash and cash equivalents, due to fluctuations in settlements receivable, and customers payable, and hence working capital. These fluctuations are primarily due to:\n\u2022Timing of period end. For periods that end on a weekend or a bank holiday, our cash and cash equivalents, settlements receivable, and customers payable balances typically will be higher than for periods ending on a weekday, as we settle to our sellers for payment processing activity on business days; and\n\u2022Fluctuations in daily GPV. When daily GPV increases, our cash and cash equivalents, settlements receivable, and customers payable amounts increase. Typically our settlements receivable, and customers payable balances at period end represent one to four days of receivables and disbursements to be made in the subsequent period. Customers payable, excluding amounts attributable to Cash App stored funds, and settlements receivable balances typically move in tandem, as pay-out and pay-in largely occur on the same business day. However, customers payable balances will be greater in amount than settlements receivable balances due to the fact that a subset of funds are held due to unlinked bank accounts, risk holds, and chargebacks. Also, customer funds obligations, which are included in customers payable, may cause customers payable to trend differently than settlements receivable. Holidays and day-of-week may also cause significant volatility in daily GPV amounts.\nCash Flow Activities\nThe following table summarizes our cash flow activities (in thousands):\nTable 28: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Year Ended December 31, </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash provided by operating activities </td> <td>$ </td> <td>381,603 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>465,699 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash provided by (used in) investing activities: </td> <td>(606,636) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>95,193 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash provided by (used in) financing activities </td> <td>2,315,195 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(98,874) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Effect of foreign exchange rate on cash and cash equivalents </td> <td>12,995 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3,841 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net increase in cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2,103,157 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>465,859 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nCash Flows from Operating Activities\nCash provided by operating activities consisted of net loss adjusted for certain non-cash items including gain or loss on revaluation of equity investments, depreciation and amortization, non-cash interest and other expense, share-based compensation expense, transaction and loan losses, deferred income taxes, non-cash lease expense, gain on sale of asset group, as well as the effect of changes in operating assets and liabilities, including working capital.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2020, cash provided by operating activities was $381.6 million, primarily due to a net income of $213.1 million, offset by PPP loans facilitated, less loans sold, of $420.8 million, adjusted for the add back of non-cash expenses of $509.4 million consisting primarily of share-based compensation, transaction and loan losses, depreciation and amortization, and non-cash interest and other expenses. Whereas the increase in transaction and loan losses was largely caused by estimated losses attributable to the COVID-19 pandemic, the increase in other non-cash expenses was primarily due to the growth and expansion of our business activities. Additionally, the cash generated from operating activities increased due to a net inflow from changes in other assets and liabilities of $79.9 million due to timing.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2019, cash provided by operating activities was $465.7 million primarily due to a net income of $375.4 million, adjusted for the add back of non-cash expenses of $574.5 million consisting primarily of share-based compensation, transaction and loan losses, depreciation and amortization, and non-cash interest and other expenses largely driven by growth and expansion of our business activities, offset in part by the gain on sale of Caviar of $373.4 million in the fourth quarter. The cash generated from operating activities was negatively affected by a net outflow from changes in other assets and liabilities of $110.8 million.\nCash Flows from Investing Activities\nCash flows used in investing activities primarily relate to capital expenditures to support our growth, investments in marketable debt securities, investment in privately held entity, and business acquisitions.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2020, cash used in investing activities was $606.6 million, primarily due to the net investments of marketable securities including investments from customer funds of $337.7 million. Additional uses of cash were as a result of the purchase of property and equipment of $138.4 million, business acquisitions, net of cash acquired of\n$79.2 million and purchases of other investments of $51.3 million.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2019, cash provided by investing activities was $95.2 million, primarily as a result of the net cash proceeds from sale of asset group of $309.3 million related to the sale of the Caviar business and proceeds from sale of equity investment in Eventbrite of $33.0 million, offset in part by the net investments of marketable securities including investments from customer funds of $149.0 million. Additional uses of cash in investing activities were a result of purchases of property and equipment of $62.5 million, business combinations, net of cash acquired of $20.4 million, and other investments of $15.3 million.\nCash Flows from Financing Activities\nFor the year ended December 31, 2020, cash provided by financing activities was $2.3 billion, primarily as a result of $1.08 billion in net proceeds from the 2026 and 2027 Note offering, $936.5 million in net proceeds from the 2025 Note offering, proceeds from the First PPPLF Agreement advances of $464.1 million, proceeds from issuances of common stock from the exercise of options and purchases under our employee share purchase plan of $162.0 million, offset by payments for employee tax withholding related to vesting of restricted stock units of $314.0 million.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2019, cash used in financing activities was $98.9 million, primarily as a result of payments for employee tax withholding related to vesting of restricted stock units of $212.3 million offset in part by proceeds from issuances of common stock from the exercise of options and purchases under the employee stock purchase plan, net of $118.5 million.\nContractual Obligations and Commitments\nOur principal commitments consist of convertible senior notes, liquidity facility, operating leases, capital leases, and purchase commitments. The following table summarizes our commitments to settle contractual obligations in cash as of December 31, 2020.\nTable 29: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Payments due by period </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Total </td> <td> </td> <td>Less than 1 year </td> <td> </td> <td>1 - 3 years </td> <td> </td> <td>3 - 5 years </td> <td> </td> <td>More than 5 years </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>(in thousands) </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Convertible senior notes, including interest </td> <td>$ </td> <td>3,044,046 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>7,032 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>880,733 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,004,125 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,152,156 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>PPP Liquidity Facility </td> <td>464,094 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>464,094 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating leases </td> <td>566,328 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>70,774 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>151,202 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>103,525 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>240,827 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Finance leases </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Purchase commitments </td> <td>40,695 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>40,695 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total </td> <td>$ </td> <td>4,115,163 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>582,595 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,031,935 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,107,650 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,392,983 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nConvertible Senior Notes\nOn November 13, 2020, we issued $1.15 billion in aggregate principal amount of 2026 and 2027 Notes that mature on May 1, 2026 and November 1, 2027, respectively, unless earlier converted or repurchased. The 2026 Notes bear no interest, whereas, the 2027 Notes bear interest at a rate of 0.25% payable semi-annually on May 1 and November 1 of each year. See Note 13, Indebtedness, of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more details on this transaction.\nOn March 5, 2020, we issued $1.0 billion in aggregate principal amount of 2025 Notes that mature on March 1, 2025, unless earlier converted or repurchased, and bear interest at a rate of 0.1250% payable semi-annually on March 1 and September 1 of each year. See Note 13, Indebtedness, of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more details on this transaction.\nOn May 25, 2018, we issued $862.5 million in aggregate principal amount of 2023 Notes that mature on May 15, 2023, unless earlier converted or repurchased, and bear interest at a rate of 0.50% payable semi-annually on May 15 and\nNovember 15 of each year. See Note 13, Indebtedness, of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more details on this transaction.\nOn March 6, 2017, we issued $440.0 million in aggregate principal amount of Notes that mature on March 1, 2022, unless earlier converted or repurchased, and bear interest at a rate of 0.375% payable semi-annually on March 1 and September 1 of each year. See Note 13, Indebtedness, of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more details on this transaction.\nPaycheck Protection Program Liquidity Facility\nOn June 2, 2020, we entered into the First PPPLF Agreement with the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco to secure additional credit in an aggregate principal amount of up to $500.0 million. Borrowings under the facility accrue interest at a rate of 0.35% and must be collateralized with loans originated under the PPP. On January 29, 2021, we entered into a second PPPLF agreement with the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco ( Second PPPLF Agreement\u201d and together with the First PPPLF Agreement, PPPLF Agreements\u201d) to secure additional credit, collateralized by loans from the second round of the PPP program, in an aggregate principal amount of up to $1.0 billion under both PPPLF Agreements. The maturity date of any PPPLF advances will be the maturity date of the PPP loan pledged to secure the advance, and will be accelerated upon the occurrence of certain events of default. Although loans originated under the PPP have a stated maturity of between two and five years from origination, some of the loans may be forgiven 24 weeks after disbursement if they meet certain specified criteria. The PPPLF advances are also repayable if the underlying PPP loan is repaid by the customer. As of December 31, 2020, $464.1 million of PPPLF advances were outstanding. As of February 23, 2021, approximately $376.3 million of PPPLF advances were outstanding and collateralized by the same value of the PPP loans. See Note 13, Indebtedness, of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more details on this transaction.\nLease Commitments\nWe have entered into various non-cancelable operating leases for certain offices with contractual lease periods expiring between 2021 and 2034. We recognized total rental expenses under operating leases of $75.2 million, $32.5 million, and $23.3 million during the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018, respectively.\nPurchase commitments\nWe had non-cancelable purchase obligations to hardware suppliers for $40.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2020.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements during the periods presented.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nOur discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. GAAP requires us to make certain estimates and judgments that affect the amounts reported in our financial statements. We base our estimates on historical experience, anticipated future trends, and other assumptions we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Because these accounting policies require significant judgment, our actual results may differ materially from our estimates.\nWe believe accounting policies and the assumptions and estimates associated with transaction and loan losses, especially due to uncertainties associated with the COVID-19 pandemic, and revenue recognition have the greatest potential effect on our consolidated financial statements. Therefore, we consider these to be our critical accounting policies and estimates.\nTransaction Losses\nWe are exposed to transaction losses due to chargebacks as a result of fraud or uncollectibility of transaction payments. We estimate accrued transaction losses based on available data as of the reporting date, including expectations of future chargebacks, and historical trends related to loss rates that is continuously adjusted for new information and incorporates, where applicable, reasonable and supportable forecasts about future expectations. During the first and second\nquarters of 2020, the Company revised its estimates to reflect expected increased chargebacks from non-delivery of goods and services as well as increased failure rates of its sellers due to the COVID-19 pandemic. During the third and fourth quarters of 2020, the Company continued to further revise its estimates for transaction losses and as a result of better than expected performance, the Company released previously established risk loss provisions for the first three quarters of 2020 amounting to $82.4 million.\nConvertible Notes\nWe account for the convertible notes as separate debt and equity components. The carrying amount of the debt component is calculated by measuring the fair value of a similar debt that does not have an associated convertible feature. The carrying amount of the equity component representing the conversion option is calculated by deducting the fair value of the debt component from the principal amount of the convertible notes as a whole. We estimated the fair value of the debt and equity components using a convertible bond model, which includes subjective assumptions such as the expected term and expected volatility. These assumptions involve inherent uncertainties and management judgement.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nSee Recent Accounting Pronouncements\u201d described in Note 1 of the Notes to our consolidated financial statements.", "item_7_truncated": "Item 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nYou should read the following discussion and analysis in conjunction with the information set forth under Selected Financial Data\u201d and our consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The statements in this discussion regarding our expectations of our future performance, liquidity, and capital resources; our plans, estimates, beliefs, and expectations that involve risks and uncertainties; and other non-historical statements in this discussion are forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties, including, but not limited to, the risks and uncertainties described under Risk Factors\u201d and elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Our actual results may differ materially from those contained in or implied by any forward-looking statements.\nOverview\nWe started Square in February 2009 to enable businesses (sellers) to accept card payments, an important capability that was previously inaccessible to many businesses. However, sellers need many innovative solutions to thrive, and we have expanded to provide them additional products and services and to give them access to a cohesive ecosystem of tools to help them manage and grow their businesses. Similarly, with Cash App, we have built a parallel ecosystem of financial services to help individuals manage their money.\nOur Seller ecosystem is a cohesive commerce ecosystem that helps sellers start, run and grow their businesses, and consists of over 30 distinct software, hardware, and financial services products. We monetize these products through a combination of transaction, subscription, and service fees. Our suite of cloud-based software solutions are integrated to create a seamless experience and enable a holistic view of sales, customers, employees, and locations. With our offering, a seller can accept payments in person via swipe, dip, or tap of a card or online via Square Invoices, Square Virtual Terminal, or the seller's website. We also provide hardware to facilitate commerce for sellers, which includes magstripe readers, contactless and chip readers, Square Stand, Square Register, Square Terminal, and third-party peripherals. Square Card is a business prepaid card that enables sellers to spend the balance they have stored with Square. Sellers can also deposit funds into their Square stored balance so they can manage all of their business expenses in one place. Sellers also gain access to business loans through Square Capital based on the seller's payment processing history. We recognize revenue upon the sale of the loans to third-party investors or over time as the sellers pay down the outstanding amounts for the loans that we hold as available for sale. We have grown rapidly to serve millions of sellers that represent a diverse set of industries (including services, food-related business, and retail businesses) and sizes, ranging from a single vendor at a farmers' market to multi-location businesses. Square sellers also span geographies, including the United States, Canada, Japan, Australia, and the United Kingdom.\nOur Cash App ecosystem provides financial tools for individuals to store, send, receive, spend and invest money. With Cash App, customers can fund their account with a bank account or debit card, send and receive P2P (peer-to-peer) payments, and receive direct deposit payments. Customers can make purchases with their Cash Card, a Visa prepaid card that is linked to the balance stored in Cash App. With Cash Boost, customers receive instant discounts when they make Cash Card purchases at designated merchants. Customers can also use their stored funds to buy and sell bitcoin and equity investments within Cash App. In the fourth quarter of 2020, we acquired Credit Karma Tax, which adds a tax filing product for individuals to Cash App's ecosystem which provides a seamless, mobile-first solution for individuals to file their taxes for free.\nEffective June 30, 2020, we changed from one reportable segment to two reportable segments to reflect the way management and our chief operating decision maker ( CODM\u201d) review and assess performance of the business. Our two reportable segments are Seller and Cash App. Seller includes managed payment services, software solutions, hardware and financial services products offered to sellers, while Cash App includes financial tools available to individuals such as P2P (peer-to-peer) payments, Cash Card transactions, bitcoin and stock investing.\nIn April 2020, we were licensed to participate in the Paycheck Protection Program ( PPP\u201d) administered by the Small Business Administration ( SBA\u201d) that was enacted in March 2020 under the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (\"CARES Act\") in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. The PPP is intended to provide relief to eligible businesses impacted by COVID-19, and to incentivize businesses to keep their workers on the payroll. For the year ended\nDecember 31, 2020, we facilitated the issuance of $857 million of PPP loans, excluding cancelled loans, through an external bank partner, of which we sold $399.0 million to an investor. These loans are guaranteed by the U.S. government. Additionally, the loans are eligible for forgiveness if the borrowers meet certain criteria. As of December 31, 2020, approximately $46.4 million in PPP loans held for sale on our consolidated balance sheet have been forgiven by the SBA. In February 2021, we began participating in the second round of the PPP program by accepting applications from certain existing Square customers who received a loan in the spring of 2020. Similar to the loans issued in the first round of PPP, the loans are guaranteed by the U.S. government and will be eligible for forgiveness if the borrowers meet certain criteria.\nOn June 2, 2020, we entered into the Paycheck Protection Program Liquidity Facility agreement with the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco ( First PPPLF Agreement\u201d) to secure additional credit in an aggregate principal amount of up to $500.0 million. The program was established by the Federal Reserve to supplement the SBA's PPP to support the economy in response to the COVID-19 crisis. The facility is intended to bolster the effectiveness of the PPP and provide liquidity to credit markets, helping to stabilize financial institutions supporting COVID-19 relief efforts. Borrowings under the facility accrue interest at a rate of 0.35% and advances must be collateralized with loans originated under the PPP. The maturity date of any PPPLF advance will be the maturity date of the PPP loan pledged to secure the advance, and will be accelerated upon the occurrence of certain events of default. The advances under this facility are also repayable if the associated PPP loans are forgiven, repaid by the customer, or settled by the government guarantee. As of December 31, 2020, $464.1 million of PPPLF advances were outstanding and collateralized by the same value of the PPP loans held for sale on our consolidated balance sheet. On January 29, 2021, we entered into a second PPPLF agreement with the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco ( Second PPPLF Agreement\u201d and together with the First PPPLF Agreement, PPPLF Agreements\u201d) to secure additional credit, collateralized by loans from the second round of the PPP program, in an aggregate principal amount of up to $1.0 billion under both PPPLF Agreements.\nOn March 5, 2020, we issued $1.0 billion in aggregate principal amount of convertible senior notes that mature on March 1, 2025 (2025 Notes), unless earlier converted or repurchased pursuant to their terms, and bear interest at a rate of 0.1250% payable semi-annually on March 1 and September 1 of each year. On November 13, 2020, we issued an aggregate principal amount of $1.150 billion of convertible senior notes comprised of $575 million of convertible senior notes that mature on May 1, 2026 (2026 Notes) with a 0.0% coupon interest rate, and $575 million of convertible senior notes that mature on November 1, 2027 (2027 Notes) with a 0.25% coupon interest rate. The 2026 Notes and 2027 Notes will mature on each of its respective dates, unless earlier converted or repurchased. The 2027 Notes will bear interest at a rate of 0.25% payable semi-annually on May 1 and November 1 of each year beginning on May 1, 2021. We intend to use the net proceeds from our 2025, 2026 and 2027 Notes offerings for general corporate purposes, which may include capital expenditures, investments, working capital, and potential acquisitions and strategic transactions.\nImpact of COVID-19 on Current Trends and Outlook\nBy March 2020, the World Health Organization declared the COVID-19 pandemic a global pandemic following which, many local governments issued various mandates and public health guidelines requiring the closure of non-essential businesses and the curtailing of all unnecessary travel. These orders also required individuals to comply with various shelter-in-place and social distancing orders. As a result, the vast majority of our customers in those affected areas experienced a significant decline in sales in the first half of 2020. In the second half of 2020, as some shelter-in-place orders were relaxed, we saw modest improvements in certain areas including positive growth from higher priced card-not-present transactions as sellers adapted their businesses to contactless commerce, new sellers that joined Square, and the positive impact of various government assistance programs that led to an increase in consumer spending. However, Seller GPV trends have continued to vary by region and depended on regional shelter-in-place restrictions and COVID-19 guidelines. We also experienced an increase in Cash App engagement as a result of customer adoption of multiple products and the deposit of government stimulus funds and unemployment benefits into Cash App customer accounts.\nIn response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we took measures to assist our customers that we believed were in the best interests of our sellers in the long term, including refunding software subscription fees during the months of March and April 2020 as well as introducing options for sellers to temporarily pause and resume their subscriptions. While we continue to actively monitor the worldwide spread of COVID-19, the extent to which COVID-19 will ultimately impact our business remains difficult to predict. Growth trends continued to vary by region, product, and vertical, depending primarily on differences in the timing and phases of reopenings, which we expect will have a significant impact on overall GPV trends. Our priority remains the safety of our employees, customers and the communities in which we live and operate. We continue to remain in close and regular contact with our employees, customers, business partners and communities to help navigate these challenging times.\nAreas in which we continuously evaluate the potential impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our financial statements, include, and are not limited to, accrued transaction losses and fair value of loans, and to a lesser extent, the impairment of goodwill and intangible assets, impairment of long-lived assets including operating lease right-of-use assets, and property and equipment. We have concluded that our goodwill and other long lived assets are not impaired as of December 31, 2020. We continue to revise our estimates and assumptions to reflect any changes in transaction and loan losses in our financial statements. Where applicable, we have incorporated judgments and estimates of the expected impact of COVID-19 in the preparation of the financial statements based on information currently available. These judgments and estimates are subject to change, as new developments occur and additional information is obtained and are recognized in the consolidated financial statements as they become known.\nComponents of Results of Operations\nRevenue\nTransaction-based revenue. We charge our sellers a transaction fee that is generally calculated based on a percentage of the total transaction amount processed. We also selectively offer custom pricing for certain larger sellers. Transaction-based revenue also includes amounts we charge our Cash App customers for peer-to-peer transactions to business accounts and payments sent from a credit card.\nSubscription and services-based revenue. Revenue from Cash App, Square Capital, and Instant Transfers for sellers currently comprise the majority of our subscription and services-based revenue. Cash App subscription and services-based revenue is primarily comprised of transaction fees from both Cash App Instant Deposit and Cash Card. Our other subscription and services-based products include website hosting and domain name registration services, Gift Cards, Square Appointments, Customer Engagement, Employee Management, Payroll, Square Card, and other product offerings. Prior to 2020, subscriptions and services-based revenue also included revenue generated from Caviar, a food ordering and delivery platform that we sold in the fourth quarter of 2019.\nInstant Deposit is a functionality within the Cash App and our managed payment solutions that enables customers to instantly deposit funds into their bank accounts, while Cash Card offers Cash App customers the ability use their stored funds via a Visa prepaid card that is linked to the balance the customer stores in Cash App. We charge a per transaction fee which we recognize as revenue when customers instantly deposit funds to their bank account, use their Cash Card to make a purchase, or withdraw funds.\nSquare Capital facilitates loans to sellers that are offered through a partnership bank and are generally repaid through withholding a percentage of the collections of the seller's receivables processed by us. We also facilitate loans to the customers of certain sellers as well as to the sellers of its partners who do not process payments with us. The loans are generally originated by a bank partner, from whom we purchase the loans obtaining all rights, title, and interest. Our intention is to sell the rights, title, and interest in certain loans to third-party investors for an upfront fee when the loans are sold. We are retained by the third-party investors to service the loans and earn a servicing fee for facilitating the repayment of these receivables through our payments solutions. In April 2020, Square Capital was licensed to participate in the Paycheck Protection Program ( PPP\u201d) administered by the Small Business Administration. These loans are guaranteed by the U.S. government and are eligible for forgiveness if the borrowers meet certain criteria.\nHardware revenue. Hardware revenue includes revenue from sales of contactless and chip readers, Square Stand, Square Register, Square Terminal, and third-party peripherals. Third-party peripherals include cash drawers, receipt printers, and barcode scanners, all of which can be integrated with Square Stand, Square Register, or Square Terminal to provide a comprehensive point-of-sale solution.\nBitcoin revenue. Our Cash App customers have the ability to purchase bitcoin, a cryptocurrency. We recognize revenue when customers purchase bitcoin and it is transferred to the customer's account. We purchase bitcoin from private broker dealers or from Cash App customers and apply a small margin before selling it to our customers. The sale amounts received from our customers are recorded as revenue on a gross basis and the associated bitcoin cost as cost of revenues, as we are the principal in the bitcoin sale transaction. We have determined we are the principal because we control the bitcoin before delivery to the customer, we are primarily responsible for the delivery of the bitcoin to the customer, we are exposed\nto risks arising from fluctuations of the market price of bitcoin before delivery to the customer, and we have discretion in setting prices charged to the customer. Bitcoin revenue may fluctuate as a result of changes in customer demand or the market price of bitcoin.\nCost of Revenue and Gross Margin\nTransaction-based costs. Transaction-based costs consist primarily of interchange and assessment fees, processing fees, and bank settlement fees paid to third-party payment processors and financial institutions.\nSubscription and services-based costs. Subscription and services-based costs consist primarily of costs related to Cash App including Instant Deposit and Cash Card as well as Instant Transfer for sellers. Caviar costs were also a significant component of the subscription and services-based costs, prior to the sale of Caviar on October 31, 2019.\nHardware costs. Hardware costs consist primarily of product costs associated with contactless and chip readers, Square Terminal, Square Stand, Square Register, and third-party peripherals. Product costs include manufacturing-related overhead and personnel costs, certain royalties, packaging, and fulfillment costs. Hardware is sold primarily as a means to grow our transaction-based revenue and, as a result, generating positive gross margins from hardware sales is not the primary goal of the hardware business.\nBitcoin costs. Bitcoin cost of revenue is comprised of the amounts we pay to purchase bitcoin, which will fluctuate in line with the price of bitcoin in the market. We purchase bitcoin to facilitate customers' access to bitcoin.\nAmortization of acquired technology. These costs consist of amortization related to technologies acquired through acquisitions. These amounts were not material to our financial statements.\nOperating Expenses\nOperating expenses consist of product development, sales and marketing, general and administrative expenses, transaction and loan losses, and amortization of acquired customer assets. For product development and general and administrative expenses, the largest single component is personnel-related expenses, including salaries, commissions and bonuses, employee benefit costs, and share-based compensation. In the case of sales and marketing expenses, a significant portion is related to the Cash App peer-to-peer transactions and Cash Card issuance costs, in addition to paid advertising and personnel-related expenses. Operating expenses also include allocated overhead costs for facilities, human resources, and IT.\nProduct development. Product development expenses currently represent the largest component of our operating expenses and consist primarily of expenses related to our engineering, data science, and design personnel; fees and supply costs related to maintenance at third-party data center facilities; hardware related development and tooling costs; and fees for software licenses, consulting, legal, and other services that are directly related to growing and maintaining our portfolio of products and services. Additionally, product development expenses include the depreciation of product-related infrastructure and tools, including data center equipment, internally developed software, and computer equipment. We continue to focus our product development efforts on adding new features and apps, and on enhancing the functionality and ease of use of our offerings. Our ability to realize returns on these investments is substantially dependent upon our ability to successfully address current and emerging requirements of sellers, buyers, and customers through the development and introduction of these new products and services.\nSales and marketing. Sales and marketing expenses are aggregated into two main components. The first component consists of traditional advertising costs incurred such as direct sales expense, account management, local and product marketing, retail and e-commerce, partnerships, and communications personnel. The second component of sales and marketing expense consists of costs incurred for services, incentives and other costs that are not directly related to revenue generating transactions that we consider to be marketing costs to encourage the usage of Cash App. These expenses include, but are not limited to, Cash App peer-to-peer processing costs and transaction losses, card issuance costs, customer referral bonuses, and promotional giveaways that are expensed as incurred.\nGeneral and administrative. General and administrative expenses consist primarily of expenses related to our customer support, finance, legal, risk operations, human resources, and administrative personnel. General and administrative expenses also include costs related to fees paid for professional services, including legal, tax, and accounting services.\nTransaction and loan losses. We are exposed to transaction losses due to chargebacks as a result of fraud or uncollectibility. We incur loan losses whenever the amortized cost of loans that have been retained exceeds their fair value.\nTransaction losses include chargebacks for unauthorized credit card use and inability to collect on disputes between buyers and sellers over the delivery of goods or services, as well as losses on Cash App activity related to peer-to-peer payments sent from a credit card, Cash for Business, and Cash Card. We base our reserve estimates on prior chargeback history and current period data points indicative of transaction loss. We reflect additions to the reserve in current operating results, while realized losses are offset against the reserve. The establishment of appropriate reserves for transaction losses is an inherently uncertain process, and ultimate losses may vary from the current estimates. We regularly update our reserve estimates as new facts become known and events occur that may affect the settlement or recovery of losses.\nLoan losses are recorded at the lower of amortized cost or fair value determined on an individual loan basis. To determine the fair value the Company utilizes industry-standard valuation modeling, such as discounted cash flow models, taking into account the estimated timing and amounts of periodic repayments. The Company recognizes a charge whenever the amortized cost of a loan exceeds its fair value, with such charges being reversed for subsequent increases in fair value, but only to the extent that such reversals do not result in the amortized cost of a loan exceeding its fair value.\nAmortization of acquired customer assets. Amortization of acquired customer assets includes customer relationships, restaurant relationships, courier relationships, subscriber relationships, and partner relationships. These amounts were not material to our financial statements.\nGain on sale of asset group\nGain on sale of asset group in 2019 represents the excess of the consideration received from the disposal of the Caviar business less the carrying values of the net assets sold.\nInterest and Other Income and Expense, net\nInterest and other income and expense, net consists primarily of gains or losses arising from marking to market of equity investments, interest expense related to our long-term debt, interest income on our investment in marketable debt securities, and foreign currency-related gains and losses.\nProvision for Income Taxes\nThe provision for income taxes consists primarily of federal, state, local, and foreign tax. Our effective tax rate fluctuates from period to period due to changes in the mix of income and losses in jurisdictions with a wide range of tax rates, the effect of acquisitions, changes resulting from the amount of recorded valuation allowance, permanent differences between U.S. generally accepted accounting principles and local tax laws, certain one-time items, and changes in tax contingencies.\nResults of Operations\nRevenue (in thousands, except for percentages)\nTable 13: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Year Ended December 31, </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>$ Change </td> <td> </td> <td>% Change </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Transaction-based revenue </td> <td>$ </td> <td>3,294,978 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>3,081,074 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>213,904 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>7 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Subscription and services-based revenue </td> <td>1,539,403 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,031,456 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>507,947 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>49 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Hardware revenue </td> <td>91,654 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>84,505 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>7,149 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>8 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Bitcoin revenue </td> <td>4,571,543 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>516,465 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4,055,078 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>785 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total net revenue </td> <td>$ </td> <td>9,497,578 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>4,713,500 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>4,784,078 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>101 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTotal net revenue for the year ended December 31, 2020, increased by $4.8 billion, or 101%, compared to the year ended December 31, 2019. Bitcoin revenue increased by $4.1 billion, and represented 85% of the increase in total net revenue. Excluding bitcoin revenue, total net revenue increased by $729.0 million, or 17%, in the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to the year ended December 31, 2019.\nTransaction-based revenue for the year ended December 31, 2020 increased by $213.9 million or 7%, compared to the year ended December 31, 2019. This increase was in line with the increase in GPV of 6% for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase was primarily attributable to and affected by the following events and factors:\n\u2022In January and February of 2020, we benefited from the growth in payment volume processed by existing sellers, in addition to meaningful contributions from new sellers, compared to the same period in the prior year, which included a benefit from the impact of the leap year;\n\u2022In the second half of March through mid-April, 2020, as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and subsequent shelter-in-place restrictions, we experienced a significant decline in transaction-based revenue, with GPV generated by our Seller business decreasing compared to the prior year;\n\u2022Beginning in mid-April 2020, we started to experience improving trends in GPV generated by our Seller business, as some states started to relax shelter-in-place measures, sellers adapted their businesses to contactless commerce, new sellers joined Square and various government assistance programs led to an increase in consumer spending;\n\u2022In the third and fourth quarters of 2020, we have experienced positive growth of GPV and revenue compared to the third and fourth quarters of 2019, primarily driven by higher priced card-not-present transactions as sellers continued to shift their businesses to adapt to the COVID-19 pandemic.\nDespite the decrease in transaction-based revenue as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, the overall increase in transaction-based revenue for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the same period in 2019 was primarily driven by growth in higher-priced card-not-present transactions as sellers shifted their businesses to adapt to the COVID-19 pandemic, and the impact from our November 2019 card-present price change, as well as Cash App GPV which includes Cash for Business and peer-to-peer payments sent from a credit card. Cash for Business activity includes peer-to-peer transactions to business accounts using Cash App. The factors and events above had varying impacts on the GPV growth and may continue to impact our revenues in the future. In particular, card-present growth varies by region and product, depending primarily on differences in the timing and phases of reopenings, which we expect will have a significant impact on overall GPV trends.\nSubscription and services-based revenue for the year ended December 31, 2020 increased by $507.9 million or 49%, compared to the year ended December 31, 2019. On October 31, 2019, we completed the sale of the Caviar business, and, accordingly, Caviar no longer contributes to subscription and services-based revenue. Excluding Caviar, subscription and services-based revenue grew by $653.9 million, or 74%, in the year ended year ended December 31, 2020, compared to the year ended December 31, 2019 driven predominantly by Cash App, and to a lesser extent Square Card and Instant Transfers for sellers, partially offset by a decrease in Square Capital loan volumes. Cash App subscription and services-based revenue is primarily comprised of transaction fees from both Cash App Instant Deposit and Cash Card, with a small portion generated from interest earned on customer funds. In an effort to support our sellers, we temporarily suspended charging customers\nsoftware subscription fees and refunded fees collected in March and April 2020. We resumed charging such fees in May 2020. Square Capital, which has historically been a significant component of the subscriptions and services revenue, suspended facilitating loans to sellers, other than PPP loans, in March 2020 but resumed facilitating such loans at the end of July 2020. Loan volumes remain lower than in 2019, and there is substantial uncertainty about when loan volumes will return to pre-COVID-19 levels.\nHardware revenue for the year ended December 31, 2020 increased by $7.1 million or 8%, compared to the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase was primarily a result of an increase in sales of hardware in our international markets, as well as sales of contactless hardware as a result of certain promotions offered in the second and third quarter of 2020.\nBitcoin revenue for the year ended December 31, 2020 increased by $4.1 billion or 785% compared to the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase was due to the market price of bitcoin, growth in the number of active bitcoin customers, as well as volume per customer. The amount of bitcoin revenue recognized will fluctuate depending on customer demand as well as changes in the market price of bitcoin. During the year ended December 31, 2020, we saw a significant growth in bitcoin revenue as compared to the year ended December 31, 2019. While bitcoin contributed 48% of the total revenue in 2020, and 85% of the increase in revenues in 2020, gross margin generated from bitcoin was only 3.5% of the total gross margin.\nCost of Revenue (in thousands, except for percentages)\nTable 14: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Year Ended December 31, </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>$ Change </td> <td> </td> <td>% Change </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Transaction-based costs </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,911,848 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,937,971 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(26,123) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(1) </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Subscription and services-based costs </td> <td>222,712 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>234,270 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(11,558) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(5) </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Hardware costs </td> <td>143,901 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>136,385 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>7,516 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Bitcoin costs </td> <td>4,474,534 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>508,239 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3,966,295 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>780 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Amortization of acquired technology </td> <td>11,174 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6,950 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4,224 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>61 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total cost of revenue </td> <td>$ </td> <td>6,764,169 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2,823,815 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>3,940,354 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>140 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTotal cost of revenue for the year ended December 31, 2020, increased by $3.9 billion, or 140%, compared to the year ended December 31, 2019. Bitcoin costs of revenue increased by $4.0 billion, and represented 101% of the increase in the total cost of revenue. Excluding bitcoin costs of revenue, total cost of revenue decreased by approximately $25.9 million, or 1%, in the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to the year ended December 31, 2019.\nDespite an increase in GPV of 6% for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to the year ended December 31, 2019, transaction-based costs decreased by $26.1 million or 1% for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to the year ended December 31, 2019. The decrease in transaction-based costs in the year ended December 31, 2020 was primarily attributable to growth in debit card transactions and increase in average transaction sizes, which lowered the average cost per transaction, partially offset by the increase in GPV. We recognize that the recent shifts in the percentage of debit card transactions, proportion of card-not-present volumes, and average value per transaction size relative to historical periods are in part, a result of changes to consumer behaviors related to COVID-19, which may not continue in future quarters.\nSubscription and services-based costs for the year ended December 31, 2020 decreased by $11.6 million or 5% compared to the year ended December 31, 2019, primarily as a result of the sale of the Caviar business on October 31, 2019. Caviar contributed approximately 45% total subscription and services-based costs in year ended December 31, 2019. Excluding Caviar, subscription and services-based costs increased by $92.7 million or 71%, in the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to the year ended December 31, 2019, driven mainly by growth in costs associated with Cash Card and Instant Deposit.\nHardware costs for the year ended December 31, 2020 increased by $7.5 million or 6%, compared to the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase was primarily due to the same drivers for the increase in hardware revenue discussed above.\nBitcoin costs for the year ended December 31, 2020 increased by $4.0 billion or 780%, compared to the year ended December 31, 2019. Bitcoin costs of revenue comprises of the total amounts we pay to purchase bitcoin, which will fluctuate in line with bitcoin revenue.\nProduct Development (in thousands, except for percentages)\nTable 15: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Year Ended December 31, </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>$ Change </td> <td> </td> <td>% Change </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Product development </td> <td>$ </td> <td>881,826 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>670,606 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>211,220 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>31 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Percentage of total net revenue </td> <td>9 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>14 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nProduct development expenses for the year ended December 31, 2020, increased by $211.2 million, or 31%, compared to the year ended December 31, 2019, due primarily to the following:\n\u2022an increase of $155.4 million in personnel costs for the year ended December 31, 2020, related to an increase in headcount among our engineering, data science, and design teams, as we continue to improve and diversify our products. The increase in personnel related costs includes an increase in share-based compensation expense of $78.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2020;\n\u2022an increase of $23.5 million in software and data center operating costs as a result of increased capacity needs and expansion of our cloud-based services.\nSales and Marketing (in thousands, except for percentages)\nTable 16: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Year Ended December 31, </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>$ Change </td> <td> </td> <td>% Change </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Sales and marketing </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,109,670 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>624,832 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>484,838 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>78 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Percentage of total net revenue </td> <td>12 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>13 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nSales and marketing expenses for the year ended December 31, 2020, increased by $484.8 million, or 78%, compared to the year ended December 31, 2019, primarily due to the following:\n\u2022an increase in Cash App marketing costs for the year ended December 31, 2020. The increase in Cash App marketing relates to a $355.6 million increase in processing costs and related transaction losses associated with the increased volume of activity with our Cash App peer-to-peer service, increased card issuance costs and increased incentives to customers that are not directly related to revenue generating transactions. We offer services such as stock investing, and certain Cash Card and peer-to-peer services to our Cash App customers for free, and various incentives to customers that we consider to be marketing tools to encourage the usage of Cash App. Additionally, Cash App advertising costs increased by $52.5 million;\n\u2022an increase of $29.6 million in advertising costs for our Seller Ecosystem services for the year ended December 31, 2020, primarily from increased online and television marketing campaigns;\n\u2022an increase of $28.3 million in Seller and Cash App sales and marketing personnel costs for the year ended December 31, 2020, to enable growth initiatives.

The increases were primarily due to higher interest expense related to our convertible notes as a result of the issuance of the 2025 Notes in March 2020, as well as the 2026 Notes and 2027 Notes in November 2020, in addition to a decrease in interest income earned on our investments in marketable debt securities due to lower interest rates prevailing in the market.\nOther expense (income), net was primarily driven by the amounts of gains or losses arising from the revaluation of our equity investments. In November 2020, upon DoorDash's initial public offering, the preferred shares held by the Company converted into common shares of DoorDash. As of December 31, 2020, the Company revalued this investment and recorded a gain of $276.3 million in the year ended December 31, 2020. Additionally, in the fourth quarter of 2020, we recorded a gain on investment in a privately held entity of $19.0 million based on observable prices for similar equity instruments issued by\nthe same entity. In the year ended December 31, 2019, we recorded a loss of $12.3 million on the revaluation of our equity investment Eventbrite, Inc. (\"Eventbrite\"), offset by the amortization of and realized gains on the sale of investments in marketable securities of $9.7 million, foreign exchange gains of $1.7 million, and other sources of income. In December 2019, the Company sold its entire equity investment in Eventbrite and as a result this investment will not impact the results in future periods.\nSegment Results\nSeller Results\nThe following tables provide a summary of the revenue and gross profit for our Seller segment for the year ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 (in thousands):\nTable 20: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Year Ended December 31, </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>$ Change </td> <td> </td> <td>% Change </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net revenue </td> <td>$ </td> <td>3,529,192 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>3,461,988 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>67,204 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cost of revenue </td> <td>2,021,361 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,071,561 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(50,200) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(2) </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gross profit </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,507,831 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,390,427 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>117,404 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>8 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table>\nRevenue\nRevenue for the Seller segment for the year ended December 31, 2020 increased by $67.2 million compared to the year ended December 31, 2019.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic and the subsequent shelter-in-place orders resulted in a material decline in Seller revenues in the latter half of March 2020 through mid-April 2020 due to lower GPV processed. Additionally, Square Capital suspended facilitating loans to sellers from mid-March 2020 through the end of July 2020, other than PPP loans, further negatively impacting Seller revenues. Excluding the impact of Square Capital, other Seller subscription and services-based revenue increased due to growth in software subscriptions, Instant Transfers, and Square Card. This was offset by the recovery and improvements in GPV processed from mid-April through the fourth quarter of 2020 as states started relaxing the shelter-in-place orders and businesses started to adapt to the COVID-19 pandemic. Additionally, we saw a higher percentage of card-not-present transactions from the second quarter through to the fourth quarter of 2020, which have a higher transaction price, as well as the impact of our November 2019 card-present price change. Recent increases in the percentage of debit, proportion of card-not-present volumes, and average transaction size relative to historical periods are in part a result of changes to consumer behaviors related to COVID-19, which may not continue in future quarters.\nCost of revenue\nCost of revenue for the Seller segment for the year ended December 31, 2020 decreased by $50.2 million compared to the year ended December 31, 2019. Seller costs benefited from a higher percentage of debit card transactions and increase in average value per transaction which have lower costs.\nCash App Results\nThe following tables provide a summary of the revenue and gross profit for our Cash App segment for the year ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 (in thousands):\nTable 21: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Year Ended December 31, </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>$ Change </td> <td> </td> <td>% Change </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net revenue </td> <td>$ </td> <td>5,968,386 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,105,599 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>4,862,787 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>440 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cost of revenue </td> <td>4,742,808 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>647,931 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4,094,877 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>632 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gross profit </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,225,578 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>457,668 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>767,910 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>168 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table>\nRevenue\nRevenue for the Cash App segment for the year ended December 31, 2020 increased by $4.9 billion compared to the year ended December 31, 2019. The primary drivers were growth in bitcoin revenue, and to a lesser extent, Cash App Instant Deposit, Cash Card, and Cash for Business. Bitcoin revenue increased primarily due to an increase in the number of active bitcoin customers, as well as growth in customer demand and bitcoin prices. Additionally, Cash App revenue benefited from increased numbers of transacting active Cash App customers and from disbursements of the CARES Act stimulus programs and unemployment benefits, including a portion of customers who direct deposited these payments into their Cash App accounts. Cash App revenue growth may not be sustained at the same levels in future quarters and may be impacted by the enactment of further stimulus relief and benefit programs, as well as the demand and market prices for bitcoin, amongst other factors.\nCost of revenue\nCost of revenue for the Cash App segment for the year ended December 31, 2020 increased by $4.1 billion compared to the year ended December 31, 2019. The primary drivers for the increase were growth in bitcoin revenue, and to a lesser extent, Cash App Instant Deposit, Cash Card, and Cash for Business.\nComparison of Years Ended December 31, 2019 and 2018\nFor a discussion of the 2019 Results of Operations, including a discussion of the financial results for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2019 compared to the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018, refer to Part I, Item 7 of our Form 10-K filed with the SEC on February 26, 2020.\nQuarterly Results of Operations\nThe following tables set forth selected unaudited quarterly statements of operations data for the last eight quarters.

</tr>\n</table>\nQuarterly Trends\nTransaction-based revenue is highly correlated with the level of GPV generated by sellers using our managed payments services. The increase in transaction-based revenue in 2020 was primarily attributable to and affected by the COVID-19 pandemic and subsequent shelter in place orders as discussed in more detail under results of operations.\nSubscription and services-based revenue generally demonstrates less seasonality than transaction-based revenue. The sequential increases were primarily driven by continued growth of Cash App which has benefited from increased engagement by customers as well as an increase from government stimulus funds deposited into customer accounts. On October 31, 2019, we completed the sale of the Caviar business, and accordingly we will no longer recognize any revenue from Caviar.\nBitcoin revenue comprises the total sale amount we receive from bitcoin sales to customers and is recorded upon transfer of bitcoin to the customer's account. The sale amount generally includes a small margin added to the price we pay to purchase bitcoin and accordingly, the amount of bitcoin revenue will fluctuate depending on the volatility of market bitcoin prices and customer demand. We saw unprecedented growth in bitcoin revenues in the second and third quarter of 2020. Various factors impact customer demand and as such, the recent periods' performance may not be indicative of future quarters.\nChanges in product development expenses primarily reflect the timing of additions of engineering, product, and design personnel. To a lesser extent, they also reflect the timing of fees and supply costs related to maintenance and capacity\nexpansion at third-party data center facilities, development and tooling costs related to the design, testing, and shipping of our hardware products, and fees for software licenses, consulting, legal, and other services that are directly related to growing and maintaining our products and services.\nChanges in sales and marketing expenses reflect the variable nature of the timing and magnitude of paid marketing and customer acquisition initiatives across our advertising channels. Changes in sales and marketing expenses are also affected by the timing of additions of direct sales, account management, local, product and paid marketing, retail and e-commerce, partnerships, and communications personnel. Additionally, sales and marketing expenses are affected by the timing and magnitude of processing costs and transaction losses related to our Cash App peer-to-peer transfer service and Cash Card issuance costs. We offer the Cash Card and certain peer-to-peer services to our Cash App customers for free and we consider these to be marketing tools intended to encourage the usage of Cash App. We saw a substantial increase in sales and marketing expenses in the second and third quarter of 2020 associated with the increased volume of activity with our Cash App peer-to-peer service.\nChanges in general and administrative expenses primarily reflect the timing of additions of finance, legal, risk operations, human resources, and administrative personnel, as well as the timing of non income tax payments and reserves. They also reflect the timing of costs related to support personnel and systems, as well as fees paid for professional services, including legal and financial services.\nWe recorded incremental provisions for transaction and loan losses in the first quarter of 2020 for our Seller business due to the expected impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and the related subsequent shelter-in-place orders that resulted in a significant slowdown in the business of many sellers. During the second quarter of 2020, we revised and lowered our estimate of transaction loss reserves recorded in the first quarter of 2020 due to better than expected realized transaction losses. Provision for transaction losses declined during the third quarter as a result of better than expected performance, and as we released previously established risk loss provisions for the first and second quarter of 2020. During the fourth quarter of 2020, we revised and lowered our estimate of transaction loss reserves recorded in the second and third quarter of 2020 due to better than expected realized transaction losses. For loan losses, during the second quarter of 2020, we noted improvements in our sellers as some states started reopening and relaxing the shelter-in place measures and have accordingly adjusted the provisions for loan losses. Additionally, other than PPP loans, we suspended offers for new loans in the second quarter of 2020 which contributed to the decrease in loan losses. During the third and fourth quarters of 2020, we continued to experience loan losses in line with the second quarter provisions for loan losses. Provisions for transaction losses increased approximately 106% in the fourth quarter of 2020, compared to the fourth quarter of 2019.\nGain on sale of asset group represents the net gain we made on the sale of the Caviar business in the fourth quarter of 2019.\nChanges in interest expense (income), net are driven by interest expense related to our convertible notes and interest income earned on our investment in marketable debt securities.\nChanges in other expense (income), net was primarily due to gains or losses arising from revaluation of our publicly traded and privately held equity investments. In the fourth quarter of 2020, we recorded a gain from the revaluation of our DoorDash investment as a result of its initial public offering in December 2020, as well as a gain in the fourth quarter of 2020 due to the revaluation of our investment in a privately held entity. In 2019, we recorded losses in the mark to market revaluation of our Eventbrite investment. In December 2019, the Company sold the investment in Eventbrite and as a result will not be impacted by mark to market revaluations related to this investment in future periods. To a lesser extent this balance is also impacted by foreign exchange gains or losses.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nThe uncertainty caused by the COVID-19 pandemic continues both in the United States and globally, with the duration and severity of the pandemic and the overall impact on consumer demand and overall economy still unknown. We are unable to forecast the full impact on our business; however, this represents a known area of uncertainty and we continue to expect the COVID-19 pandemic and its related economic disruption may have a material impact on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. We continue to evaluate our investment plans and discretionary expenditures and will make adjustments accordingly.\nAs of December 31, 2020, we had approximately $4.9 billion in available funds, including undrawn amounts available under our revolving credit facility, as described in Note 13, Indebtedness, of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. We intend to continue focusing on our long-term business initiatives and believe that our available funds are sufficient to meet our liquidity needs for the foreseeable future. We are carefully monitoring and managing our cash position in light of ongoing conditions and levels of operations.\nThe following table summarizes our cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash, and investments in marketable debt securities (in thousands):\nLiquidity Sources\nTable 27: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Year Ended December 31, </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cash and cash equivalents </td> <td>$ </td> <td>3,158,058 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,047,118 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Short-term restricted cash </td> <td>30,279 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>38,873 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Long-term restricted cash </td> <td>13,526 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>12,715 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash </td> <td>3,201,863 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,098,706 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Investments in short-term debt securities </td> <td>695,112 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>492,456 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Investments in long-term debt securities </td> <td>463,950 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>537,303 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash and investments in marketable debt securities </td> <td>$ </td> <td>4,360,925 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2,128,465 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nOur principal sources of liquidity are our cash and cash equivalents, and investments in marketable debt securities. As of December 31, 2020, we had $4.4 billion of cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash and investments in marketable debt securities, which were held primarily in cash deposits, money market funds, U.S. government and agency securities, commercial paper, and corporate bonds. We consider all highly liquid investments with an original maturity of three months or less when purchased to be cash equivalents. Our investments in marketable debt securities are classified as available-for-sale. From time to time, we have raised capital by issuing equity, equity-linked, or debt securities such as our convertible senior notes.\nAs of December 31, 2020, we held $3.0 billion in aggregate principal amount of convertible senior notes, comprised of $8.5 million in aggregate principal amount of outstanding convertible senior notes that mature on March 1, 2022 (2022 Notes), $862.5 million in aggregate principal amount of convertible senior notes that mature on May 15, 2023 (2023 Notes), $1.0 billion in aggregate amount of convertible senior notes that mature on March 1, 2025 (2025 Notes), and $575.0 million and $575.0 million in aggregate amount of convertible senior notes that mature on May 1, 2026, and November 1, 2027, respectively (2026 and 2027 Notes). The 2022 Notes bear interest at a rate of 0.375% payable semi-annually on March 1 and September 1 of each year, while the 2023 Notes bear interest at a rate of 0.50% payable semi-annually on May 15 and November 15 of each year, and the 2025 Notes bear interest at a rate of 0.125% payable semi-annually on March 1 and September 1 of each year. The 2026 Notes bear no interest, whereas, the 2027 notes bear interest at a rate of 0.25% payable semi-annually on May 1 and November 1 of each year. These notes can be converted or repurchased prior to maturity if certain conditions are met.\nWe purchased $50 million in bitcoin in October 2020 and another $170 million in February 2021, as we believe cryptocurrency is an instrument of economic empowerment that aligns with our corporate purpose. We expect to hold these investments for the long term but will continue to reassess our investment in bitcoin relative to our balance sheet. As bitcoin is considered an indefinite lived intangible asset, under the accounting policy for such assets we will be required to recognize\nany decreases in market prices below cost as an impairment charge, with any mark up in value prohibited if the market price of bitcoin subsequently increases.\nIn September 2020, we announced our intent to invest $100 million in supporting underserved communities, particularly, racial and ethnic minority groups who have been disproportionately affected by COVID-19. This initiative further deepens our commitment toward economic empowerment to help broaden such communities' access to financial services.\nIn June 2020, we entered into the Paycheck Protection Program Liquidity Facility agreement with the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco (\"First PPPLF Agreement\") to secure additional credit collateralized by PPP loans. As of December 31, 2020, $464.1 million of PPPLF advances were outstanding and collateralized by the same value of PPP loans. The advances under this facility are repayable if the associated PPP loans are forgiven, repaid by a customer or settled by the government guarantee. As of February 23, 2021, approximately $376.3 million of PPPLF advances were outstanding and collateralized by the same value of the PPP loans. On January 29, 2021, we entered into a Second PPPLF Agreement with the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco to secure additional credit, collateralized by loans from the second round of the PPP program, in an aggregate principal amount of up to $1.0 billion under both PPPLF Agreements.\nIn May 2020, we entered into a new revolving credit agreement with certain lenders, which provides a $500 million senior unsecured revolving credit facility (the \"2020 Credit Facility\") maturing in May 2023. Loans under the 2020 Credit Facility bear interest at our option of (i) a base rate based on the highest of the prime rate, the federal funds rate plus 0.50%, and the adjusted LIBOR rate plus 1.00%, in each case, plus a margin ranging from 0.25% to 0.75% or (ii) an adjusted LIBOR rate plus a margin ranging from 1.25% to 1.75%. The margin is determined based on our total net leverage ratio, as defined in the agreement. We are obligated to pay other customary fees for a credit facility of this size and type including an unused commitment fee of 0.15%. To date, no funds have been drawn and no letters of credit have been issued under the 2020 Credit Facility.\nSee Note 13, Indebtedness, of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more details on these transactions.\nWe believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents, investment in marketable debt securities, and availability under our line of credit will be sufficient to meet our working capital needs, including any expenditures related to strategic transactions and investment commitments that we may from time to time enter into, and planned capital expenditures for at least the next 12 months. From time to time, we may seek to raise additional capital through equity, equity-linked, and debt financing arrangements. We cannot provide assurance that any additional financing will be available to us on acceptable terms or at all.\nShort-term restricted cash of $30.3 million as of December 31, 2020 reflects pledged cash deposited into savings accounts at the financial institutions that process our sellers' payments transactions and as collateral pursuant to an agreement with the originating bank for the Company's Square Capital loan product. We use the restricted cash to secure letters of credit with these financial institutions to provide collateral for liabilities arising from cash flow timing differences in the processing of these payments. We have recorded this amount as a current asset on our consolidated balance sheets given the short-term nature of these cash flow timing differences and that there is no minimum time frame during which the cash must remain restricted. Additionally, this balance includes certain amounts held as collateral pursuant to multi-year lease agreements, discussed in the paragraph below, which we expect to become unrestricted within the next year.\nLong-term restricted cash of $13.5 million as of December 31, 2020 is primarily related to cash deposited into money market funds that is used as collateral pursuant to multi-year lease agreements. The Company has recorded this amount as a non-current asset on the consolidated balance sheets as the lease terms extend beyond one year.\nWe experience significant day-to-day fluctuations in our cash and cash equivalents, due to fluctuations in settlements receivable, and customers payable, and hence working capital. These fluctuations are primarily due to:\n\u2022Timing of period end. For periods that end on a weekend or a bank holiday, our cash and cash equivalents, settlements receivable, and customers payable balances typically will be higher than for periods ending on a weekday, as we settle to our sellers for payment processing activity on business days; and\n\u2022Fluctuations in daily GPV. When daily GPV increases, our cash and cash equivalents, settlements receivable, and customers payable amounts increase. Typically our settlements receivable, and customers payable balances at period end represent one to four days of receivables and disbursements to be made in the subsequent period. Customers payable, excluding amounts attributable to Cash App stored funds, and settlements receivable balances typically move in tandem, as pay-out and pay-in largely occur on the same business day. However, customers payable balances will be greater in amount than settlements receivable balances due to the fact that a subset of funds are held due to unlinked bank accounts, risk holds, and chargebacks. Also, customer funds obligations, which are included in customers payable, may cause customers payable to trend differently than settlements receivable. Holidays and day-of-week may also cause significant volatility in daily GPV amounts.\nCash Flow Activities\nThe following table summarizes our cash flow activities (in thousands):\nTable 28: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Year Ended December 31, </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash provided by operating activities </td> <td>$ </td> <td>381,603 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>465,699 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash provided by (used in) investing activities: </td> <td>(606,636) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>95,193 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash provided by (used in) financing activities </td> <td>2,315,195 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(98,874) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Effect of foreign exchange rate on cash and cash equivalents </td> <td>12,995 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3,841 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net increase in cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2,103,157 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>465,859 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nCash Flows from Operating Activities\nCash provided by operating activities consisted of net loss adjusted for certain non-cash items including gain or loss on revaluation of equity investments, depreciation and amortization, non-cash interest and other expense, share-based compensation expense, transaction and loan losses, deferred income taxes, non-cash lease expense, gain on sale of asset group, as well as the effect of changes in operating assets and liabilities, including working capital.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2020, cash provided by operating activities was $381.6 million, primarily due to a net income of $213.1 million, offset by PPP loans facilitated, less loans sold, of $420.8 million, adjusted for the add back of non-cash expenses of $509.4 million consisting primarily of share-based compensation, transaction and loan losses, depreciation and amortization, and non-cash interest and other expenses. Whereas the increase in transaction and loan losses was largely caused by estimated losses attributable to the COVID-19 pandemic, the increase in other non-cash expenses was primarily due to the growth and expansion of our business activities. Additionally, the cash generated from operating activities increased due to a net inflow from changes in other assets and liabilities of $79.9 million due to timing.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2019, cash provided by operating activities was $465.7 million primarily due to a net income of $375.4 million, adjusted for the add back of non-cash expenses of $574.5 million consisting primarily of share-based compensation, transaction and loan losses, depreciation and amortization, and non-cash interest and other expenses largely driven by growth and expansion of our business activities, offset in part by the gain on sale of Caviar of $373.4 million in the fourth quarter. The cash generated from operating activities was negatively affected by a net outflow from changes in other assets and liabilities of $110.8 million.\nCash Flows from Investing Activities\nCash flows used in investing activities primarily relate to capital expenditures to support our growth, investments in marketable debt securities, investment in privately held entity, and business acquisitions.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2020, cash used in investing activities was $606.6 million, primarily due to the net investments of marketable securities including investments from customer funds of $337.7 million. Additional uses of cash were as a result of the purchase of property and equipment of $138.4 million, business acquisitions, net of cash acquired of\n$79.2 million and purchases of other investments of $51.3 million.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2019, cash provided by investing activities was $95.2 million, primarily as a result of the net cash proceeds from sale of asset group of $309.3 million related to the sale of the Caviar business and proceeds from sale of equity investment in Eventbrite of $33.0 million, offset in part by the net investments of marketable securities including investments from customer funds of $149.0 million. Additional uses of cash in investing activities were a result of purchases of property and equipment of $62.5 million, business combinations, net of cash acquired of $20.4 million, and other investments of $15.3 million.\nCash Flows from Financing Activities\nFor the year ended December 31, 2020, cash provided by financing activities was $2.3 billion, primarily as a result of $1.08 billion in net proceeds from the 2026 and 2027 Note offering, $936.5 million in net proceeds from the 2025 Note offering, proceeds from the First PPPLF Agreement advances of $464.1 million, proceeds from issuances of common stock from the exercise of options and purchases under our employee share purchase plan of $162.0 million, offset by payments for employee tax withholding related to vesting of restricted stock units of $314.0 million.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2019, cash used in financing activities was $98.9 million, primarily as a result of payments for employee tax withholding related to vesting of restricted stock units of $212.3 million offset in part by proceeds from issuances of common stock from the exercise of options and purchases under the employee stock purchase plan, net of $118.5 million.\nContractual Obligations and Commitments\nOur principal commitments consist of convertible senior notes, liquidity facility, operating leases, capital leases, and purchase commitments.

The 2026 Notes bear no interest, whereas, the 2027 Notes bear interest at a rate of 0.25% payable semi-annually on May 1 and November 1 of each year. See Note 13, Indebtedness, of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more details on this transaction.\nOn March 5, 2020, we issued $1.0 billion in aggregate principal amount of 2025 Notes that mature on March 1, 2025, unless earlier converted or repurchased, and bear interest at a rate of 0.1250% payable semi-annually on March 1 and September 1 of each year. See Note 13, Indebtedness, of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more details on this transaction.\nOn May 25, 2018, we issued $862.5 million in aggregate principal amount of 2023 Notes that mature on May 15, 2023, unless earlier converted or repurchased, and bear interest at a rate of 0.50% payable semi-annually on May 15 and\nNovember 15 of each year. See Note 13, Indebtedness, of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more details on this transaction.\nOn March 6, 2017, we issued $440.0 million in aggregate principal amount of Notes that mature on March 1, 2022, unless earlier converted or repurchased, and bear interest at a rate of 0.375% payable semi-annually on March 1 and September 1 of each year. See Note 13, Indebtedness, of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more details on this transaction.\nPaycheck Protection Program Liquidity Facility\nOn June 2, 2020, we entered into the First PPPLF Agreement with the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco to secure additional credit in an aggregate principal amount of up to $500.0 million. Borrowings under the facility accrue interest at a rate of 0.35% and must be collateralized with loans originated under the PPP. On January 29, 2021, we entered into a second PPPLF agreement with the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco ( Second PPPLF Agreement\u201d and together with the First PPPLF Agreement, PPPLF Agreements\u201d) to secure additional credit, collateralized by loans from the second round of the PPP program, in an aggregate principal amount of up to $1.0 billion under both PPPLF Agreements. The maturity date of any PPPLF advances will be the maturity date of the PPP loan pledged to secure the advance, and will be accelerated upon the occurrence of certain events of default. Although loans originated under the PPP have a stated maturity of between two and five years from origination, some of the loans may be forgiven 24 weeks after disbursement if they meet certain specified criteria. The PPPLF advances are also repayable if the underlying PPP loan is repaid by the customer. As of December 31, 2020, $464.1 million of PPPLF advances were outstanding. As of February 23, 2021, approximately $376.3 million of PPPLF advances were outstanding and collateralized by the same value of the PPP loans. See Note 13, Indebtedness, of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more details on this transaction.\nLease Commitments\nWe have entered into various non-cancelable operating leases for certain offices with contractual lease periods expiring between 2021 and 2034. We recognized total rental expenses under operating leases of $75.2 million, $32.5 million, and $23.3 million during the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018, respectively.\nPurchase commitments\nWe had non-cancelable purchase obligations to hardware suppliers for $40.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2020.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements during the periods presented.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nOur discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. GAAP requires us to make certain estimates and judgments that affect the amounts reported in our financial statements. We base our estimates on historical experience, anticipated future trends, and other assumptions we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Because these accounting policies require significant judgment, our actual results may differ materially from our estimates.\nWe believe accounting policies and the assumptions and estimates associated with transaction and loan losses, especially due to uncertainties associated with the COVID-19 pandemic, and revenue recognition have the greatest potential effect on our consolidated financial statements. Therefore, we consider these to be our critical accounting policies and estimates.\nTransaction Losses\nWe are exposed to transaction losses due to chargebacks as a result of fraud or uncollectibility of transaction payments. We estimate accrued transaction losses based on available data as of the reporting date, including expectations of future chargebacks, and historical trends related to loss rates that is continuously adjusted for new information and incorporates, where applicable, reasonable and supportable forecasts about future expectations. During the first and second\nquarters of 2020, the Company revised its estimates to reflect expected increased chargebacks from non-delivery of goods and services as well as increased failure rates of its sellers due to the COVID-19 pandemic. During the third and fourth quarters of 2020, the Company continued to further revise its estimates for transaction losses and as a result of better than expected performance, the Company released previously established risk loss provisions for the first three quarters of 2020 amounting to $82.4 million.\nConvertible Notes\nWe account for the convertible notes as separate debt and equity components. The carrying amount of the debt component is calculated by measuring the fair value of a similar debt that does not have an associated convertible feature. The carrying amount of the equity component representing the conversion option is calculated by deducting the fair value of the debt component from the principal amount of the convertible notes as a whole. We estimated the fair value of the debt and equity components using a convertible bond model, which includes subjective assumptions such as the expected term and expected volatility. These assumptions involve inherent uncertainties and management judgement.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nSee Recent Accounting Pronouncements\u201d described in Note 1 of the Notes to our consolidated financial statements.", "item_7_text": "Item 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nYou should read the following discussion and analysis in conjunction with the information set forth under Selected Financial Data\u201d and our consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The statements in this discussion regarding our expectations of our future performance, liquidity, and capital resources; our plans, estimates, beliefs, and expectations that involve risks and uncertainties; and other non-historical statements in this discussion are forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties, including, but not limited to, the risks and uncertainties described under Risk Factors\u201d and elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Our actual results may differ materially from those contained in or implied by any forward-looking statements.\nOverview\nWe started Square in February 2009 to enable businesses (sellers) to accept card payments, an important capability that was previously inaccessible to many businesses. However, sellers need many innovative solutions to thrive, and we have expanded to provide them additional products and services and to give them access to a cohesive ecosystem of tools to help them manage and grow their businesses. Similarly, with Cash App, we have built a parallel ecosystem of financial services to help individuals manage their money.\nOur Seller ecosystem is a cohesive commerce ecosystem that helps sellers start, run and grow their businesses, and consists of over 30 distinct software, hardware, and financial services products. We monetize these products through a combination of transaction, subscription, and service fees. Our suite of cloud-based software solutions are integrated to create a seamless experience and enable a holistic view of sales, customers, employees, and locations. With our offering, a seller can accept payments in person via swipe, dip, or tap of a card or online via Square Invoices, Square Virtual Terminal, or the seller's website. We also provide hardware to facilitate commerce for sellers, which includes magstripe readers, contactless and chip readers, Square Stand, Square Register, Square Terminal, and third-party peripherals. Square Card is a business prepaid card that enables sellers to spend the balance they have stored with Square. Sellers can also deposit funds into their Square stored balance so they can manage all of their business expenses in one place. Sellers also gain access to business loans through Square Capital based on the seller's payment processing history. We recognize revenue upon the sale of the loans to third-party investors or over time as the sellers pay down the outstanding amounts for the loans that we hold as available for sale. We have grown rapidly to serve millions of sellers that represent a diverse set of industries (including services, food-related business, and retail businesses) and sizes, ranging from a single vendor at a farmers' market to multi-location businesses. Square sellers also span geographies, including the United States, Canada, Japan, Australia, and the United Kingdom.\nOur Cash App ecosystem provides financial tools for individuals to store, send, receive, spend and invest money. With Cash App, customers can fund their account with a bank account or debit card, send and receive P2P (peer-to-peer) payments, and receive direct deposit payments. Customers can make purchases with their Cash Card, a Visa prepaid card that is linked to the balance stored in Cash App. With Cash Boost, customers receive instant discounts when they make Cash Card purchases at designated merchants. Customers can also use their stored funds to buy and sell bitcoin and equity investments within Cash App. In the fourth quarter of 2020, we acquired Credit Karma Tax, which adds a tax filing product for individuals to Cash App's ecosystem which provides a seamless, mobile-first solution for individuals to file their taxes for free.\nEffective June 30, 2020, we changed from one reportable segment to two reportable segments to reflect the way management and our chief operating decision maker ( CODM\u201d) review and assess performance of the business. Our two reportable segments are Seller and Cash App. Seller includes managed payment services, software solutions, hardware and financial services products offered to sellers, while Cash App includes financial tools available to individuals such as P2P (peer-to-peer) payments, Cash Card transactions, bitcoin and stock investing.\nIn April 2020, we were licensed to participate in the Paycheck Protection Program ( PPP\u201d) administered by the Small Business Administration ( SBA\u201d) that was enacted in March 2020 under the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (\"CARES Act\") in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. The PPP is intended to provide relief to eligible businesses impacted by COVID-19, and to incentivize businesses to keep their workers on the payroll. For the year ended\nDecember 31, 2020, we facilitated the issuance of $857 million of PPP loans, excluding cancelled loans, through an external bank partner, of which we sold $399.0 million to an investor. These loans are guaranteed by the U.S. government. Additionally, the loans are eligible for forgiveness if the borrowers meet certain criteria. As of December 31, 2020, approximately $46.4 million in PPP loans held for sale on our consolidated balance sheet have been forgiven by the SBA. In February 2021, we began participating in the second round of the PPP program by accepting applications from certain existing Square customers who received a loan in the spring of 2020. Similar to the loans issued in the first round of PPP, the loans are guaranteed by the U.S. government and will be eligible for forgiveness if the borrowers meet certain criteria.\nOn June 2, 2020, we entered into the Paycheck Protection Program Liquidity Facility agreement with the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco ( First PPPLF Agreement\u201d) to secure additional credit in an aggregate principal amount of up to $500.0 million. The program was established by the Federal Reserve to supplement the SBA's PPP to support the economy in response to the COVID-19 crisis. The facility is intended to bolster the effectiveness of the PPP and provide liquidity to credit markets, helping to stabilize financial institutions supporting COVID-19 relief efforts. Borrowings under the facility accrue interest at a rate of 0.35% and advances must be collateralized with loans originated under the PPP. The maturity date of any PPPLF advance will be the maturity date of the PPP loan pledged to secure the advance, and will be accelerated upon the occurrence of certain events of default. The advances under this facility are also repayable if the associated PPP loans are forgiven, repaid by the customer, or settled by the government guarantee. As of December 31, 2020, $464.1 million of PPPLF advances were outstanding and collateralized by the same value of the PPP loans held for sale on our consolidated balance sheet. On January 29, 2021, we entered into a second PPPLF agreement with the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco ( Second PPPLF Agreement\u201d and together with the First PPPLF Agreement, PPPLF Agreements\u201d) to secure additional credit, collateralized by loans from the second round of the PPP program, in an aggregate principal amount of up to $1.0 billion under both PPPLF Agreements.\nOn March 5, 2020, we issued $1.0 billion in aggregate principal amount of convertible senior notes that mature on March 1, 2025 (2025 Notes), unless earlier converted or repurchased pursuant to their terms, and bear interest at a rate of 0.1250% payable semi-annually on March 1 and September 1 of each year. On November 13, 2020, we issued an aggregate principal amount of $1.150 billion of convertible senior notes comprised of $575 million of convertible senior notes that mature on May 1, 2026 (2026 Notes) with a 0.0% coupon interest rate, and $575 million of convertible senior notes that mature on November 1, 2027 (2027 Notes) with a 0.25% coupon interest rate. The 2026 Notes and 2027 Notes will mature on each of its respective dates, unless earlier converted or repurchased. The 2027 Notes will bear interest at a rate of 0.25% payable semi-annually on May 1 and November 1 of each year beginning on May 1, 2021. We intend to use the net proceeds from our 2025, 2026 and 2027 Notes offerings for general corporate purposes, which may include capital expenditures, investments, working capital, and potential acquisitions and strategic transactions.\nImpact of COVID-19 on Current Trends and Outlook\nBy March 2020, the World Health Organization declared the COVID-19 pandemic a global pandemic following which, many local governments issued various mandates and public health guidelines requiring the closure of non-essential businesses and the curtailing of all unnecessary travel. These orders also required individuals to comply with various shelter-in-place and social distancing orders. As a result, the vast majority of our customers in those affected areas experienced a significant decline in sales in the first half of 2020. In the second half of 2020, as some shelter-in-place orders were relaxed, we saw modest improvements in certain areas including positive growth from higher priced card-not-present transactions as sellers adapted their businesses to contactless commerce, new sellers that joined Square, and the positive impact of various government assistance programs that led to an increase in consumer spending. However, Seller GPV trends have continued to vary by region and depended on regional shelter-in-place restrictions and COVID-19 guidelines. We also experienced an increase in Cash App engagement as a result of customer adoption of multiple products and the deposit of government stimulus funds and unemployment benefits into Cash App customer accounts.\nIn response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we took measures to assist our customers that we believed were in the best interests of our sellers in the long term, including refunding software subscription fees during the months of March and April 2020 as well as introducing options for sellers to temporarily pause and resume their subscriptions. While we continue to actively monitor the worldwide spread of COVID-19, the extent to which COVID-19 will ultimately impact our business remains difficult to predict. Growth trends continued to vary by region, product, and vertical, depending primarily on differences in the timing and phases of reopenings, which we expect will have a significant impact on overall GPV trends. Our priority remains the safety of our employees, customers and the communities in which we live and operate. We continue to remain in close and regular contact with our employees, customers, business partners and communities to help navigate these challenging times.\nAreas in which we continuously evaluate the potential impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our financial statements, include, and are not limited to, accrued transaction losses and fair value of loans, and to a lesser extent, the impairment of goodwill and intangible assets, impairment of long-lived assets including operating lease right-of-use assets, and property and equipment. We have concluded that our goodwill and other long lived assets are not impaired as of December 31, 2020. We continue to revise our estimates and assumptions to reflect any changes in transaction and loan losses in our financial statements. Where applicable, we have incorporated judgments and estimates of the expected impact of COVID-19 in the preparation of the financial statements based on information currently available. These judgments and estimates are subject to change, as new developments occur and additional information is obtained and are recognized in the consolidated financial statements as they become known.\nComponents of Results of Operations\nRevenue\nTransaction-based revenue. We charge our sellers a transaction fee that is generally calculated based on a percentage of the total transaction amount processed. We also selectively offer custom pricing for certain larger sellers. Transaction-based revenue also includes amounts we charge our Cash App customers for peer-to-peer transactions to business accounts and payments sent from a credit card.\nSubscription and services-based revenue. Revenue from Cash App, Square Capital, and Instant Transfers for sellers currently comprise the majority of our subscription and services-based revenue. Cash App subscription and services-based revenue is primarily comprised of transaction fees from both Cash App Instant Deposit and Cash Card. Our other subscription and services-based products include website hosting and domain name registration services, Gift Cards, Square Appointments, Customer Engagement, Employee Management, Payroll, Square Card, and other product offerings. Prior to 2020, subscriptions and services-based revenue also included revenue generated from Caviar, a food ordering and delivery platform that we sold in the fourth quarter of 2019.\nInstant Deposit is a functionality within the Cash App and our managed payment solutions that enables customers to instantly deposit funds into their bank accounts, while Cash Card offers Cash App customers the ability use their stored funds via a Visa prepaid card that is linked to the balance the customer stores in Cash App. We charge a per transaction fee which we recognize as revenue when customers instantly deposit funds to their bank account, use their Cash Card to make a purchase, or withdraw funds.\nSquare Capital facilitates loans to sellers that are offered through a partnership bank and are generally repaid through withholding a percentage of the collections of the seller's receivables processed by us. We also facilitate loans to the customers of certain sellers as well as to the sellers of its partners who do not process payments with us. The loans are generally originated by a bank partner, from whom we purchase the loans obtaining all rights, title, and interest. Our intention is to sell the rights, title, and interest in certain loans to third-party investors for an upfront fee when the loans are sold. We are retained by the third-party investors to service the loans and earn a servicing fee for facilitating the repayment of these receivables through our payments solutions. In April 2020, Square Capital was licensed to participate in the Paycheck Protection Program ( PPP\u201d) administered by the Small Business Administration. These loans are guaranteed by the U.S. government and are eligible for forgiveness if the borrowers meet certain criteria.\nHardware revenue. Hardware revenue includes revenue from sales of contactless and chip readers, Square Stand, Square Register, Square Terminal, and third-party peripherals. Third-party peripherals include cash drawers, receipt printers, and barcode scanners, all of which can be integrated with Square Stand, Square Register, or Square Terminal to provide a comprehensive point-of-sale solution.\nBitcoin revenue. Our Cash App customers have the ability to purchase bitcoin, a cryptocurrency. We recognize revenue when customers purchase bitcoin and it is transferred to the customer's account. We purchase bitcoin from private broker dealers or from Cash App customers and apply a small margin before selling it to our customers. The sale amounts received from our customers are recorded as revenue on a gross basis and the associated bitcoin cost as cost of revenues, as we are the principal in the bitcoin sale transaction. We have determined we are the principal because we control the bitcoin before delivery to the customer, we are primarily responsible for the delivery of the bitcoin to the customer, we are exposed\nto risks arising from fluctuations of the market price of bitcoin before delivery to the customer, and we have discretion in setting prices charged to the customer. Bitcoin revenue may fluctuate as a result of changes in customer demand or the market price of bitcoin.\nCost of Revenue and Gross Margin\nTransaction-based costs. Transaction-based costs consist primarily of interchange and assessment fees, processing fees, and bank settlement fees paid to third-party payment processors and financial institutions.\nSubscription and services-based costs. Subscription and services-based costs consist primarily of costs related to Cash App including Instant Deposit and Cash Card as well as Instant Transfer for sellers. Caviar costs were also a significant component of the subscription and services-based costs, prior to the sale of Caviar on October 31, 2019.\nHardware costs. Hardware costs consist primarily of product costs associated with contactless and chip readers, Square Terminal, Square Stand, Square Register, and third-party peripherals. Product costs include manufacturing-related overhead and personnel costs, certain royalties, packaging, and fulfillment costs. Hardware is sold primarily as a means to grow our transaction-based revenue and, as a result, generating positive gross margins from hardware sales is not the primary goal of the hardware business.\nBitcoin costs. Bitcoin cost of revenue is comprised of the amounts we pay to purchase bitcoin, which will fluctuate in line with the price of bitcoin in the market. We purchase bitcoin to facilitate customers' access to bitcoin.\nAmortization of acquired technology. These costs consist of amortization related to technologies acquired through acquisitions. These amounts were not material to our financial statements.\nOperating Expenses\nOperating expenses consist of product development, sales and marketing, general and administrative expenses, transaction and loan losses, and amortization of acquired customer assets. For product development and general and administrative expenses, the largest single component is personnel-related expenses, including salaries, commissions and bonuses, employee benefit costs, and share-based compensation. In the case of sales and marketing expenses, a significant portion is related to the Cash App peer-to-peer transactions and Cash Card issuance costs, in addition to paid advertising and personnel-related expenses. Operating expenses also include allocated overhead costs for facilities, human resources, and IT.\nProduct development. Product development expenses currently represent the largest component of our operating expenses and consist primarily of expenses related to our engineering, data science, and design personnel; fees and supply costs related to maintenance at third-party data center facilities; hardware related development and tooling costs; and fees for software licenses, consulting, legal, and other services that are directly related to growing and maintaining our portfolio of products and services. Additionally, product development expenses include the depreciation of product-related infrastructure and tools, including data center equipment, internally developed software, and computer equipment. We continue to focus our product development efforts on adding new features and apps, and on enhancing the functionality and ease of use of our offerings. Our ability to realize returns on these investments is substantially dependent upon our ability to successfully address current and emerging requirements of sellers, buyers, and customers through the development and introduction of these new products and services.\nSales and marketing. Sales and marketing expenses are aggregated into two main components. The first component consists of traditional advertising costs incurred such as direct sales expense, account management, local and product marketing, retail and e-commerce, partnerships, and communications personnel. The second component of sales and marketing expense consists of costs incurred for services, incentives and other costs that are not directly related to revenue generating transactions that we consider to be marketing costs to encourage the usage of Cash App. These expenses include, but are not limited to, Cash App peer-to-peer processing costs and transaction losses, card issuance costs, customer referral bonuses, and promotional giveaways that are expensed as incurred.\nGeneral and administrative. General and administrative expenses consist primarily of expenses related to our customer support, finance, legal, risk operations, human resources, and administrative personnel. General and administrative expenses also include costs related to fees paid for professional services, including legal, tax, and accounting services.\nTransaction and loan losses. We are exposed to transaction losses due to chargebacks as a result of fraud or uncollectibility. We incur loan losses whenever the amortized cost of loans that have been retained exceeds their fair value.\nTransaction losses include chargebacks for unauthorized credit card use and inability to collect on disputes between buyers and sellers over the delivery of goods or services, as well as losses on Cash App activity related to peer-to-peer payments sent from a credit card, Cash for Business, and Cash Card. We base our reserve estimates on prior chargeback history and current period data points indicative of transaction loss. We reflect additions to the reserve in current operating results, while realized losses are offset against the reserve. The establishment of appropriate reserves for transaction losses is an inherently uncertain process, and ultimate losses may vary from the current estimates. We regularly update our reserve estimates as new facts become known and events occur that may affect the settlement or recovery of losses.\nLoan losses are recorded at the lower of amortized cost or fair value determined on an individual loan basis. To determine the fair value the Company utilizes industry-standard valuation modeling, such as discounted cash flow models, taking into account the estimated timing and amounts of periodic repayments. The Company recognizes a charge whenever the amortized cost of a loan exceeds its fair value, with such charges being reversed for subsequent increases in fair value, but only to the extent that such reversals do not result in the amortized cost of a loan exceeding its fair value.\nAmortization of acquired customer assets. Amortization of acquired customer assets includes customer relationships, restaurant relationships, courier relationships, subscriber relationships, and partner relationships. These amounts were not material to our financial statements.\nGain on sale of asset group\nGain on sale of asset group in 2019 represents the excess of the consideration received from the disposal of the Caviar business less the carrying values of the net assets sold.\nInterest and Other Income and Expense, net\nInterest and other income and expense, net consists primarily of gains or losses arising from marking to market of equity investments, interest expense related to our long-term debt, interest income on our investment in marketable debt securities, and foreign currency-related gains and losses.\nProvision for Income Taxes\nThe provision for income taxes consists primarily of federal, state, local, and foreign tax. Our effective tax rate fluctuates from period to period due to changes in the mix of income and losses in jurisdictions with a wide range of tax rates, the effect of acquisitions, changes resulting from the amount of recorded valuation allowance, permanent differences between U.S. generally accepted accounting principles and local tax laws, certain one-time items, and changes in tax contingencies.\nResults of Operations\nRevenue (in thousands, except for percentages)\n\nTotal net revenue for the year ended December 31, 2020, increased by $4.8 billion, or 101%, compared to the year ended December 31, 2019. Bitcoin revenue increased by $4.1 billion, and represented 85% of the increase in total net revenue. Excluding bitcoin revenue, total net revenue increased by $729.0 million, or 17%, in the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to the year ended December 31, 2019.\nTransaction-based revenue for the year ended December 31, 2020 increased by $213.9 million or 7%, compared to the year ended December 31, 2019. This increase was in line with the increase in GPV of 6% for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase was primarily attributable to and affected by the following events and factors:\n\u2022In January and February of 2020, we benefited from the growth in payment volume processed by existing sellers, in addition to meaningful contributions from new sellers, compared to the same period in the prior year, which included a benefit from the impact of the leap year;\n\u2022In the second half of March through mid-April, 2020, as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and subsequent shelter-in-place restrictions, we experienced a significant decline in transaction-based revenue, with GPV generated by our Seller business decreasing compared to the prior year;\n\u2022Beginning in mid-April 2020, we started to experience improving trends in GPV generated by our Seller business, as some states started to relax shelter-in-place measures, sellers adapted their businesses to contactless commerce, new sellers joined Square and various government assistance programs led to an increase in consumer spending;\n\u2022In the third and fourth quarters of 2020, we have experienced positive growth of GPV and revenue compared to the third and fourth quarters of 2019, primarily driven by higher priced card-not-present transactions as sellers continued to shift their businesses to adapt to the COVID-19 pandemic.\nDespite the decrease in transaction-based revenue as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, the overall increase in transaction-based revenue for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the same period in 2019 was primarily driven by growth in higher-priced card-not-present transactions as sellers shifted their businesses to adapt to the COVID-19 pandemic, and the impact from our November 2019 card-present price change, as well as Cash App GPV which includes Cash for Business and peer-to-peer payments sent from a credit card. Cash for Business activity includes peer-to-peer transactions to business accounts using Cash App. The factors and events above had varying impacts on the GPV growth and may continue to impact our revenues in the future. In particular, card-present growth varies by region and product, depending primarily on differences in the timing and phases of reopenings, which we expect will have a significant impact on overall GPV trends.\nSubscription and services-based revenue for the year ended December 31, 2020 increased by $507.9 million or 49%, compared to the year ended December 31, 2019. On October 31, 2019, we completed the sale of the Caviar business, and, accordingly, Caviar no longer contributes to subscription and services-based revenue. Excluding Caviar, subscription and services-based revenue grew by $653.9 million, or 74%, in the year ended year ended December 31, 2020, compared to the year ended December 31, 2019 driven predominantly by Cash App, and to a lesser extent Square Card and Instant Transfers for sellers, partially offset by a decrease in Square Capital loan volumes. Cash App subscription and services-based revenue is primarily comprised of transaction fees from both Cash App Instant Deposit and Cash Card, with a small portion generated from interest earned on customer funds. In an effort to support our sellers, we temporarily suspended charging customers\nsoftware subscription fees and refunded fees collected in March and April 2020. We resumed charging such fees in May 2020. Square Capital, which has historically been a significant component of the subscriptions and services revenue, suspended facilitating loans to sellers, other than PPP loans, in March 2020 but resumed facilitating such loans at the end of July 2020. Loan volumes remain lower than in 2019, and there is substantial uncertainty about when loan volumes will return to pre-COVID-19 levels.\nHardware revenue for the year ended December 31, 2020 increased by $7.1 million or 8%, compared to the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase was primarily a result of an increase in sales of hardware in our international markets, as well as sales of contactless hardware as a result of certain promotions offered in the second and third quarter of 2020.\nBitcoin revenue for the year ended December 31, 2020 increased by $4.1 billion or 785% compared to the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase was due to the market price of bitcoin, growth in the number of active bitcoin customers, as well as volume per customer. The amount of bitcoin revenue recognized will fluctuate depending on customer demand as well as changes in the market price of bitcoin. During the year ended December 31, 2020, we saw a significant growth in bitcoin revenue as compared to the year ended December 31, 2019. While bitcoin contributed 48% of the total revenue in 2020, and 85% of the increase in revenues in 2020, gross margin generated from bitcoin was only 3.5% of the total gross margin.\nCost of Revenue (in thousands, except for percentages)\n\nTotal cost of revenue for the year ended December 31, 2020, increased by $3.9 billion, or 140%, compared to the year ended December 31, 2019. Bitcoin costs of revenue increased by $4.0 billion, and represented 101% of the increase in the total cost of revenue. Excluding bitcoin costs of revenue, total cost of revenue decreased by approximately $25.9 million, or 1%, in the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to the year ended December 31, 2019.\nDespite an increase in GPV of 6% for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to the year ended December 31, 2019, transaction-based costs decreased by $26.1 million or 1% for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to the year ended December 31, 2019. The decrease in transaction-based costs in the year ended December 31, 2020 was primarily attributable to growth in debit card transactions and increase in average transaction sizes, which lowered the average cost per transaction, partially offset by the increase in GPV. We recognize that the recent shifts in the percentage of debit card transactions, proportion of card-not-present volumes, and average value per transaction size relative to historical periods are in part, a result of changes to consumer behaviors related to COVID-19, which may not continue in future quarters.\nSubscription and services-based costs for the year ended December 31, 2020 decreased by $11.6 million or 5% compared to the year ended December 31, 2019, primarily as a result of the sale of the Caviar business on October 31, 2019. Caviar contributed approximately 45% total subscription and services-based costs in year ended December 31, 2019. Excluding Caviar, subscription and services-based costs increased by $92.7 million or 71%, in the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to the year ended December 31, 2019, driven mainly by growth in costs associated with Cash Card and Instant Deposit.\nHardware costs for the year ended December 31, 2020 increased by $7.5 million or 6%, compared to the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase was primarily due to the same drivers for the increase in hardware revenue discussed above.\nBitcoin costs for the year ended December 31, 2020 increased by $4.0 billion or 780%, compared to the year ended December 31, 2019. Bitcoin costs of revenue comprises of the total amounts we pay to purchase bitcoin, which will fluctuate in line with bitcoin revenue.\nProduct Development (in thousands, except for percentages)\n\nProduct development expenses for the year ended December 31, 2020, increased by $211.2 million, or 31%, compared to the year ended December 31, 2019, due primarily to the following:\n\u2022an increase of $155.4 million in personnel costs for the year ended December 31, 2020, related to an increase in headcount among our engineering, data science, and design teams, as we continue to improve and diversify our products. The increase in personnel related costs includes an increase in share-based compensation expense of $78.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2020;\n\u2022an increase of $23.5 million in software and data center operating costs as a result of increased capacity needs and expansion of our cloud-based services.\nSales and Marketing (in thousands, except for percentages)\n\nSales and marketing expenses for the year ended December 31, 2020, increased by $484.8 million, or 78%, compared to the year ended December 31, 2019, primarily due to the following:\n\u2022an increase in Cash App marketing costs for the year ended December 31, 2020. The increase in Cash App marketing relates to a $355.6 million increase in processing costs and related transaction losses associated with the increased volume of activity with our Cash App peer-to-peer service, increased card issuance costs and increased incentives to customers that are not directly related to revenue generating transactions. We offer services such as stock investing, and certain Cash Card and peer-to-peer services to our Cash App customers for free, and various incentives to customers that we consider to be marketing tools to encourage the usage of Cash App. Additionally, Cash App advertising costs increased by $52.5 million;\n\u2022an increase of $29.6 million in advertising costs for our Seller Ecosystem services for the year ended December 31, 2020, primarily from increased online and television marketing campaigns;\n\u2022an increase of $28.3 million in Seller and Cash App sales and marketing personnel costs for the year ended December 31, 2020, to enable growth initiatives. The increase in personnel related costs includes an increase in share-based compensation expense of $9.9 million.\nGeneral and Administrative (in thousands, except for percentages)\n\nGeneral and administrative expenses for the year ended December 31, 2020, increased by $143.0 million, or 33%, compared to the year ended December 31, 2019, primarily due to the following:\n\u2022an increase of $58.7 million in general and administrative personnel costs for the year ended December 31, 2020, mainly as a result of additions to our customer support, finance, and legal personnel as we continued to add resources and skills to support our long-term growth as our business continues to scale. The increase in personnel related costs includes an increase in share-based compensation expense of $10.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2020; and\n\u2022the remaining increase was primarily due to the commencement of new leases, software and subscription costs, local business-related taxes, third-party legal and other professional fees and other administrative expenses, as well as impact of our statutory reserves.\nTransaction and Loan Losses (in thousands, except for percentages)\n\nTransaction and loan losses for the year ended December 31, 2020, increased by $50.7 million, or 40%, compared to the year ended December 31, 2019, primarily due to the following:\n\u2022transaction losses increased by $44.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 due to growth in our Cash App business, as well as increased provisions for transaction losses for our Seller business due to the expected impact of the COVID-19 pandemic that resulted in a significant slowdown in business for many sellers.\n\u2022an increase of $6.0 million in loan losses for the year ended December 31, 2020 due to incremental provisions for loan losses associated with the COVID-19 pandemic, and to a lesser extent the aging of our Square Capital loan portfolio. The increases in loan losses were offset by decreases in loan volumes as we suspended offers for new loans, other than PPP loans, in March 2020 and resumed offering such loans at the end of July 2020 at lower volumes.\nGain on Sale of Asset Group, Interest Expense, Net, and Other Expense (Income), Net (in thousands, except for percentages)\n\nGain on sale of asset group represents the excess of the consideration received from the sale of the Caviar business in October, 2019, of $410 million less the carrying value of the net assets sold and selling expenses, as analyzed in Note 8, Sale of Asset Group, of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nInterest expense, net, for the year ended December 31, 2020 increased by $35.4 million compared to the year ended December 31, 2019. The increases were primarily due to higher interest expense related to our convertible notes as a result of the issuance of the 2025 Notes in March 2020, as well as the 2026 Notes and 2027 Notes in November 2020, in addition to a decrease in interest income earned on our investments in marketable debt securities due to lower interest rates prevailing in the market.\nOther expense (income), net was primarily driven by the amounts of gains or losses arising from the revaluation of our equity investments. In November 2020, upon DoorDash's initial public offering, the preferred shares held by the Company converted into common shares of DoorDash. As of December 31, 2020, the Company revalued this investment and recorded a gain of $276.3 million in the year ended December 31, 2020. Additionally, in the fourth quarter of 2020, we recorded a gain on investment in a privately held entity of $19.0 million based on observable prices for similar equity instruments issued by\nthe same entity. In the year ended December 31, 2019, we recorded a loss of $12.3 million on the revaluation of our equity investment Eventbrite, Inc. (\"Eventbrite\"), offset by the amortization of and realized gains on the sale of investments in marketable securities of $9.7 million, foreign exchange gains of $1.7 million, and other sources of income. In December 2019, the Company sold its entire equity investment in Eventbrite and as a result this investment will not impact the results in future periods.\nSegment Results\nSeller Results\nThe following tables provide a summary of the revenue and gross profit for our Seller segment for the year ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 (in thousands):\n\nRevenue\nRevenue for the Seller segment for the year ended December 31, 2020 increased by $67.2 million compared to the year ended December 31, 2019.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic and the subsequent shelter-in-place orders resulted in a material decline in Seller revenues in the latter half of March 2020 through mid-April 2020 due to lower GPV processed. Additionally, Square Capital suspended facilitating loans to sellers from mid-March 2020 through the end of July 2020, other than PPP loans, further negatively impacting Seller revenues. Excluding the impact of Square Capital, other Seller subscription and services-based revenue increased due to growth in software subscriptions, Instant Transfers, and Square Card. This was offset by the recovery and improvements in GPV processed from mid-April through the fourth quarter of 2020 as states started relaxing the shelter-in-place orders and businesses started to adapt to the COVID-19 pandemic. Additionally, we saw a higher percentage of card-not-present transactions from the second quarter through to the fourth quarter of 2020, which have a higher transaction price, as well as the impact of our November 2019 card-present price change. Recent increases in the percentage of debit, proportion of card-not-present volumes, and average transaction size relative to historical periods are in part a result of changes to consumer behaviors related to COVID-19, which may not continue in future quarters.\nCost of revenue\nCost of revenue for the Seller segment for the year ended December 31, 2020 decreased by $50.2 million compared to the year ended December 31, 2019. Seller costs benefited from a higher percentage of debit card transactions and increase in average value per transaction which have lower costs.\nCash App Results\nThe following tables provide a summary of the revenue and gross profit for our Cash App segment for the year ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 (in thousands):\n\nRevenue\nRevenue for the Cash App segment for the year ended December 31, 2020 increased by $4.9 billion compared to the year ended December 31, 2019. The primary drivers were growth in bitcoin revenue, and to a lesser extent, Cash App Instant Deposit, Cash Card, and Cash for Business. Bitcoin revenue increased primarily due to an increase in the number of active bitcoin customers, as well as growth in customer demand and bitcoin prices. Additionally, Cash App revenue benefited from increased numbers of transacting active Cash App customers and from disbursements of the CARES Act stimulus programs and unemployment benefits, including a portion of customers who direct deposited these payments into their Cash App accounts. Cash App revenue growth may not be sustained at the same levels in future quarters and may be impacted by the enactment of further stimulus relief and benefit programs, as well as the demand and market prices for bitcoin, amongst other factors.\nCost of revenue\nCost of revenue for the Cash App segment for the year ended December 31, 2020 increased by $4.1 billion compared to the year ended December 31, 2019. The primary drivers for the increase were growth in bitcoin revenue, and to a lesser extent, Cash App Instant Deposit, Cash Card, and Cash for Business.\nComparison of Years Ended December 31, 2019 and 2018\nFor a discussion of the 2019 Results of Operations, including a discussion of the financial results for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2019 compared to the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018, refer to Part I, Item 7 of our Form 10-K filed with the SEC on February 26, 2020.\nQuarterly Results of Operations\nThe following tables set forth selected unaudited quarterly statements of operations data for the last eight quarters. The information for each of these quarters has been prepared on the same basis as the audited annual financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and, in the opinion of management, includes all adjustments, which consist only of normal recurring adjustments, necessary for the fair presentation of the results of operations for these periods. This data should be read in conjunction with our audited consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. These quarterly operating results are not necessarily indicative of the results we may achieve in future periods.\n\nCosts and expenses include share-based compensation expense as follows:\n\nThe following table sets forth the key operating metrics and non-GAAP financial measures we use to evaluate our business for each of the periods indicated:\n\nThe following table presents a reconciliation of net loss to Adjusted EBITDA for each of the periods indicated:\n\nThe following table presents a reconciliation of net loss to Adjusted Net Income (Loss) Per Share for each of the periods indicated:\n\nQuarterly Trends\nTransaction-based revenue is highly correlated with the level of GPV generated by sellers using our managed payments services. The increase in transaction-based revenue in 2020 was primarily attributable to and affected by the COVID-19 pandemic and subsequent shelter in place orders as discussed in more detail under results of operations.\nSubscription and services-based revenue generally demonstrates less seasonality than transaction-based revenue. The sequential increases were primarily driven by continued growth of Cash App which has benefited from increased engagement by customers as well as an increase from government stimulus funds deposited into customer accounts. On October 31, 2019, we completed the sale of the Caviar business, and accordingly we will no longer recognize any revenue from Caviar.\nBitcoin revenue comprises the total sale amount we receive from bitcoin sales to customers and is recorded upon transfer of bitcoin to the customer's account. The sale amount generally includes a small margin added to the price we pay to purchase bitcoin and accordingly, the amount of bitcoin revenue will fluctuate depending on the volatility of market bitcoin prices and customer demand. We saw unprecedented growth in bitcoin revenues in the second and third quarter of 2020. Various factors impact customer demand and as such, the recent periods' performance may not be indicative of future quarters.\nChanges in product development expenses primarily reflect the timing of additions of engineering, product, and design personnel. To a lesser extent, they also reflect the timing of fees and supply costs related to maintenance and capacity\nexpansion at third-party data center facilities, development and tooling costs related to the design, testing, and shipping of our hardware products, and fees for software licenses, consulting, legal, and other services that are directly related to growing and maintaining our products and services.\nChanges in sales and marketing expenses reflect the variable nature of the timing and magnitude of paid marketing and customer acquisition initiatives across our advertising channels. Changes in sales and marketing expenses are also affected by the timing of additions of direct sales, account management, local, product and paid marketing, retail and e-commerce, partnerships, and communications personnel. Additionally, sales and marketing expenses are affected by the timing and magnitude of processing costs and transaction losses related to our Cash App peer-to-peer transfer service and Cash Card issuance costs. We offer the Cash Card and certain peer-to-peer services to our Cash App customers for free and we consider these to be marketing tools intended to encourage the usage of Cash App. We saw a substantial increase in sales and marketing expenses in the second and third quarter of 2020 associated with the increased volume of activity with our Cash App peer-to-peer service.\nChanges in general and administrative expenses primarily reflect the timing of additions of finance, legal, risk operations, human resources, and administrative personnel, as well as the timing of non income tax payments and reserves. They also reflect the timing of costs related to support personnel and systems, as well as fees paid for professional services, including legal and financial services.\nWe recorded incremental provisions for transaction and loan losses in the first quarter of 2020 for our Seller business due to the expected impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and the related subsequent shelter-in-place orders that resulted in a significant slowdown in the business of many sellers. During the second quarter of 2020, we revised and lowered our estimate of transaction loss reserves recorded in the first quarter of 2020 due to better than expected realized transaction losses. Provision for transaction losses declined during the third quarter as a result of better than expected performance, and as we released previously established risk loss provisions for the first and second quarter of 2020. During the fourth quarter of 2020, we revised and lowered our estimate of transaction loss reserves recorded in the second and third quarter of 2020 due to better than expected realized transaction losses. For loan losses, during the second quarter of 2020, we noted improvements in our sellers as some states started reopening and relaxing the shelter-in place measures and have accordingly adjusted the provisions for loan losses. Additionally, other than PPP loans, we suspended offers for new loans in the second quarter of 2020 which contributed to the decrease in loan losses. During the third and fourth quarters of 2020, we continued to experience loan losses in line with the second quarter provisions for loan losses. Provisions for transaction losses increased approximately 106% in the fourth quarter of 2020, compared to the fourth quarter of 2019.\nGain on sale of asset group represents the net gain we made on the sale of the Caviar business in the fourth quarter of 2019.\nChanges in interest expense (income), net are driven by interest expense related to our convertible notes and interest income earned on our investment in marketable debt securities.\nChanges in other expense (income), net was primarily due to gains or losses arising from revaluation of our publicly traded and privately held equity investments. In the fourth quarter of 2020, we recorded a gain from the revaluation of our DoorDash investment as a result of its initial public offering in December 2020, as well as a gain in the fourth quarter of 2020 due to the revaluation of our investment in a privately held entity. In 2019, we recorded losses in the mark to market revaluation of our Eventbrite investment. In December 2019, the Company sold the investment in Eventbrite and as a result will not be impacted by mark to market revaluations related to this investment in future periods. To a lesser extent this balance is also impacted by foreign exchange gains or losses.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nThe uncertainty caused by the COVID-19 pandemic continues both in the United States and globally, with the duration and severity of the pandemic and the overall impact on consumer demand and overall economy still unknown. We are unable to forecast the full impact on our business; however, this represents a known area of uncertainty and we continue to expect the COVID-19 pandemic and its related economic disruption may have a material impact on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. We continue to evaluate our investment plans and discretionary expenditures and will make adjustments accordingly.\nAs of December 31, 2020, we had approximately $4.9 billion in available funds, including undrawn amounts available under our revolving credit facility, as described in Note 13, Indebtedness, of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. We intend to continue focusing on our long-term business initiatives and believe that our available funds are sufficient to meet our liquidity needs for the foreseeable future. We are carefully monitoring and managing our cash position in light of ongoing conditions and levels of operations.\nThe following table summarizes our cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash, and investments in marketable debt securities (in thousands):\nLiquidity Sources\n\nOur principal sources of liquidity are our cash and cash equivalents, and investments in marketable debt securities. As of December 31, 2020, we had $4.4 billion of cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash and investments in marketable debt securities, which were held primarily in cash deposits, money market funds, U.S. government and agency securities, commercial paper, and corporate bonds. We consider all highly liquid investments with an original maturity of three months or less when purchased to be cash equivalents. Our investments in marketable debt securities are classified as available-for-sale. From time to time, we have raised capital by issuing equity, equity-linked, or debt securities such as our convertible senior notes.\nAs of December 31, 2020, we held $3.0 billion in aggregate principal amount of convertible senior notes, comprised of $8.5 million in aggregate principal amount of outstanding convertible senior notes that mature on March 1, 2022 (2022 Notes), $862.5 million in aggregate principal amount of convertible senior notes that mature on May 15, 2023 (2023 Notes), $1.0 billion in aggregate amount of convertible senior notes that mature on March 1, 2025 (2025 Notes), and $575.0 million and $575.0 million in aggregate amount of convertible senior notes that mature on May 1, 2026, and November 1, 2027, respectively (2026 and 2027 Notes). The 2022 Notes bear interest at a rate of 0.375% payable semi-annually on March 1 and September 1 of each year, while the 2023 Notes bear interest at a rate of 0.50% payable semi-annually on May 15 and November 15 of each year, and the 2025 Notes bear interest at a rate of 0.125% payable semi-annually on March 1 and September 1 of each year. The 2026 Notes bear no interest, whereas, the 2027 notes bear interest at a rate of 0.25% payable semi-annually on May 1 and November 1 of each year. These notes can be converted or repurchased prior to maturity if certain conditions are met.\nWe purchased $50 million in bitcoin in October 2020 and another $170 million in February 2021, as we believe cryptocurrency is an instrument of economic empowerment that aligns with our corporate purpose. We expect to hold these investments for the long term but will continue to reassess our investment in bitcoin relative to our balance sheet. As bitcoin is considered an indefinite lived intangible asset, under the accounting policy for such assets we will be required to recognize\nany decreases in market prices below cost as an impairment charge, with any mark up in value prohibited if the market price of bitcoin subsequently increases.\nIn September 2020, we announced our intent to invest $100 million in supporting underserved communities, particularly, racial and ethnic minority groups who have been disproportionately affected by COVID-19. This initiative further deepens our commitment toward economic empowerment to help broaden such communities' access to financial services.\nIn June 2020, we entered into the Paycheck Protection Program Liquidity Facility agreement with the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco (\"First PPPLF Agreement\") to secure additional credit collateralized by PPP loans. As of December 31, 2020, $464.1 million of PPPLF advances were outstanding and collateralized by the same value of PPP loans. The advances under this facility are repayable if the associated PPP loans are forgiven, repaid by a customer or settled by the government guarantee. As of February 23, 2021, approximately $376.3 million of PPPLF advances were outstanding and collateralized by the same value of the PPP loans. On January 29, 2021, we entered into a Second PPPLF Agreement with the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco to secure additional credit, collateralized by loans from the second round of the PPP program, in an aggregate principal amount of up to $1.0 billion under both PPPLF Agreements.\nIn May 2020, we entered into a new revolving credit agreement with certain lenders, which provides a $500 million senior unsecured revolving credit facility (the \"2020 Credit Facility\") maturing in May 2023. Loans under the 2020 Credit Facility bear interest at our option of (i) a base rate based on the highest of the prime rate, the federal funds rate plus 0.50%, and the adjusted LIBOR rate plus 1.00%, in each case, plus a margin ranging from 0.25% to 0.75% or (ii) an adjusted LIBOR rate plus a margin ranging from 1.25% to 1.75%. The margin is determined based on our total net leverage ratio, as defined in the agreement. We are obligated to pay other customary fees for a credit facility of this size and type including an unused commitment fee of 0.15%. To date, no funds have been drawn and no letters of credit have been issued under the 2020 Credit Facility.\nSee Note 13, Indebtedness, of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more details on these transactions.\nWe believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents, investment in marketable debt securities, and availability under our line of credit will be sufficient to meet our working capital needs, including any expenditures related to strategic transactions and investment commitments that we may from time to time enter into, and planned capital expenditures for at least the next 12 months. From time to time, we may seek to raise additional capital through equity, equity-linked, and debt financing arrangements. We cannot provide assurance that any additional financing will be available to us on acceptable terms or at all.\nShort-term restricted cash of $30.3 million as of December 31, 2020 reflects pledged cash deposited into savings accounts at the financial institutions that process our sellers' payments transactions and as collateral pursuant to an agreement with the originating bank for the Company's Square Capital loan product. We use the restricted cash to secure letters of credit with these financial institutions to provide collateral for liabilities arising from cash flow timing differences in the processing of these payments. We have recorded this amount as a current asset on our consolidated balance sheets given the short-term nature of these cash flow timing differences and that there is no minimum time frame during which the cash must remain restricted. Additionally, this balance includes certain amounts held as collateral pursuant to multi-year lease agreements, discussed in the paragraph below, which we expect to become unrestricted within the next year.\nLong-term restricted cash of $13.5 million as of December 31, 2020 is primarily related to cash deposited into money market funds that is used as collateral pursuant to multi-year lease agreements. The Company has recorded this amount as a non-current asset on the consolidated balance sheets as the lease terms extend beyond one year.\nWe experience significant day-to-day fluctuations in our cash and cash equivalents, due to fluctuations in settlements receivable, and customers payable, and hence working capital. These fluctuations are primarily due to:\n\u2022Timing of period end. For periods that end on a weekend or a bank holiday, our cash and cash equivalents, settlements receivable, and customers payable balances typically will be higher than for periods ending on a weekday, as we settle to our sellers for payment processing activity on business days; and\n\u2022Fluctuations in daily GPV. When daily GPV increases, our cash and cash equivalents, settlements receivable, and customers payable amounts increase. Typically our settlements receivable, and customers payable balances at period end represent one to four days of receivables and disbursements to be made in the subsequent period. Customers payable, excluding amounts attributable to Cash App stored funds, and settlements receivable balances typically move in tandem, as pay-out and pay-in largely occur on the same business day. However, customers payable balances will be greater in amount than settlements receivable balances due to the fact that a subset of funds are held due to unlinked bank accounts, risk holds, and chargebacks. Also, customer funds obligations, which are included in customers payable, may cause customers payable to trend differently than settlements receivable. Holidays and day-of-week may also cause significant volatility in daily GPV amounts.\nCash Flow Activities\nThe following table summarizes our cash flow activities (in thousands):\n\nCash Flows from Operating Activities\nCash provided by operating activities consisted of net loss adjusted for certain non-cash items including gain or loss on revaluation of equity investments, depreciation and amortization, non-cash interest and other expense, share-based compensation expense, transaction and loan losses, deferred income taxes, non-cash lease expense, gain on sale of asset group, as well as the effect of changes in operating assets and liabilities, including working capital.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2020, cash provided by operating activities was $381.6 million, primarily due to a net income of $213.1 million, offset by PPP loans facilitated, less loans sold, of $420.8 million, adjusted for the add back of non-cash expenses of $509.4 million consisting primarily of share-based compensation, transaction and loan losses, depreciation and amortization, and non-cash interest and other expenses. Whereas the increase in transaction and loan losses was largely caused by estimated losses attributable to the COVID-19 pandemic, the increase in other non-cash expenses was primarily due to the growth and expansion of our business activities. Additionally, the cash generated from operating activities increased due to a net inflow from changes in other assets and liabilities of $79.9 million due to timing.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2019, cash provided by operating activities was $465.7 million primarily due to a net income of $375.4 million, adjusted for the add back of non-cash expenses of $574.5 million consisting primarily of share-based compensation, transaction and loan losses, depreciation and amortization, and non-cash interest and other expenses largely driven by growth and expansion of our business activities, offset in part by the gain on sale of Caviar of $373.4 million in the fourth quarter. The cash generated from operating activities was negatively affected by a net outflow from changes in other assets and liabilities of $110.8 million.\nCash Flows from Investing Activities\nCash flows used in investing activities primarily relate to capital expenditures to support our growth, investments in marketable debt securities, investment in privately held entity, and business acquisitions.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2020, cash used in investing activities was $606.6 million, primarily due to the net investments of marketable securities including investments from customer funds of $337.7 million. Additional uses of cash were as a result of the purchase of property and equipment of $138.4 million, business acquisitions, net of cash acquired of\n$79.2 million and purchases of other investments of $51.3 million.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2019, cash provided by investing activities was $95.2 million, primarily as a result of the net cash proceeds from sale of asset group of $309.3 million related to the sale of the Caviar business and proceeds from sale of equity investment in Eventbrite of $33.0 million, offset in part by the net investments of marketable securities including investments from customer funds of $149.0 million. Additional uses of cash in investing activities were a result of purchases of property and equipment of $62.5 million, business combinations, net of cash acquired of $20.4 million, and other investments of $15.3 million.\nCash Flows from Financing Activities\nFor the year ended December 31, 2020, cash provided by financing activities was $2.3 billion, primarily as a result of $1.08 billion in net proceeds from the 2026 and 2027 Note offering, $936.5 million in net proceeds from the 2025 Note offering, proceeds from the First PPPLF Agreement advances of $464.1 million, proceeds from issuances of common stock from the exercise of options and purchases under our employee share purchase plan of $162.0 million, offset by payments for employee tax withholding related to vesting of restricted stock units of $314.0 million.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2019, cash used in financing activities was $98.9 million, primarily as a result of payments for employee tax withholding related to vesting of restricted stock units of $212.3 million offset in part by proceeds from issuances of common stock from the exercise of options and purchases under the employee stock purchase plan, net of $118.5 million.\nContractual Obligations and Commitments\nOur principal commitments consist of convertible senior notes, liquidity facility, operating leases, capital leases, and purchase commitments. The following table summarizes our commitments to settle contractual obligations in cash as of December 31, 2020.\n\nConvertible Senior Notes\nOn November 13, 2020, we issued $1.15 billion in aggregate principal amount of 2026 and 2027 Notes that mature on May 1, 2026 and November 1, 2027, respectively, unless earlier converted or repurchased. The 2026 Notes bear no interest, whereas, the 2027 Notes bear interest at a rate of 0.25% payable semi-annually on May 1 and November 1 of each year. See Note 13, Indebtedness, of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more details on this transaction.\nOn March 5, 2020, we issued $1.0 billion in aggregate principal amount of 2025 Notes that mature on March 1, 2025, unless earlier converted or repurchased, and bear interest at a rate of 0.1250% payable semi-annually on March 1 and September 1 of each year. See Note 13, Indebtedness, of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more details on this transaction.\nOn May 25, 2018, we issued $862.5 million in aggregate principal amount of 2023 Notes that mature on May 15, 2023, unless earlier converted or repurchased, and bear interest at a rate of 0.50% payable semi-annually on May 15 and\nNovember 15 of each year. See Note 13, Indebtedness, of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more details on this transaction.\nOn March 6, 2017, we issued $440.0 million in aggregate principal amount of Notes that mature on March 1, 2022, unless earlier converted or repurchased, and bear interest at a rate of 0.375% payable semi-annually on March 1 and September 1 of each year. See Note 13, Indebtedness, of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more details on this transaction.\nPaycheck Protection Program Liquidity Facility\nOn June 2, 2020, we entered into the First PPPLF Agreement with the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco to secure additional credit in an aggregate principal amount of up to $500.0 million. Borrowings under the facility accrue interest at a rate of 0.35% and must be collateralized with loans originated under the PPP. On January 29, 2021, we entered into a second PPPLF agreement with the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco ( Second PPPLF Agreement\u201d and together with the First PPPLF Agreement, PPPLF Agreements\u201d) to secure additional credit, collateralized by loans from the second round of the PPP program, in an aggregate principal amount of up to $1.0 billion under both PPPLF Agreements. The maturity date of any PPPLF advances will be the maturity date of the PPP loan pledged to secure the advance, and will be accelerated upon the occurrence of certain events of default. Although loans originated under the PPP have a stated maturity of between two and five years from origination, some of the loans may be forgiven 24 weeks after disbursement if they meet certain specified criteria. The PPPLF advances are also repayable if the underlying PPP loan is repaid by the customer. As of December 31, 2020, $464.1 million of PPPLF advances were outstanding. As of February 23, 2021, approximately $376.3 million of PPPLF advances were outstanding and collateralized by the same value of the PPP loans. See Note 13, Indebtedness, of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more details on this transaction.\nLease Commitments\nWe have entered into various non-cancelable operating leases for certain offices with contractual lease periods expiring between 2021 and 2034. We recognized total rental expenses under operating leases of $75.2 million, $32.5 million, and $23.3 million during the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018, respectively.\nPurchase commitments\nWe had non-cancelable purchase obligations to hardware suppliers for $40.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2020.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements during the periods presented.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nOur discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. GAAP requires us to make certain estimates and judgments that affect the amounts reported in our financial statements. We base our estimates on historical experience, anticipated future trends, and other assumptions we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Because these accounting policies require significant judgment, our actual results may differ materially from our estimates.\nWe believe accounting policies and the assumptions and estimates associated with transaction and loan losses, especially due to uncertainties associated with the COVID-19 pandemic, and revenue recognition have the greatest potential effect on our consolidated financial statements. Therefore, we consider these to be our critical accounting policies and estimates.\nTransaction Losses\nWe are exposed to transaction losses due to chargebacks as a result of fraud or uncollectibility of transaction payments. We estimate accrued transaction losses based on available data as of the reporting date, including expectations of future chargebacks, and historical trends related to loss rates that is continuously adjusted for new information and incorporates, where applicable, reasonable and supportable forecasts about future expectations. During the first and second\nquarters of 2020, the Company revised its estimates to reflect expected increased chargebacks from non-delivery of goods and services as well as increased failure rates of its sellers due to the COVID-19 pandemic. During the third and fourth quarters of 2020, the Company continued to further revise its estimates for transaction losses and as a result of better than expected performance, the Company released previously established risk loss provisions for the first three quarters of 2020 amounting to $82.4 million.\nConvertible Notes\nWe account for the convertible notes as separate debt and equity components. The carrying amount of the debt component is calculated by measuring the fair value of a similar debt that does not have an associated convertible feature. The carrying amount of the equity component representing the conversion option is calculated by deducting the fair value of the debt component from the principal amount of the convertible notes as a whole. We estimated the fair value of the debt and equity components using a convertible bond model, which includes subjective assumptions such as the expected term and expected volatility. These assumptions involve inherent uncertainties and management judgement.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nSee Recent Accounting Pronouncements\u201d described in Note 1 of the Notes to our

The increase was primarily due to Bitcoin revenue growth of $4.1 billion. Excluding Bitcoin, total revenue was up 17%.\n\n- Net income in 2020 was $213.1 million compared to $375.4 million in 2019. \n\n- Operating expenses were up significantly in 2020, driven by higher sales and marketing costs for Cash App and increases in product development and general and administrative expenses.\n\n- Cash App revenue grew 440% year-over-year to $6 billion in 2020, driven by Bitcoin purchases, Instant Deposit fees, and Cash Card usage.\n\n- Seller revenue increased 2% to $3.5 billion in 2020. Growth was impacted by COVID-19 but recovered in the second half as sellers adapted to contactless commerce. \n\n- Transaction losses increased $50.7 million or 40% in 2020 due to COVID-19 chargeback risks and Cash App growth. Provisions were reduced in Q3 and Q4 as losses were better than expected.\n\n- Cash and investments totaled $4.4 billion at the end of 2020 compared to $2.1 billion at the end of 2019. Cash flow from operations was $381.6 million in 2020.\n\nIn summary, Square saw strong growth in 2020 led by Cash App, but profits declined from 2019 due to Bitcoin revenue mix and impacts from the pandemic. The company maintained a strong balance sheet and cash position."}
