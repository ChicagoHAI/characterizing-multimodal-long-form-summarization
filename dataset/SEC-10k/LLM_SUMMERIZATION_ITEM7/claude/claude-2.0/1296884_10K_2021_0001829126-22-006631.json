The following information contains forward-looking statements, which are subject to risks\nand uncertainties. Should one or more of these risks or uncertainties materialize, actual results may differ materially from those\nexpressed or implied by the forward-looking statements. Please see Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\u201d\nabove for a description of these risks and uncertainties. Dollar amounts are presented in thousands, except per share data and\nwhere indicated in millions.\nOverview\nLightstone\nValue Plus REIT I, Inc. (the Lightstone REIT I\u201d), (together with the Operating Partnership (as defined below), the\nCompany\u201d, also referred to as we\u201d, our\u201d or us\u201d herein) has and expects to\ncontinue to acquire and operate or develop in the future, commercial, residential and hospitality properties and/or make real\nestate-related investments, principally in the United States. Our acquisitions and investments are, principally conducted through\nthe Operating Partnership, and may include both portfolios and individual properties.\nAs\nof December 31, 2021, we have ownership interests in (i) two consolidated operating properties, (ii) two consolidated development\nproperties and (iii) seven unconsolidated operating properties. With respect to our consolidated operating properties, we wholly\nown the St. Augustine Outlet Center, a retail property containing 0.3 million square feet of gross leasable area, and have a majority\nownership interest of 59.2% in Gantry Park Landing, a multi-family residential property containing 199 apartment units. With respect\nto our consolidated development properties, we wholly own two projects consisting of the Lower East Side Moxy Hotel and the Exterior\nStreet Project. We also hold a 2.5% ownership interest in seven hotel properties through a joint venture (the Joint Venture\u201d)\nwhich we account for using a measurement alternative under which the Joint Venture is measured at cost, adjusted for observable\nprice changes and impairments, if any. The Joint Venture is between us and the operating partnership of Lightstone Value Plus\nREIT II, Inc., a real estate investment trust also sponsored by our Sponsor, which has a 97.5% ownership interest in the Joint\nVenture. Furthermore, we have other real estate-related investments, including preferred contributions that were made pursuant\nto agreements with various related party entities (the Preferred Investments\u201d) and nonrecourse promissory notes made\nto unaffiliated third-parties. Our real estate investments have been and are expected to continue to be held by the Company alone\nor jointly with other parties.\nWe\ndo not have employees. We entered into an advisory agreement pursuant to which the Advisor supervises and manages our day-to-day\noperations and selects our real estate and real estate related investments, subject to oversight by our board of directors (the\nBoard of Directors\u201d). We pay the Advisor fees for services related to the investment and management of our assets,\nand we will reimburse the Advisor for certain expenses incurred on our behalf.\t\nTo\nmaintain our qualification as a REIT, we engage in certain activities through taxable REIT subsidiaries ( TRSs\u201d).\nAs such, we may still be subject to U.S. federal and state income and franchise taxes from these activities.\nAcquisitions\nand Investment Strategy\nWe\nhave, to date, acquired and/or developed residential, commercial and hospitality properties principally, all of which are located\nin the United States and also made other real estate-related investments. Our acquisitions have included both portfolios and individual\nproperties. Our current operating properties consist of one retail property (the St. Augustine Outlet Center) and one multi-family\nresidential property (Gantry Park Landing). We have also acquired various parcels of land and air rights related to the development\nand construction of real estate properties. Additionally, we have made preferred investments in related parties and originated\nnonrecourse loans to unaffiliated third-party borrowers.\nInvestments\nin real estate are generally made through the purchase of all or part of a fee simple ownership, or all or part of a leasehold\ninterest. We may also purchase limited partnership interests, limited liability company interests and other equity securities.\nWe may also enter into joint ventures with related parties for the acquisition, development or improvement of properties as well\nas general partnerships, co-tenancies and other participations with real estate developers, owners and others for the purpose\nof developing, owning and operating real properties. We will not enter into a joint venture to make an investment that we would\nnot be permitted to make on our own. Not more than 10% of our total assets will be invested in unimproved real property. For purposes\nof this paragraph, unimproved real properties\u201d does not include properties acquired for the purpose of producing\nrental or other operating income, properties under construction and properties for which development or construction is planned\nwithin one year.\nCurrent\nEnvironment\nOur\noperating results are substantially impacted by the overall health of local, U.S. national and global economies and may be influenced\nby market and other challenges. Additionally, our business and financial performance may be adversely affected by current and\nfuture economic and other conditions; including, but not limited to, availability or terms of financings, financial markets volatility,\npolitical upheaval or uncertainty, natural and man-made disasters, terrorism and acts of war, unfavorable changes in laws and\nregulations, outbreaks of contagious diseases, cybercrime, loss of key relationships, and recession.\nCOVID-19\nPandemic\nThe\nWorld Health Organization declared COVID-19 a global pandemic on March 11, 2020 and since that time many of the previously imposed\nrestrictions and other measures which were instituted in response have been subsequently reduced or lifted. However, the COVID-19\npandemic remains highly unpredictable and dynamic and its duration and extent continue to be dependent on various developments,\nsuch as the emergence of variants to the virus that may cause additional strains of COVID-19, the administration and ultimate\neffectiveness of vaccines, and the eventual timeline to achieve a sufficient level of herd immunity among the general population.\nAccordingly, the COVID-19 pandemic may continue to have negative effects on the health of the U.S. economy for the foreseeable\nfuture.\nAs\na result of previously imposed restrictions, we temporarily closed our St. Augustine Outlet Center from March 20, 2020 through\nMay 7, 2020. During the COVID-19 pandemic, the property's occupancy declined and because of limited leasing success, we\nbegan exploring various strategic alternatives for our St. Augustine Outlet Center and as a result determined during the third\nquarter of 2021 that we would no longer pursue leasing of space to tenants and therefore, entered into lease termination agreements\nwith certain tenants and also provided notice to our other tenants that we would not renew their leases at scheduled expiration.\nAs a result of this change in leasing strategy and resulting decrease in the fair value of the St. Augustine Outlet Center, we\nrecorded a non-cash impairment charge of $11.3 million during the third quarter of 2021. See Note 8 of the Notes to Consolidated\nFinancial Statements for additional information.\nAdditionally,\nas a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, during 2020 we saw deterioration in both the occupancy and rental rates for Gantry Park\nLanding, which is located on Long Island, New York, as the luxury rental market in the greater New York City metropolitan area\nwas negatively impacted. However, both occupancy and rental rates have improved considerably throughout 2021 and have returned\nto pre-COVID-19 levels.\nTo-date,\nthe COVID-19 pandemic has not had any significant impact on our development projects. Furthermore, our other real estate-related\ninvestments (both our preferred investments in related parties and nonrecourse loans made to unaffiliated third-party borrowers)\nalso relate to various development projects which are at different stages in their respective development process. These investments,\nwhich are subject to similar restrictions and other measures, have also not yet been significantly impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic.\nThe\noverall extent to which our business may be affected by the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic will largely depend on both current and\nfuture developments, all of which are highly uncertain and cannot be reasonably predicted.\nIf\nour operating properties, development projects and real estate-related investments are negatively impacted for an extended period\nbecause (i) occupancy levels and rental rates further decline, (ii) tenants are unable to pay their rent, (iii) borrowers are\nunable to pay scheduled debt service on notes receivable, (iv) development activities are delayed and/or (v) various related party\nentities are unable to pay monthly preferred distributions on our preferred investments in related parties, our business and financial\nresults could be materially and adversely impacted.\nWe\nare not currently aware of any other material trends or uncertainties, favorable or unfavorable, that may be reasonably anticipated\nto have a material impact on either capital resources or the revenues or income to be derived from our operations, other than\nthose referred to above or throughout this Form 10-K. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles\ngenerally accepted in the United States of America ( GAAP\u201d) requires the Company's management to make estimates\nand assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities\nand the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during a reporting period.\nCritical\nAccounting Estimates and Policies\nGeneral\nOur\nconsolidated financial statements, included in this annual report, include our accounts, the Operating Partnership and its subsidiaries (over\nwhich we exercise financial and operating control). All inter-company balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.\nThe\ndiscussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements,\nwhich have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of our financial statements requires us to make estimates and\njudgments about the effects of matters or future events that are inherently uncertain. These estimates and judgments may affect\nthe reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities.\nOn\nan ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates, including contingencies and litigation. We base these estimates on historical experience\nand on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable in the circumstances. These estimates form the basis for making\njudgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results\nmay differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.\nTo\nassist in understanding our results of operations and financial position, we have identified our critical accounting policies\nand discussed them below. These accounting policies are most important to the portrayal of our results and financial position,\neither because of the significance of the financial statement items to which they relate or because they require our management's\nmost difficult, subjective or complex judgments.\nRevenue\nRecognition\nOur\nrevenue, which is comprised largely of rental income, includes rents that tenants pay in accordance with the terms of their respective\nleases reported on a straight-line basis over the initial term of the lease. Since our leases may provide for rental increases\nat specified intervals, straight-line basis accounting requires us to record as an asset, and include in revenue, unbilled rent\nthat we only receive if the tenant makes all rent payments required through the expiration of the initial term of the lease.\nIn\naddition, we will defer the recognition of contingent rental income, such as percentage rents, until the specific target which\ntriggers the contingent rental income is achieved. Cost recoveries from tenants will be included in tenant recovery income in\nthe period the related costs are incurred.\nInvestments\nin Real Estate\nWe\ngenerally record investments in real estate at cost and capitalize improvements and replacements when they extend the useful life\nor improve the efficiency of the asset. We expense costs of ordinary repairs and maintenance as incurred. We compute depreciation\nusing the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the applicable real estate asset. We generally use estimated\nuseful lives of up to thirty-nine years for buildings and improvements, five to ten years for furniture and fixtures\nand the shorter of the useful life or the remaining lease term for tenant improvements and leasehold interests.\nWe\nmake subjective assessments as to the useful lives of our properties for purposes of determining the amount of depreciation to\nrecord on an annual basis with respect to our investments in real estate. These assessments have a direct impact on our net income\nbecause, if we were to shorten the expected useful lives of our investments in real estate, we would depreciate these investments\nover fewer years, resulting in more depreciation expense and lower net income on an annual basis.\nWe\nrecord assets and groups of assets and liabilities which comprise disposal groups as held for sale\u201d when all of the\nfollowing criteria are met: a decision has been made to sell, the assets are available for sale immediately, the assets are being\nactively marketed at a reasonable price in relation to the current fair value, a sale has been or is expected to be concluded\nwithin twelve months of the balance sheet date, and significant changes to the plan to sell are not expected. The assets and disposal\ngroups held for sale are valued at the lower of book value or fair value less disposal costs. For sales of real estate or assets\nclassified as held for sale, we evaluate whether a disposal transaction meets the criteria of a strategic shift and will have\na major effect on our operations and financial results to determine if the results of operations and gains on sale of real estate\nwill be presented as part of our continuing operations or as discontinued operations in our consolidated statements of operations.\nIf the disposal represents a strategic shift, it will be classified as discontinued operations for all periods presented; if not,\nit will be presented in continuing operations.\nWe\nevaluate the recoverability of our investments in real estate assets at the lowest identifiable level, the individual property\nlevel. An impairment loss is recognized only if the carrying amount of a long-lived asset is not recoverable and exceeds its fair\nvalue.\nWe\nevaluate the long-lived assets for potential impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the undiscounted\nprojected cash flows are less than the carrying amount for a particular property. No single indicator would necessarily result\nin us preparing an estimate to determine if a long-lived asset's future undiscounted cash flows are less than its book value.\nWe use judgment to determine if the severity of any single indicator, or the fact there are a number of indicators of less severity\nthat when combined, would result in an indication that a long-lived asset requires an estimate of the undiscounted cash flows\nto determine if an impairment has occurred. Relevant facts and circumstances include, among others, significant underperformance\nrelative to historical or projected future operating results and significant negative industry or economic trends. The estimated\ncash flows used for the impairment analysis are subjective and require us to use our judgment and the determination of estimated\nfair value are based on our plans for the respective assets and our views of market and economic conditions. The estimates consider\nmatters such as future operating income, market and other applicable trends and residual value, as well as the effects of demand,\ncompetition, and recent sales data for comparable properties. Changes in estimated future cash flows due to changes in our plans\nor views of market and economic conditions could result in recognition of impairment losses, which, under the applicable accounting\nguidance, may be substantial.\nAccounting\nfor Asset Acquisitions\nThe\ncost of the acquisition in an asset acquisition is allocated to the acquired tangible assets, consisting of land, building and\ntenant improvements, and identified intangible assets and liabilities, consisting of the value of above-market and below-market\nleases for acquired in-place leases and the value of tenant relationships, and certain liabilities such as assumed debt and contingent\nliabilities on the basis of their relative fair values. Fees incurred related to asset acquisitions are capitalized as part of\nthe cost of the investment.\nAccounting\nfor Development Projects\nWe\nincur a variety of costs in the development of a property. The costs of land and building under development include specifically\nidentifiable costs. The capitalized costs include, but are not limited to, pre-construction costs essential to the development\nof the property, development costs, construction costs, interest costs, real estate taxes and other costs incurred during the\nperiod of development. We cease capitalization when the development project is substantially complete and placed in service,\nwhich may occur in phases. Determination of when a development project is substantially complete and capitalization must cease\ninvolves a degree of judgment.\nOnce\na development project is placed in service, which may occur in phases or for an entire building or project, the costs capitalized\nto that development project are transferred to land and improvements, buildings and improvements, and furniture and fixtures on\nour consolidated balance sheets at the historical cost of the property.\nNotes\nReceivable and Preferred Investments\nNotes\nreceivable and preferred investments that we intend to hold to maturity are carried at cost, net of any unamortized origination\ncosts, fees, discounts, premiums and unfunded commitments.\nInvestment\nincome will be recognized on an accrual basis and any related premium, discount, origination costs and fees are amortized over\nthe life of the investment using the effective interest method. The amortization is reflected as an adjustment to investment income\nin the Company's statements of operations.\nIncome\nrecognition is suspended when, in the opinion of management, a full recovery of income and principal becomes doubtful. When the\nultimate collectability of the principal is in doubt, all payments are applied to principal under the cost recovery method. When\nthe ultimate collectability of the principal is not in doubt, contractual interest is recorded as investment income when received,\nunder the cash basis method, until an accrual is resumed when the instrument becomes contractually current and performance is\ndemonstrated to be resumed.\nCredit\nLosses and Impairment on Notes Receivable\nNotes\nreceivable are considered impaired when, based on current information and events, it is probable that we will not be able to collect\nprincipal and interest amounts due according to the contractual terms. We assess the credit quality of our notes receivable and\nadequacy of reserves on a quarterly basis, or more frequently as necessary. Significant judgment of management is required in\nthis analysis. We consider the estimated net recoverable value of the notes receivable as well as other factors, including but\nnot limited to the fair value of any collateral, the amount and the status of any senior debt, the quality and financial condition\nof the borrower and the competitive situation of the area where the underlying collateral is located. Because this determination\nis based on projections of future economic events, which are inherently subjective, the amount ultimately realized may differ\nmaterially from the carrying value as of the balance sheet date. If upon completion of the assessment, the estimated fair value\nof the underlying collateral is less than the net carrying value of the notes receivable, a reserve is recorded with a corresponding\ncharge to investment income. The reserve for each note receivable is maintained at a level that is determined to be adequate by\nmanagement to absorb probable losses.\nCredit\nLosses and Impairment on Preferred Investments\nPreferred\ninvestments that are accounted for as held to maturity are assessed for impairment at the individual investment level when there\nis a decline in fair value below the amortized cost basis that is deemed to be other than temporary. In making the determination\nof an other-than-temporary impairment assessment, the Company considers all available information relevant to the collectability\nof the investment, including information about past events, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts when\ndeveloping the estimate of cash flows expected to be collected. This information includes the remaining redemption terms of the\ninvestment, financial condition of the issuer, expected defaults and the value of any underlying collateral. In assessing whether\nthe entire amortized cost basis of the investment will be recovered, the Company compares the present value of cash flows expected\nto be collected from the investment with the amortized cost basis and records an impairment based on the amount by which the present\nvalue of cash flows expected to be collected is less than the amortized cost basis of the investment.\nTreatment\nof Management Compensation, Expense Reimbursements and Operating Partnership Participation Interest\nManagement\nof our operations is outsourced to our Advisor and certain other affiliates of our Sponsor. Fees related to each of these services\nare accounted for based on the nature of such service and the relevant accounting literature. Such fees include acquisition fees\nassociated with the purchase of interests in affiliated real estate entities; asset management fees paid to our Advisor and property\nmanagement fees paid to our Property Manager, which manage certain of the properties we acquire, or to other unaffiliated third-party\nproperty managers, principally for the management of our hospitality properties. These fees are expensed or capitalized to the\nbasis of acquired assets, as appropriate.\nOur\nProperty Manager may also perform fee-based construction management services for both our re-development activities and tenant\nconstruction projects. These fees are considered incremental to the construction effort and will be capitalized to the associated\nreal estate project as incurred. Costs incurred for tenant construction will be depreciated over the shorter of their useful\nlife or the term of the related lease. Costs related to redevelopment activities will be depreciated over the estimated useful\nlife of the associated project.\nLeasing\nactivity at certain of our properties has also been outsourced to our Property Manager. Any corresponding leasing fees we pay\nare capitalized and amortized over the life of the related lease.\nExpense\nreimbursements made to both our Advisor and Property Manager will be expensed or capitalized to the basis of acquired assets,\nas appropriate.\nThrough\nMarch 31, 2009, Lightstone SLP, LLC, an affiliate of the Advisor, purchased an aggregate of $30.0 million of SLP Units in the\nOperating Partnership at a cost of $100,000 per unit and none thereafter.\nIncome\nTaxes\nWe\nelected to be taxed and qualify as a REIT commencing with the taxable year ended December 31, 2005. If we remain qualified as\na REIT, we generally will not be subject to U.S. federal income tax on our net taxable income that we distribute currently to\nour stockholders. To maintain our REIT qualification under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, or the Code, we must\nmeet a number of organizational and operational requirements, including a requirement that we annually distribute to our stockholders\nat least 90% of our REIT taxable income (which does not equal net income, as calculated in accordance with generally accepted\naccounting principles in the United States of America, or GAAP), determined without regard to the deduction for dividends paid\nand excluding any net capital gain. If we fail to remain qualified for taxation as a REIT in any subsequent year and do not qualify\nfor certain statutory relief provisions, our income for that year will be taxed at regular corporate rates, and we may be precluded\nfrom qualifying for treatment as a REIT for the four-year period following our failure to qualify as a REIT. Such an event could\nmaterially adversely affect our net income and net cash available for distribution to our stockholders.\nTo\nmaintain our qualification as a REIT, we engage in certain activities through taxable REIT subsidiaries ( TRSs\u201d).\nAs such, we may still be subject to U.S. federal and state income and franchise taxes from these activities.\nAs\nof December 31, 2021 and 2020, we had no material uncertain income tax positions. Additionally, even if we continue to qualify\nas a REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes, we may still be subject to some U.S. federal, state and local taxes on our income\nand property and to U.S. federal income taxes and excise taxes on our undistributed income.\nResults\nof Operations\nDisposition\nof the Santa Clara Data Center\nOn\nJanuary 10, 2019, we acquired a parcel of land located at 2175 Martin Avenue, Santa Clara, California (the Martin Avenue\nLand\u201d) from an unaffiliated third party for $10.6 million. Subsequently, we completed certain activities associated with\nthe potential development and construction of a data center on the Martin Avenue Land (the Santa Clara Data Center\u201d).\nOn\nJuly 7, 2021, we disposed of the Santa Clara Data Center to an unrelated third party for a contractual sales price of $13.9 million.\nIn connection with the disposition of the Santa Clara Data Center, we recognized a gain on sale of investment property of $0.2\nmillion during the third quarter of 2021.\nThe\ndisposition of the Santa Clara Data Center did not qualify to be reported as discontinued operations since it did not represent\na strategic shift that had a major effect on our operations and financial results. Accordingly, the operating results of the Santa\nClara Data Center are reflected in our results from continuing operations for all periods presented through its date of disposition.\nInvestment\nImpairment - St. Augustine Outlet Center\nDuring\nthe COVID-19 pandemic, St. Augustine Outlet Center's occupancy declined and because of limited leasing success, we began\nbeen exploring various strategic alternatives for the property and as a result determined during the third quarter of 2021 that\nwe would no longer pursue leasing of space to tenants and therefore, entered into lease termination agreements with certain tenants\nand also provided notice to its other tenants that it would not renew their leases at scheduled expiration. As a result of this\nchange in leasing strategy and resulting decrease in the fair value of the St. Augustine Outlet Center, we recorded a non-cash\nimpairment charge of $11.3 million during the third quarter of 2021 to reduce the carrying value of the St. Augustine Outlet Center\nto its estimated fair value of $23.3 million as of September 30, 2021. In estimating the fair value of the St. Augustine Outlet\nCenter, we used management's internal analysis prepared with consideration of local market conditions.\nWe\nbelieve the reduced carrying value of the St. Augustine Outlet Center is currently recoverable. However, if market conditions\nworsen unexpectedly or if changes in its strategy significantly affect any key assumptions used in determining the property's\nestimated fair value, we may need to take additional impairment charges in future periods.\nFor\nthe Year Ended December 31, 2021 vs. December 31, 2020\nConsolidated\nRevenues\nOur\nrevenues are comprised of rental income and tenant recovery income. Total revenues decreased by $0.9 million to $10.4 million\nfor the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to $11.3 million for the same period in 2020. This decrease was primarily attributable\nto reduced occupancy and rental rates for Gantry Park Landing during the 2021 period resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic.\nProperty\noperating expenses\nProperty\noperating expenses increased by $0.2 million to $4.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to $4.0 million for\nthe same period in 2020. The increase in property operating expenses is primarily a result of lease termination fees incurred\nfor the St. Augustine Outlet Center. See Investment Impairment - St. Augustine Outlet Center\u201d above.\nReal\nestate taxes\nReal\nestate taxes decreased by $0.3 million to $0.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to $0.6 million for the same\nperiod in 2020. The decrease reflects lower real estate taxes resulting from the sale of the Santa Clara Data Center and certain\nland parcels adjacent to the St. Augustine Outlet Center.\nGeneral\nand administrative expenses\nGeneral\nand administrative expenses decreased by $0.5 million to $2.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to $3.1 million\nfor the same period in 2020 principally due to lower bad debt expense in 2021.\nImpairment\ncharge\nDuring\nthe third quarter of 2021, we recorded a non-cash impairment charge of $11.3 million to reduce the carrying value of our St. Augustine\nOutlet Center to its estimated fair value as of September 30, 2021. See Investment Impairment - St. Augustine Outlet Center\u201d\nabove.\nDepreciation\nand amortization\nDepreciation\nand amortization increased by $1.5 million to $5.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to $4.0 million for the\nsame period in 2020. The increase in depreciation and amortization reflects changes to the estimated remaining useful lives of\ncertain tenant-related building improvements resulting from lease terminations for the St. Augustine Outlet Center. See Investment\nImpairment - St. Augustine Outlet Center\u201d above.\nInterest\nand dividend income\nInterest\nand dividend income increased by $0.8 million to $13.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to $13.0 million\nfor the same period in 2020. The increase primarily reflects higher interest income earned on our notes receivable of $0.3 million\nand higher interest and dividend income earned on our available cash and investments in marketable securities of $0.7 million,\npartially offset by lower investment income of $0.2 million from our Preferred Investments.\nInterest\nexpense\nInterest\nexpense, including amortization of deferred financing costs, decreased by $0.4 million to $2.6 million for the year ended December\n31, 2021 compared to $3.0 million for the same period in 2020. During the year ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, $8.2 million\nand $7.8 million, respectively, of interest was capitalized to construction in progress for our development projects.\nGain\non disposition of real estate, net\nOur\ngain on disposition of real estate, net of $3.9 million during the year ended December 31, 2021 primarily is attributable to a\nsecond quarter gain of $3.6 million recognized in connection with the disposition of a parcel of land adjacent to St. Augustine\nOutlet Center and a third quarter gain of $0.2 million recognized in connection with the disposition of the Santa Clara Data Center.\nOur\ngain on disposition of real estate, net of $1.6 million during the year ended December 31, 2020 consists of a second quarter gain\nof $1.6 million recognized in connection with the disposition of a parcel of land adjacent to the St. Augustine Outlet Center.\nUnrealized\ngain/(loss) on marketable equity securities\nDuring\nthe year ended December 31, 2021, we recorded unrealized gains on marketable equity securities of $16.5 million and during the\nyear ended December 31, 2020, we recorded unrealized losses on marketable equity securities of $12.2 million. These unrealized\ngains and losses represented the change in the fair value of our marketable equity securities during those periods.\nGain/(loss)\non sale and redemption of marketable securities\nDuring\nthe year ended December 31, 2021, we recorded a gain on the sale of marketable securities of $5.9 million and during the year\nended December 31, 2020, we recorded a loss on the sale of marketable securities of $0.2 million. These gains and losses represented\nthe difference between the sales price and carrying value of our marketable securities sold during those periods.\nNoncontrolling\ninterests\nThe\nnet earnings allocated to noncontrolling interests relates to (i) parties of the Company that hold units in the Operating Partnership,\n(ii) the interest in PRO-DFJV Holdings LLC ( PRO\u201d) held by our Sponsor, (iii) the ownership interests in 50-01 2nd\nSt. Associates LLC (the 2nd Street Joint Venture\u201d) held by our Sponsor and other affiliates and (iv) the ownership\ninterest in various joint ventures held by affiliates of our Sponsor that have originated nonrecourse loans to unaffiliated third-party\nborrowers.\nFinancial\nCondition, Liquidity and Capital Resources\nOverview:\nAs\nof December 31, 2021, we had $39.4 million of cash on hand, $3.2 million of restricted cash and $62.8 million of marketable securities.\nWe also have the ability to make draws from a line of credit up to $20.0 million, subject to certain conditions (see Notes\nPayable - Line of Credit\u201d). We currently believe that these items along with rental income from our operating properties;\ninterest and dividend income earned on our marketable securities, notes receivable and preferred investments; as well as proceeds\nreceived from the repayment of the notes receivable and redemptions of the preferred investments will be sufficient to satisfy\nour expected cash requirements primarily consisting our anticipated operating expenses, scheduled debt service, capital expenditures\n(including certain of our development activities) and distributions to our shareholders, if any, required to maintain our status\nas a REIT for the foreseeable future. However, we may also obtain additional funds through selective asset dispositions, joint\nventure arrangements, new borrowings and refinancing of existing debt.\nWe\ncurrently have two development projects (see Development Activities\u201d). With respect to our Lower East Side Moxy Hotel,\nwhich is currently under construction and expected to open during the fourth quarter of 2022, we have obtained construction financings\nand the remaining costs associated with the construction of the Lower East Side Moxy Hotel are expected to be funded from the\nremaining availability under such construction financings. See Development Activities - Lower East Side Moxy Hotel\u201d\nfor additional information. Our Exterior Street Project is currently under development and we expect to seek construction financing\nto fund a substantial portion of its future development and construction costs. See Development Activities - Exterior\nStreet Project\u201d for additional information.\nOur\nborrowings consist of single-property mortgages as well as mortgages cross-collateralized by a pool of properties. We typically\nhave obtained level payment financing, meaning that the amount of debt service payable would be substantially the same each year.\nAs such, most of the mortgages on our properties provide for a so-called balloon\u201d payment and are at a fixed interest\nrate.\nAdditionally,\nin order to leverage our investments in marketable securities and seek a higher rate of return, we have access to borrowings under\na margin loan and line of credit collateralized by the securities held with the financial institution that provided the margin\nloan and line of credit as well as a portion of our Marco OP Units. These loans are due on demand and any outstanding balance\nmust be paid upon the liquidation of securities.\nOur\ncharter provides that the aggregate amount of borrowing, both secured and unsecured, may not exceed 300% of net assets in the\nabsence of a satisfactory showing that a higher level is appropriate, the approval of the Board of Directors and disclosure to\nstockholders. Net assets means our total assets, other than intangibles, at cost before deducting depreciation or other non-cash\nreserves less our total liabilities, calculated at least quarterly on a basis consistently applied. Any excess in borrowing over\nsuch 300% of net assets level must be approved by a majority of our independent directors and disclosed to our stockholders in\nour next quarterly report to stockholders, along with justification for such excess. As of December 31, 2021, our total borrowings\nof $171.8 million represented 53% of net assets.\nAny\nfuture properties that we may acquire or investments we may make may be funded through a combination of borrowings, proceeds generated\nfrom the sale and redemption of our marketable securities, available for sale, proceeds received from the selective disposition\nof our properties and proceeds received from the redemption of our preferred investments in related parties. These borrowings\nmay consist of single-property mortgages as well as mortgages cross-collateralized by a pool of properties. Such mortgages may\nbe put in place either at the time we acquire a property or subsequent to our purchasing a property for cash. In addition, we\nmay acquire properties that are subject to existing indebtedness where we choose to assume the existing mortgages. Generally,\nthough not exclusively, we intend to seek to encumber our properties with debt, which will be on a non-recourse basis. This means\nthat a lender's rights on default will generally be limited to foreclosing on the property. However, we may, at our discretion,\nsecure recourse financing or provide a guarantee to lenders if we believe this may result in more favorable terms. When we give\na guaranty for a property owning entity, we will be responsible to the lender for the satisfaction of the indebtedness if it is\nnot paid by the property owning entity.\nWe\nmay also obtain lines of credit to be used to acquire properties or real estate-related assets. These lines of credit will be\nat prevailing market terms and will be repaid from proceeds from the sale or refinancing of properties, working capital or permanent\nfinancing. Our Sponsor or its affiliates may guarantee the lines of credit although they will not be obligated to do so. We expect\nthat such properties may be purchased by our Sponsor's affiliates on our behalf, in our name, in order to minimize the imposition\nof a transfer tax upon a transfer of such properties to us.\nWe have\nvarious agreements, including an advisory agreement, with the Advisor to pay certain fees in exchange for services performed by\nthe Advisor and/or its affiliated entities. Additionally, our ability to secure financing and our real estate operations are dependent\nupon our Advisor and its affiliates to perform such services as provided in these agreements.\nIn\naddition to meeting working capital needs and distributions, if any, to our stockholders, our capital resources are used to make\ncertain payments to our Advisor and our Property Manager, including payments related to asset acquisition fees, development fees\nand leasing commissions, asset management fees, the reimbursement of acquisition related expenses to our Advisor and property\nmanagement fees. We also reimburse our Advisor and its affiliates for actual expenses it incurs for administrative and other services\nprovided to us. Additionally, the Operating Partnership may be required to make distributions to Lightstone SLP, LLC, an affiliate\nof the Advisor.\nThe\nadvisory agreement has a one-year term and is renewable for an unlimited number of successive one-year periods upon the mutual\nconsent of the Advisor and our independent directors.\nThe\nfollowing table represents the fees incurred associated with the payments to our Advisor and its affiliates:\nTable 35: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>For\nthe\nYear Ended </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>December 31,\n2021 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>December 31,\n2020 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Asset\nmanagement fees (general and administrative costs) </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>849 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>919 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Property\nmanagement fees (property operating expenses) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>362 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>388 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Development\nfees and cost reimbursement(1) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3,595 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,337 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Total </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>4,806 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2,644 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 36: <table><tr> <td> </td> <td>(1) </td> <td>Development\nfees and development costs that we reimburse our Advisor for are capitalized and are\nincluded in the carrying value of the associated development project and classified as\nconstruction in progress on the consolidated balance sheets.

In connection with the Company's initial public offering, Lightstone\nSLP, LLC purchased an aggregate of $30.0 million of SLP Units. These SLP Units, the purchase price of which will be repaid only\nafter stockholders receive a stated preferred return and their net investment, entitle Lightstone SLP, LLC to a portion of any\nregular distributions made by the Operating Partnership.\nDuring\nboth the of the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, distributions of $2.1 million were declared and paid on the SLP units.\nOur\ncharter states that our operating expenses, excluding offering costs, property operating expenses and real estate taxes, as well\nas acquisition fees and non-cash related items ( Qualified Operating Expenses\u201d) are to be less than the greater of\n2% of our average invested net assets or 25% of net income. For the year ended December 31, 2021, our Qualified Operating Expenses\nwere less than the greater of 2% of our average invested net assets or 25% of net income.\nIn\naddition, our charter states that our acquisition fees and expenses shall not exceed 6% of the contractual purchase price or in\nthe case of a mortgage, 6% of funds advanced unless approved by a majority of the independent directors. For the year ended December\n31, 2021, the acquisition fees and acquisition expenses were less than 6% of each of the contract prices.\nSummary\nof Cash Flows.\nThe\nfollowing summary discussion of our cash flows is based on the consolidated statements of cash flows and is not meant to be an\nall-inclusive discussion of the changes in our cash flows for the periods presented below:\nTable 37: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Year\nEnded\nDecember 31,\n2021 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Year\nEnded\nDecember 31,\n2020 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Cash\nflows provided by operating activities </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>10,001 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>10,144 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Cash\nflows provided by/(used in) investing activities </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>49,161 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(54,493 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Cash\nflows (used in)/provided by financing activities </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(63,411 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>11,390 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Net\nchange in cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(4,249 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(32,959 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Cash,\ncash equivalents and restricted cash, beginning of year </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>46,841 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>79,800 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Cash,\ncash equivalents and restricted cash, end of year </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>42,592 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>46,841 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nOperating\nactivities\nThe\nnet cash provided by operating activities of $10.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 consists of the following:\nTable 38: <table><tr> <td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>cash\ninflows of $9.8 million from our net income after adjustment for non-cash items; and </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 39: <table><tr> <td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>cash\ninflows of $0.2 million associated with the net changes in operating assets and liabilities. </td> </tr>\n</table>\nInvesting\nactivities\nThe\nnet cash provided by investing activities of $49.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 consists primarily of the following:\nTable 40: <table><tr> <td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>purchases\nof investment property of $59.5 million; </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 41: <table><tr> <td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>net\nproceeds from the sale of marketable securities of $5.2 million </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 42: <table><tr> <td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>proceeds\nfrom notes receivable of $83.2 million; and </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 43: <table><tr> <td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>proceeds\nfrom the sale of investment property of $20.2 million. </td> </tr>\n</table>\nFinancing\nactivities\nThe\nnet cash used in financing activities of $63.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 is primarily related to the following:\nTable 44: <table><tr> <td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>debt\nprincipal payments of $89.1 million; </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 45: <table><tr> <td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>proceeds\nfrom mortgage financing of $67.3 million; </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 46: <table><tr> <td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>payment\nof loan fees and expenses of $6.1 million; </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 47: <table><tr> <td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>redemption\nand cancellation of common shares of $1.6 million; </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 48: <table><tr> <td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>distributions\nto our noncontrolling interests of $18.8 million; and </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 49: <table><tr> <td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>distributions\nto our common shareholders of $15.3 million. </td> </tr>\n</table>\nDevelopment\nActivities\nLower\nEast Side Moxy Hotel\nOn\nDecember 3, 2018, we, through a subsidiary of the Operating Partnership, acquired three adjacent parcels of land located at 147-151\nBowery, New York, New York from unaffiliated third parties for aggregate consideration of $56.5 million, excluding closing and\nother acquisition related costs. Additionally, on December 6, 2018, we, though a subsidiary of the Operating Partnership, acquired\ncertain air rights located at 329 Broome Street, New York, New York from an unaffiliated third party for $2.4 million, excluding\nclosing and other acquisition related costs. We are using the land and air rights in connection with the development and construction\nof a 296-room Marriott Moxy hotel (the Lower East Side Moxy Hotel\u201d). On June 3, 2021, the Company entered into a\ndevelopment agreement (the Development Agreement\u201d) with an affiliate of the Advisor (the Moxy Lower East Side\nDeveloper\u201d) pursuant to which the Lower East Side Moxy Developer will be paid a development fee equal to 3% of hard and\nsoft costs incurred in connection with the development and construction of the Lower East Side Moxy Hotel. Additionally on June\n3, 2021, the Company obtained construction financing for the Lower East Side Moxy Hotel. The Lower East Side Moxy Hotel is currently\nunder construction and expected to open during the fourth quarter of 2022.\nPreviously\non December 3, 2018, we had entered into a mortgage loan which was collateralized by the Lower East Side Moxy Hotel (the Lower\nEast Side Moxy Mortgage\u201d) for $35.6 million. The Lower East Side Moxy Mortgage had an initial term of two years, bore interest\nat the London Interbank Offered Rate ( LIBOR\u201d) + 4.25%, subject to a 6.63% floor, and required monthly interest-only\npayments through its stated maturity with the entire unpaid balance due upon maturity. In November 2020 the maturity date of Lower\nEast Side Moxy Mortgage was extended to March 3, 2021 and in March 2021 it was further extended until June 3, 2021, on which date\nit was then repaid in full as discussed below.\nOn\nJune 3, 2021, we, through a wholly owned subsidiary, closed on a recourse construction loan facility (the Moxy Senior Loan\u201d)\nproviding for up to $90.0 million of funds for the development and construction of the Lower East Side Moxy Hotel. At closing,\n$35.6 million of proceeds were initially advanced under the Moxy Senior Loan, which were used to repay in full the Lower East\nSide Moxy Mortgage. The Moxy Senior Loan bears interest at LIBOR + 7.50%, subject to an 8.00% floor, and initially matures on\nJune 3, 2024, with two one-year extension options, subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions. The Moxy Senior Loan is\ncollateralized by the Lower East Side Moxy Hotel. As of December 31, 2021, the outstanding principal balance of the Moxy Senior\nLoan was $35.6 million and the remaining availability under the facility was up to $54.4 million.\nSimultaneously\non June 3, 2021, we, through the same wholly owned subsidiary, also entered into a mezzanine construction loan facility (the Moxy\nJunior Loan\u201d and together with the Moxy Senior Loan, the Moxy Construction Loans\u201d) providing for up to $40.0\nmillion of additional funds for the development and construction of the Lower East Side Moxy Hotel. The Moxy Junior Loan bears\ninterest at LIBOR + 13.50%, subject to a 14.00% floor, and initially matures on June 3, 2024, with two one-year extension options\nsubject to the satisfaction of certain conditions. The Moxy Junior Loan is subordinate to the Moxy Senior loan but also collateralized\nby the Lower East Side Moxy Hotel. We provided a principal guarantee of up to $7.0 million with respect to the Moxy Junior Loan.\nAs of December 31, 2021, the outstanding principal balance of the Moxy Junior Loan was $24.6 million and the remaining availability\nunder the facility was up to $15.4 million.\nFuture\ndraws to cover the costs associated with the development and construction of the Lower East Side Moxy Hotel will first be advanced\nunder the Moxy Junior Loan until it has been fully funded and thereafter, funds will be advanced under the remaining availability\nof the Moxy Senior Loan.\nIn\nconnection with the Moxy Construction Loans, we provided certain completion and carry cost guarantees. We also entered into an\ninterest rate cap agreement pursuant to which the LIBOR rate will be capped at 3.00% on the Moxy Senior Loan through June 3, 2024\nat a cost of $0.2 million. Furthermore, in connection with the Moxy Construction Loans, we paid $5.3 million of loan fees and\nexpenses and accrued $1.1 million of loan exit fees which are due at the initial maturity date and are included in accounts payable,\naccrued expenses and other liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets as of December 31, 2021.\nExterior\nStreet Project\nOn\nFebruary 27, 2019, we, through subsidiaries of the Operating Partnership, acquired two adjacent parcels of land located at 355\nand 399 Exterior Street, New York, New York from unaffiliated third parties for an aggregate purchase price of $59.0 million,\nexcluding closing and other acquisition related costs. In September 2021, we subsequently acquired an additional adjacent parcel\nof land at cost from an affiliate of our Advisor for $1.0 million in order to achieve certain zoning compliance. We are using\nthe land parcels for the development of a multi-family residential property (the Exterior Street Project\u201d).\nOn\nMarch 29, 2019, we entered into a $35.0 million loan (the Exterior Street Loan\u201d) which commencing on October 10,\n2020 bears interest at LIBOR + 2.25% through its scheduled maturity date. The Exterior Street Loan requires monthly interest-only\npayments with the outstanding principal balance due in full at its maturity date. The Exterior Street Loan was initially scheduled\nto mature on April 9, 2021 but during April 2021, its maturity date was further extended to April 9, 2022. Additionally, on December\n21, 2021, the loan agreement was amended to provide an additional six-month extension and an additional $7.0 million loan (the\nExterior Street Supplemental Loan\u201d and collectively with the Exterior Street Loan, the Exterior Street Loans\u201d)\nwhich bears interest at LIBOR + 2.50% and requires monthly interest-only payments through its maturity date. The Exterior Street\nLoans are scheduled to mature on April 9, 2022, with a six-month extension option, subject to certain conditions and are collateralized\nby the Exterior Street Project.\nThe\nfollowing is a summary of the amounts incurred and capitalized to development projects on the consolidated balance sheet for the\nLower East Side Moxy Hotel and the Exterior Street Project as of December 31, 2021:\nTable 50: <table> <tr> <td>Development\nProject </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Lower\nEast Side Moxy Hotel </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>146,747 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Exterior\nStreet Project </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>87,467 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Total </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>234,214 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTo-date\nthe ongoing COVID-19 pandemic as well as other economic conditions and uncertainties have not had a significant impact on our\ndevelopment activities associated with either the Lower East Side Moxy Hotel or the Exterior Street Project. As discussed above,\nwe have already obtained construction financing for the Lower East Side Moxy Hotel and it is currently under construction and\nexpected to open during the fourth quarter of 2022. However, with respect to our Exterior Street Project which is currently under\ndevelopment, we currently expect to seek construction financing to fund a substantial portion of its future development and construction\ncosts. The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic as well as other economic conditions and uncertainties may (i) affect our ability to obtain\nconstruction financing, and/or (ii) cause delays or increase costs associated with building materials or construction services\nnecessary for construction, which could adversely impact our ability to either ultimately commence and/or complete construction\nas planned, on budget or at all for the Exterior Street Project.\nAlthough\nwe currently believe our capital resources are sufficient to fund our expected development activities for the next 12 months,\nthere can be no assurance we will be successful in obtaining construction financing at favorable terms, if at all.\nPreferred\nInvestments\nWe\nhave Preferred Investments that entitle us to monthly preferred distributions. The Preferred Investments are classified as held-to-maturity\nsecurities, recorded at cost and included in investments in related parties on the consolidated balance sheets. The fair value\nof these investments approximated their carrying values based on market rates for similar instruments. During the year ended December\n31, 2020, we redeemed $11.0 million of the 40 East End Avenue Preferred Investment and the entire remaining Miami Moxy Preferred\nInvestment of $9.0 million.\nThe\nPreferred Investments are summarized as follows:\nTable 51: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Preferred\nInvestment Balance </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Investment\nIncome(1) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Dividend </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>As\nof\nDecember 31, </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>As\nof\nDecember 31, </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>For\nthe\nYear Ended\nDecember 31, </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Preferred\nInvestments </td> <td> </td> <td>Rate </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2021 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2021 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>40\nEast End Avenue </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>12 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>6,000 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>6,000 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>730 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>886 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>East\n11th Street </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>12 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>8,500 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>8,500 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,034 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,040 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Miami\nMoxy </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>12 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>45 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Total\nPreferred Investments </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>14,500 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>14,500 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,764 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,971 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nNote:\nTable 52: <table><tr> <td> </td> <td>(1) </td> <td>Included\nin interest and dividend income on the statements of operations. </td> </tr>\n</table>\nNotes\nReceivable\nWe\nformed certain joint ventures (collectively, the NR Joint Ventures\u201d) between wholly-owned subsidiaries of the Operating\nPartnership (collectively, the NR Subsidiaries\u201d) and affiliates of the Sponsor (the NR Affiliates\u201d)\nwhich have originated nonrecourse loans (collectively, the Joint Venture Promissory Notes\u201d) to unaffiliated third-party\nborrowers (collectively, the Joint Venture Borrowers\u201d).\nWe\ndetermined that the NR Joint Ventures are VIEs and the NR Subsidiaries are the primary beneficiaries. Since the NR Subsidiaries\nare the primary beneficiaries, beginning on the applicable date of formation, we consolidated the operating results and financial\ncondition of the NR Joint Ventures and accounted for the respective ownership interests of the NR Affiliates as noncontrolling\ninterests.\nThe\nJoint Venture Promissory Notes generally provide for monthly interest at a prescribed variable rate, subject to a floor. In connection\nwith the initial funding of the Joint Venture Promissory Notes, the NR Joint Ventures receive origination fees (ranging from 1.00%\nto 1.50%) based on the principal commitment under the loan and retain a portion of the loan proceeds to establish a reserve for\ninterest and other items (the Loan Reserves\u201d). The Joint Venture Promissory Notes are recorded in notes receivable,\nnet on the consolidated balance sheets.\nThe\nJoint Venture Promissory Notes generally have an initial term of one or two years and may provide for additional one-year extension\noptions subject to satisfaction of certain conditions, including the funding of additional Loan Reserves and payment of extension\nfees. The Joint Venture Promissory Notes are collateralized by either the membership interests of the Joint Venture Borrowers\nin the borrowing entity or the underlying real property being developed by the Joint Venture Borrower.\nThe\nJoint Venture Promissory Notes are recorded in notes receivable, net on the consolidated balance sheets. The origination fees\nreceived are presented in the consolidated balance sheets as a direct deduction from the carrying value of the Joint\nVenture Promissory Notes and are amortized into interest income, using a straight-line method that approximates the effective\ninterest method, over the initial term of the Joint Venture Promissory Notes. The Loan Reserves are presented in\nthe consolidated balance sheets as a direct deduction from the carrying value of the Joint Venture Promissory Notes and\nare applied against the monthly interest

their shares of common stock back to us, subject to restrictions.\nOn\nMarch 25, 2020, the Board of Directors amended the SRP to remove stockholder notice requirements and also approved the suspension\nof all redemptions effective immediately.\nEffective\nMarch 15, 2021 and May 14, 2021, the Board of Directors partially reopened the SRP to allow, subject to various conditions as\nset forth below, for redemptions submitted in connection with a stockholder's death and hardship, respectively, and set\nthe price for all such purchases to our current NAV per Share, as determined by the Board of Directors and reported by the Company\nfrom time to time. Deaths that occurred subsequent to January 1, 2020 were eligible for consideration, subject to certain conditions.\nBeginning January 1, 2022, requests for redemptions in connection with a stockholder's death must be submitted and received\nby us within one year of the stockholder's date of death for consideration.\nAt\nthe above noted dates, the Board of Directors established that on an annual basis, we would not redeem in excess of 0.5% of the\nnumber of shares outstanding as of the end of the preceding year for either death or hardship redemptions, respectively. Additionally,\nredemption requests generally would be processed on a quarterly basis and would be subject to pro ration if either type of redemption\nrequests exceeded the annual limitation.\nFor\nthe year ended December 31, 2021, we repurchased 143,918 shares of common stock for $11.18 per share, pursuant to the SRP. For\nthe period from January 1 through March 24, 2020, we repurchased 287,987 shares of common stock for $10.87 per share, pursuant\nto the SRP.\nOn\nMarch 18, 2022, The Board of Directors approved an increase to the annual threshold for death redemptions from up to 0.5% to 1.0%.\nTender Offer\nWe\ncommenced a tender offer on June 15, 2020, pursuant to which we offered to acquire up to 225,000 of our shares of common stock\nat a purchase price of $5.00 per share, or $1.1 million in the aggregate (the 2020 Tender Offer\u201d). Pursuant to the\nterms of the 2020 Tender Offer, which expired on July 24, 2020, we repurchased 0.1 million shares of our common stock for an aggregate\nof $0.3 million in August 2020.\nDistribution\nReinvestment Program ( DRIP\u201d)\nOur\ndistribution reinvestment program ( DRIP\u201d) provides our shareholders with an opportunity to purchase additional shares\nof our common stock at a discount by reinvesting distributions. Under our distribution reinvestment program, a shareholder may\nacquire, from time to time, additional shares of our common stock by reinvesting cash distributions payable by us to such shareholder,\nwithout incurring any brokerage commission, fees or service charges.\nThe\nDRIP had been suspended since 2015 until our DRIP Registration Statement on Form S-3D was filed and became effective as amended\nand restated, under the Securities Act of 1933 on October 25, 2018.\nPursuant\nto the DRIP following its reactivation, our stockholders who elect to participate may invest all or a portion of the cash distributions\nthat we pay them on shares of our common stock in additional shares of our common stock without paying any fees or commissions.\nThe purchase price for shares under the DRIP will be equal to 95% of our current NAV per Share, as determined by the Board of\nDirectors and reported by us from time to time. On December 16, 2021, the Board of Directors determined our NAV per Share of $11.75,\nas of September 30, 2021, which resulted in a purchase price for shares under the DRIP of $11.16 per share. As of December 31,\n2021, 9.9 million shares remain available for issuance under our DRIP.\nThe\nBoard of Directors reserves the right to terminate the DRIP for any reason without cause by providing written notice of termination\nof the DRIP to all participants.\nDistributions\nDeclared by the Board of Directors\nCommon\nShares\nDuring\nthe years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, distributions on our Common Shares were declared quarterly, for each calendar quarter\nend, at the pro rata equivalent of an annual distribution of $0.70 per share, or an annualized rate of 7.0% assuming a purchase\nprice of $10.00 per share, to stockholders of record at the close of business on the last day of the quarter-end. All distributions\nwere paid on or about the 15th day of the month following the quarter-end.\nTotal\ndistributions declared during both of the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 were $15.6 million.\nOn\nMarch 18, 2022, the Board of Directors authorized and declared a Common Share distribution of $0.175 per share for the quarterly\nperiod ending March 31, 2022. The quarterly distribution is the pro rata equivalent of an annual distribution of $0.70 per share,\nor an annualized rate of 7.0% assuming a purchase price of $10.00 per share. The distribution will be paid on or about the 15th\nday of the month following the quarter-end to stockholders of record at the close of business on the last day of the quarter-end.\nThe stockholders have an option to elect the receipt of shares under the Company's DRIP.\nSLP\nUnits\nFor\nboth of the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, total distributions declared and paid on the SLP Units were $2.1 million.\nAdditionally, on March 18, 2022, the Board of Directors declared a quarterly distribution for the quarterly period ending March\n31, 2022 on the SLP Units at an annualized rate of 7.0%. Any future distributions on the SLP Units will always be subordinated\nuntil stockholders receive a stated preferred return.\nContractual\nObligations\nThe\nfollowing is a summary of our contractual obligations outstanding over the next five years and thereafter as of December 31, 2021.\nTable 60: <table> <tr> <td>Contractual\nObligations </td> <td> </td> <td>2022 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2023 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2024 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2025 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2026 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Thereafter </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Total </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Mortgage\nPayable </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>43,389 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,454 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>126,910 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>171,753 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Interest\nPayments1 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>9,786 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>9,446 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6,169 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>25,401 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Total\nContractual Obligations </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>53,175 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>10,900 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>133,079 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>197,154 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 61: <table><tr> <td> </td> <td>1) </td> <td>These\namounts represent future interest payments related to mortgage payable obligations based\non the fixed and variable interest rates specified in the associated debt agreement.\nAll variable rate debt agreements are based on the one month LIBOR rate.

The Margin Loan, which is due on demand, bears interest at LIBOR + 0.85% (0.95% as of December 31, 2021)\nand is collateralized by the marketable securities in our account. The amounts available to us under the Margin Loan are at the\ndiscretion of the financial institution and not limited to the amount of collateral in our account. There were no amounts outstanding\nunder the Margin Loan as of December 31, 2021 and 2020.\nLine\nof Credit\nWe\nhave a non-revolving credit facility (the Line of Credit\u201d) with a financial institution that provides for borrowings\nup to a maximum of $20.0 million, subject to a 55% loan-to-value ratio based on the fair value of the underlying collateral, matures\non November 30, 2022 and bears interest at LIBOR + 1.35% (1.45% as of December 31, 2021). The Line of Credit is collateralized\nby an aggregate of 209,243 of Marco OP Units and Marco II OP Units and was guaranteed by PRO. As of December 31, 2021, the amount\nof borrowings available to be drawn under the Line of Credit was $18.4 million. No amounts were outstanding under the Line of\nCredit as of both December 31, 2021 and 2020.\nLIBOR\nThe\nMoxy Construction Loans, Exterior Street Loans, Margin Loan and Line of Credit are indexed to LIBOR. In late 2021, it was announced\nLIBOR interest rates will cease publication altogether by June 30, 2023. We have and intend continue to incorporate relatively\nstandardized replacement rate provisions into our LIBOR-indexed debt documents, including a spread adjustment mechanism designed\nto equate to the current LIBOR all in\u201d rate. There is significant uncertainty with respect to the implementation\nof the phase out and what alternative indexes will be adopted which will ultimately be determined by the market as a whole. It\ntherefore remains uncertain how such changes will be implemented and the effects such changes would have on us and the financial\nmarkets generally.\nDebt\nMaturities\nThe\nExterior Street Loans (outstanding principal balance of $42.0 million as of December 31, 2021) mature on April 9, 2022. We currently\nintend to extend or refinance the Exterior Street Loans on or before their maturity date.\nHowever,\nif we are unable to extend or refinance any of our maturing indebtedness at favorable terms, we will look to repay the then outstanding\nbalance with available cash and/or proceeds from selective asset sales. We have no additional significant maturities of mortgage\ndebt over the next 12 months.\nFunds\nfrom Operations and Modified Funds from Operations\nThe\nhistorical accounting convention used for real estate assets requires straight-line depreciation of buildings, improvements, and\nstraight-line amortization of intangibles, which implies that the value of a real estate asset diminishes predictably over time.\nWe believe that, because real estate values historically rise and fall with market conditions, including, but not limited to,\ninflation, interest rates, the business cycle, unemployment and consumer spending, presentations of operating results for a REIT\nusing the historical accounting convention for depreciation and certain other items may be less informative.\nBecause\nof these factors, the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts ( NAREIT\u201d), an industry trade group, has\npublished a standardized measure of performance known as funds from operations ( FFO\u201d), which is used in the REIT\nindustry as a supplemental performance measure. We believe FFO, which excludes certain items such as real estate-related depreciation\nand amortization, is an appropriate supplemental measure of a REIT's operating performance. FFO is not equivalent to our\nnet income or loss as determined under GAAP.\nWe\ncalculate FFO, a non-GAAP measure, consistent with the standards established over time by the Board of Governors of NAREIT, as\nrestated in a White Paper approved by the Board of Governors of NAREIT effective in December 2018 (the White Paper\u201d).\nThe White Paper defines FFO as net income or loss computed in accordance with GAAP, excluding depreciation and amortization related\nto real estate, gains and losses from the sale of certain real estate assets, gains and losses from change in control and impairment\nwrite-downs of certain real estate assets and investments in entities when the impairment is directly attributable to decreases\nin the value of depreciable real estate held by the entity. Our FFO calculation complies with NAREIT's definition.\nWe\nbelieve that the use of FFO provides a more complete understanding of our performance to investors and to management, and\nreflects the impact on our operations from trends in occupancy rates, rental rates, operating costs, general and administrative\nexpenses, and interest costs, which may not be immediately apparent from net income.\nChanges\nin the accounting and reporting promulgations under GAAP that were put into effect in 2009 subsequent to the establishment\nof NAREIT's definition of FFO, such as the change to expense as incurred rather than capitalize and depreciate acquisition\nfees and expenses incurred for business combinations, have prompted an increase in cash-settled expenses, specifically acquisition\nfees and expenses, as items that are expensed under GAAP across all industries. These changes had a particularly significant impact\non publicly registered, non-listed REITs, which typically have a significant amount of acquisition activity in the early\npart of their existence, particularly during the period when they are raising capital through ongoing initial public offerings.\nBecause\nof these factors, the Investment Program Association (the IPA\u201d), an industry trade group, published a standardized\nmeasure of performance known as modified funds from operations ( MFFO\u201d), which the IPA has recommended as a supplemental\nmeasure for publicly registered, non-listed REITs. MFFO is designed to be reflective of the ongoing operating performance of publicly\nregistered, non-listed REITs by adjusting for those costs that are more reflective of acquisitions and investment activity, along\nwith other items the IPA believes are not indicative of the ongoing operating performance of a publicly registered, non-listed\nREIT, such as straight-lining of rents as required by GAAP. We believe it is appropriate to use MFFO as a supplemental measure\nof operating performance because we believe that both before and after we have deployed all of our offering proceeds and\nare no longer incurring a significant amount of acquisition fees or other related costs, it reflects the impact on our operations\nfrom trends in occupancy rates, rental rates, operating costs, general and administrative expenses, and interest costs, which\nmay not be immediately apparent from net income. MFFO is not equivalent to our net income or loss as determined under GAAP.\nWe\ndefine MFFO, a non-GAAP measure, consistent with the IPA's Guideline 2010-01, Supplemental Performance Measure for Publicly\nRegistered, Non-Listed REITs: Modified Funds from Operations (the Practice Guideline\u201d) issued by the IPA in November\n2010. The Practice Guideline defines MFFO as FFO further adjusted for acquisition and transaction-related fees and expenses and\nother items. In calculating MFFO, we follow the Practice Guideline and exclude acquisition and transaction-related fees and expenses\n(which includes costs incurred in connection with strategic alternatives), amounts relating to deferred rent receivables and amortization\nof market lease and other intangibles, net (which are adjusted in order to reflect such payments from a GAAP accrual basis to\na cash basis of disclosing the rent and lease payments), accretion of discounts and amortization of premiums on debt investments\nand borrowings, mark-to-market adjustments included in net income (including gains or losses incurred on assets held for sale),\ngains or losses included in net income from the extinguishment or sale of debt, hedges, foreign exchange, derivatives or securities\nholdings where trading of such holdings is not a fundamental attribute of the business plan, unrealized gains or losses resulting\nfrom consolidation from, or deconsolidation to, equity accounting, and after adjustments for consolidated and unconsolidated partnerships\nand joint ventures, with such adjustments calculated to reflect MFFO on the same basis. Certain of the above adjustments\nare also made to reconcile net income (loss) to net cash provided by (used in) operating activities, such as for the amortization\nof a premium and accretion of a discount on debt and securities investments, amortization of fees, any unrealized gains (losses)\non derivatives, securities or other investments, as well as other adjustments.\nMFFO\nexcludes non-recurring impairment of real estate-related investments. We assess the credit quality of our investments and adequacy\nof reserves on a quarterly basis, or more frequently as necessary. Significant judgment is required in this analysis. We consider\nthe estimated net recoverable value of a loan as well as other factors, including but not limited to the fair value of any collateral,\nthe amount and the status of any senior debt, the prospects for the borrower and the competitive situation of the region where\nthe borrower does business.\nWe\nbelieve that, because MFFO excludes costs that we consider more reflective of acquisition activities and other non-operating items,\nMFFO can provide, on a going-forward basis, an indication of the sustainability (that is, the capacity to continue to be maintained)\nof our operating performance after the period in which we are acquiring properties and once our portfolio is stabilized. We also\nbelieve that MFFO is a recognized measure of sustainable operating performance by the non-listed REIT industry and allows for\nan evaluation of our performance against other publicly registered, non-listed REITs.\nNot\nall REITs, including publicly registered, non-listed REITs, calculate FFO and MFFO the same way. Accordingly, comparisons with\nother REITs, including publicly registered, non-listed REITs, may not be meaningful. Furthermore, FFO and MFFO are not indicative\nof cash flow available to fund cash needs and should not be considered as an alternative to net income (loss) or income (loss)\nfrom continuing operations as determined under GAAP as an indication of our performance, as an alternative to cash flows from\noperations as an indication of our liquidity, or indicative of funds available to fund our cash needs including our ability to\nmake distributions to our stockholders. FFO and MFFO should be reviewed in conjunction with other GAAP measurements as an indication\nof our performance. FFO and MFFO should not be construed to be more relevant or accurate than the current GAAP methodology in\ncalculating net income or in its applicability in evaluating our operating performance. The methods utilized to evaluate the performance\nof a publicly registered, non-listed REIT under GAAP should be construed as more relevant measures of operational performance\nand considered more prominently than the non-GAAP measures, FFO and MFFO, and the adjustments to GAAP in calculating FFO and MFFO.\nNeither\nthe SEC, NAREIT, the IPA nor any other regulatory body or industry trade group has passed judgment on the acceptability of the\nadjustments that we use to calculate FFO or MFFO. In the future, NAREIT, the IPA or another industry trade group may publish updates to\nthe White Paper or the Practice Guidelines or the SEC or another regulatory body could standardize the allowable adjustments across\nthe publicly registered, non-listed REIT industry, and we would have to adjust our calculation and characterization of FFO or\nMFFO accordingly.\nThe\nbelow table illustrates the items deducted in the calculation of FFO and MFFO. Items are presented net of non-controlling interest\nportions where applicable.\nTable 62: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>For\nthe\nYears Ended </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td>

Acquisition fees and expenses under GAAP are considered operating expenses and\nas expenses included in the determination of net income and income from continuing operations,\nboth of which are performance measures under GAAP.

(the Lightstone REIT I\u201d), (together with the Operating Partnership (as defined below), the\nCompany\u201d, also referred to as we\u201d, our\u201d or us\u201d herein) has and expects to\ncontinue to acquire and operate or develop in the future, commercial, residential and hospitality properties and/or make real\nestate-related investments, principally in the United States. Our acquisitions and investments are, principally conducted through\nthe Operating Partnership, and may include both portfolios and individual properties.\nAs\nof December 31, 2021, we have ownership interests in (i) two consolidated operating properties, (ii) two consolidated development\nproperties and (iii) seven unconsolidated operating properties. With respect to our consolidated operating properties, we wholly\nown the St. Augustine Outlet Center, a retail property containing 0.3 million square feet of gross leasable area, and have a majority\nownership interest of 59.2% in Gantry Park Landing, a multi-family residential property containing 199 apartment units. With respect\nto our consolidated development properties, we wholly own two projects consisting of the Lower East Side Moxy Hotel and the Exterior\nStreet Project. We also hold a 2.5% ownership interest in seven hotel properties through a joint venture (the Joint Venture\u201d)\nwhich we account for using a measurement alternative under which the Joint Venture is measured at cost, adjusted for observable\nprice changes and impairments, if any. The Joint Venture is between us and the operating partnership of Lightstone Value Plus\nREIT II, Inc., a real estate investment trust also sponsored by our Sponsor, which has a 97.5% ownership interest in the Joint\nVenture. Furthermore, we have other real estate-related investments, including preferred contributions that were made pursuant\nto agreements with various related party entities (the Preferred Investments\u201d) and nonrecourse promissory notes made\nto unaffiliated third-parties. Our real estate investments have been and are expected to continue to be held by the Company alone\nor jointly with other parties.\nWe\ndo not have employees. We entered into an advisory agreement pursuant to which the Advisor supervises and manages our day-to-day\noperations and selects our real estate and real estate related investments, subject to oversight by our board of directors (the\nBoard of Directors\u201d). We pay the Advisor fees for services related to the investment and management of our assets,\nand we will reimburse the Advisor for certain expenses incurred on our behalf.\t\nTo\nmaintain our qualification as a REIT, we engage in certain activities through taxable REIT subsidiaries ( TRSs\u201d).\nAs such, we may still be subject to U.S. federal and state income and franchise taxes from these activities.\nAcquisitions\nand Investment Strategy\nWe\nhave, to date, acquired and/or developed residential, commercial and hospitality properties principally, all of which are located\nin the United States and also made other real estate-related investments. Our acquisitions have included both portfolios and individual\nproperties. Our current operating properties consist of one retail property (the St. Augustine Outlet Center) and one multi-family\nresidential property (Gantry Park Landing). We have also acquired various parcels of land and air rights related to the development\nand construction of real estate properties. Additionally, we have made preferred investments in related parties and originated\nnonrecourse loans to unaffiliated third-party borrowers.\nInvestments\nin real estate are generally made through the purchase of all or part of a fee simple ownership, or all or part of a leasehold\ninterest. We may also purchase limited partnership interests, limited liability company interests and other equity securities.\nWe may also enter into joint ventures with related parties for the acquisition, development or improvement of properties as well\nas general partnerships, co-tenancies and other participations with real estate developers, owners and others for the purpose\nof developing, owning and operating real properties. We will not enter into a joint venture to make an investment that we would\nnot be permitted to make on our own. Not more than 10% of our total assets will be invested in unimproved real property. For purposes\nof this paragraph, unimproved real properties\u201d does not include properties acquired for the purpose of producing\nrental or other operating income, properties under construction and properties for which development or construction is planned\nwithin one year.\nCurrent\nEnvironment\nOur\noperating results are substantially impacted by the overall health of local, U.S. national and global economies and may be influenced\nby market and other challenges. Additionally, our business and financial performance may be adversely affected by current and\nfuture economic and other conditions; including, but not limited to, availability or terms of financings, financial markets volatility,\npolitical upheaval or uncertainty, natural and man-made disasters, terrorism and acts of war, unfavorable changes in laws and\nregulations, outbreaks of contagious diseases, cybercrime, loss of key relationships, and recession.\nCOVID-19\nPandemic\nThe\nWorld Health Organization declared COVID-19 a global pandemic on March 11, 2020 and since that time many of the previously imposed\nrestrictions and other measures which were instituted in response have been subsequently reduced or lifted. However, the COVID-19\npandemic remains highly unpredictable and dynamic and its duration and extent continue to be dependent on various developments,\nsuch as the emergence of variants to the virus that may cause additional strains of COVID-19, the administration and ultimate\neffectiveness of vaccines, and the eventual timeline to achieve a sufficient level of herd immunity among the general population.\nAccordingly, the COVID-19 pandemic may continue to have negative effects on the health of the U.S. economy for the foreseeable\nfuture.\nAs\na result of previously imposed restrictions, we temporarily closed our St. Augustine Outlet Center from March 20, 2020 through\nMay 7, 2020. During the COVID-19 pandemic, the property's occupancy declined and because of limited leasing success, we\nbegan exploring various strategic alternatives for our St. Augustine Outlet Center and as a result determined during the third\nquarter of 2021 that we would no longer pursue leasing of space to tenants and therefore, entered into lease termination agreements\nwith certain tenants and also provided notice to our other tenants that we would not renew their leases at scheduled expiration.\nAs a result of this change in leasing strategy and resulting decrease in the fair value of the St. Augustine Outlet Center, we\nrecorded a non-cash impairment charge of $11.3 million during the third quarter of 2021. See Note 8 of the Notes to Consolidated\nFinancial Statements for additional information.\nAdditionally,\nas a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, during 2020 we saw deterioration in both the occupancy and rental rates for Gantry Park\nLanding, which is located on Long Island, New York, as the luxury rental market in the greater New York City metropolitan area\nwas negatively impacted. However, both occupancy and rental rates have improved considerably throughout 2021 and have returned\nto pre-COVID-19 levels.\nTo-date,\nthe COVID-19 pandemic has not had any significant impact on our development projects. Furthermore, our other real estate-related\ninvestments (both our preferred investments in related parties and nonrecourse loans made to unaffiliated third-party borrowers)\nalso relate to various development projects which are at different stages in their respective development process. These investments,\nwhich are subject to similar restrictions and other measures, have also not yet been significantly impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic.\nThe\noverall extent to which our business may be affected by the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic will largely depend on both current and\nfuture developments, all of which are highly uncertain and cannot be reasonably predicted.\nIf\nour operating properties, development projects and real estate-related investments are negatively impacted for an extended period\nbecause (i) occupancy levels and rental rates further decline, (ii) tenants are unable to pay their rent, (iii) borrowers are\nunable to pay scheduled debt service on notes receivable, (iv) development activities are delayed and/or (v) various related party\nentities are unable to pay monthly preferred distributions on our preferred investments in related parties, our business and financial\nresults could be materially and adversely impacted.\nWe\nare not currently aware of any other material trends or uncertainties, favorable or unfavorable, that may be reasonably anticipated\nto have a material impact on either capital resources or the revenues or income to be derived from our operations, other than\nthose referred to above or throughout this Form 10-K. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles\ngenerally accepted in the United States of America ( GAAP\u201d) requires the Company's management to make estimates\nand assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities\nand the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during a reporting period.\nCritical\nAccounting Estimates and Policies\nGeneral\nOur\nconsolidated financial statements, included in this annual report, include our accounts, the Operating Partnership and its subsidiaries (over\nwhich we exercise financial and operating control). All inter-company balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.\nThe\ndiscussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements,\nwhich have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of our financial statements requires us to make estimates and\njudgments about the effects of matters or future events that are inherently uncertain. These estimates and judgments may affect\nthe reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities.\nOn\nan ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates, including contingencies and litigation. We base these estimates on historical experience\nand on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable in the circumstances. These estimates form the basis for making\njudgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results\nmay differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.\nTo\nassist in understanding our results of operations and financial position, we have identified our critical accounting policies\nand discussed them below. These accounting policies are most important to the portrayal of our results and financial position,\neither because of the significance of the financial statement items to which they relate or because they require our management's\nmost difficult, subjective or complex judgments.\nRevenue\nRecognition\nOur\nrevenue, which is comprised largely of rental income, includes rents that tenants pay in accordance with the terms of their respective\nleases reported on a straight-line basis over the initial term of the lease. Since our leases may provide for rental increases\nat specified intervals, straight-line basis accounting requires us to record as an asset, and include in revenue, unbilled rent\nthat we only receive if the tenant makes all rent payments required through the expiration of the initial term of the lease.\nIn\naddition, we will defer the recognition of contingent rental income, such as percentage rents, until the specific target which\ntriggers the contingent rental income is achieved. Cost recoveries from tenants will be included in tenant recovery income in\nthe period the related costs are incurred.\nInvestments\nin Real Estate\nWe\ngenerally record investments in real estate at cost and capitalize improvements and replacements when they extend the useful life\nor improve the efficiency of the asset. We expense costs of ordinary repairs and maintenance as incurred. We compute depreciation\nusing the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the applicable real estate asset. We generally use estimated\nuseful lives of up to thirty-nine years for buildings and improvements, five to ten years for furniture and fixtures\nand the shorter of the useful life or the remaining lease term for tenant improvements and leasehold interests.\nWe\nmake subjective assessments as to the useful lives of our properties for purposes of determining the amount of depreciation to\nrecord on an annual basis with respect to our investments in real estate. These assessments have a direct impact on our net income\nbecause, if we were to shorten the expected useful lives of our investments in real estate, we would depreciate these investments\nover fewer years, resulting in more depreciation expense and lower net income on an annual basis.\nWe\nrecord assets and groups of assets and liabilities which comprise disposal groups as held for sale\u201d when all of the\nfollowing criteria are met: a decision has been made to sell, the assets are available for sale immediately, the assets are being\nactively marketed at a reasonable price in relation to the current fair value, a sale has been or is expected to be concluded\nwithin twelve months of the balance sheet date, and significant changes to the plan to sell are not expected. The assets and disposal\ngroups held for sale are valued at the lower of book value or fair value less disposal costs. For sales of real estate or assets\nclassified as held for sale, we evaluate whether a disposal transaction meets the criteria of a strategic shift and will have\na major effect on our operations and financial results to determine if the results of operations and gains on sale of real estate\nwill be presented as part of our continuing operations or as discontinued operations in our consolidated statements of operations.\nIf the disposal represents a strategic shift, it will be classified as discontinued operations for all periods presented; if not,\nit will be presented in continuing operations.\nWe\nevaluate the recoverability of our investments in real estate assets at the lowest identifiable level, the individual property\nlevel. An impairment loss is recognized only if the carrying amount of a long-lived asset is not recoverable and exceeds its fair\nvalue.\nWe\nevaluate the long-lived assets for potential impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the undiscounted\nprojected cash flows are less than the carrying amount for a particular property. No single indicator would necessarily result\nin us preparing an estimate to determine if a long-lived asset's future undiscounted cash flows are less than its book value.\nWe use judgment to determine if the severity of any single indicator, or the fact there are a number of indicators of less severity\nthat when combined, would result in an indication that a long-lived asset requires an estimate of the undiscounted cash flows\nto determine if an impairment has occurred. Relevant facts and circumstances include, among others, significant underperformance\nrelative to historical or projected future operating results and significant negative industry or economic trends. The estimated\ncash flows used for the impairment analysis are subjective and require us to use our judgment and the determination of estimated\nfair value are based on our plans for the respective assets and our views of market and economic conditions. The estimates consider\nmatters such as future operating income, market and other applicable trends and residual value, as well as the effects of demand,\ncompetition, and recent sales data for comparable properties. Changes in estimated future cash flows due to changes in our plans\nor views of market and economic conditions could result in recognition of impairment losses, which, under the applicable accounting\nguidance, may be substantial.\nAccounting\nfor Asset Acquisitions\nThe\ncost of the acquisition in an asset acquisition is allocated to the acquired tangible assets, consisting of land, building and\ntenant improvements, and identified intangible assets and liabilities, consisting of the value of above-market and below-market\nleases for acquired in-place leases and the value of tenant relationships, and certain liabilities such as assumed debt and contingent\nliabilities on the basis of their relative fair values. Fees incurred related to asset acquisitions are capitalized as part of\nthe cost of the investment.\nAccounting\nfor Development Projects\nWe\nincur a variety of costs in the development of a property. The costs of land and building under development include specifically\nidentifiable costs. The capitalized costs include, but are not limited to, pre-construction costs essential to the development\nof the property, development costs, construction costs, interest costs, real estate taxes and other costs incurred during the\nperiod of development. We cease capitalization when the development project is substantially complete and placed in service,\nwhich may occur in phases. Determination of when a development project is substantially complete and capitalization must cease\ninvolves a degree of judgment.\nOnce\na development project is placed in service, which may occur in phases or for an entire building or project, the costs capitalized\nto that development project are transferred to land and improvements, buildings and improvements, and furniture and fixtures on\nour consolidated balance sheets at the historical cost of the property.\nNotes\nReceivable and Preferred Investments\nNotes\nreceivable and preferred investments that we intend to hold to maturity are carried at cost, net of any unamortized origination\ncosts, fees, discounts, premiums and unfunded commitments.\nInvestment\nincome will be recognized on an accrual basis and any related premium, discount, origination costs and fees are amortized over\nthe life of the investment using the effective interest method. The amortization is reflected as an adjustment to investment income\nin the Company's statements of operations.\nIncome\nrecognition is suspended when, in the opinion of management, a full recovery of income and principal becomes doubtful. When the\nultimate collectability of the principal is in doubt, all payments are applied to principal under the cost recovery method. When\nthe ultimate collectability of the principal is not in doubt, contractual interest is recorded as investment income when received,\nunder the cash basis method, until an accrual is resumed when the instrument becomes contractually current and performance is\ndemonstrated to be resumed.\nCredit\nLosses and Impairment on Notes Receivable\nNotes\nreceivable are considered impaired when, based on current information and events, it is probable that we will not be able to collect\nprincipal and interest amounts due according to the contractual terms. We assess the credit quality of our notes receivable and\nadequacy of reserves on a quarterly basis, or more frequently as necessary. Significant judgment of management is required in\nthis analysis. We consider the estimated net recoverable value of the notes receivable as well as other factors, including but\nnot limited to the fair value of any collateral, the amount and the status of any senior debt, the quality and financial condition\nof the borrower and the competitive situation of the area where the underlying collateral is located. Because this determination\nis based on projections of future economic events, which are inherently subjective, the amount ultimately realized may differ\nmaterially from the carrying value as of the balance sheet date. If upon completion of the assessment, the estimated fair value\nof the underlying collateral is less than the net carrying value of the notes receivable, a reserve is recorded with a corresponding\ncharge to investment income. The reserve for each note receivable is maintained at a level that is determined to be adequate by\nmanagement to absorb probable losses.\nCredit\nLosses and Impairment on Preferred Investments\nPreferred\ninvestments that are accounted for as held to maturity are assessed for impairment at the individual investment level when there\nis a decline in fair value below the amortized cost basis that is deemed to be other than temporary. In making the determination\nof an other-than-temporary impairment assessment, the Company considers all available information relevant to the collectability\nof the investment, including information about past events, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts when\ndeveloping the estimate of cash flows expected to be collected. This information includes the remaining redemption terms of the\ninvestment, financial condition of the issuer, expected defaults and the value of any underlying collateral. In assessing whether\nthe entire amortized cost basis of the investment will be recovered, the Company compares the present value of cash flows expected\nto be collected from the investment with the amortized cost basis and records an impairment based on the amount by which the present\nvalue of cash flows expected to be collected is less than the amortized cost basis of the investment.\nTreatment\nof Management Compensation, Expense Reimbursements and Operating Partnership Participation Interest\nManagement\nof our operations is outsourced to our Advisor and certain other affiliates of our Sponsor. Fees related to each of these services\nare accounted for based on the nature of such service and the relevant accounting literature. Such fees include acquisition fees\nassociated with the purchase of interests in affiliated real estate entities; asset management fees paid to our Advisor and property\nmanagement fees paid to our Property Manager, which manage certain of the properties we acquire, or to other unaffiliated third-party\nproperty managers, principally for the management of our hospitality properties. These fees are expensed or capitalized to the\nbasis of acquired assets, as appropriate.\nOur\nProperty Manager may also perform fee-based construction management services for both our re-development activities and tenant\nconstruction projects. These fees are considered incremental to the construction effort and will be capitalized to the associated\nreal estate project as incurred. Costs incurred for tenant construction will be depreciated over the shorter of their useful\nlife or the term of the related lease. Costs related to redevelopment activities will be depreciated over the estimated useful\nlife of the associated project.\nLeasing\nactivity at certain of our properties has also been outsourced to our Property Manager. Any corresponding leasing fees we pay\nare capitalized and amortized over the life of the related lease.\nExpense\nreimbursements made to both our Advisor and Property Manager will be expensed or capitalized to the basis of acquired assets,\nas appropriate.\nThrough\nMarch 31, 2009, Lightstone SLP, LLC, an affiliate of the Advisor, purchased an aggregate of $30.0 million of SLP Units in the\nOperating Partnership at a cost of $100,000 per unit and none thereafter.\nIncome\nTaxes\nWe\nelected to be taxed and qualify as a REIT commencing with the taxable year ended December 31, 2005. If we remain qualified as\na REIT, we generally will not be subject to U.S. federal income tax on our net taxable income that we distribute currently to\nour stockholders. To maintain our REIT qualification under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, or the Code, we must\nmeet a number of organizational and operational requirements, including a requirement that we annually distribute to our stockholders\nat least 90% of our REIT taxable income (which does not equal net income, as calculated in accordance with generally accepted\naccounting principles in the United States of America, or GAAP), determined without regard to the deduction for dividends paid\nand excluding any net capital gain. If we fail to remain qualified for taxation as a REIT in any subsequent year and do not qualify\nfor certain statutory relief provisions, our income for that year will be taxed at regular corporate rates, and we may be precluded\nfrom qualifying for treatment as a REIT for the four-year period following our failure to qualify as a REIT. Such an event could\nmaterially adversely affect our net income and net cash available for distribution to our stockholders.\nTo\nmaintain our qualification as a REIT, we engage in certain activities through taxable REIT subsidiaries ( TRSs\u201d).\nAs such, we may still be subject to U.S. federal and state income and franchise taxes from these activities.\nAs\nof December 31, 2021 and 2020, we had no material uncertain income tax positions. Additionally, even if we continue to qualify\nas a REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes, we may still be subject to some U.S. federal, state and local taxes on our income\nand property and to U.S. federal income taxes and excise taxes on our undistributed income.\nResults\nof Operations\nDisposition\nof the Santa Clara Data Center\nOn\nJanuary 10, 2019, we acquired a parcel of land located at 2175 Martin Avenue, Santa Clara, California (the Martin Avenue\nLand\u201d) from an unaffiliated third party for $10.6 million. Subsequently, we completed certain activities associated with\nthe potential development and construction of a data center on the Martin Avenue Land (the Santa Clara Data Center\u201d).\nOn\nJuly 7, 2021, we disposed of the Santa Clara Data Center to an unrelated third party for a contractual sales price of $13.9 million.\nIn connection with the disposition of the Santa Clara Data Center, we recognized a gain on sale of investment property of $0.2\nmillion during the third quarter of 2021.\nThe\ndisposition of the Santa Clara Data Center did not qualify to be reported as discontinued operations since it did not represent\na strategic shift that had a major effect on our operations and financial results. Accordingly, the operating results of the Santa\nClara Data Center are reflected in our results from continuing operations for all periods presented through its date of disposition.\nInvestment\nImpairment - St. Augustine Outlet Center\nDuring\nthe COVID-19 pandemic, St. Augustine Outlet Center's occupancy declined and because of limited leasing success, we began\nbeen exploring various strategic alternatives for the property and as a result determined during the third quarter of 2021 that\nwe would no longer pursue leasing of space to tenants and therefore, entered into lease termination agreements with certain tenants\nand also provided notice to its other tenants that it would not renew their leases at scheduled expiration. As a result of this\nchange in leasing strategy and resulting decrease in the fair value of the St. Augustine Outlet Center, we recorded a non-cash\nimpairment charge of $11.3 million during the third quarter of 2021 to reduce the carrying value of the St. Augustine Outlet Center\nto its estimated fair value of $23.3 million as of September 30, 2021. In estimating the fair value of the St. Augustine Outlet\nCenter, we used management's internal analysis prepared with consideration of local market conditions.\nWe\nbelieve the reduced carrying value of the St. Augustine Outlet Center is currently recoverable. However, if market conditions\nworsen unexpectedly or if changes in its strategy significantly affect any key assumptions used in determining the property's\nestimated fair value, we may need to take additional impairment charges in future periods.\nFor\nthe Year Ended December 31, 2021 vs. December 31, 2020\nConsolidated\nRevenues\nOur\nrevenues are comprised of rental income and tenant recovery income. Total revenues decreased by $0.9 million to $10.4 million\nfor the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to $11.3 million for the same period in 2020. This decrease was primarily attributable\nto reduced occupancy and rental rates for Gantry Park Landing during the 2021 period resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic.\nProperty\noperating expenses\nProperty\noperating expenses increased by $0.2 million to $4.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to $4.0 million for\nthe same period in 2020. The increase in property operating expenses is primarily a result of lease termination fees incurred\nfor the St. Augustine Outlet Center. See Investment Impairment - St. Augustine Outlet Center\u201d above.\nReal\nestate taxes\nReal\nestate taxes decreased by $0.3 million to $0.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to $0.6 million for the same\nperiod in 2020. The decrease reflects lower real estate taxes resulting from the sale of the Santa Clara Data Center and certain\nland parcels adjacent to the St. Augustine Outlet Center.\nGeneral\nand administrative expenses\nGeneral\nand administrative expenses decreased by $0.5 million to $2.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to $3.1 million\nfor the same period in 2020 principally due to lower bad debt expense in 2021.\nImpairment\ncharge\nDuring\nthe third quarter of 2021, we recorded a non-cash impairment charge of $11.3 million to reduce the carrying value of our St. Augustine\nOutlet Center to its estimated fair value as of September 30, 2021. See Investment Impairment - St. Augustine Outlet Center\u201d\nabove.\nDepreciation\nand amortization\nDepreciation\nand amortization increased by $1.5 million to $5.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to $4.0 million for the\nsame period in 2020. The increase in depreciation and amortization reflects changes to the estimated remaining useful lives of\ncertain tenant-related building improvements resulting from lease terminations for the St. Augustine Outlet Center. See Investment\nImpairment - St. Augustine Outlet Center\u201d above.\nInterest\nand dividend income\nInterest\nand dividend income increased by $0.8 million to $13.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to $13.0 million\nfor the same period in 2020. The increase primarily reflects higher interest income earned on our notes receivable of $0.3 million\nand higher interest and dividend income earned on our available cash and investments in marketable securities of $0.7 million,\npartially offset by lower investment income of $0.2 million from our Preferred Investments.\nInterest\nexpense\nInterest\nexpense, including amortization of deferred financing costs, decreased by $0.4 million to $2.6 million for the year ended December\n31, 2021 compared to $3.0 million for the same period in 2020. During the year ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, $8.2 million\nand $7.8 million, respectively, of interest was capitalized to construction in progress for our development projects.\nGain\non disposition of real estate, net\nOur\ngain on disposition of real estate, net of $3.9 million during the year ended December 31, 2021 primarily is attributable to a\nsecond quarter gain of $3.6 million recognized in connection with the disposition of a parcel of land adjacent to St. Augustine\nOutlet Center and a third quarter gain of $0.2 million recognized in connection with the disposition of the Santa Clara Data Center.\nOur\ngain on disposition of real estate, net of $1.6 million during the year ended December 31, 2020 consists of a second quarter gain\nof $1.6 million recognized in connection with the disposition of a parcel of land adjacent to the St. Augustine Outlet Center.\nUnrealized\ngain/(loss) on marketable equity securities\nDuring\nthe year ended December 31, 2021, we recorded unrealized gains on marketable equity securities of $16.5 million and during the\nyear ended December 31, 2020, we recorded unrealized losses on marketable equity securities of $12.2 million. These unrealized\ngains and losses represented the change in the fair value of our marketable equity securities during those periods.\nGain/(loss)\non sale and redemption of marketable securities\nDuring\nthe year ended December 31, 2021, we recorded a gain on the sale of marketable securities of $5.9 million and during the year\nended December 31, 2020, we recorded a loss on the sale of marketable securities of $0.2 million. These gains and losses represented\nthe difference between the sales price and carrying value of our marketable securities sold during those periods.\nNoncontrolling\ninterests\nThe\nnet earnings allocated to noncontrolling interests relates to (i) parties of the Company that hold units in the Operating Partnership,\n(ii) the interest in PRO-DFJV Holdings LLC ( PRO\u201d) held by our Sponsor, (iii) the ownership interests in 50-01 2nd\nSt. Associates LLC (the 2nd Street Joint Venture\u201d) held by our Sponsor and other affiliates and (iv) the ownership\ninterest in various joint ventures held by affiliates of our Sponsor that have originated nonrecourse loans to unaffiliated third-party\nborrowers.\nFinancial\nCondition, Liquidity and Capital Resources\nOverview:\nAs\nof December 31, 2021, we had $39.4 million of cash on hand, $3.2 million of restricted cash and $62.8 million of marketable securities.\nWe also have the ability to make draws from a line of credit up to $20.0 million, subject to certain conditions (see Notes\nPayable - Line of Credit\u201d). We currently believe that these items along with rental income from our operating properties;\ninterest and dividend income earned on our marketable securities, notes receivable and preferred investments; as well as proceeds\nreceived from the repayment of the notes receivable and redemptions of the preferred investments will be sufficient to satisfy\nour expected cash requirements primarily consisting our anticipated operating expenses, scheduled debt service, capital expenditures\n(including certain of our development activities) and distributions to our shareholders, if any, required to maintain our status\nas a REIT for the foreseeable future. However, we may also obtain additional funds through selective asset dispositions, joint\nventure arrangements, new borrowings and refinancing of existing debt.\nWe\ncurrently have two development projects (see Development Activities\u201d). With respect to our Lower East Side Moxy Hotel,\nwhich is currently under construction and expected to open during the fourth quarter of 2022, we have obtained construction financings\nand the remaining costs associated with the construction of the Lower East Side Moxy Hotel are expected to be funded from the\nremaining availability under such construction financings. See Development Activities - Lower East Side Moxy Hotel\u201d\nfor additional information. Our Exterior Street Project is currently under development and we expect to seek construction financing\nto fund a substantial portion of its future development and construction costs. See Development Activities - Exterior\nStreet Project\u201d for additional information.\nOur\nborrowings consist of single-property mortgages as well as mortgages cross-collateralized by a pool of properties. We typically\nhave obtained level payment financing, meaning that the amount of debt service payable would be substantially the same each year.\nAs such, most of the mortgages on our properties provide for a so-called balloon\u201d payment and are at a fixed interest\nrate.\nAdditionally,\nin order to leverage our investments in marketable securities and seek a higher rate of return, we have access to borrowings under\na margin loan and line of credit collateralized by the securities held with the financial institution that provided the margin\nloan and line of credit as well as a portion of our Marco OP Units. These loans are due on demand and any outstanding balance\nmust be paid upon the liquidation of securities.\nOur\ncharter provides that the aggregate amount of borrowing, both secured and unsecured, may not exceed 300% of net assets in the\nabsence of a satisfactory showing that a higher level is appropriate, the approval of the Board of Directors and disclosure to\nstockholders. Net assets means our total assets, other than intangibles, at cost before deducting depreciation or other non-cash\nreserves less our total liabilities, calculated at least quarterly on a basis consistently applied. Any excess in borrowing over\nsuch 300% of net assets level must be approved by a majority of our independent directors and disclosed to our stockholders in\nour next quarterly report to stockholders, along with justification for such excess. As of December 31, 2021, our total borrowings\nof $171.8 million represented 53% of net assets.\nAny\nfuture properties that we may acquire or investments we may make may be funded through a combination of borrowings, proceeds generated\nfrom the sale and redemption of our marketable securities, available for sale, proceeds received from the selective disposition\nof our properties and proceeds received from the redemption of our preferred investments in related parties. These borrowings\nmay consist of single-property mortgages as well as mortgages cross-collateralized by a pool of properties. Such mortgages may\nbe put in place either at the time we acquire a property or subsequent to our purchasing a property for cash. In addition, we\nmay acquire properties that are subject to existing indebtedness where we choose to assume the existing mortgages. Generally,\nthough not exclusively, we intend to seek to encumber our properties with debt, which will be on a non-recourse basis. This means\nthat a lender's rights on default will generally be limited to foreclosing on the property. However, we may, at our discretion,\nsecure recourse financing or provide a guarantee to lenders if we believe this may result in more favorable terms. When we give\na guaranty for a property owning entity, we will be responsible to the lender for the satisfaction of the indebtedness if it is\nnot paid by the property owning entity.\nWe\nmay also obtain lines of credit to be used to acquire properties or real estate-related assets. These lines of credit will be\nat prevailing market terms and will be repaid from proceeds from the sale or refinancing of properties, working capital or permanent\nfinancing. Our Sponsor or its affiliates may guarantee the lines of credit although they will not be obligated to do so. We expect\nthat such properties may be purchased by our Sponsor's affiliates on our behalf, in our name, in order to minimize the imposition\nof a transfer tax upon a transfer of such properties to us.\nWe have\nvarious agreements, including an advisory agreement, with the Advisor to pay certain fees in exchange for services performed by\nthe Advisor and/or its affiliated entities. Additionally, our ability to secure financing and our real estate operations are dependent\nupon our Advisor and its affiliates to perform such services as provided in these agreements.\nIn\naddition to meeting working capital needs and distributions, if any, to our stockholders, our capital resources are used to make\ncertain payments to our Advisor and our Property Manager, including payments related to asset acquisition fees, development fees\nand leasing commissions, asset management fees, the reimbursement of acquisition related expenses to our Advisor and property\nmanagement fees. We also reimburse our Advisor and its affiliates for actual expenses it incurs for administrative and other services\nprovided to us. Additionally, the Operating Partnership may be required to make distributions to Lightstone SLP, LLC, an affiliate\nof the Advisor.\nThe\nadvisory agreement has a one-year term and is renewable for an unlimited number of successive one-year periods upon the mutual\nconsent of the Advisor and our independent directors.\nThe\nfollowing table represents the fees incurred associated with the payments to our Advisor and its affiliates:\nTable 35: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>For\nthe\nYear Ended </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>December 31,\n2021 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>December 31,\n2020 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Asset\nmanagement fees (general and administrative costs) </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>849 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>919 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Property\nmanagement fees (property operating expenses) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>362 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>388 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Development\nfees and cost reimbursement(1) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3,595 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,337 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Total </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>4,806 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2,644 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 36: <table><tr> <td> </td> <td>(1) </td> <td>Development\nfees and development costs that we reimburse our Advisor for are capitalized and are\nincluded in the carrying value of the associated development project and classified as\nconstruction in progress on the consolidated balance sheets.

See Note 3 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional\ninformation. </td> </tr>\n</table>\nAdditionally,\nwe may be required to make distributions on the special general partner interests ( SLP Units\u201d) in the Operating Partnership\nheld by Lightstone SLP, LLC, an affiliate of the Advisor. In connection with the Company's initial public offering, Lightstone\nSLP, LLC purchased an aggregate of $30.0 million of SLP Units.

Additionally, on December 6, 2018, we, though a subsidiary of the Operating Partnership, acquired\ncertain air rights located at 329 Broome Street, New York, New York from an unaffiliated third party for $2.4 million, excluding\nclosing and other acquisition related costs. We are using the land and air rights in connection with the development and construction\nof a 296-room Marriott Moxy hotel (the Lower East Side Moxy Hotel\u201d). On June 3, 2021, the Company entered into a\ndevelopment agreement (the Development Agreement\u201d) with an affiliate of the Advisor (the Moxy Lower East Side\nDeveloper\u201d) pursuant to which the Lower East Side Moxy Developer will be paid a development fee equal to 3% of hard and\nsoft costs incurred in connection with the development and construction of the Lower East Side Moxy Hotel. Additionally on June\n3, 2021, the Company obtained construction financing for the Lower East Side Moxy Hotel. The Lower East Side Moxy Hotel is currently\nunder construction and expected to open during the fourth quarter of 2022.\nPreviously\non December 3, 2018, we had entered into a mortgage loan which was collateralized by the Lower East Side Moxy Hotel (the Lower\nEast Side Moxy Mortgage\u201d) for $35.6 million. The Lower East Side Moxy Mortgage had an initial term of two years, bore interest\nat the London Interbank Offered Rate ( LIBOR\u201d) + 4.25%, subject to a 6.63% floor, and required monthly interest-only\npayments through its stated maturity with the entire unpaid balance due upon maturity. In November 2020 the maturity date of Lower\nEast Side Moxy Mortgage was extended to March 3, 2021 and in March 2021 it was further extended until June 3, 2021, on which date\nit was then repaid in full as discussed below.\nOn\nJune 3, 2021, we, through a wholly owned subsidiary, closed on a recourse construction loan facility (the Moxy Senior Loan\u201d)\nproviding for up to $90.0 million of funds for the development and construction of the Lower East Side Moxy Hotel. At closing,\n$35.6 million of proceeds were initially advanced under the Moxy Senior Loan, which were used to repay in full the Lower East\nSide Moxy Mortgage. The Moxy Senior Loan bears interest at LIBOR + 7.50%, subject to an 8.00% floor, and initially matures on\nJune 3, 2024, with two one-year extension options, subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions. The Moxy Senior Loan is\ncollateralized by the Lower East Side Moxy Hotel. As of December 31, 2021, the outstanding principal balance of the Moxy Senior\nLoan was $35.6 million and the remaining availability under the facility was up to $54.4 million.\nSimultaneously\non June 3, 2021, we, through the same wholly owned subsidiary, also entered into a mezzanine construction loan facility (the Moxy\nJunior Loan\u201d and together with the Moxy Senior Loan, the Moxy Construction Loans\u201d) providing for up to $40.0\nmillion of additional funds for the development and construction of the Lower East Side Moxy Hotel. The Moxy Junior Loan bears\ninterest at LIBOR + 13.50%, subject to a 14.00% floor, and initially matures on June 3, 2024, with two one-year extension options\nsubject to the satisfaction of certain conditions. The Moxy Junior Loan is subordinate to the Moxy Senior loan but also collateralized\nby the Lower East Side Moxy Hotel. We provided a principal guarantee of up to $7.0 million with respect to the Moxy Junior Loan.\nAs of December 31, 2021, the outstanding principal balance of the Moxy Junior Loan was $24.6 million and the remaining availability\nunder the facility was up to $15.4 million.\nFuture\ndraws to cover the costs associated with the development and construction of the Lower East Side Moxy Hotel will first be advanced\nunder the Moxy Junior Loan until it has been fully funded and thereafter, funds will be advanced under the remaining availability\nof the Moxy Senior Loan.\nIn\nconnection with the Moxy Construction Loans, we provided certain completion and carry cost guarantees. We also entered into an\ninterest rate cap agreement pursuant to which the LIBOR rate will be capped at 3.00% on the Moxy Senior Loan through June 3, 2024\nat a cost of $0.2 million. Furthermore, in connection with the Moxy Construction Loans, we paid $5.3 million of loan fees and\nexpenses and accrued $1.1 million of loan exit fees which are due at the initial maturity date and are included in accounts payable,\naccrued expenses and other liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets as of December 31, 2021.\nExterior\nStreet Project\nOn\nFebruary 27, 2019, we, through subsidiaries of the Operating Partnership, acquired two adjacent parcels of land located at 355\nand 399 Exterior Street, New York, New York from unaffiliated third parties for an aggregate purchase price of $59.0 million,\nexcluding closing and other acquisition related costs. In September 2021, we subsequently acquired an additional adjacent parcel\nof land at cost from an affiliate of our Advisor for $1.0 million in order to achieve certain zoning compliance. We are using\nthe land parcels for the development of a multi-family residential property (the Exterior Street Project\u201d).\nOn\nMarch 29, 2019, we entered into a $35.0 million loan (the Exterior Street Loan\u201d) which commencing on October 10,\n2020 bears interest at LIBOR + 2.25% through its scheduled maturity date. The Exterior Street Loan requires monthly interest-only\npayments with the outstanding principal balance due in full at its maturity date. The Exterior Street Loan was initially scheduled\nto mature on April 9, 2021 but during April 2021, its maturity date was further extended to April 9, 2022. Additionally, on December\n21, 2021, the loan agreement was amended to provide an additional six-month extension and an additional $7.0 million loan (the\nExterior Street Supplemental Loan\u201d and collectively with the Exterior Street Loan, the Exterior Street Loans\u201d)\nwhich bears interest at LIBOR + 2.50% and requires monthly interest-only payments through its maturity date. The Exterior Street\nLoans are scheduled to mature on April 9, 2022, with a six-month extension option, subject to certain conditions and are collateralized\nby the Exterior Street Project.\nThe\nfollowing is a summary of the amounts incurred and capitalized to development projects on the consolidated balance sheet for the\nLower East Side Moxy Hotel and the Exterior Street Project as of December 31, 2021:\nTable 50: <table> <tr> <td>Development\nProject </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Lower\nEast Side Moxy Hotel </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>146,747 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Exterior\nStreet Project </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>87,467 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Total </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>234,214 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTo-date\nthe ongoing COVID-19 pandemic as well as other economic conditions and uncertainties have not had a significant impact on our\ndevelopment activities associated with either the Lower East Side Moxy Hotel or the Exterior Street Project. As discussed above,\nwe have already obtained construction financing for the Lower East Side Moxy Hotel and it is currently under construction and\nexpected to open during the fourth quarter of 2022. However, with respect to our Exterior Street Project which is currently under\ndevelopment, we currently expect to seek construction financing to fund a substantial portion of its future development and construction\ncosts. The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic as well as other economic conditions and uncertainties may (i) affect our ability to obtain\nconstruction financing, and/or (ii) cause delays or increase costs associated with building materials or construction services\nnecessary for construction, which could adversely impact our ability to either ultimately commence and/or complete construction\nas planned, on budget or at all for the Exterior Street Project.\nAlthough\nwe currently believe our capital resources are sufficient to fund our expected development activities for the next 12 months,\nthere can be no assurance we will be successful in obtaining construction financing at favorable terms, if at all.\nPreferred\nInvestments\nWe\nhave Preferred Investments that entitle us to monthly preferred distributions. The Preferred Investments are classified as held-to-maturity\nsecurities, recorded at cost and included in investments in related parties on the consolidated balance sheets. The fair value\nof these investments approximated their carrying values based on market rates for similar instruments. During the year ended December\n31, 2020, we redeemed $11.0 million of the 40 East End Avenue Preferred Investment and the entire remaining Miami Moxy Preferred\nInvestment of $9.0 million.\nThe\nPreferred Investments are summarized as follows:\nTable 51: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Preferred\nInvestment Balance </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Investment\nIncome(1) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Dividend </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>As\nof\nDecember 31, </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>As\nof\nDecember 31, </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>For\nthe\nYear Ended\nDecember 31, </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Preferred\nInvestments </td> <td> </td> <td>Rate </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2021 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2021 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>40\nEast End Avenue </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>12 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>6,000 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>6,000 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>730 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>886 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>East\n11th Street </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>12 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>8,500 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>8,500 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,034 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,040 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Miami\nMoxy </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>12 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>45 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Total\nPreferred Investments </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>14,500 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>14,500 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,764 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,971 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nNote:\nTable 52: <table><tr> <td> </td> <td>(1) </td> <td>Included\nin interest and dividend income on the statements of operations. </td> </tr>\n</table>\nNotes\nReceivable\nWe\nformed certain joint ventures (collectively, the NR Joint Ventures\u201d) between wholly-owned subsidiaries of the Operating\nPartnership (collectively, the NR Subsidiaries\u201d) and affiliates of the Sponsor (the NR Affiliates\u201d)\nwhich have originated nonrecourse loans (collectively, the Joint Venture Promissory Notes\u201d) to unaffiliated third-party\nborrowers (collectively, the Joint Venture Borrowers\u201d).\nWe\ndetermined that the NR Joint Ventures are VIEs and the NR Subsidiaries are the primary beneficiaries. Since the NR Subsidiaries\nare the primary beneficiaries, beginning on the applicable date of formation, we consolidated the operating results and financial\ncondition of the NR Joint Ventures and accounted for the respective ownership interests of the NR Affiliates as noncontrolling\ninterests.\nThe\nJoint Venture Promissory Notes generally provide for monthly interest at a prescribed variable rate, subject to a floor. In connection\nwith the initial funding of the Joint Venture Promissory Notes, the NR Joint Ventures receive origination fees (ranging from 1.00%\nto 1.50%) based on the principal commitment under the loan and retain a portion of the loan proceeds to establish a reserve for\ninterest and other items (the Loan Reserves\u201d). The Joint Venture Promissory Notes are recorded in notes receivable,\nnet on the consolidated balance sheets.\nThe\nJoint Venture Promissory Notes generally have an initial term of one or two years and may provide for additional one-year extension\noptions subject to satisfaction of certain conditions, including the funding of additional Loan Reserves and payment of extension\nfees. The Joint Venture Promissory Notes are collateralized by either the membership interests of the Joint Venture Borrowers\nin the borrowing entity or the underlying real property being developed by the Joint Venture Borrower.\nThe\nJoint Venture Promissory Notes are recorded in notes receivable, net on the consolidated balance sheets. The origination fees\nreceived are presented in the consolidated balance sheets as a direct deduction from the carrying value of the Joint\nVenture Promissory Notes and are amortized into interest income, using a straight-line method that approximates the effective\ninterest method, over the initial term of the Joint Venture Promissory Notes. The Loan Reserves are presented in\nthe consolidated balance sheets as a direct deduction from the carrying value of the Joint Venture Promissory Notes and\nare applied against the monthly interest

their shares of common stock back to us, subject to restrictions.\nOn\nMarch 25, 2020, the Board of Directors amended the SRP to remove stockholder notice requirements and also approved the suspension\nof all redemptions effective immediately.\nEffective\nMarch 15, 2021 and May 14, 2021, the Board of Directors partially reopened the SRP to allow, subject to various conditions as\nset forth below, for redemptions submitted in connection with a stockholder's death and hardship, respectively, and set\nthe price for all such purchases to our current NAV per Share, as determined by the Board of Directors and reported by the Company\nfrom time to time. Deaths that occurred subsequent to January 1, 2020 were eligible for consideration, subject to certain conditions.\nBeginning January 1, 2022, requests for redemptions in connection with a stockholder's death must be submitted and received\nby us within one year of the stockholder's date of death for consideration.\nAt\nthe above noted dates, the Board of Directors established that on an annual basis, we would not redeem in excess of 0.5% of the\nnumber of shares outstanding as of the end of the preceding year for either death or hardship redemptions, respectively. Additionally,\nredemption requests generally would be processed on a quarterly basis and would be subject to pro ration if either type of redemption\nrequests exceeded the annual limitation.\nFor\nthe year ended December 31, 2021, we repurchased 143,918 shares of common stock for $11.18 per share, pursuant to the SRP. For\nthe period from January 1 through March 24, 2020, we repurchased 287,987 shares of common stock for $10.87 per share, pursuant\nto the SRP.\nOn\nMarch 18, 2022, The Board of Directors approved an increase to the annual threshold for death redemptions from up to 0.5% to 1.0%.\nTender Offer\nWe\ncommenced a tender offer on June 15, 2020, pursuant to which we offered to acquire up to 225,000 of our shares of common stock\nat a purchase price of $5.00 per share, or $1.1 million in the aggregate (the 2020 Tender Offer\u201d). Pursuant to the\nterms of the 2020 Tender Offer, which expired on July 24, 2020, we repurchased 0.1 million shares of our common stock for an aggregate\nof $0.3 million in August 2020.\nDistribution\nReinvestment Program ( DRIP\u201d)\nOur\ndistribution reinvestment program ( DRIP\u201d) provides our shareholders with an opportunity to purchase additional shares\nof our common stock at a discount by reinvesting distributions. Under our distribution reinvestment program, a shareholder may\nacquire, from time to time, additional shares of our common stock by reinvesting cash distributions payable by us to such shareholder,\nwithout incurring any brokerage commission, fees or service charges.\nThe\nDRIP had been suspended since 2015 until our DRIP Registration Statement on Form S-3D was filed and became effective as amended\nand restated, under the Securities Act of 1933 on October 25, 2018.\nPursuant\nto the DRIP following its reactivation, our stockholders who elect to participate may invest all or a portion of the cash distributions\nthat we pay them on shares of our common stock in additional shares of our common stock without paying any fees or commissions.\nThe purchase price for shares under the DRIP will be equal to 95% of our current NAV per Share, as determined by the Board of\nDirectors and reported by us from time to time. On December 16, 2021, the Board of Directors determined our NAV per Share of $11.75,\nas of September 30, 2021, which resulted in a purchase price for shares under the DRIP of $11.16 per share. As of December 31,\n2021, 9.9 million shares remain available for issuance under our DRIP.\nThe\nBoard of Directors reserves the right to terminate the DRIP for any reason without cause by providing written notice of termination\nof the DRIP to all participants.\nDistributions\nDeclared by the Board of Directors\nCommon\nShares\nDuring\nthe years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, distributions on our Common Shares were declared quarterly, for each calendar quarter\nend, at the pro rata equivalent of an annual distribution of $0.70 per share, or an annualized rate of 7.0% assuming a purchase\nprice of $10.00 per share, to stockholders of record at the close of business on the last day of the quarter-end. All distributions\nwere paid on or about the 15th day of the month following the quarter-end.\nTotal\ndistributions declared during both of the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 were $15.6 million.\nOn\nMarch 18, 2022, the Board of Directors authorized and declared a Common Share distribution of $0.175 per share for the quarterly\nperiod ending March 31, 2022. The quarterly distribution is the pro rata equivalent of an annual distribution of $0.70 per share,\nor an annualized rate of 7.0% assuming a purchase price of $10.00 per share. The distribution will be paid on or about the 15th\nday of the month following the quarter-end to stockholders of record at the close of business on the last day of the quarter-end.\nThe stockholders have an option to elect the receipt of shares under the Company's DRIP.\nSLP\nUnits\nFor\nboth of the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, total distributions declared and paid on the SLP Units were $2.1 million.\nAdditionally, on March 18, 2022, the Board of Directors declared a quarterly distribution for the quarterly period ending March\n31, 2022 on the SLP Units at an annualized rate of 7.0%. Any future distributions on the SLP Units will always be subordinated\nuntil stockholders receive a stated preferred return.\nContractual\nObligations\nThe\nfollowing is a summary of our contractual obligations outstanding over the next five years and thereafter as of December 31, 2021.\nTable 60: <table> <tr> <td>Contractual\nObligations </td> <td> </td> <td>2022 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2023 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2024 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2025 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2026 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Thereafter </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Total </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Mortgage\nPayable </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>43,389 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,454 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>126,910 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>171,753 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Interest\nPayments1 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>9,786 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>9,446 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6,169 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>25,401 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Total\nContractual Obligations </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>53,175 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>10,900 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>133,079 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>197,154 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 61: <table><tr> <td> </td> <td>1) </td> <td>These\namounts represent future interest payments related to mortgage payable obligations based\non the fixed and variable interest rates specified in the associated debt agreement.\nAll variable rate debt agreements are based on the one month LIBOR rate.

The Margin Loan, which is due on demand, bears interest at LIBOR + 0.85% (0.95% as of December 31, 2021)\nand is collateralized by the marketable securities in our account. The amounts available to us under the Margin Loan are at the\ndiscretion of the financial institution and not limited to the amount of collateral in our account. There were no amounts outstanding\nunder the Margin Loan as of December 31, 2021 and 2020.\nLine\nof Credit\nWe\nhave a non-revolving credit facility (the Line of Credit\u201d) with a financial institution that provides for borrowings\nup to a maximum of $20.0 million, subject to a 55% loan-to-value ratio based on the fair value of the underlying collateral, matures\non November 30, 2022 and bears interest at LIBOR + 1.35% (1.45% as of December 31, 2021). The Line of Credit is collateralized\nby an aggregate of 209,243 of Marco OP Units and Marco II OP Units and was guaranteed by PRO. As of December 31, 2021, the amount\nof borrowings available to be drawn under the Line of Credit was $18.4 million. No amounts were outstanding under the Line of\nCredit as of both December 31, 2021 and 2020.\nLIBOR\nThe\nMoxy Construction Loans, Exterior Street Loans, Margin Loan and Line of Credit are indexed to LIBOR. In late 2021, it was announced\nLIBOR interest rates will cease publication altogether by June 30, 2023. We have and intend continue to incorporate relatively\nstandardized replacement rate provisions into our LIBOR-indexed debt documents, including a spread adjustment mechanism designed\nto equate to the current LIBOR all in\u201d rate. There is significant uncertainty with respect to the implementation\nof the phase out and what alternative indexes will be adopted which will ultimately be determined by the market as a whole. It\ntherefore remains uncertain how such changes will be implemented and the effects such changes would have on us and the financial\nmarkets generally.\nDebt\nMaturities\nThe\nExterior Street Loans (outstanding principal balance of $42.0 million as of December 31, 2021) mature on April 9, 2022. We currently\nintend to extend or refinance the Exterior Street Loans on or before their maturity date.\nHowever,\nif we are unable to extend or refinance any of our maturing indebtedness at favorable terms, we will look to repay the then outstanding\nbalance with available cash and/or proceeds from selective asset sales. We have no additional significant maturities of mortgage\ndebt over the next 12 months.\nFunds\nfrom Operations and Modified Funds from Operations\nThe\nhistorical accounting convention used for real estate assets requires straight-line depreciation of buildings, improvements, and\nstraight-line amortization of intangibles, which implies that the value of a real estate asset diminishes predictably over time.\nWe believe that, because real estate values historically rise and fall with market conditions, including, but not limited to,\ninflation, interest rates, the business cycle, unemployment and consumer spending, presentations of operating results for a REIT\nusing the historical accounting convention for depreciation and certain other items may be less informative.\nBecause\nof these factors, the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts ( NAREIT\u201d), an industry trade group, has\npublished a standardized measure of performance known as funds from operations ( FFO\u201d), which is used in the REIT\nindustry as a supplemental performance measure. We believe FFO, which excludes certain items such as real estate-related depreciation\nand amortization, is an appropriate supplemental measure of a REIT's operating performance. FFO is not equivalent to our\nnet income or loss as determined under GAAP.\nWe\ncalculate FFO, a non-GAAP measure, consistent with the standards established over time by the Board of Governors of NAREIT, as\nrestated in a White Paper approved by the Board of Governors of NAREIT effective in December 2018 (the White Paper\u201d).\nThe White Paper defines FFO as net income or loss computed in accordance with GAAP, excluding depreciation and amortization related\nto real estate, gains and losses from the sale of certain real estate assets, gains and losses from change in control and impairment\nwrite-downs of certain real estate assets and investments in entities when the impairment is directly attributable to decreases\nin the value of depreciable real estate held by the entity. Our FFO calculation complies with NAREIT's definition.\nWe\nbelieve that the use of FFO provides a more complete understanding of our performance to investors and to management, and\nreflects the impact on our operations from trends in occupancy rates, rental rates, operating costs, general and administrative\nexpenses, and interest costs, which may not be immediately apparent from net income.\nChanges\nin the accounting and reporting promulgations under GAAP that were put into effect in 2009 subsequent to the establishment\nof NAREIT's definition of FFO, such as the change to expense as incurred rather than capitalize and depreciate acquisition\nfees and expenses incurred for business combinations, have prompted an increase in cash-settled expenses, specifically acquisition\nfees and expenses, as items that are expensed under GAAP across all industries. These changes had a particularly significant impact\non publicly registered, non-listed REITs, which typically have a significant amount of acquisition activity in the early\npart of their existence, particularly during the period when they are raising capital through ongoing initial public offerings.\nBecause\nof these factors, the Investment Program Association (the IPA\u201d), an industry trade group, published a standardized\nmeasure of performance known as modified funds from operations ( MFFO\u201d), which the IPA has recommended as a supplemental\nmeasure for publicly registered, non-listed REITs. MFFO is designed to be reflective of the ongoing operating performance of publicly\nregistered, non-listed REITs by adjusting for those costs that are more reflective of acquisitions and investment activity, along\nwith other items the IPA believes are not indicative of the ongoing operating performance of a publicly registered, non-listed\nREIT, such as straight-lining of rents as required by GAAP. We believe it is appropriate to use MFFO as a supplemental measure\nof operating performance because we believe that both before and after we have deployed all of our offering proceeds and\nare no longer incurring a significant amount of acquisition fees or other related costs, it reflects the impact on our operations\nfrom trends in occupancy rates, rental rates, operating costs, general and administrative expenses, and interest costs, which\nmay not be immediately apparent from net income. MFFO is not equivalent to our net income or loss as determined under GAAP.\nWe\ndefine MFFO, a non-GAAP measure, consistent with the IPA's Guideline 2010-01, Supplemental Performance Measure for Publicly\nRegistered, Non-Listed REITs: Modified Funds from Operations (the Practice Guideline\u201d) issued by the IPA in November\n2010. The Practice Guideline defines MFFO as FFO further adjusted for acquisition and transaction-related fees and expenses and\nother items. In calculating MFFO, we follow the Practice Guideline and exclude acquisition and transaction-related fees and expenses\n(which includes costs incurred in connection with strategic alternatives), amounts relating to deferred rent receivables and amortization\nof market lease and other intangibles, net (which are adjusted in order to reflect such payments from a GAAP accrual basis to\na cash basis of disclosing the rent and lease payments), accretion of discounts and amortization of premiums on debt investments\nand borrowings, mark-to-market adjustments included in net income (including gains or losses incurred on assets held for sale),\ngains or losses included in net income from the extinguishment or sale of debt, hedges, foreign exchange, derivatives or securities\nholdings where trading of such holdings is not a fundamental attribute of the business plan, unrealized gains or losses resulting\nfrom consolidation from, or deconsolidation to, equity accounting, and after adjustments for consolidated and unconsolidated partnerships\nand joint ventures, with such adjustments calculated to reflect MFFO on the same basis. Certain of the above adjustments\nare also made to reconcile net income (loss) to net cash provided by (used in) operating activities, such as for the amortization\nof a premium and accretion of a discount on debt and securities investments, amortization of fees, any unrealized gains (losses)\non derivatives, securities or other investments, as well as other adjustments.\nMFFO\nexcludes non-recurring impairment of real estate-related investments. We assess the credit quality of our investments and adequacy\nof reserves on a quarterly basis, or more frequently as necessary. Significant judgment is required in this analysis. We consider\nthe estimated net recoverable value of a loan as well as other factors, including but not limited to the fair value of any collateral,\nthe amount and the status of any senior debt, the prospects for the borrower and the competitive situation of the region where\nthe borrower does business.\nWe\nbelieve that, because MFFO excludes costs that we consider more reflective of acquisition activities and other non-operating items,\nMFFO can provide, on a going-forward basis, an indication of the sustainability (that is, the capacity to continue to be maintained)\nof our operating performance after the period in which we are acquiring properties and once our portfolio is stabilized. We also\nbelieve that MFFO is a recognized measure of sustainable operating performance by the non-listed REIT industry and allows for\nan evaluation of our performance against other publicly registered, non-listed REITs.\nNot\nall REITs, including publicly registered, non-listed REITs, calculate FFO and MFFO the same way. Accordingly, comparisons with\nother REITs, including publicly registered, non-listed REITs, may not be meaningful. Furthermore, FFO and MFFO are not indicative\nof cash flow available to fund cash needs and should not be considered as an alternative to net income (loss) or income (loss)\nfrom continuing operations as determined under GAAP as an indication of our performance, as an alternative to cash flows from\noperations as an indication of our liquidity, or indicative of funds available to fund our cash needs including our ability to\nmake distributions to our stockholders. FFO and MFFO should be reviewed in conjunction with other GAAP measurements as an indication\nof our performance. FFO and MFFO should not be construed to be more relevant or accurate than the current GAAP methodology in\ncalculating net income or in its applicability in evaluating our operating performance. The methods utilized to evaluate the performance\nof a publicly registered, non-listed REIT under GAAP should be construed as more relevant measures of operational performance\nand considered more prominently than the non-GAAP measures, FFO and MFFO, and the adjustments to GAAP in calculating FFO and MFFO.\nNeither\nthe SEC, NAREIT, the IPA nor any other regulatory body or industry trade group has passed judgment on the acceptability of the\nadjustments that we use to calculate FFO or MFFO. In the future, NAREIT, the IPA or another industry trade group may publish updates to\nthe White Paper or the Practice Guidelines or the SEC or another regulatory body could standardize the allowable adjustments across\nthe publicly registered, non-listed REIT industry, and we would have to adjust our calculation and characterization of FFO or\nMFFO accordingly.\nThe\nbelow table illustrates the items deducted in the calculation of FFO and MFFO. Items are presented net of non-controlling interest\nportions where applicable.\nTable 62: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>For\nthe\nYears Ended </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td>

Acquisition fees and expenses under GAAP are considered operating expenses and\nas expenses included in the determination of net income and income from continuing operations,\nboth of which are performance measures under GAAP.

(the Lightstone REIT I\u201d), (together with the Operating Partnership (as defined below), the\nCompany\u201d, also referred to as we\u201d, our\u201d or us\u201d herein) has and expects to\ncontinue to acquire and operate or develop in the future, commercial, residential and hospitality properties and/or make real\nestate-related investments, principally in the United States. Our acquisitions and investments are, principally conducted through\nthe Operating Partnership, and may include both portfolios and individual properties.\nAs\nof December 31, 2021, we have ownership interests in (i) two consolidated operating properties, (ii) two consolidated development\nproperties and (iii) seven unconsolidated operating properties. With respect to our consolidated operating properties, we wholly\nown the St. Augustine Outlet Center, a retail property containing 0.3 million square feet of gross leasable area, and have a majority\nownership interest of 59.2% in Gantry Park Landing, a multi-family residential property containing 199 apartment units. With respect\nto our consolidated development properties, we wholly own two projects consisting of the Lower East Side Moxy Hotel and the Exterior\nStreet Project. We also hold a 2.5% ownership interest in seven hotel properties through a joint venture (the Joint Venture\u201d)\nwhich we account for using a measurement alternative under which the Joint Venture is measured at cost, adjusted for observable\nprice changes and impairments, if any. The Joint Venture is between us and the operating partnership of Lightstone Value Plus\nREIT II, Inc., a real estate investment trust also sponsored by our Sponsor, which has a 97.5% ownership interest in the Joint\nVenture. Furthermore, we have other real estate-related investments, including preferred contributions that were made pursuant\nto agreements with various related party entities (the Preferred Investments\u201d) and nonrecourse promissory notes made\nto unaffiliated third-parties. Our real estate investments have been and are expected to continue to be held by the Company alone\nor jointly with other parties.\nWe\ndo not have employees. We entered into an advisory agreement pursuant to which the Advisor supervises and manages our day-to-day\noperations and selects our real estate and real estate related investments, subject to oversight by our board of directors (the\nBoard of Directors\u201d). We pay the Advisor fees for services related to the investment and management of our assets,\nand we will reimburse the Advisor for certain expenses incurred on our behalf.\t\nTo\nmaintain our qualification as a REIT, we engage in certain activities through taxable REIT subsidiaries ( TRSs\u201d).\nAs such, we may still be subject to U.S. federal and state income and franchise taxes from these activities.\nAcquisitions\nand Investment Strategy\nWe\nhave, to date, acquired and/or developed residential, commercial and hospitality properties principally, all of which are located\nin the United States and also made other real estate-related investments. Our acquisitions have included both portfolios and individual\nproperties. Our current operating properties consist of one retail property (the St. Augustine Outlet Center) and one multi-family\nresidential property (Gantry Park Landing). We have also acquired various parcels of land and air rights related to the development\nand construction of real estate properties. Additionally, we have made preferred investments in related parties and originated\nnonrecourse loans to unaffiliated third-party borrowers.\nInvestments\nin real estate are generally made through the purchase of all or part of a fee simple ownership, or all or part of a leasehold\ninterest. We may also purchase limited partnership interests, limited liability company interests and other equity securities.\nWe may also enter into joint ventures with related parties for the acquisition, development or improvement of properties as well\nas general partnerships, co-tenancies and other participations with real estate developers, owners and others for the purpose\nof developing, owning and operating real properties. We will not enter into a joint venture to make an investment that we would\nnot be permitted to make on our own. Not more than 10% of our total assets will be invested in unimproved real property. For purposes\nof this paragraph, unimproved real properties\u201d does not include properties acquired for the purpose of producing\nrental or other operating income, properties under construction and properties for which development or construction is planned\nwithin one year.\nCurrent\nEnvironment\nOur\noperating results are substantially impacted by the overall health of local, U.S. national and global economies and may be influenced\nby market and other challenges. Additionally, our business and financial performance may be adversely affected by current and\nfuture economic and other conditions; including, but not limited to, availability or terms of financings, financial markets volatility,\npolitical upheaval or uncertainty, natural and man-made disasters, terrorism and acts of war, unfavorable changes in laws and\nregulations, outbreaks of contagious diseases, cybercrime, loss of key relationships, and recession.\nCOVID-19\nPandemic\nThe\nWorld Health Organization declared COVID-19 a global pandemic on March 11, 2020 and since that time many of the previously imposed\nrestrictions and other measures which were instituted in response have been subsequently reduced or lifted. However, the COVID-19\npandemic remains highly unpredictable and dynamic and its duration and extent continue to be dependent on various developments,\nsuch as the emergence of variants to the virus that may cause additional strains of COVID-19, the administration and ultimate\neffectiveness of vaccines, and the eventual timeline to achieve a sufficient level of herd immunity among the general population.\nAccordingly, the COVID-19 pandemic may continue to have negative effects on the health of the U.S. economy for the foreseeable\nfuture.\nAs\na result of previously imposed restrictions, we temporarily closed our St. Augustine Outlet Center from March 20, 2020 through\nMay 7, 2020. During the COVID-19 pandemic, the property's occupancy declined and because of limited leasing success, we\nbegan exploring various strategic alternatives for our St. Augustine Outlet Center and as a result determined during the third\nquarter of 2021 that we would no longer pursue leasing of space to tenants and therefore, entered into lease termination agreements\nwith certain tenants and also provided notice to our other tenants that we would not renew their leases at scheduled expiration.\nAs a result of this change in leasing strategy and resulting decrease in the fair value of the St. Augustine Outlet Center, we\nrecorded a non-cash impairment charge of $11.3 million during the third quarter of 2021. See Note 8 of the Notes to Consolidated\nFinancial Statements for additional information.\nAdditionally,\nas a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, during 2020 we saw deterioration in both the occupancy and rental rates for Gantry Park\nLanding, which is located on Long Island, New York, as the luxury rental market in the greater New York City metropolitan area\nwas negatively impacted. However, both occupancy and rental rates have improved considerably throughout 2021 and have returned\nto pre-COVID-19 levels.\nTo-date,\nthe COVID-19 pandemic has not had any significant impact on our development projects. Furthermore, our other real estate-related\ninvestments (both our preferred investments in related parties and nonrecourse loans made to unaffiliated third-party borrowers)\nalso relate to various development projects which are at different stages in their respective development process. These investments,\nwhich are subject to similar restrictions and other measures, have also not yet been significantly impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic.\nThe\noverall extent to which our business may be affected by the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic will largely depend on both current and\nfuture developments, all of which are highly uncertain and cannot be reasonably predicted.\nIf\nour operating properties, development projects and real estate-related investments are negatively impacted for an extended period\nbecause (i) occupancy levels and rental rates further decline, (ii) tenants are unable to pay their rent, (iii) borrowers are\nunable to pay scheduled debt service on notes receivable, (iv) development activities are delayed and/or (v) various related party\nentities are unable to pay monthly preferred distributions on our preferred investments in related parties, our business and financial\nresults could be materially and adversely impacted.\nWe\nare not currently aware of any other material trends or uncertainties, favorable or unfavorable, that may be reasonably anticipated\nto have a material impact on either capital resources or the revenues or income to be derived from our operations, other than\nthose referred to above or throughout this Form 10-K. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles\ngenerally accepted in the United States of America ( GAAP\u201d) requires the Company's management to make estimates\nand assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities\nand the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during a reporting period.\nCritical\nAccounting Estimates and Policies\nGeneral\nOur\nconsolidated financial statements, included in this annual report, include our accounts, the Operating Partnership and its subsidiaries (over\nwhich we exercise financial and operating control). All inter-company balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.\nThe\ndiscussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements,\nwhich have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of our financial statements requires us to make estimates and\njudgments about the effects of matters or future events that are inherently uncertain. These estimates and judgments may affect\nthe reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities.\nOn\nan ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates, including contingencies and litigation. We base these estimates on historical experience\nand on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable in the circumstances. These estimates form the basis for making\njudgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results\nmay differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.\nTo\nassist in understanding our results of operations and financial position, we have identified our critical accounting policies\nand discussed them below. These accounting policies are most important to the portrayal of our results and financial position,\neither because of the significance of the financial statement items to which they relate or because they require our management's\nmost difficult, subjective or complex judgments.\nRevenue\nRecognition\nOur\nrevenue, which is comprised largely of rental income, includes rents that tenants pay in accordance with the terms of their respective\nleases reported on a straight-line basis over the initial term of the lease. Since our leases may provide for rental increases\nat specified intervals, straight-line basis accounting requires us to record as an asset, and include in revenue, unbilled rent\nthat we only receive if the tenant makes all rent payments required through the expiration of the initial term of the lease.\nIn\naddition, we will defer the recognition of contingent rental income, such as percentage rents, until the specific target which\ntriggers the contingent rental income is achieved. Cost recoveries from tenants will be included in tenant recovery income in\nthe period the related costs are incurred.\nInvestments\nin Real Estate\nWe\ngenerally record investments in real estate at cost and capitalize improvements and replacements when they extend the useful life\nor improve the efficiency of the asset. We expense costs of ordinary repairs and maintenance as incurred. We compute depreciation\nusing the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the applicable real estate asset. We generally use estimated\nuseful lives of up to thirty-nine years for buildings and improvements, five to ten years for furniture and fixtures\nand the shorter of the useful life or the remaining lease term for tenant improvements and leasehold interests.\nWe\nmake subjective assessments as to the useful lives of our properties for purposes of determining the amount of depreciation to\nrecord on an annual basis with respect to our investments in real estate. These assessments have a direct impact on our net income\nbecause, if we were to shorten the expected useful lives of our investments in real estate, we would depreciate these investments\nover fewer years, resulting in more depreciation expense and lower net income on an annual basis.\nWe\nrecord assets and groups of assets and liabilities which comprise disposal groups as held for sale\u201d when all of the\nfollowing criteria are met: a decision has been made to sell, the assets are available for sale immediately, the assets are being\nactively marketed at a reasonable price in relation to the current fair value, a sale has been or is expected to be concluded\nwithin twelve months of the balance sheet date, and significant changes to the plan to sell are not expected. The assets and disposal\ngroups held for sale are valued at the lower of book value or fair value less disposal costs. For sales of real estate or assets\nclassified as held for sale, we evaluate whether a disposal transaction meets the criteria of a strategic shift and will have\na major effect on our operations and financial results to determine if the results of operations and gains on sale of real estate\nwill be presented as part of our continuing operations or as discontinued operations in our consolidated statements of operations.\nIf the disposal represents a strategic shift, it will be classified as discontinued operations for all periods presented; if not,\nit will be presented in continuing operations.\nWe\nevaluate the recoverability of our investments in real estate assets at the lowest identifiable level, the individual property\nlevel. An impairment loss is recognized only if the carrying amount of a long-lived asset is not recoverable and exceeds its fair\nvalue.\nWe\nevaluate the long-lived assets for potential impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the undiscounted\nprojected cash flows are less than the carrying amount for a particular property. No single indicator would necessarily result\nin us preparing an estimate to determine if a long-lived asset's future undiscounted cash flows are less than its book value.\nWe use judgment to determine if the severity of any single indicator, or the fact there are a number of indicators of less severity\nthat when combined, would result in an indication that a long-lived asset requires an estimate of the undiscounted cash flows\nto determine if an impairment has occurred. Relevant facts and circumstances include, among others, significant underperformance\nrelative to historical or projected future operating results and significant negative industry or economic trends. The estimated\ncash flows used for the impairment analysis are subjective and require us to use our judgment and the determination of estimated\nfair value are based on our plans for the respective assets and our views of market and economic conditions. The estimates consider\nmatters such as future operating income, market and other applicable trends and residual value, as well as the effects of demand,\ncompetition, and recent sales data for comparable properties. Changes in estimated future cash flows due to changes in our plans\nor views of market and economic conditions could result in recognition of impairment losses, which, under the applicable accounting\nguidance, may be substantial.\nAccounting\nfor Asset Acquisitions\nThe\ncost of the acquisition in an asset acquisition is allocated to the acquired tangible assets, consisting of land, building and\ntenant improvements, and identified intangible assets and liabilities, consisting of the value of above-market and below-market\nleases for acquired in-place leases and the value of tenant relationships, and certain liabilities such as assumed debt and contingent\nliabilities on the basis of their relative fair values. Fees incurred related to asset acquisitions are capitalized as part of\nthe cost of the investment.\nAccounting\nfor Development Projects\nWe\nincur a variety of costs in the development of a property. The costs of land and building under development include specifically\nidentifiable costs. The capitalized costs include, but are not limited to, pre-construction costs essential to the development\nof the property, development costs, construction costs, interest costs, real estate taxes and other costs incurred during the\nperiod of development. We cease capitalization when the development project is substantially complete and placed in service,\nwhich may occur in phases. Determination of when a development project is substantially complete and capitalization must cease\ninvolves a degree of judgment.\nOnce\na development project is placed in service, which may occur in phases or for an entire building or project, the costs capitalized\nto that development project are transferred to land and improvements, buildings and improvements, and furniture and fixtures on\nour consolidated balance sheets at the historical cost of the property.\nNotes\nReceivable and Preferred Investments\nNotes\nreceivable and preferred investments that we intend to hold to maturity are carried at cost, net of any unamortized origination\ncosts, fees, discounts, premiums and unfunded commitments.\nInvestment\nincome will be recognized on an accrual basis and any related premium, discount, origination costs and fees are amortized over\nthe life of the investment using the effective interest method. The amortization is reflected as an adjustment to investment income\nin the Company's statements of operations.\nIncome\nrecognition is suspended when, in the opinion of management, a full recovery of income and principal becomes doubtful. When the\nultimate collectability of the principal is in doubt, all payments are applied to principal under the cost recovery method. When\nthe ultimate collectability of the principal is not in doubt, contractual interest is recorded as investment income when received,\nunder the cash basis method, until an accrual is resumed when the instrument becomes contractually current and performance is\ndemonstrated to be resumed.\nCredit\nLosses and Impairment on Notes Receivable\nNotes\nreceivable are considered impaired when, based on current information and events, it is probable that we will not be able to collect\nprincipal and interest amounts due according to the contractual terms. We assess the credit quality of our notes receivable and\nadequacy of reserves on a quarterly basis, or more frequently as necessary. Significant judgment of management is required in\nthis analysis. We consider the estimated net recoverable value of the notes receivable as well as other factors, including but\nnot limited to the fair value of any collateral, the amount and the status of any senior debt, the quality and financial condition\nof the borrower and the competitive situation of the area where the underlying collateral is located. Because this determination\nis based on projections of future economic events, which are inherently subjective, the amount ultimately realized may differ\nmaterially from the carrying value as of the balance sheet date. If upon completion of the assessment, the estimated fair value\nof the underlying collateral is less than the net carrying value of the notes receivable, a reserve is recorded with a corresponding\ncharge to investment income. The reserve for each note receivable is maintained at a level that is determined to be adequate by\nmanagement to absorb probable losses.\nCredit\nLosses and Impairment on Preferred Investments\nPreferred\ninvestments that are accounted for as held to maturity are assessed for impairment at the individual investment level when there\nis a decline in fair value below the amortized cost basis that is deemed to be other than temporary. In making the determination\nof an other-than-temporary impairment assessment, the Company considers all available information relevant to the collectability\nof the investment, including information about past events, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts when\ndeveloping the estimate of cash flows expected to be collected. This information includes the remaining redemption terms of the\ninvestment, financial condition of the issuer, expected defaults and the value of any underlying collateral. In assessing whether\nthe entire amortized cost basis of the investment will be recovered, the Company compares the present value of cash flows expected\nto be collected from the investment with the amortized cost basis and records an impairment based on the amount by which the present\nvalue of cash flows expected to be collected is less than the amortized cost basis of the investment.\nTreatment\nof Management Compensation, Expense Reimbursements and Operating Partnership Participation Interest\nManagement\nof our operations is outsourced to our Advisor and certain other affiliates of our Sponsor. Fees related to each of these services\nare accounted for based on the nature of such service and the relevant accounting literature. Such fees include acquisition fees\nassociated with the purchase of interests in affiliated real estate entities; asset management fees paid to our Advisor and property\nmanagement fees paid to our Property Manager, which manage certain of the properties we acquire, or to other unaffiliated third-party\nproperty managers, principally for the management of our hospitality properties. These fees are expensed or capitalized to the\nbasis of acquired assets, as appropriate.\nOur\nProperty Manager may also perform fee-based construction management services for both our re-development activities and tenant\nconstruction projects. These fees are considered incremental to the construction effort and will be capitalized to the associated\nreal estate project as incurred. Costs incurred for tenant construction will be depreciated over the shorter of their useful\nlife or the term of the related lease. Costs related to redevelopment activities will be depreciated over the estimated useful\nlife of the associated project.\nLeasing\nactivity at certain of our properties has also been outsourced to our Property Manager. Any corresponding leasing fees we pay\nare capitalized and amortized over the life of the related lease.\nExpense\nreimbursements made to both our Advisor and Property Manager will be expensed or capitalized to the basis of acquired assets,\nas appropriate.\nThrough\nMarch 31, 2009, Lightstone SLP, LLC, an affiliate of the Advisor, purchased an aggregate of $30.0 million of SLP Units in the\nOperating Partnership at a cost of $100,000 per unit and none thereafter.\nIncome\nTaxes\nWe\nelected to be taxed and qualify as a REIT commencing with the taxable year ended December 31, 2005. If we remain qualified as\na REIT, we generally will not be subject to U.S. federal income tax on our net taxable income that we distribute currently to\nour stockholders. To maintain our REIT qualification under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, or the Code, we must\nmeet a number of organizational and operational requirements, including a requirement that we annually distribute to our stockholders\nat least 90% of our REIT taxable income (which does not equal net income, as calculated in accordance with generally accepted\naccounting principles in the United States of America, or GAAP), determined without regard to the deduction for dividends paid\nand excluding any net capital gain. If we fail to remain qualified for taxation as a REIT in any subsequent year and do not qualify\nfor certain statutory relief provisions, our income for that year will be taxed at regular corporate rates, and we may be precluded\nfrom qualifying for treatment as a REIT for the four-year period following our failure to qualify as a REIT. Such an event could\nmaterially adversely affect our net income and net cash available for distribution to our stockholders.\nTo\nmaintain our qualification as a REIT, we engage in certain activities through taxable REIT subsidiaries ( TRSs\u201d).\nAs such, we may still be subject to U.S. federal and state income and franchise taxes from these activities.\nAs\nof December 31, 2021 and 2020, we had no material uncertain income tax positions. Additionally, even if we continue to qualify\nas a REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes, we may still be subject to some U.S. federal, state and local taxes on our income\nand property and to U.S. federal income taxes and excise taxes on our undistributed income.\nResults\nof Operations\nDisposition\nof the Santa Clara Data Center\nOn\nJanuary 10, 2019, we acquired a parcel of land located at 2175 Martin Avenue, Santa Clara, California (the Martin Avenue\nLand\u201d) from an unaffiliated third party for $10.6 million. Subsequently, we completed certain activities associated with\nthe potential development and construction of a data center on the Martin Avenue Land (the Santa Clara Data Center\u201d).\nOn\nJuly 7, 2021, we disposed of the Santa Clara Data Center to an unrelated third party for a contractual sales price of $13.9 million.\nIn connection with the disposition of the Santa Clara Data Center, we recognized a gain on sale of investment property of $0.2\nmillion during the third quarter of 2021.\nThe\ndisposition of the Santa Clara Data Center did not qualify to be reported as discontinued operations since it did not represent\na strategic shift that had a major effect on our operations and financial results. Accordingly, the operating results of the Santa\nClara Data Center are reflected in our results from continuing operations for all periods presented through its date of disposition.\nInvestment\nImpairment - St. Augustine Outlet Center\nDuring\nthe COVID-19 pandemic, St. Augustine Outlet Center's occupancy declined and because of limited leasing success, we began\nbeen exploring various strategic alternatives for the property and as a result determined during the third quarter of 2021 that\nwe would no longer pursue leasing of space to tenants and therefore, entered into lease termination agreements with certain tenants\nand also provided notice to its other tenants that it would not renew their leases at scheduled expiration. As a result of this\nchange in leasing strategy and resulting decrease in the fair value of the St. Augustine Outlet Center, we recorded a non-cash\nimpairment charge of $11.3 million during the third quarter of 2021 to reduce the carrying value of the St. Augustine Outlet Center\nto its estimated fair value of $23.3 million as of September 30, 2021. In estimating the fair value of the St. Augustine Outlet\nCenter, we used management's internal analysis prepared with consideration of local market conditions.\nWe\nbelieve the reduced carrying value of the St. Augustine Outlet Center is currently recoverable. However, if market conditions\nworsen unexpectedly or if changes in its strategy significantly affect any key assumptions used in determining the property's\nestimated fair value, we may need to take additional impairment charges in future periods.\nFor\nthe Year Ended December 31, 2021 vs. December 31, 2020\nConsolidated\nRevenues\nOur\nrevenues are comprised of rental income and tenant recovery income. Total revenues decreased by $0.9 million to $10.4 million\nfor the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to $11.3 million for the same period in 2020. This decrease was primarily attributable\nto reduced occupancy and rental rates for Gantry Park Landing during the 2021 period resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic.\nProperty\noperating expenses\nProperty\noperating expenses increased by $0.2 million to $4.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to $4.0 million for\nthe same period in 2020. The increase in property operating expenses is primarily a result of lease termination fees incurred\nfor the St. Augustine Outlet Center. See Investment Impairment - St. Augustine Outlet Center\u201d above.\nReal\nestate taxes\nReal\nestate taxes decreased by $0.3 million to $0.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to $0.6 million for the same\nperiod in 2020. The decrease reflects lower real estate taxes resulting from the sale of the Santa Clara Data Center and certain\nland parcels adjacent to the St. Augustine Outlet Center.\nGeneral\nand administrative expenses\nGeneral\nand administrative expenses decreased by $0.5 million to $2.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to $3.1 million\nfor the same period in 2020 principally due to lower bad debt expense in 2021.\nImpairment\ncharge\nDuring\nthe third quarter of 2021, we recorded a non-cash impairment charge of $11.3 million to reduce the carrying value of our St. Augustine\nOutlet Center to its estimated fair value as of September 30, 2021. See Investment Impairment - St. Augustine Outlet Center\u201d\nabove.\nDepreciation\nand amortization\nDepreciation\nand amortization increased by $1.5 million to $5.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to $4.0 million for the\nsame period in 2020. The increase in depreciation and amortization reflects changes to the estimated remaining useful lives of\ncertain tenant-related building improvements resulting from lease terminations for the St. Augustine Outlet Center. See Investment\nImpairment - St. Augustine Outlet Center\u201d above.\nInterest\nand dividend income\nInterest\nand dividend income increased by $0.8 million to $13.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to $13.0 million\nfor the same period in 2020. The increase primarily reflects higher interest income earned on our notes receivable of $0.3 million\nand higher interest and dividend income earned on our available cash and investments in marketable securities of $0.7 million,\npartially offset by lower investment income of $0.2 million from our Preferred Investments.\nInterest\nexpense\nInterest\nexpense, including amortization of deferred financing costs, decreased by $0.4 million to $2.6 million for the year ended December\n31, 2021 compared to $3.0 million for the same period in 2020. During the year ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, $8.2 million\nand $7.8 million, respectively, of interest was capitalized to construction in progress for our development projects.\nGain\non disposition of real estate, net\nOur\ngain on disposition of real estate, net of $3.9 million during the year ended December 31, 2021 primarily is attributable to a\nsecond quarter gain of $3.6 million recognized in connection with the disposition of a parcel of land adjacent to St. Augustine\nOutlet Center and a third quarter gain of $0.2 million recognized in connection with the disposition of the Santa Clara Data Center.\nOur\ngain on disposition of real estate, net of $1.6 million during the year ended December 31, 2020 consists of a second quarter gain\nof $1.6 million recognized in connection with the disposition of a parcel of land adjacent to the St. Augustine Outlet Center.\nUnrealized\ngain/(loss) on marketable equity securities\nDuring\nthe year ended December 31, 2021, we recorded unrealized gains on marketable equity securities of $16.5 million and during the\nyear ended December 31, 2020, we recorded unrealized losses on marketable equity securities of $12.2 million. These unrealized\ngains and losses represented the change in the fair value of our marketable equity securities during those periods.\nGain/(loss)\non sale and redemption of marketable securities\nDuring\nthe year ended December 31, 2021, we recorded a gain on the sale of marketable securities of $5.9 million and during the year\nended December 31, 2020, we recorded a loss on the sale of marketable securities of $0.2 million. These gains and losses represented\nthe difference between the sales price and carrying value of our marketable securities sold during those periods.\nNoncontrolling\ninterests\nThe\nnet earnings allocated to noncontrolling interests relates to (i) parties of the Company that hold units in the Operating Partnership,\n(ii) the interest in PRO-DFJV Holdings LLC ( PRO\u201d) held by our Sponsor, (iii) the ownership interests in 50-01 2nd\nSt. Associates LLC (the 2nd Street Joint Venture\u201d) held by our Sponsor and other affiliates and (iv) the ownership\ninterest in various joint ventures held by affiliates of our Sponsor that have originated nonrecourse loans to unaffiliated third-party\nborrowers.\nFinancial\nCondition, Liquidity and Capital Resources\nOverview:\nAs\nof December 31, 2021, we had $39.4 million of cash on hand, $3.2 million of restricted cash and $62.8 million of marketable securities.\nWe also have the ability to make draws from a line of credit up to $20.0 million, subject to certain conditions (see Notes\nPayable - Line of Credit\u201d). We currently believe that these items along with rental income from our operating properties;\ninterest and dividend income earned on our marketable securities, notes receivable and preferred investments; as well as proceeds\nreceived from the repayment of the notes receivable and redemptions of the preferred investments will be sufficient to satisfy\nour expected cash requirements primarily consisting our anticipated operating expenses, scheduled debt service, capital expenditures\n(including certain of our development activities) and distributions to our shareholders, if any, required to maintain our status\nas a REIT for the foreseeable future. However, we may also obtain additional funds through selective asset dispositions, joint\nventure arrangements, new borrowings and refinancing of existing debt.\nWe\ncurrently have two development projects (see Development Activities\u201d). With respect to our Lower East Side Moxy Hotel,\nwhich is currently under construction and expected to open during the fourth quarter of 2022, we have obtained construction financings\nand the remaining costs associated with the construction of the Lower East Side Moxy Hotel are expected to be funded from the\nremaining availability under such construction financings. See Development Activities - Lower East Side Moxy Hotel\u201d\nfor additional information. Our Exterior Street Project is currently under development and we expect to seek construction financing\nto fund a substantial portion of its future development and construction costs. See Development Activities - Exterior\nStreet Project\u201d for additional information.\nOur\nborrowings consist of single-property mortgages as well as mortgages cross-collateralized by a pool of properties. We typically\nhave obtained level payment financing, meaning that the amount of debt service payable would be substantially the same each year.\nAs such, most of the mortgages on our properties provide for a so-called balloon\u201d payment and are at a fixed interest\nrate.\nAdditionally,\nin order to leverage our investments in marketable securities and seek a higher rate of return, we have access to borrowings under\na margin loan and line of credit collateralized by the securities held with the financial institution that provided the margin\nloan and line of credit as well as a portion of our Marco OP Units. These loans are due on demand and any outstanding balance\nmust be paid upon the liquidation of securities.\nOur\ncharter provides that the aggregate amount of borrowing, both secured and unsecured, may not exceed 300% of net assets in the\nabsence of a satisfactory showing that a higher level is appropriate, the approval of the Board of Directors and disclosure to\nstockholders. Net assets means our total assets, other than intangibles, at cost before deducting depreciation or other non-cash\nreserves less our total liabilities, calculated at least quarterly on a basis consistently applied. Any excess in borrowing over\nsuch 300% of net assets level must be approved by a majority of our independent directors and disclosed to our stockholders in\nour next quarterly report to stockholders, along with justification for such excess. As of December 31, 2021, our total borrowings\nof $171.8 million represented 53% of net assets.\nAny\nfuture properties that we may acquire or investments we may make may be funded through a combination of borrowings, proceeds generated\nfrom the sale and redemption of our marketable securities, available for sale, proceeds received from the selective disposition\nof our properties and proceeds received from the redemption of our preferred investments in related parties. These borrowings\nmay consist of single-property mortgages as well as mortgages cross-collateralized by a pool of properties. Such mortgages may\nbe put in place either at the time we acquire a property or subsequent to our purchasing a property for cash. In addition, we\nmay acquire properties that are subject to existing indebtedness where we choose to assume the existing mortgages. Generally,\nthough not exclusively, we intend to seek to encumber our properties with debt, which will be on a non-recourse basis. This means\nthat a lender's rights on default will generally be limited to foreclosing on the property. However, we may, at our discretion,\nsecure recourse financing or provide a guarantee to lenders if we believe this may result in more favorable terms. When we give\na guaranty for a property owning entity, we will be responsible to the lender for the satisfaction of the indebtedness if it is\nnot paid by the property owning entity.\nWe\nmay also obtain lines of credit to be used to acquire properties or real estate-related assets. These lines of credit will be\nat prevailing market terms and will be repaid from proceeds from the sale or refinancing of properties, working capital or permanent\nfinancing. Our Sponsor or its affiliates may guarantee the lines of credit although they will not be obligated to do so. We expect\nthat such properties may be purchased by our Sponsor's affiliates on our behalf, in our name, in order to minimize the imposition\nof a transfer tax upon a transfer of such properties to us.\nWe have\nvarious agreements, including an advisory agreement, with the Advisor to pay certain fees in exchange for services performed by\nthe Advisor and/or its affiliated entities. Additionally, our ability to secure financing and our real estate operations are dependent\nupon our Advisor and its affiliates to perform such services as provided in these agreements.\nIn\naddition to meeting working capital needs and distributions, if any, to our stockholders, our capital resources are used to make\ncertain payments to our Advisor and our Property Manager, including payments related to asset acquisition fees, development fees\nand leasing commissions, asset management fees, the reimbursement of acquisition related expenses to our Advisor and property\nmanagement fees. We also reimburse our Advisor and its affiliates for actual expenses it incurs for administrative and other services\nprovided to us. Additionally, the Operating Partnership may be required to make distributions to Lightstone SLP, LLC, an affiliate\nof the Advisor.\nThe\nadvisory agreement has a one-year term and is renewable for an unlimited number of successive one-year periods upon the mutual\nconsent of the Advisor and our independent directors.\nThe\nfollowing table represents the fees incurred associated with the payments to our Advisor and its affiliates:\n\n\nAdditionally,\nwe may be required to make distributions on the special general partner interests ( SLP Units\u201d) in the Operating Partnership\nheld by Lightstone SLP, LLC, an affiliate of the Advisor. In connection with the Company's initial public offering, Lightstone\nSLP, LLC purchased an aggregate of $30.0 million of SLP Units. These SLP Units, the purchase price of which will be repaid only\nafter stockholders receive a stated preferred return and their net investment, entitle Lightstone SLP, LLC to a portion of any\nregular distributions made by the Operating Partnership.\nDuring\nboth the of the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, distributions of $2.1 million were declared and paid on the SLP units.\nOur\ncharter states that our operating expenses, excluding offering costs, property operating expenses and real estate taxes, as well\nas acquisition fees and non-cash related items ( Qualified Operating Expenses\u201d) are to be less than the greater of\n2% of our average invested net assets or 25% of net income. For the year ended December 31, 2021, our Qualified Operating Expenses\nwere less than the greater of 2% of our average invested net assets or 25% of net income.\nIn\naddition, our charter states that our acquisition fees and expenses shall not exceed 6% of the contractual purchase price or in\nthe case of a mortgage, 6% of funds advanced unless approved by a majority of the independent directors. For the year ended December\n31, 2021, the acquisition fees and acquisition expenses were less than 6% of each of the contract prices.\nSummary\nof Cash Flows.\nThe\nfollowing summary discussion of our cash flows is based on the consolidated statements of cash flows and is not meant to be an\nall-inclusive discussion of the changes in our cash flows for the periods presented below:\n\nOperating\nactivities\nThe\nnet cash provided by operating activities of $10.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 consists of the following:\n \u25cf cash inflows of $9.8 million from our net income after adjustment for non-cash items; and \n \u25cf cash inflows of $0.2 million associated with the net changes in operating assets and liabilities. \nInvesting\nactivities\nThe\nnet cash provided by investing activities of $49.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 consists primarily of the following:\n\n\n\n\nFinancing\nactivities\nThe\nnet cash used in financing activities of $63.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 is primarily related to the following:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDevelopment\nActivities\nLower\nEast Side Moxy Hotel\nOn\nDecember 3, 2018, we, through a subsidiary of the Operating Partnership, acquired three adjacent parcels of land located at 147-151\nBowery, New York, New York from unaffiliated third parties for aggregate consideration of $56.5 million, excluding closing and\nother acquisition related costs. Additionally, on December 6, 2018, we, though a subsidiary of the Operating Partnership, acquired\ncertain air rights located at 329 Broome Street, New York, New York from an unaffiliated third party for $2.4 million, excluding\nclosing and other acquisition related costs. We are using the land and air rights in connection with the development and construction\nof a 296-room Marriott Moxy hotel (the Lower East Side Moxy Hotel\u201d). On June 3, 2021, the Company entered into a\ndevelopment agreement (the Development Agreement\u201d) with an affiliate of the Advisor (the Moxy Lower East Side\nDeveloper\u201d) pursuant to which the Lower East Side Moxy Developer will be paid a development fee equal to 3% of hard and\nsoft costs incurred in connection with the development and construction of the Lower East Side Moxy Hotel. Additionally on June\n3, 2021, the Company obtained construction financing for the Lower East Side Moxy Hotel. The Lower East Side Moxy Hotel is currently\nunder construction and expected to open during the fourth quarter of 2022.\nPreviously\non December 3, 2018, we had entered into a mortgage loan which was collateralized by the Lower East Side Moxy Hotel (the Lower\nEast Side Moxy Mortgage\u201d) for $35.6 million. The Lower East Side Moxy Mortgage had an initial term of two years, bore interest\nat the London Interbank Offered Rate ( LIBOR\u201d) + 4.25%, subject to a 6.63% floor, and required monthly interest-only\npayments through its stated maturity with the entire unpaid balance due upon maturity. In November 2020 the maturity date of Lower\nEast Side Moxy Mortgage was extended to March 3, 2021 and in March 2021 it was further extended until June 3, 2021, on which date\nit was then repaid in full as discussed below.\nOn\nJune 3, 2021, we, through a wholly owned subsidiary, closed on a recourse construction loan facility (the Moxy Senior Loan\u201d)\nproviding for up to $90.0 million of funds for the development and construction of the Lower East Side Moxy Hotel. At closing,\n$35.6 million of proceeds were initially advanced under the Moxy Senior Loan, which were used to repay in full the Lower East\nSide Moxy Mortgage. The Moxy Senior Loan bears interest at LIBOR + 7.50%, subject to an 8.00% floor, and initially matures on\nJune 3, 2024, with two one-year extension options, subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions. The Moxy Senior Loan is\ncollateralized by the Lower East Side Moxy Hotel. As of December 31, 2021, the outstanding principal balance of the Moxy Senior\nLoan was $35.6 million and the remaining availability under the facility was up to $54.4 million.\nSimultaneously\non June 3, 2021, we, through the same wholly owned subsidiary, also entered into a mezzanine construction loan facility (the Moxy\nJunior Loan\u201d and together with the Moxy Senior Loan, the Moxy Construction Loans\u201d) providing for up to $40.0\nmillion of additional funds for the development and construction of the Lower East Side Moxy Hotel. The Moxy Junior Loan bears\ninterest at LIBOR + 13.50%, subject to a 14.00% floor, and initially matures on June 3, 2024, with two one-year extension options\nsubject to the satisfaction of certain conditions. The Moxy Junior Loan is subordinate to the Moxy Senior loan but also collateralized\nby the Lower East Side Moxy Hotel. We provided a principal guarantee of up to $7.0 million with respect to the Moxy Junior Loan.\nAs of December 31, 2021, the outstanding principal balance of the Moxy Junior Loan was $24.6 million and the remaining availability\nunder the facility was up to $15.4 million.\nFuture\ndraws to cover the costs associated with the development and construction of the Lower East Side Moxy Hotel will first be advanced\nunder the Moxy Junior Loan until it has been fully funded and thereafter, funds will be advanced under the remaining availability\nof the Moxy Senior Loan.\nIn\nconnection with the Moxy Construction Loans, we provided certain completion and carry cost guarantees. We also entered into an\ninterest rate cap agreement pursuant to which the LIBOR rate will be capped at 3.00% on the Moxy Senior Loan through June 3, 2024\nat a cost of $0.2 million. Furthermore, in connection with the Moxy Construction Loans, we paid $5.3 million of loan fees and\nexpenses and accrued $1.1 million of loan exit fees which are due at the initial maturity date and are included in accounts payable,\naccrued expenses and other liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets as of December 31, 2021.\nExterior\nStreet Project\nOn\nFebruary 27, 2019, we, through subsidiaries of the Operating Partnership, acquired two adjacent parcels of land located at 355\nand 399 Exterior Street, New York, New York from unaffiliated third parties for an aggregate purchase price of $59.0 million,\nexcluding closing and other acquisition related costs. In September 2021, we subsequently acquired an additional adjacent parcel\nof land at cost from an affiliate of our Advisor for $1.0 million in order to achieve certain zoning compliance. We are using\nthe land parcels for the development of a multi-family residential property (the Exterior Street Project\u201d).\nOn\nMarch 29, 2019, we entered into a $35.0 million loan (the Exterior Street Loan\u201d) which commencing on October 10,\n2020 bears interest at LIBOR + 2.25% through its scheduled maturity date. The Exterior Street Loan requires monthly interest-only\npayments with the outstanding principal balance due in full at its maturity date. The Exterior Street Loan was initially scheduled\nto mature on April 9, 2021 but during April 2021, its maturity date was further extended to April 9, 2022. Additionally, on December\n21, 2021, the loan agreement was amended to provide an additional six-month extension and an additional $7.0 million loan (the\nExterior Street Supplemental Loan\u201d and collectively with the Exterior Street Loan, the Exterior Street Loans\u201d)\nwhich bears interest at LIBOR + 2.50% and requires monthly interest-only payments through its maturity date. The Exterior Street\nLoans are scheduled to mature on April 9, 2022, with a six-month extension option, subject to certain conditions and are collateralized\nby the Exterior Street Project.\nThe\nfollowing is a summary of the amounts incurred and capitalized to development projects on the consolidated balance sheet for the\nLower East Side Moxy Hotel and the Exterior Street Project as of December 31, 2021:\n\nTo-date\nthe ongoing COVID-19 pandemic as well as other economic conditions and uncertainties have not had a significant impact on our\ndevelopment activities associated with either the Lower East Side Moxy Hotel or the Exterior Street Project. As discussed above,\nwe have already obtained construction financing for the Lower East Side Moxy Hotel and it is currently under construction and\nexpected to open during the fourth quarter of 2022. However, with respect to our Exterior Street Project which is currently under\ndevelopment, we currently expect to seek construction financing to fund a substantial portion of its future development and construction\ncosts. The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic as well as other economic conditions and uncertainties may (i) affect our ability to obtain\nconstruction financing, and/or (ii) cause delays or increase costs associated with building materials or construction services\nnecessary for construction, which could adversely impact our ability to either ultimately commence and/or complete construction\nas planned, on budget or at all for the Exterior Street Project.\nAlthough\nwe currently believe our capital resources are sufficient to fund our expected development activities for the next 12 months,\nthere can be no assurance we will be successful in obtaining construction financing at favorable terms, if at all.\nPreferred\nInvestments\nWe\nhave Preferred Investments that entitle us to monthly preferred distributions. The Preferred Investments are classified as held-to-maturity\nsecurities, recorded at cost and included in investments in related parties on the consolidated balance sheets. The fair value\nof these investments approximated their carrying values based on market rates for similar instruments. During the year ended December\n31, 2020, we redeemed $11.0 million of the 40 East End Avenue Preferred Investment and the entire remaining Miami Moxy Preferred\nInvestment of $9.0 million.\nThe\nPreferred Investments are summarized as follows:\n\nNote:\n\nNotes\nReceivable\nWe\nformed certain joint ventures (collectively, the NR Joint Ventures\u201d) between wholly-owned subsidiaries of the Operating\nPartnership (collectively, the NR Subsidiaries\u201d) and affiliates of the Sponsor (the NR Affiliates\u201d)\nwhich have originated nonrecourse loans (collectively, the Joint Venture Promissory Notes\u201d) to unaffiliated third-party\nborrowers (collectively, the Joint Venture Borrowers\u201d).\nWe\ndetermined that the NR Joint Ventures are VIEs and the NR Subsidiaries are the primary beneficiaries. Since the NR Subsidiaries\nare the primary beneficiaries, beginning on the applicable date of formation, we consolidated the operating results and financial\ncondition of the NR Joint Ventures and accounted for the respective ownership interests of the NR Affiliates as noncontrolling\ninterests.\nThe\nJoint Venture Promissory Notes generally provide for monthly interest at a prescribed variable rate, subject to a floor. In connection\nwith the initial funding of the Joint Venture Promissory Notes, the NR Joint Ventures receive origination fees (ranging from 1.00%\nto 1.50%) based on the principal commitment under the loan and retain a portion of the loan proceeds to establish a reserve for\ninterest and other items (the Loan Reserves\u201d). The Joint Venture Promissory Notes are recorded in notes receivable,\nnet on the consolidated balance sheets.\nThe\nJoint Venture Promissory Notes generally have an initial term of one or two years and may provide for additional one-year extension\noptions subject to satisfaction of certain conditions, including the funding of additional Loan Reserves and payment of extension\nfees. The Joint Venture Promissory Notes are collateralized by either the membership interests of the Joint Venture Borrowers\nin the borrowing entity or the underlying real property being developed by the Joint Venture Borrower.\nThe\nJoint Venture Promissory Notes are recorded in notes receivable, net on the consolidated balance sheets. The origination fees\nreceived are presented in the consolidated balance sheets as a direct deduction from the carrying value of the Joint\nVenture Promissory Notes and are amortized into interest income, using a straight-line method that approximates the effective\ninterest method, over the initial term of the Joint Venture Promissory Notes. The Loan Reserves are presented in\nthe consolidated balance sheets as a direct deduction from the carrying value of the Joint Venture Promissory Notes and\nare applied against the monthly interest due over the initial term.\nThe\nNotes Receivable are summarized as follows:\n\n\nNotes:\n\n\n\n\nThe\nfollowing summarizes the interest earned (included in interest and dividend income on the consolidated statements of operations)\nfor each of the Joint Venture Promissory Notes during the periods indicated:\n\nStockholder's\nEquity\nShare\nRepurchase Program\nOur\nshare repurchase program (the SRP\u201d) may provide our stockholders with limited, interim liquidity by enabling them\nto sell their shares of common stock back to us, subject to restrictions.\nOn\nMarch 25, 2020, the Board of Directors amended the SRP to remove stockholder notice requirements and also approved the suspension\nof all redemptions effective immediately.\nEffective\nMarch 15, 2021 and May 14, 2021, the Board of Directors partially reopened the SRP to allow, subject to various conditions as\nset forth below, for redemptions submitted in connection with a stockholder's death and hardship, respectively, and set\nthe price for all such purchases to our current NAV per Share, as determined by the Board of Directors and reported by the Company\nfrom time to time. Deaths that occurred subsequent to January 1, 2020 were eligible for consideration, subject to certain conditions.\nBeginning January 1, 2022, requests for redemptions in connection with a stockholder's death must be submitted and received\nby us within one year of the stockholder's date of death for consideration.\nAt\nthe above noted dates, the Board of Directors established that on an annual basis, we would not redeem in excess of 0.5% of the\nnumber of shares outstanding as of the end of the preceding year for either death or hardship redemptions, respectively. Additionally,\nredemption requests generally would be processed on a quarterly basis and would be subject to pro ration if either type of redemption\nrequests exceeded the annual limitation.\nFor\nthe year ended December 31, 2021, we repurchased 143,918 shares of common stock for $11.18 per share, pursuant to the SRP. For\nthe period from January 1 through March 24, 2020, we repurchased 287,987 shares of common stock for $10.87 per share, pursuant\nto the SRP.\nOn\nMarch 18, 2022, The Board of Directors approved an increase to the annual threshold for death redemptions from up to 0.5% to 1.0%.\nTender Offer\nWe\ncommenced a tender offer on June 15, 2020, pursuant to which we offered to acquire up to 225,000 of our shares of common stock\nat a purchase price of $5.00 per share, or $1.1 million in the aggregate (the 2020 Tender Offer\u201d). Pursuant to the\nterms of the 2020 Tender Offer, which expired on July 24, 2020, we repurchased 0.1 million shares of our common stock for an aggregate\nof $0.3 million in August 2020.\nDistribution\nReinvestment Program ( DRIP\u201d)\nOur\ndistribution reinvestment program ( DRIP\u201d) provides our shareholders with an opportunity to purchase additional shares\nof our common stock at a discount by reinvesting distributions. Under our distribution reinvestment program, a shareholder may\nacquire, from time to time, additional shares of our common stock by reinvesting cash distributions payable by us to such shareholder,\nwithout incurring any brokerage commission, fees or service charges.\nThe\nDRIP had been suspended since 2015 until our DRIP Registration Statement on Form S-3D was filed and became effective as amended\nand restated, under the Securities Act of 1933 on October 25, 2018.\nPursuant\nto the DRIP following its reactivation, our stockholders who elect to participate may invest all or a portion of the cash distributions\nthat we pay them on shares of our common stock in additional shares of our common stock without paying any fees or commissions.\nThe purchase price for shares under the DRIP will be equal to 95% of our current NAV per Share, as determined by the Board of\nDirectors and reported by us from time to time. On December 16, 2021, the Board of Directors determined our NAV per Share of $11.75,\nas of September 30, 2021, which resulted in a purchase price for shares under the DRIP of $11.16 per share. As of December 31,\n2021, 9.9 million shares remain available for issuance under our DRIP.\nThe\nBoard of Directors reserves the right to terminate the DRIP for any reason without cause by providing written notice of termination\nof the DRIP to all participants.\nDistributions\nDeclared by the Board of Directors\nCommon\nShares\nDuring\nthe years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, distributions on our Common Shares were declared quarterly, for each calendar quarter\nend, at the pro rata equivalent of an annual distribution of $0.70 per share, or an annualized rate of 7.0% assuming a purchase\nprice of $10.00 per share, to stockholders of record at the close of business on the last day of the quarter-end. All distributions\nwere paid on or about the 15th day of the month following the quarter-end.\nTotal\ndistributions declared during both of the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 were $15.6 million.\nOn\nMarch 18, 2022, the Board of Directors authorized and declared a Common Share distribution of $0.175 per share for the quarterly\nperiod ending March 31, 2022. The quarterly distribution is the pro rata equivalent of an annual distribution of $0.70 per share,\nor an annualized rate of 7.0% assuming a purchase price of $10.00 per share. The distribution will be paid on or about the 15th\nday of the month following the quarter-end to stockholders of record at the close of business on the last day of the quarter-end.\nThe stockholders have an option to elect the receipt of shares under the Company's DRIP.\nSLP\nUnits\nFor\nboth of the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, total distributions declared and paid on the SLP Units were $2.1 million.\nAdditionally, on March 18, 2022, the Board of Directors declared a quarterly distribution for the quarterly period ending March\n31, 2022 on the SLP Units at an annualized rate of 7.0%. Any future distributions on the SLP Units will always be subordinated\nuntil stockholders receive a stated preferred return.\nContractual\nObligations\nThe\nfollowing is a summary of our contractual obligations outstanding over the next five years and thereafter as of December 31, 2021.\n\n\nNotes\nPayable\nMargin\nLoan\nWe\nhave access to a margin loan (the Margin Loan\u201d) from a financial institution that holds custody of certain of our\nmarketable securities. The Margin Loan, which is due on demand, bears interest at LIBOR + 0.85% (0.95% as of December 31, 2021)\nand is collateralized by the marketable securities in our account. The amounts available to us under the Margin Loan are at the\ndiscretion of the financial institution and not limited to the amount of collateral in our account. There were no amounts outstanding\nunder the Margin Loan as of December 31, 2021 and 2020.\nLine\nof Credit\nWe\nhave a non-revolving credit facility (the Line of Credit\u201d) with a financial institution that provides for borrowings\nup to a maximum of $20.0 million, subject to a 55% loan-to-value ratio based on the fair value of the underlying collateral, matures\non November 30, 2022 and bears interest at LIBOR + 1.35% (1.45% as of December 31, 2021). The Line of Credit is collateralized\nby an aggregate of 209,243 of Marco OP Units and Marco II OP Units and was guaranteed by PRO. As of December 31, 2021, the amount\nof borrowings available to be drawn under the Line of Credit was $18.4 million. No amounts were outstanding under the Line of\nCredit as of both December 31, 2021 and 2020.\nLIBOR\nThe\nMoxy Construction Loans, Exterior Street Loans, Margin Loan and Line of Credit are indexed to LIBOR. In late 2021, it was announced\nLIBOR interest rates will cease publication altogether by June 30, 2023. We have and intend continue to incorporate relatively\nstandardized replacement rate provisions into our LIBOR-indexed debt documents, including a spread adjustment mechanism designed\nto equate to the current LIBOR all in\u201d rate. There is significant uncertainty with respect to the implementation\nof the phase out and what alternative indexes will be adopted which will ultimately be determined by the market as a whole. It\ntherefore remains uncertain how such changes will be implemented and the effects such changes would have on us and the financial\nmarkets generally.\nDebt\nMaturities\nThe\nExterior Street Loans (outstanding principal balance of $42.0 million as of December 31, 2021) mature on April 9, 2022. We currently\nintend to extend or refinance the Exterior Street Loans on or before their maturity date.\nHowever,\nif we are unable to extend or refinance any of our maturing indebtedness at favorable terms, we will look to repay the then outstanding\nbalance with available cash and/or proceeds from selective asset sales. We have no additional significant maturities of mortgage\ndebt over the next 12 months.\nFunds\nfrom Operations and Modified Funds from Operations\nThe\nhistorical accounting convention used for real estate assets requires straight-line depreciation of buildings, improvements, and\nstraight-line amortization of intangibles, which implies that the value of a real estate asset diminishes predictably over time.\nWe believe that, because real estate values historically rise and fall with market conditions, including, but not limited to,\ninflation, interest rates, the business cycle, unemployment and consumer spending, presentations of operating results for a REIT\nusing the historical accounting convention for depreciation and certain other items may be less informative.\nBecause\nof these factors, the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts ( NAREIT\u201d), an industry trade group, has\npublished a standardized measure of performance known as funds from operations ( FFO\u201d), which is used in the REIT\nindustry as a supplemental performance measure. We believe FFO, which excludes certain items such as real estate-related depreciation\nand amortization, is an appropriate supplemental measure of a REIT's operating performance. FFO is not equivalent to our\nnet income or loss as determined under GAAP.\nWe\ncalculate FFO, a non-GAAP measure, consistent with the standards established over time by the Board of Governors of NAREIT, as\nrestated in a White Paper approved by the Board of Governors of NAREIT effective in December 2018 (the White Paper\u201d).\nThe White Paper defines FFO as net income or loss computed in accordance with GAAP, excluding depreciation and amortization related\nto real estate, gains and losses from the sale of certain real estate assets, gains and losses from change in control and impairment\nwrite-downs of certain real estate assets and investments in entities when the impairment is directly attributable to decreases\nin the value of depreciable real estate held by the entity. Our FFO calculation complies with NAREIT's definition.\nWe\nbelieve that the use of FFO provides a more complete understanding of our performance to investors and to management, and\nreflects the impact on our operations from trends in occupancy rates, rental rates, operating costs, general and administrative\nexpenses, and interest costs, which may not be immediately apparent from net income.\nChanges\nin the accounting and reporting promulgations under GAAP that were put into effect in 2009 subsequent to the establishment\nof NAREIT's definition of FFO, such as the change to expense as incurred rather than capitalize and depreciate acquisition\nfees and expenses incurred for business combinations, have prompted an increase in cash-settled expenses, specifically acquisition\nfees and expenses, as items that are expensed under GAAP across all industries. These changes had a particularly significant impact\non publicly registered, non-listed REITs, which typically have a significant amount of acquisition activity in the early\npart of their existence, particularly during the period when they are raising capital through ongoing initial public offerings.\nBecause\nof these factors, the Investment Program Association (the IPA\u201d), an industry trade group, published a standardized\nmeasure of performance known as modified funds from operations ( MFFO\u201d), which the IPA has recommended as a supplemental\nmeasure for publicly registered, non-listed REITs. MFFO is designed to be reflective of the ongoing operating performance of publicly\nregistered, non-listed REITs by adjusting for those costs that are more reflective of acquisitions and investment activity, along\nwith other items the IPA believes are not indicative of the ongoing operating performance of a publicly registered, non-listed\nREIT, such as straight-lining of rents as required by GAAP. We believe it is appropriate to use MFFO as a supplemental measure\nof operating performance because we believe that both before and after we have deployed all of our offering proceeds and\nare no longer incurring a significant amount of acquisition fees or other related costs, it reflects the impact on our operations\nfrom trends in occupancy rates, rental rates, operating costs, general and administrative expenses, and interest costs, which\nmay not be immediately apparent from net income. MFFO is not equivalent to our net income or loss as determined under GAAP.\nWe\ndefine MFFO, a non-GAAP measure, consistent with the IPA's Guideline 2010-01, Supplemental Performance Measure for Publicly\nRegistered, Non-Listed REITs: Modified Funds from Operations (the Practice Guideline\u201d) issued by the IPA in November\n2010. The Practice Guideline defines MFFO as FFO further adjusted for acquisition and transaction-related fees and expenses and\nother items. In calculating MFFO, we follow the Practice Guideline and exclude acquisition and transaction-related fees and expenses\n(which includes costs incurred in connection with strategic alternatives), amounts relating to deferred rent receivables and amortization\nof market lease and other intangibles, net (which are adjusted in order to reflect such payments from a GAAP accrual basis to\na cash basis of disclosing the rent and lease payments), accretion of discounts and amortization of premiums on debt investments\nand borrowings, mark-to-market adjustments included in net income (including gains or losses incurred on assets held for sale),\ngains or losses included in net income from the extinguishment or sale of debt, hedges, foreign exchange, derivatives or securities\nholdings where trading of such holdings is not a fundamental attribute of the business plan, unrealized gains or losses resulting\nfrom consolidation from, or deconsolidation to, equity accounting, and after adjustments for consolidated and unconsolidated partnerships\nand joint ventures, with such adjustments calculated to reflect MFFO on the same basis. Certain of the above adjustments\nare also made to reconcile net income (loss) to net cash provided by (used in) operating activities, such as for the amortization\nof a premium and accretion of a discount on debt and securities investments, amortization of fees, any unrealized gains (losses)\non derivatives, securities or other investments, as well as other adjustments.\nMFFO\nexcludes non-recurring impairment of real estate-related investments. We assess the credit quality of our investments and adequacy\nof reserves on a quarterly basis, or more frequently as necessary. Significant judgment is required in this analysis. We consider\nthe estimated net recoverable value of a loan as well as other factors, including but not limited to the fair value of any collateral,\nthe amount and the status of any senior debt, the prospects for the borrower and the competitive situation of the region where\nthe borrower does business.\nWe\nbelieve that, because MFFO excludes costs that we consider more reflective of acquisition activities and other non-operating items,\nMFFO can provide, on a going-forward basis, an indication of the sustainability (that is, the capacity to continue to be maintained)\nof our operating performance after the period in which we are acquiring properties and once our portfolio is stabilized. We also\nbelieve that MFFO is a recognized measure of sustainable operating performance by the non-listed REIT industry and allows for\nan evaluation of our performance against other publicly registered, non-listed REITs.\nNot\nall REITs, including publicly registered, non-listed REITs, calculate FFO and MFFO the same way. Accordingly, comparisons with\nother REITs, including publicly registered, non-listed REITs, may not be meaningful. Furthermore, FFO and MFFO are not indicative\nof cash flow available to fund cash needs and should not be considered as an alternative to net income (loss) or income (loss)\nfrom continuing operations as determined under GAAP as an indication of our performance, as an alternative to cash flows from\noperations as an indication of our liquidity, or indicative of funds available to fund our cash needs including our ability to\nmake distributions to our stockholders. FFO and MFFO should be reviewed in conjunction with other GAAP measurements as an indication\nof our performance. FFO and MFFO should not be construed to be more relevant or accurate than the current GAAP methodology in\ncalculating net income or in its applicability in evaluating our operating performance. The methods utilized to evaluate the performance\nof a publicly registered, non-listed REIT under GAAP should be construed as more relevant measures of operational performance\nand considered more prominently than the non-GAAP measures, FFO and MFFO, and the adjustments to GAAP in calculating FFO and MFFO.\nNeither\nthe SEC, NAREIT, the IPA nor any other regulatory body or industry trade group has passed judgment on the acceptability of the\nadjustments that we use to calculate FFO or MFFO. In the future, NAREIT, the IPA or another industry trade group may publish updates to\nthe White Paper or the Practice Guidelines or the SEC or another regulatory body could standardize the allowable adjustments across\nthe publicly registered, non-listed REIT industry, and we would have to adjust our calculation and characterization of FFO or\nMFFO accordingly.\nThe\nbelow table illustrates the items deducted in the calculation of FFO and MFFO. Items are presented net of non-controlling interest\nportions where applicable.\n\nNotes:\n\n\n\n\n\nThe\ntable below presents our cumulative distributions paid and cumulative FFO:\n\nFor\nthe year ended December 31, 2021, we paid cash distributions of $15.3 million. Cash flow from operations was $10.0 million and\nFFO attributable to Company's common shares for the year ended December 31, 2021 was $31.1 million. For the year ended December\n31, 2020, we paid cash distributions of $15.4 million. Cash flow from operations was $10.1 million and FFO attributable to Company's\ncommon shares for the year ended December 31, 2020 was negative $0.4 million.\nNew\nAccounting Pronouncements\nSee\nNote 2 to the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information concerning accounting standards that we have\nnot yet been required to adopt and may be applicable to our future operations.", "item_7_tables": "Table 35: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>For\nthe\nYear Ended </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>December 31,\n2021 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>December 31,\n2020 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Asset\nmanagement fees (general and administrative costs) </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>849 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>919 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Property\nmanagement fees (property operating expenses) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>362 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>388 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Development\nfees and cost reimbursement(1) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3,595 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,337 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Total </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>4,806 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2,644 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>Table 36: <table><tr> <td> </td> <td>(1) </td> <td>Development\nfees and development costs that we reimburse our Advisor for are capitalized and are\nincluded in the carrying value of the associated development project and classified as\nconstruction in progress on the consolidated balance sheets.

business plan to generate operational income and\ncash flows in order to make distributions to investors. In evaluating investments in\nreal estate, management differentiates the costs to acquire the investment from the operations\nderived from the investment. Such information would be comparable only for non-listed\nREITs that have completed their acquisition activity and have other similar operating\ncharacteristics. By excluding expensed acquisition costs, management believes MFFO provides\nuseful supplemental information that is comparable for each type of real estate investment\nand is consistent with management's analysis of the investing and operating performance\nof our properties. Acquisition fees and expenses include payments to our advisor or third\nparties. Acquisition fees and expenses under GAAP are considered operating expenses and\nas expenses included in the determination of net income and income from continuing operations,\nboth of which are performance measures under GAAP. Such fees and expenses are paid in\ncash, and therefore such funds will not be available to distribute to investors. Such\nfees and expenses negatively impact our operating performance during the period in which\nproperties are being acquired. Therefore, MFFO may not be an accurate indicator of our\noperating performance, especially during periods in which properties are being acquired.\nAll paid and accrued acquisition fees and expenses will have negative effects on returns\nto investors, the potential for future distributions, and cash flows generated by us,\nunless earnings from operations or net sales proceeds from the disposition of properties\nare generated to cover the purchase price of the property, these fees and expenses and\nother costs related to the property. Acquisition fees and expenses will not be paid or\nreimbursed, as applicable, to our advisor even if there are no further proceeds from\nthe sale of shares in our offering, and therefore such fees and expenses would need to\nbe paid from either additional debt, operational earnings or cash flows, net proceeds\nfrom the sale of properties or from ancillary cash flows. </td> </tr>\n</table>Table 64: <table><tr> <td> </td> <td>(2) </td> <td>Under\nGAAP, certain intangibles are accounted for at cost and reviewed at least annually for\nimpairment, and certain intangibles are assumed to diminish predictably in value over\ntime and amortized, similar to depreciation and amortization of other real estate related\nassets that are excluded from FFO.

Construction financing has been obtained for the Moxy Hotel which is currently under construction.\n\n- Cash flows from operating activities were $10 million in 2021.
