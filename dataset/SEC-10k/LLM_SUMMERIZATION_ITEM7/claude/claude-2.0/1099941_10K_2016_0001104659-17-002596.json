Such statements are predictions only, and the actual events or results may differ materially from those discussed in the forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include, but are not limited to, those relating to adverse conditions in the U.S. and international economies, competition in the markets in which our portfolio companies operate, investment capital demand, pricing, market acceptance, any changes in the regulatory environments in which we operate, changes in our accounting assumptions that regulatory agencies, including the SEC, may require or that result from changes in the accounting rules or their application, competitive forces, adverse conditions in the credit markets impacting the cost, including interest rates and/or availability of financing, the results of financing and investing efforts, the ability to complete transactions, the inability to implement our business strategies and other risks identified below or in the Company's filings with the SEC. Readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date hereof. The Company undertakes no obligation to publicly revise these forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances occurring after the date hereof or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events. The following analysis of the financial condition and results of operations of the Company should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements, the notes thereto and the other financial information included elsewhere in this report.\nOVERVIEW\nThe Company is an externally managed, non-diversified, closed-end management investment company that has elected to be regulated as a business development company under the 1940 Act. The Company's investment objective is to seek to maximize total return from capital appreciation and/or income, though our current focus is more on yield generating investments.\nOn November 6, 2003, Mr. Tokarz assumed his positions as Chairman and Portfolio Manager of the Company. He and the Company's management team are seeking to implement our investment\nobjective (i.e., to maximize total return from capital appreciation and/or income) through making a broad range of private investments in a variety of industries.\nThe investments can include senior or subordinated loans, convertible debt and convertible preferred securities, common or preferred stock, equity interests, warrants or rights to acquire equity interests and other private equity transactions, among other investments. During the fiscal year ended October 31, 2015, the Company made eight new investments and made 5 follow-on investments in 4 existing portfolio companies committing a total of approximately $62.4 million to these investments. During the fiscal year ended October 31, 2016, the Company made six new and 9 follow-on investments in 6 existing portfolio companies totaling approximately $44.2 million.\nPrior to the adoption of our current investment objective, the Company's investment objective had been to achieve long-term capital appreciation from venture capital investments in information technology companies. The Company's investments had thus previously focused on investments in equity and debt securities of information technology companies. As of October 31, 2016, 1.4% of the current fair value of our assets consisted of Legacy Investments. We are, however, managing these Legacy Investments to try and realize maximum returns. We generally seek to capitalize on opportunities to realize cash returns on these investments when presented with a potential \u201cliquidity event,\u201d i.e., a sale, public offering, merger or other reorganization.\nOur new portfolio investments are made pursuant to our current objective and strategy. We are concentrating our investment efforts on small and middle-market companies that, in our view, provide opportunities to maximize total return from capital appreciation and/or income. More recently, the Company has been focusing its strategy more on yield generating investments. Under our investment approach, we have the authority to invest, without limit, in any one portfolio company, subject to any diversification limits required in order for us to continue to qualify as a RIC under Subchapter M of the Code. Presently, due to our asset growth and composition, compliance with the RIC requirements limits our ability to make Non-Diversified Investments.\nWe participate in the private equity business generally by providing privately negotiated long-term equity and/or debt investment capital to small and middle-market companies. Our financings are generally used to fund growth, buyouts, acquisitions, recapitalizations, note purchases and/or bridge financings. We generally invest in private companies, though, from time to time, we may invest in public companies that may lack adequate access to public capital.\nWe may also seek to achieve our investment objective by establishing a subsidiary or subsidiaries that would serve as general partner to a private equity or other investment fund(s). In fact, during fiscal year 2006, we established MVC Partners for this purpose. Furthermore, the Board of Directors authorized the establishment of a PE Fund, for which an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company serves as the GP and which may raise up to $250 million. On October 29, 2010, through MVC Partners and MVCFS, the Company committed to invest approximately $20.1 million in the PE Fund. The PE Fund closed on approximately $104 million of capital commitments. The Company's Board of Directors authorized the establishment of, and investment in, the PE Fund for a variety of reasons, including the Company's ability to make Non-Diversified Investments through the PE Fund. As previously disclosed, the Company is restricted in its ability to make Non-Diversified Investments. For services provided to the PE Fund, the GP and MVC Partners are together entitled to receive 25% of all management fees and other fees paid by the PE Fund and its portfolio companies and up to 30% of the carried interest generated by the PE Fund. Further, at the direction of the Board of Directors, the GP retained TTG Advisers to serve as the\nportfolio manager of the PE Fund. In exchange for providing those services, and pursuant to the Board of Directors' authorization and direction, TTG Advisers is entitled to receive the balance of the fees and any carried interest generated by the PE Fund and its portfolio companies. Given this separate arrangement with the GP and the PE Fund, under the terms of the Company's Advisory Agreement with TTG Advisers, TTG Advisers is not entitled to receive from the Company a management fee or an incentive fee on assets of the Company that are invested in the PE Fund. During the fiscal year ended October 31, 2012 and thereafter, MVC Partners was consolidated with the operations of the Company as MVC Partners' limited partnership interest in the PE Fund is a substantial portion of MVC Partners operations. Previously, MVC Partners was presented as a portfolio company on the Schedule of Investments. The consolidation of MVC Partners has not had any material effect on the financial position or net results of operations of the Company. Also, during fiscal year ended October 31, 2014, MVC Turf, LLC (\u201cMVC Turf\u201d) was consolidated with the Company as MVC Turf is an MVC wholly-owned holding company. The consolidation of MVC Turf has not had any material effect on the financial position or net results of operations of the Company. Please see Note 2 of our consolidated financial statements \u201cConsolidation\u201d for more information.\nAs a result of the closing of the PE Fund, consistent with the Board-approved policy concerning the allocation of investment opportunities, the PE Fund received a priority allocation of all private equity investments that would otherwise be Non-Diversified Investments for the Company during the PE Fund's investment period that ended on October 28, 2014. Additional capital may be called for follow-on investments in existing portfolio companies of the PE Fund or to pay operating expenses of the PE Fund. For a further discussion of this allocation policy, please see \u201cOur Investment Strategy - Allocation of Investment Opportunities\u201d above.\nAdditionally, in pursuit of our objective, we may acquire a portfolio of existing private equity or debt investments held by financial institutions or other investment funds should such opportunities arise.\nFurthermore, pending investments in portfolio companies pursuant to the Company's principal investment strategy, the Company may invest in certain securities on a short-term or temporary basis. In addition to cash-equivalents and other money market-type investments, such short-term investments may include exchange-traded funds and private investment funds offering periodic liquidity.\nOPERATING INCOME\nFor the Fiscal Years Ended October 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014. Total operating income was $37.4 million for the fiscal year ended October 31, 2016 and $23.7 million for the fiscal year ended October 31, 2015, an increase of $13.7 million. Fiscal year 2015 operating income increased by approximately $3.9 million compared to Fiscal year 2014 operating income of $19.8 million.\nFor the Fiscal Year Ended October 31, 2016\nTotal operating income was $37.4 million for the fiscal year ended October 31, 2016. The increase in operating income over the same period last year was primarily due to an increase in dividend income and fee income from the Company's portfolio companies. The Company earned approximately $32.7 million in interest and dividend income from investments in portfolio companies. Of the $32.7 million recorded in interest/dividend income, $12.5 million was dividend\nincome from U.S. Gas and approximately $4.8 million was \u201cpayment in kind\u201d/deferred interest. The \u201cpayment in kind\u201d/deferred interest is computed at the contractual rate specified in each investment agreement and may be added to the principal balance of each investment. The Company's debt investments yielded annualized rates from 5.0% to 16.0%. The Company also received fee income from asset management of the PE Fund and its portfolio companies totaling approximately $1.4 million and fee income from the Company's portfolio companies of approximately $3.3 million, of which $2.3 million was one-time fee income related to the Ohio Medical sale, totaling approximately $4.7 million in fee income. Of the $1.4 million of fee income from asset management activities, 75% of the income is obligated to be paid to TTG Advisers. However, under the PE Fund's agreements, a significant portion of the portfolio fees that are paid by the PE Fund's portfolio companies to the GP and TTG Advisers is subject to recoupment by the PE Fund in the form of an offset to future management fees paid by the PE Fund.\nFor the Fiscal Year Ended October 31, 2015\nTotal operating income was $23.7 million for the fiscal year ended October 31, 2015. The increase in operating income over the same period last year was primarily due to an increase in interest earned on loans partially offset by a decrease in fee income from asset management and other income. The main component of operating income for the fiscal year ended October 31, 2015 was interest earned on loans. The Company earned approximately $20.4 million in interest and dividend income from investments in portfolio companies. Of the $20.4 million recorded in interest/dividend income, approximately $5.2 million was \u201cpayment in kind\u201d/deferred interest. The \u201cpayment in kind\u201d/deferred interest is computed at the contractual rate specified in each investment agreement and may be added to the principal balance of each investment. The Company's debt investments yielded annualized rates from 9.75% to 16.0%. The Company also received fee income from asset management of the PE Fund and its portfolio companies totaling approximately $1.3 million and fee income from the Company's portfolio companies of approximately $2.0 million, totaling approximately $3.3 million. Of the $1.3 million of fee income from asset management activities, 75% of the income is obligated to be paid to TTG Advisers. However, under the PE Fund's agreements, a significant portion of the portfolio fees that are paid by the PE Fund's portfolio companies to the GP and TTG Advisers is subject to recoupment by the PE Fund in the form of an offset to future management fees paid by the PE Fund.\nFor the Fiscal Year Ended October 31, 2014\nTotal operating income was $19.8 million for the fiscal year ended October 31, 2014. The decrease in operating income over the same period last year was primarily due to a decrease in dividend income from portfolio companies, specifically U.S. Gas (which did not pay a dividend in fiscal 2014, as it did in 2013), which was partially offset by an increase in interest income from portfolio companies. The main components of operating income for the fiscal year ended October 31, 2014 were interest earned on loans and fee income from portfolio companies and asset management. The Company earned approximately $15.3 million in interest and dividend income from investments in portfolio companies. Of the $15.3 million recorded in interest/dividend income, approximately $4.2 million was \u201cpayment in kind\u201d interest/dividends. The \u201cpayment in kind\u201d interest/dividends are computed at the contractual rate specified in each investment agreement and added to the principal balance of each investment. The Company's debt investments yielded rates from 5% to 16%. The Company also received fee income from asset management of the PE Fund and its portfolio companies totaling approximately $1.9 million and fee income from the Company's portfolio companies of approximately $1.6 million, totaling approximately $3.5\nmillion. Of the $1.9 million of fee income from asset management activities, 75% of the income is obligated to be paid to TTG Advisers. However, under the PE Fund's agreements, a significant portion of the portfolio fees that are paid by the PE Fund's portfolio companies to the GP and TTG Advisers is subject to recoupment by the PE Fund in the form of an offset to future management fees paid by the PE Fund.\nOPERATING EXPENSES\nFor the Fiscal Years Ended October 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014. Net Operating expenses were $18.0 million for the fiscal year ended October 31, 2016 and $14.4 million for the fiscal year ended October 31, 2015, an increase of $3.6 million. Fiscal year 2015 operating expenses decreased by approximately $3.8 million compared to Fiscal year 2014 operating expenses of $18.2 million.\nFor the Fiscal Year Ended October 31, 2016\nOperating expenses, net of the Voluntary Waivers (as described below), were approximately $18.02 million or 6.35% of the Company's average net assets for the fiscal year ended October 31, 2016. Significant components of operating expenses for the fiscal year ended October 31, 2016 were interest and other borrowing costs of approximately $10.2 million and management fee expense paid by the Company of approximately $5.7 million, which is net of the voluntary management fee waiver of approximately $1.9 million.\nThe approximately $3.6 million increase in the Company's net operating expenses for the fiscal year ended October 31, 2016 compared to the same period in 2015, was primarily due to the approximately $6.7 million increase in the estimated provision for incentive compensation expense, including a $1.0 million incentive fee waiver for the fiscal year ended October 31, 2016, which was partially offset by an approximately $2.2 million decrease in management fee expense that included a voluntary management fee waiver of approximately $1.9 million. The approximately $1.0 million decrease in audit and tax preparation fees for the fiscal year ended October 31, 2016 compared to the same period in 2015 was due to the delay in filing both the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended October 31, 2015 and the Quarterly Report for the period ended January 31, 2016 and the timing of the work performed by the Company's auditors during the fiscal year ended October 31, 2016. The portfolio fees - asset management are payable to TTG Advisers for monitoring and other customary fees received by the GP from portfolio companies of the PE Fund. To the extent the GP or TTG Advisers receives advisory, monitoring, organization or other customary fees from any portfolio company of the PE Fund or management fees related to the PE Fund, 25% of such fees shall be paid to or retained by the GP and 75% of such fees shall be paid to or retained by TTG Advisers. On October 28, 2016, the Board approved the renewal of the Advisory Agreement for the 2017 fiscal year. Further, the Adviser agreed to continue to waive a portion of the base management fee so that it is reduced to 1.50% for fiscal year 2017. In March 2016, the Adviser agreed to modify its prior agreement to waive, effective November 1, 2015, the first $1.0 million of capital gains incentive fee due under the Advisory Agreement, such that the $1.0 million waiver of incentive fee would be applied to any incentive fee due under the agreement, whether it is a capital gains incentive fee or net operating income incentive fee. Furthermore, the Company and the Adviser, similar to fiscal year 2016, agreed on an expense cap for fiscal 2017 of 3.25% under the Modified Methodology. The amount of any payments made by the GP of the PE Fund to TTG Advisers pursuant to the Portfolio Management Agreement between the GP and TTG Advisers respecting the PE Fund continues to be excluded from the calculation of the Company's expense ratio under the Expense Limitation Agreement. In addition, for fiscal years 2010 through\n2016, TTG Advisers voluntarily agreed to waive $150,000 of expenses that the Company is obligated to reimburse to TTG Advisers under the Advisory Agreement (the \u201cVoluntary Waiver\u201d). TTG Advisers also voluntarily agreed that any assets of the Company that are invested in exchange-traded funds would not be taken into account in the calculation of the base management fee due to TTG Advisers under the Advisory Agreement. As of October 31, 2016, the Company did not have an investment in an exchange traded fund. Under the Modified Methodology, for the fiscal year ended October 31, 2016, the Company's expense ratio was 2.47%, (taking into account the same carve outs as those applicable to the expense cap).\nPursuant to the terms of the Advisory Agreement, during the fiscal year ended October 31, 2016, the provision for incentive compensation was decreased by a net amount of approximately $3.0 million to approximately $1.9 million, including both the net operating income incentive fee and the capital gains incentive fee. The net decrease in the provision for incentive compensation during the fiscal year ended October 31, 2016 primarily reflects the Valuation Committee's determination to decrease the fair values of sixteen of the Company's portfolio investments (Custom Alloy, MVC Automotive, Security Holdings, SGDA Europe, Tekers, Turf, JSC Tekers, RuMe, BAC, Biogenics, Morey's, Ohio Medical, Equus, Legal Solutions, MVC Environmental and Initials) by a total of approximately $32.0 million. The net decrease in the provision also reflects the Valuation Committee's determination to increase the fair values of ten of the Company's portfolio investments (NPWT, Centile, SCSD, Agri-Carriers, RX, U.S. Gas, Advantage, Thunderdome, U.S. Tech and Vestal) by a total of approximately $8.5 million. For the fiscal year ended October 31, 2016, no incentive compensation was paid. For the quarter ended April 30, 2016, a $2.1 million provision was recorded for the net operating income portion of the incentive fee as pre-incentive fee net operating income exceeded the hurdle rate. A $1.0 million incentive fee waiver was recorded during the quarter ended April 30, 2016 resulting in a net $1.1 million provision being recorded for the net operating income portion of the incentive fee. For the quarter ended October 31, 2016, no provision was recorded for the net operating income portion of the incentive fee as pre-incentive fee net operating income for the quarter did not exceed the hurdle rate. Please see Note 5 of our consolidated financial statements \u201cIncentive Compensation\u201d for more information.\nFor the Fiscal Year Ended October 31, 2015\nOperating expenses, net of the Voluntary Waivers (as described below), were approximately $14.4 million or 4.54% of the Company's average net assets for the fiscal year ended October 31, 2015. Significant components of operating expenses for the fiscal year ended October 31, 2015 were interest and other borrowing costs of approximately $10.2 million and management fee expense paid by the Company of approximately $7.8 million.\nThe approximately $3.8 million decrease in the Company's net operating expenses for the fiscal year ended October 31, 2015 compared to the same period in 2014, was primarily due to the approximately $5.0 million decrease in the estimated provision for incentive compensation expense and approximately $836,000 decrease in management fees, which was partially offset by an increase in interest and other borrowing costs of approximately $788,000 and an increase in audit and tax preparation fees, which was due to the fiscal year 2014 restatements and related expenses, totaling $836,000. The portfolio fees - asset management are payable to TTG Advisers for monitoring and other customary fees received by the GP from portfolio companies of the PE Fund. To the extent the GP or TTG Advisers receives advisory, monitoring, organization or other customary fees from any portfolio company of the PE Fund or management fees related to the PE\nFund, 25% of such fees shall be paid to or retained by the GP and 75% of such fees shall be paid to or retained by TTG Advisers. For the 2015 fiscal year, TTG Advisers voluntarily agreed to waive $150,000 of expenses that the Company is obligated to reimburse to TTG Advisers under the Advisory Agreement (the \u201cVoluntary Waiver\u201d). TTG Advisers voluntarily agreed that any assets of the Company that were invested in exchange-traded funds would not be taken into account in the calculation of the base management fee due to TTG Advisers under the Advisory Agreement. TTG Advisers has voluntarily agreed to waive any management fees on the Company's assets invested in Equus common stock. The Company and the Adviser have agreed to continue the expense cap of 3.5% (on consolidated expenses of the Company, including any amounts payable to TTG Advisers under the base management fee, but excluding the amount of any interest and other direct borrowing costs, taxes, incentive compensation, payments made by the GP of the PE Fund to TTG Advisers pursuant to the Portfolio Management Agreement between the GP and TTG Advisers respecting the PE Fund and extraordinary expenses taken as a percentage of the Company's average net assets) into fiscal year 2015, though they modified the methodology so that the cap is applied to limit the Company's ratio of expenses to total assets less cash (the \u201cModified Methodology\u201d), consistent with the asset level used to calculate the base management fee. (The expenses covered by the cap remain unchanged.) Under the Modified Methodology, for the fiscal year ended October 31, 2015, the Company's expense ratio was 3.21% (taking into account the same carve outs as those applicable to the expense cap).\nPursuant to the terms of the Advisory Agreement, during the fiscal year ended October 31, 2015, the provision for incentive compensation was decreased by a net amount of approximately $9.7 million to approximately $5.0 million. The net decrease in the provision for incentive compensation during the fiscal year ended October 31, 2015 primarily reflects the Valuation Committee's determination to decrease the fair values of sixteen of the Company's portfolio investments (Custom Alloy, NPWT, BAC, Tekers, PrePaid Legal, Centile, Biovation, Inland, MVC Automotive, Ohio Medical, SGDA Europe, Security Holdings, JSC Tekers, Morey's, Velocitius and Equus) by a total of approximately $58.2 million. The net decrease in the provision also reflects the Valuation Committee's determination to increase the fair values of five of the Company's portfolio investments (Turf, RuMe, Biogenic, Advantage Insurance and SCSD) by a total of approximately $4.3 million. The Valuation Committee also increased the fair value of the Ohio Medical series C convertible preferred stock by approximately $4.7 million due to a PIK distribution, which was treated as a return of capital. For the fiscal year ended October 31, 2015, no incentive compensation fee was paid. Also, for the fiscal year ended October 31, 2015, no provision was recorded for the net operating income portion of the incentive fee as pre-incentive fee net operating income did not exceed the hurdle rate. Please see Note 5 of our consolidated financial statements \u201cIncentive Compensation\u201d for more information.\nFor the Fiscal Year Ended October 31, 2014\nOperating expenses, net of the Voluntary Waivers (as described below), were approximately $18.2 million or 5.04% of the Company's average net assets, for the fiscal year ended October 31, 2014. Significant components of operating expenses for the fiscal year ended October 31, 2014 were management fee expense paid by the Company of approximately $8.7 million and interest and other borrowing costs of approximately $9.4 million.\nThe approximately $5.1 million decrease in the Company's net operating expenses for the fiscal year ended October 31, 2014 compared to the fiscal year ended October 31, 2013, was primarily due to the approximately $8.6 million decrease in the estimated provision for incentive\ncompensation expense, which was partially offset by an increase in interest and other borrowing costs of approximately $2.7 million and an increase in the Company's management fee expense of approximately $849,000. The portfolio fees - asset management are payable to TTG Advisers for monitoring and other customary fees received by the GP from portfolio companies of the PE Fund. To the extent the GP or TTG Advisers receives advisory, monitoring, organization or other customary fees from any portfolio company of the PE Fund or management fees related to the PE Fund, 25% of such fees shall be paid to or retained by the GP and 75% of such fees shall be paid to or retained by TTG Advisers. For the 2011 through 2015 fiscal years, TTG Advisers voluntarily agreed to waive $150,000 of expenses that the Company is obligated to reimburse to TTG Advisers under the Advisory Agreement (the \u201cVoluntary Waiver\u201d). TTG Advisers voluntarily agreed that any assets of the Company that were invested in exchange-traded funds would not be taken into account in the calculation of the base management fee due to TTG Advisers under the Advisory Agreement. TTG Advisers has voluntarily agreed to waive any management fees on the Company's assets invested in Equus common stock. The Company and the Adviser agreed to continue the expense cap of 3.5% (on consolidated expenses of the Company, including any amounts payable to TTG Advisers under the base management fee, but excluding the amount of any interest and other direct borrowing costs, taxes, incentive compensation, payments made by the GP of the PE Fund to TTG Advisers pursuant to the Portfolio Management Agreement between the GP and TTG Advisers respecting the PE Fund and extraordinary expenses taken as a percentage of the Company's average net assets) into fiscal year 2015, though they reserved the ability to revise the calculation methodology later that year. For the fiscal year ended October 31, 2014, no incentive compensation fee was paid. Also, for fiscal year 2013 and fiscal year 2014, the Company's expense ratio was 3.03% and 3.37%, respectively, (taking into account the same carve outs as those applicable to the expense cap).\nPursuant to the terms of the Advisory Agreement, during the fiscal year ended October 31, 2014, the provision for incentive compensation was decreased by a net amount of approximately $4.7 million to approximately $14.7 million. The net decrease in the provision for incentive compensation during the fiscal year ended October 31, 2014 primarily reflects the Valuation Committee's determination to decrease the fair values of eleven of the Company's portfolio investments (MVC Automotive, G3K, Ohio Medical, NPWT, U.S. Gas, Velocitius, Octagon, Tekers, JSC Tekers, SGDA Europe and Biovation) by a total of approximately $40.7 million. The net decrease in the provision also reflects the Valuation Committee's determination to increase the fair values of twelve of the Company's portfolio investments (Custom Alloy, Advantage, Biogenic, PrePaid Legal, RuMe, Freshii USA, Inc. (\u201cFreshii\u201d), Centile, Security Holdings, Summit, Morey's, Turf and Vestal) by a total of approximately $11.5 million. The Valuation Committee also increased the fair value of the Ohio Medical series C convertible preferred stock by approximately $4.0 million due to a PIK distribution, which was treated as a return of capital. For the fiscal year ended October 31, 2014, no provision was recorded for the net operating income portion of the incentive fee as pre-incentive fee net operating income did not exceed the hurdle rate. Please see Note 5 of our consolidated financial statements \u201cIncentive Compensation\u201d for more information.\nREALIZED GAINS AND LOSSES ON PORTFOLIO SECURITIES\nFor the Fiscal Years Ended October 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014. Net realized losses for the fiscal year ended October 31, 2016 were approximately $45.2 million and net realized gains for the fiscal year ended October 31, 2015 were $3.7 million, a decrease of approximately $48.9 million. Net realized gains for the fiscal year ended October 31, 2014 were $16.5 million.\nFor the Year Ended October 31, 2016\nNet realized losses for the fiscal year ended October 31, 2016 were approximately $45.2 million. The Company's net realized loss for the fiscal year ended October 31, 2016 was primarily due to realized losses of approximately $30.5 million on the sale of Ohio Medical common and preferred stock, approximately $6.2 million on the Inland senior secured loan and warrant and approximately $5.6 million on the G3K loan and warrant.\nOn December 22, 2015, the Company realized a loss of approximately $1.5 million as a result of the dissolution of Biovation.\nOn December 24, 2015, the Company realized losses of approximately $5.5 million on Inland's senior secured loan and $713,000 on its warrants as part of Inland's restructuring. As part of the restructuring, the Company received a $6.0 million senior secured loan from MVC Environmental, Inc. and received 950 of its common shares. The loan bears annual interest of 9% and matures on December 22, 2020.\nOn December 31, 2015, the Company completed the sale of Ohio Medical through an asset sale. The Company expects gross proceeds of approximately $40.0 million, including fees. At the time of closing, the Company received cash proceeds of approximately $29.0 million and anticipates receiving an additional $11.0 million, assuming the full receipt of all escrow proceeds scheduled for various periods, with the final release of payment scheduled for 18 months from the closing.\nOn May 31, 2016, the Company realized a loss of approximately $1.2 million with the dissolution of NPWT.\nOn October 31, 2016, the Company realized a loss of approximately $5.6 million on its investment in G3K.\nDuring the fiscal year ended October 31, 2016, the Company also recorded net realized gains of approximately $126,000 with the sale of its short-term investments and net realized losses of approximately $360,000 on its escrow receivables.\nFor the Year Ended October 31, 2015\nNet realized gains for the fiscal year ended October 31, 2015 were approximately $3.7 million.

On October 7, 2016, the Company loaned RuMe $900,000 in the form of a subordinated note with an interest rate of 10% and a maturity date of October 7, 2017. The Company also guaranteed $1.0 million of a third party's working capital line of credit and received a warrant at no cost and allocated a portion of the cost basis of the loan to the warrant at the time the investment was made.\nCurrent balance sheet resources, which include the additional cash resources from the Credit Facility, are believed to be sufficient to finance current commitments. Current commitments include:\nCommitments to/for Portfolio Companies\nAt October 31, 2016 and October 31, 2015, the Company's existing commitments to portfolio companies consisted of the following:\nTable 12: <table> <tr> <td> Portfolio Company\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Amount Committed\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Amount Funded at October 31, 2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> MVC Private Equity Fund LP\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $20.1 million\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $14.6 million\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $20.1 million\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $14.6 million\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 13: <table> <tr> <td> Portfolio Company\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Amount Committed\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Amount Funded at October 31, 2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> MVC Private Equity Fund LP\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $20.1 million\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $14.6 million\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $20.1 million\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $14.6 million\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nGuarantees\nAs of October 31, 2016 and October 31, 2015, the Company had the following commitments to guarantee various loans and mortgages:\nTable 14: <table> <tr> <td> Guarantee\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Amount Committed\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Amount Funded at October 31, 2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> MVC Automotive\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $6.3 million\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> RuMe\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $1.0 million\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Turf\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $1.0 million\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $8.3 million\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 15: <table> <tr> <td> Guarantee\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Amount Committed\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Amount Funded at October 31, 2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> MVC Automotive\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $7.2 million\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Tekers\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Turf\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $1.0 million\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $8.2 million\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nASC 460, Guarantees, requires the Company to estimate the fair value of the guarantee obligation at its inception and requires the Company to assess whether a probable loss contingency exists in accordance with the requirements of ASC 450, Contingencies. At October 31, 2016, the Valuation Committee estimated the combined fair values of the guarantee obligations noted above to be approximately -$291,000 or a liability of $291,000.\nThese guarantees are further described below, together with the Company's other commitments.\nOn January 16, 2008, the Company agreed to support a 4.0 million Euro mortgage for a Ford dealership owned and operated by MVC Automotive through making financing available to the dealership and agreeing under certain circumstances not to reduce its equity stake in MVC Automotive. Over time, Erste Bank, the bank extending the mortgage to MVC Automotive, increased the amount of the mortgage. As such, the balance of the guarantee as of October 31, 2016 is approximately 5.7 million Euro (equivalent to approximately $6.3 million).\nThe Company guaranteed $1.0 million of Turf's indebtedness to Berkshire Bank, which had a fair value of approximately -$13,000 or a liability of $13,000 as of October 31, 2016.\nThe Company guaranteed $1.0 million of RuMe's indebtedness to Colorado Business Bank, which had a fair value of approximately -$278,000 or negative $278,000 as of October 31, 2016.\nOn March 31, 2010, the Company pledged its Series I and Series J preferred stock of U.S. Gas to Macquarie Energy, LLC (\u201cMacquarie Energy\u201d) as collateral for Macquarie Energy's trade supply credit facility to U.S. Gas.\nOn October 29, 2010, through MVC Partners and MVCFS, the Company committed to invest approximately $20.1 million in the PE Fund, for which an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company serves as GP. The PE Fund closed on approximately $104 million of capital commitments. During the fiscal year ended October 31, 2012 and thereafter, MVC Partners was consolidated with the operations of the Company as MVC Partners' limited partnership interest in the PE Fund is a substantial portion of MVC Partners operations. The investment period related to the PE Fund has ended. Additional capital may be called for follow-on investments in existing portfolio companies of the PE Fund or to pay operating expenses of the PE Fund. As of October 31, 2016, $14.6 million of the Company's commitment has been contributed.\nOn April 26, 2011, the Company agreed to collateralize a 5.0 million Euro letter of credit from JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., which is related to a project guarantee by AB DnB NORD bankas to Security Holdings, a portfolio company investment, and was classified as restricted cash equivalents on the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheets. The Euro letter of credit was equivalent to approximately $5.5 million at October 31, 2015. During the fiscal year ended October 31, 2016, the Euro letter of credit was released and is no longer collateralized by the Company and released from restricted cash equivalents.\nDuring the fiscal year ended October 31, 2016, the Company agreed to cash collateralize a $500,000 working capital line of credit for an entity partially owned by MVC Environmental provided by Branch Banking and Trust Company (\u201cBB&T\u201d).\nDuring the fiscal year ended October 31, 2016, the Company agreed to cash collateralize a $300,000 third party working capital line of credit for RuMe.\nCommitments of the Company\nOn February 19, 2013, the Company sold $70.0 million of senior unsecured notes (the \u201cSenior Notes\u201d) in a public offering. The Senior Notes will mature on January 15, 2023 and may be redeemed in whole or in part at any time or from time to time at the Company's option on or after April 15, 2016. The Senior Notes bear interest at a rate of 7.25% per year payable quarterly on January 15, April 15, July 15, and October 15 of each year, beginning April 15, 2013. The Company had also granted the underwriters a 30-day option to purchase up to an additional $10.5 million of Senior Notes to cover overallotments. The additional $10.5 million in principal was purchased and the total principal amount of the Senior Notes totaled $80.5 million. The net proceeds to the Company from the sale of the Senior Notes, after offering expenses, were approximately $77.4 million. The offering expenses incurred are amortized over the term of the Senior Notes.\nOn February 26, 2013, the Company received the funds related to the Senior Notes offering, net of expenses, and subsequently repaid the credit facility (the \u201cCredit Facility\u201d) with Guggenheim as administrative agent for the lenders in full, including all accrued interest. The Company used the excess net proceeds after the repayment of the Credit Facility for general corporate purposes, including, for example, investing in portfolio companies according to our investment objective and strategy, repurchasing shares pursuant to the share repurchase program adopted by our Board of Directors, funding distributions, and/or funding the activities of our subsidiaries.\nOn May 3, 2013, the Company sold approximately $33.9 million of additional Senior Notes in a direct offering. The additional Senior Notes will also mature on January 15, 2023 and may be redeemed in whole or in part at any time or from time to time at the Company's option on or after April 15, 2016. The Notes bear interest at a rate of 7.25% per year payable quarterly on January 15, April 15, July 15, and October 15 of each year. As of October 31, 2016, the total outstanding amount of the Senior Notes was approximately $114.4 million with a market value of approximately $116.6 million. The market value of the Senior Notes is based on the closing price of the security as of October 31, 2016 on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE:MVCB).\nOn July 31, 2013, the Company entered into a one-year, $50 million revolving credit facility (\u201cCredit Facility II\u201d) with BB&T. On January 31, 2014, Credit Facility II was increased to a $100 million revolving credit facility. At October 31, 2015, the balance of Credit Facility II was $90.0 million. On December 1, 2015, Credit Facility II was renewed and expired on May 31, 2016, at which time all outstanding amounts under it were due and repaid. On June 30, 2016, Credit Facility II was renewed and reduced to a $50 million revolving credit facility, which expires on February 28, 2017. During the fiscal year ended October 31, 2016, the Company's net borrowings on Credit Facility II were $35.0 million, resulting in an outstanding balance of $35.0 million at October 31, 2016. See \u201cSubsequent Events\u201d for more information. Credit Facility II is used to provide the Company with better overall financial flexibility in managing its investment portfolio. Borrowings under Credit Facility II bear interest at LIBOR plus 125 basis points. In addition, the Company is also subject to a 25 basis point commitment fee for the average amount of Credit Facility II that is unused during each fiscal quarter. The Company paid closing fees, legal and other costs associated with these transactions. These costs will be amortized over the life of the facility. Borrowings under Credit Facility II will be secured by cash, short-term and long-term U.S. Treasury securities and other governmental agency securities. The Company received waivers from BB&T with respect to the delivery of financial reports required under Credit Facility II, due to the Company's delayed filing of certain prior annual and quarterly reports.\nOn December 30, 2014, the Company entered into a 6 month, $25.0 million bridge loan (\u201cBridge Loan\u201d) with Firstrust Bank. Prior to maturity, the Bridge Loan was extended to December 31, 2015. At October 31, 2015, the balance of the Bridge Loan was $8.0 million. During the fiscal year ended October 31, 2016, the Bridge Loan was repaid in full. On December 9, 2015, the Bridge Loan was replaced with Credit Facility III (as described below). Borrowings under the Bridge Loan bore interest at 5%. The Company paid closing fees, legal and other costs associated with the transaction. These costs were amortized over the life of the Bridge Loan. The Company received extensions from Firstrust Bank as to the delivery of financial reports required under the Amended and Restated Loan Agreement, due to the Company's delayed quarterly filings.\nOn December 9, 2015, the Company entered into a three-year, $50 million revolving borrowing base credit facility (\u201cCredit Facility III\u201d) with Santander Bank N.A. as a lender and lead agent and Wintrust Bank as a lender and syndication agent. As of October 31, 2016, there was no\noutstanding balance on Credit Facility III. Credit Facility III can, under certain conditions, be increased up to $85 million. The new facility bears an interest rate of LIBOR plus 3.75% or the prime rate plus 1% (at the Company's option), and includes a 1% closing fee of the commitment amount and a 0.75% unused fee. The compensating balance for the revolving credit facility is $10.0 million. The Company received extensions from Santander Bank N.A. related to its delayed quarterly filings, including the quarterly filing for the period ended April 30, 2016.\nThe Company enters into contracts with portfolio companies and other parties that contain a variety of indemnifications. The Company's maximum exposure under these arrangements is unknown. However, the Company has not experienced claims or losses pursuant to these contracts and believes the risk of loss related to indemnifications to be remote.\nSUBSEQUENT EVENTS\nOn November 9, 2016, the Company invested $59,000 in MVC Environmental and received an additional 30 shares of common stock.\nOn November 21, 2016, the Company repaid Credit Facility II in full, including all accrued interest.\nOn December 1, 2016, the Company loaned an additional $500,000 to U.S. Technologies increasing the total amount outstanding to $5.5 million.\nOn December 13, 2016, the Company loaned an additional $475,000 to MVC Automotive increasing the amount outstanding on the bridge loan to approximately $3.8 million. The maturity date was also extended to December 31, 2017.\nOn December 23, 2016, the Company received proceeds of approximately $12.2 million from the PE Fund related to the sale of AccuMed Corp., a portfolio company of the PE Fund. The Company's pro-rata share of the PE Fund's investment in AccuMed Corp. totaled approximately $2.4 million. Assuming full receipt of escrow proceeds, the Company expects to receive an additional $1.2 million for a total of $13.4 million.\nSIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES\nThe following is a summary of significant accounting policies followed by the Company in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements:\nThe preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Actual results could differ from those estimates.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nIn May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (\u201cFASB\u201d) issued Accounting Standards Update (\u201cASU\u201d) No. 2014-09, \u201cRevenue from Contracts with Customers\u201d (Topic 606). ASU 2014-09 addresses the reporting of revenue by most entities and will replace most existing revenue recognition guidance in U.S. GAAP when it becomes effective. In August 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-14 that defers the effective date of ASU 2014-09 for public business entities for\nannual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods therein. Early application is not permitted for public business entities. The Company is currently assessing the impact of this guidance.\nIn August 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-15, \u201cPresentation of Financial Statements - Going Concern (Subtopic 205-40): Disclosure of Uncertainties about an Entity's Ability to Continue as a Going Concern\u201d (\u201cASU 2014-15\u201d). The standard requires management to evaluate, at each interim and annual reporting period, whether there are conditions or events that raise substantial doubt about the entity's ability to continue as a going concern within one year after the date the financial statements are issued, and provide related disclosures. ASU 2014-15 is effective for annual periods ending after December 15, 2016, and for annual and interim periods thereafter, and early adoption is permitted. The Company is currently assessing the impact of this guidance.\nIn February 2015, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update 2015-02, which updated consolidation standards under ASC Topic 810, \u201cConsolidation\u201d. Under this update, a new consolidation analysis is required for variable interest entities (\u201cVIEs\u201d) and will limit the circumstances in which investment managers and similar entities are required to consolidate the entities that they manage. The FASB decided to eliminate some of the criteria under which their fees are considered a variable interest and limit the circumstances in which variable interests in a VIE held by related parties of a reporting enterprise require the reporting enterprise to consolidate the VIE. The guidance is effective for public business entities for annual and interim periods in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2015. This update has had no impact on the Company's financial condition or results of operations.\nIn April 2015, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update 2015-03, Interest-Imputation of Interest (Subtopic 835-30): Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs. Under this guidance, debt issuance costs related to a recognized debt liability are to be presented as a direct deduction from the debt liability rather than as an asset on the balance sheet, consistent with debt discounts. The guidance is effective for public business entities for annual and interim periods in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2015. The Company is currently assessing the impact of this guidance.\nIn May 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-07, Fair Value Measurement (Topic 820): Disclosures for Investments in Certain Entities that Calculate Net Asset Value per Share (or Its Equivalent). The new guidance removes the requirement that investments for which NAV is determined based on practical expedient reliance be reported utilizing the fair value hierarchy. The guidance is effective for public business entities for annual and interim periods in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2015. The Company is currently assessing the impact of this guidance.\nIn November 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-17, which requires deferred tax liabilities and assets to be classified as non-current in a classified statement of financial condition. The amendments are effective for all entities for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2016. Early adoption is permitted. The Company is currently assessing the impact of this guidance.\nIn August 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-15, Statement of Cash Flows - Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments (Topic 230). The amendments provide guidance on eight specific cash flow issues in how certain cash receipts and cash payments are presented and\nclassified in the statement of cash flows with the objective of reducing the existing diversity in practice. The amendments are effective for all entities for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2017. Early adoption is permitted. The Company is currently assessing the impact of this guidance.\nIn October 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-17, to amend the consolidation guidance on how a reporting entity that is the single decision maker of a VIE should treat indirect interests in the entity held through related parties that are under common control with the reporting entity when determining whether it is the primary beneficiary of that VIE. The ASU is effective for public business entities for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim periods within those fiscal years. The Company is currently assessing the impact of this guidance.\nIn November 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-18, Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Restricted Cash. The amendments in this Update require that a statement of cash flows explain the change during the period in the total of cash, cash equivalents, and amounts generally described as restricted cash or restricted cash equivalents. The ASU is effective for public business entities for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within those fiscal years. The Company is currently assessing the impact of this guidance.\nTax Status and Capital Loss Carryforwards\nAs a RIC, the Company is not subject to federal income tax to the extent that it distributes all of its investment company taxable income and net realized capital gains for its taxable year (see Notes 12 \u201cTax Matters\u201d and Note 13 \u201cIncome Taxes\u201d of our notes to the consolidated financial statements). This allows us to attract different kinds of investors than other publicly held corporations. The Company is also exempt from excise tax if it distributes at least (1) 98% of its ordinary income during each calendar year, (2) 98.2% of its capital gains realized in the period from November 1 of the prior year through October 31 of the current year, and (3) all such ordinary income and capital gains for previous years that were not distributed during those years. On October 31, 2016, the Company had a net capital loss carryforward of approximately $50.2 million. The Company also had approximately $18.0 million in unrealized losses associated with Legacy Investments as of October 31, 2016.\nValuation of Portfolio Securities\nPursuant to the requirements of the 1940 Act and in accordance with the Accounting Standards Codification (\u201cASC\u201d), Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures (\u201cASC 820\u201d), we value our portfolio securities at their current market values or, if market quotations are not readily available, at their estimates of fair values. Because our portfolio company investments generally do not have readily ascertainable market values, we record these investments at fair value in accordance with our Valuation Procedures adopted by the Board of Directors, which are consistent with ASC 820. As permitted by the SEC, the Board of Directors has delegated the responsibility of making fair value determinations to its Valuation Committee, subject to the Board of Directors' supervision and pursuant to our Valuation Procedures. Our Board of Directors may also hire independent consultants to review our Valuation Procedures or to conduct an independent valuation of one or more of our portfolio investments. In this regard, the Company has engaged an independent valuation firm to perform valuation services for certain portfolio debt investments.\nPursuant to our Valuation Procedures, the Valuation Committee (which is comprised of three Independent Directors) determines fair values of portfolio company investments on a quarterly basis (or more frequently, if deemed appropriate under the circumstances). In doing so, the Committee considers the recommendations of TTG Advisers and input and reviews by third party consultants retained to support the Company's valuation process. The Company has also adopted other enhanced processes related to valuations of controlled/affiliated portfolio companies. Any changes in valuation are recorded in the consolidated statements of operations as \u201cNet unrealized appreciation (depreciation) on investments.\u201d\nCurrently, our NAV per share is calculated and published on a quarterly basis. The Company calculates our NAV per share by subtracting all liabilities from the total value of our portfolio securities and other assets and dividing the result by the total number of outstanding shares of our common stock on the date of valuation. Fair values of foreign investments reflect exchange rates, as applicable, in effect on the last business day of the quarter end. Exchange rates fluctuate on a daily basis, sometimes significantly. Exchange rate fluctuations following the most recent fiscal year end are not reflected in the valuations reported in this Annual Report. See Item 1A Risk Factor, \u201cInvestments in foreign debt or equity may involve significant risks in addition to the risks inherent in U.S. investments.\u201d\nAt October 31, 2016, approximately 80.97% of total assets represented investments in portfolio companies recorded at fair value (\u201cFair Value Investments\u201d).\nUnder most circumstances, at the time of acquisition, Fair Value Investments are carried at cost (absent the existence of conditions warranting, in management's and the Valuation Committee's view, a different initial value). During the period that an investment is held by the Company, its original cost may cease to approximate fair value as the result of market and investment specific factors. No pre-determined formula can be applied to determine fair value. Rather, the Valuation Committee analyzes fair value measurements based on the value at which the securities of the portfolio company could be sold in an orderly disposition over a reasonable period of time between willing parties, other than in a forced or liquidation sale. The liquidity event whereby the Company ultimately exits an investment is generally the sale, the merger, or the recapitalization of a portfolio company or by a public offering of its securities.\nValuation Methodology\nThere is no one methodology to determine fair value and, in fact, for any portfolio security, fair value may be expressed as a range of values, from which the Company derives a single estimate of fair value. To determine the fair value of a portfolio security, the Valuation Committee analyzes the portfolio company's financial results and projections, publicly traded comparable companies when available, comparable private transactions when available, precedent transactions in the market when available, third-party real estate and asset appraisals if appropriate and available, discounted cash flow analysis, if appropriate, as well as other factors. The Company generally requires, where practicable, Portfolio Companies to provide annual audited and more regular unaudited financial statements, and/or annual projections for the upcoming fiscal year.\nThe fair value of our portfolio securities is inherently subjective. Because of the inherent uncertainty of fair valuation of portfolio securities and escrow receivables that do not have readily ascertainable market values, our estimate of fair value may significantly differ from the value that would have been used had a ready market existed for the securities. Such values also do not reflect\nbrokers' fees or other selling costs, which might become payable on disposition of such investments.\nASC 820 provides a framework for measuring the fair value of assets and liabilities and provides guidance regarding a fair value hierarchy, which prioritizes information used to measure value. In determining fair value, the Valuation Committee primarily uses the level 3 inputs referenced in ASC 820.\nASC 820 defines fair value in terms of the price that would be received upon the sale of an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. The price used to measure the fair value is not adjusted for transaction costs while the cost basis of our investments may include initial transaction costs. Under ASC 820, the fair value measurement also assumes that the transaction to sell an asset occurs in the principal market for the asset or, in the absence of a principal market, the most advantageous market for the asset. The principal market is the market in which the reporting entity would sell or transfer the asset with the greatest volume and level of activity for the asset to which the reporting entity has access to as of the measurement date. If no market for the asset exists or if the reporting entity does not have access to the principal market, the reporting entity should use a hypothetical market.\nOur investments are carried at fair value in accordance with ASC 820. Unrestricted minority-owned publicly traded securities for which market quotations are readily available are valued at the closing market quote on the valuation date and majority-owned publicly traded securities and other privately held securities are valued as determined in good faith by the Valuation Committee of the Board of Directors. For legally or contractually restricted securities of companies that are publicly traded, the value is based on the closing market quote on the valuation date minus a discount for the restriction. At October 31, 2016, we did not own restricted or unrestricted securities of any publicly traded company in which we have a majority-owned interest, but did own one security in which we have a minority-owned interest.\nIf a security is publicly traded, the fair value is generally equal to the market value based on the closing price on the principal exchange on which the security is primarily traded, unless the security is restricted and in such a case, a discount is applied for the restriction.\nFor equity securities of Portfolio Companies, the Valuation Committee estimates the fair value based on market and/or income approach with value then attributed to equity or equity like securities using the enterprise value waterfall (\u201cEnterprise Value Waterfall\u201d) valuation methodology. Under the Enterprise Value Waterfall valuation methodology, the Valuation Committee estimates the enterprise fair value of the portfolio company and then waterfalls the enterprise value over the portfolio company's securities in order of their preference relative to one another. To assess the enterprise value of the portfolio company, the Valuation Committee weighs some or all of the traditional market valuation methods and factors based on the individual circumstances of the portfolio company in order to estimate the enterprise value. The methodologies for performing assets may be based on, among other things: valuations of comparable public companies, recent sales of private and public comparable companies, discounting the forecasted cash flows of the portfolio company, third party valuations of the portfolio company, considering offers from third parties to buy the company, estimating the value to potential strategic buyers and considering the value of recent investments in the equity securities of the portfolio company, and third-party asset and real estate appraisals. For non-performing assets, the Valuation Committee may estimate the liquidation or collateral value of the portfolio\ncompany's assets. The Valuation Committee also takes into account historical and anticipated financial results.\nThe Company does not utilize hedge accounting and instead, when applicable, marks its derivatives to market on the Company's consolidated statement of operations.\nIn assessing enterprise value, the Valuation Committee considers the mergers and acquisitions (\u201cM&A\u201d) market as the principal market in which the Company would sell its investments in portfolio companies under circumstances where the Company has the ability to control or gain control of the board of directors of the portfolio company (\u201cControl Companies\u201d). This approach is consistent with the principal market that the Company would use for its portfolio companies if the Company has the ability to initiate a sale of the portfolio company as of the measurement date, i.e., if it has the ability to control or gain control of the board of directors of the portfolio company as of the measurement date. In evaluating if the Company can control or gain control of a portfolio company as of the measurement date, the Company takes into account its equity securities on a fully diluted basis, as well as other factors.\nFor non-Control Companies, consistent with ASC 820, the Valuation Committee considers a hypothetical secondary market as the principal market in which it would sell investments in those companies. The Company also considers other valuation methodologies such as the Option Pricing Method and liquidity preferences when valuing minority equity positions of a portfolio company.\nFor loans and debt securities of non-Control Companies (for which the Valuation Committee has identified the hypothetical secondary market as the principal market), the Valuation Committee determines fair value based on the assumptions that a hypothetical market participant would use to value the security in a current hypothetical sale using a market yield (\u201cMarket Yield\u201d) valuation methodology. In applying the Market Yield valuation methodology, the Valuation Committee determines the fair value based on such factors as third party broker quotes (if available) and market participant assumptions, including synthetic credit ratings, estimated remaining life, current market yield and interest rate spreads of similar securities as of the measurement date.\nEstimates of average life are generally based on market data of the average life of similar debt securities. However, if the Valuation Committee has information available to it that the debt security is expected to be repaid in the near term, the Valuation Committee would use an estimated life based on the expected repayment date.\nThe Valuation Committee determines fair value of loan and debt securities of Control Companies based on the estimate of the enterprise value of the portfolio company. To the extent the enterprise value exceeds the remaining principal amount of the loan and all other debt securities of the company, the fair value of such securities is generally estimated to be their cost. However, where the enterprise value is less than the remaining principal amount of the loan and all other debt securities, the Valuation Committee may discount the value of such securities to reflect an impairment.\nFor the Company's or its subsidiary's investment in the PE Fund, for which an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company serves as the general partner (the \u201cGP\u201d) of the PE Fund, the Valuation Committee relies on the GP's determination of the fair value of the PE Fund which will be generally valued, as a practical expedient, utilizing the net asset valuations provided by the GP, which will be made: (i) no less frequently than quarterly as of the Company's fiscal quarter end and (ii) with respect to the valuation of PE Fund investments in portfolio companies, will be based on\nmethodologies consistent with those set forth in the Company's valuation procedures. In making its determinations, the GP considers and generally relies on TTG Advisers' recommendations. The determination of the net asset value of the Company's or its subsidiary's investment in the PE Fund will follow the methodologies described for valuing interests in private investment funds (\u201cInvestment Vehicles\u201d) described below. Additionally, when both the Company and the PE Fund hold investments in the same portfolio company, the GP's Fair Value determination shall be based on the Valuation Committee's determination of the Fair Value of the Company's portfolio security in that portfolio company.\nAs permitted under GAAP, the Company's interests in private investment funds are generally valued, as a practical expedient, utilizing the net asset valuations provided by management of the underlying Investment Vehicles, without adjustment, unless TTG Advisers is aware of information indicating that a value reported does not accurately reflect the value of the Investment Vehicle, including any information showing that the valuation has not been calculated in a manner consistent with GAAP. Net unrealized appreciation (depreciation) of such investments is recorded based on the Company's proportionate share of the aggregate amount of appreciation (depreciation) recorded by each underlying Investment Vehicle. The Company's proportionate investment interest includes its share of interest and dividend income and expense, and realized and unrealized gains and losses on securities held by the underlying Investment Vehicles, net of operating expenses and fees. Realized gains and losses on distributions from Investment Vehicles are generally recognized on a first in, first out basis.\nThe Company applies the practical expedient to interests in Investment Vehicles on an investment by investment basis, and consistently with respect to the Company's entire interest in an investment. The Company may adjust the valuation obtained from an Investment Vehicle with a premium, discount or reserve if it determines that the net asset value is not representative of fair value.\nIf the Company intends to sell all or a portion of its interest in an Investment Vehicle to a third-party in a privately negotiated transaction near the valuation date, the Company will consider offers from third parties to buy the interest in an Investment Vehicle in valuations, which may be discounted for both probability of close and time.\nWhen the Company receives nominal cost warrants or free equity securities (\u201cnominal cost equity\u201d) with a debt security, the Company typically allocates its cost basis in the investment between debt securities and nominal cost equity at the time of origination. If the Company is not reimbursed for investment or transaction related costs at the time an investment is made, the Company typically capitalizes those costs to the cost basis of the investment.\nInterest income, adjusted for amortization of premium and accretion of discount on a yield to maturity methodology, is recorded on an accrual basis to the extent that such amounts are expected to be collected. Origination and/or closing fees associated with investments in portfolio companies are accreted into income over the respective terms of the applicable loans. Upon the prepayment of a loan or debt security, any unamortized original issue discount or market discount is recorded as interest income. Prepayment premiums are recorded on loans when received as interest income. Dividend income, if any, is recognized on an accrual basis on the ex-dividend date to the extent that the Company expects to collect such amounts.\nFor loans, debt securities, and preferred securities with contractual payment-in-kind interest or dividends, which represent contractual interest/dividends accrued and added to the loan balance or liquidation preference that generally becomes due at maturity, the Company will not ascribe value to payment-in-kind interest/dividends, if the portfolio company valuation indicates that the payment-in-kind interest is not collectible. However, the Company may ascribe value to payment-in-kind interest if the health of the portfolio company and the underlying securities are not in question. All payment-in-kind interest that has been added to the principal balance or capitalized is subject to ratification by the Valuation Committee. For interest or deferred interest receivables purchased by the Company at a discount to their outstanding amount, the Company amortizes the discount using the effective yield method and records it as interest income over the life of the loan. The Company will not ascribe value to the interest or deferred interest, if the Company has determined that the interest is not collectible.\nEscrows from the sale of a portfolio company are generally valued at an amount, which may be expected to be received from the buyer under the escrow's various conditions and discounted for both risk and time.\nASC 460, Guarantees, requires the Company to estimate the fair value of the guarantee obligation at its inception and requires the Company to assess whether a probable loss contingency exists in accordance with the requirements of ASC 450, Contingencies. The Valuation Committee typically will look at the pricing of the security in which the guarantee provided support for the security and compare it to the price of a similar or hypothetical security without guarantee support. The difference in pricing will be discounted for time and risk over the period in which the guarantee is expected to remain outstanding.\nInvestment Classification\nWe classify our investments by level of control. As defined in the 1940 Act, \u201cControl Investments\u201d are investments in those companies that we are deemed to \u201cControl.\u201d \u201cAffiliate Investments\u201d are investments in those companies that are \u201cAffiliated Companies\u201d of us, as defined in the 1940 Act, other than Control Investments. \u201cNon-Control/Non-Affiliate Investments\u201d are those that are neither Control Investments nor Affiliate Investments. Generally, under the 1940 Act, we are deemed to control a company in which we have invested if we own 25% or more of the voting securities of such company or have greater than 50% representation on its board. We are deemed to be an affiliate of a company in which we have invested if we own 5% or more and less than 25% of the voting securities of such company.\nInvestment Transactions and Related Operating Income\nInvestment transactions and related revenues and expenses are accounted for on the trade date (the date the order to buy or sell is executed). The cost of securities sold is determined on a first-in, first-out basis, unless otherwise specified. Dividend income and distributions on investment securities is recorded on the ex-dividend date. The tax characteristics of such distributions received from our portfolio companies will be determined by whether or not the distribution was made from the investment's current taxable earnings and profits or accumulated taxable earnings and profits from prior years. Interest income, which includes accretion of discount and amortization of premium, if applicable, is recorded on the accrual basis to the extent that such amounts are expected to be collected. Fee income includes fees for guarantees and services rendered by the Company or its wholly-owned subsidiary to portfolio companies and other third parties such as due diligence,\nstructuring, transaction services, monitoring services, and investment advisory services. Guaranty fees are recognized as income over the related period of the guaranty. Due diligence, structuring, and transaction services fees are generally recognized as income when services are rendered or when the related transactions are completed. Monitoring and investment advisory services fees are generally recognized as income as the services are rendered. Any fee income determined to be loan origination fees is recorded as income at the time that the investment is made and any original issue discount and market discount are capitalized and then amortized into income using the effective interest method. Upon the prepayment of a loan or debt security, any unamortized original issue discount or market discount is recorded as interest income. For investments with PIK interest and dividends, we base income and dividend accrual on the valuation of the PIK notes or securities received from the borrower. If the portfolio company indicates a value of the PIK notes or securities that is not sufficient to cover the contractual interest or dividend, we will not accrue interest or dividend income on the notes or securities.\nCash Equivalents\nFor the purpose of the Consolidated Balance Sheets and Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows, the Company considers all money market and all highly liquid temporary cash investments purchased with an original maturity of less than three months to be cash equivalents. The Company places its cash and cash equivalents with financial institutions and cash held in bank accounts may exceed the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (\u201cFDIC\u201d) insured limit. As of October 31, 2016, the Company had approximately $395,000 in cash equivalents, approximately $800,000 in restricted cash and approximately $19.8 million in cash totaling approximately $21.0 million. Of the $19.8 million in cash, approximately $328,000 was held by MVC Turf and approximately $1.1 million was held by MVC Cayman.\nRestricted Cash and Cash Equivalents\nCash and cash equivalent accounts that are not available to the Company for day-to-day use and are legally restricted are classified as restricted cash. Restricted cash and cash equivalents are carried at cost, which approximates fair value. On April 26, 2011, the Company agreed to collateralize a 5.0 million Euro letter of credit from JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., which is related to a project guarantee by AB DnB NORD bankas to Security Holdings, a portfolio company investment and was classified as restricted cash. The Euro letter of credit was equivalent to approximately $5.5 million at October 31, 2015. During the fiscal year ended October 31, 2016, the Euro letter of credit was released and is no longer collateralized by the Company and released from restricted cash. During the fiscal year ended October 31, 2016, the Company agreed to cash collateralize a $500,000 working capital line of credit for an entity partially owned by MVC Environmental and a $300,000 letter of credit for RuMe, which were classified as restricted cash equivalents on the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nRestricted Securities\nThe Company will invest in privately-placed restricted securities. These securities may be resold in transactions exempt from registration or to the public if the securities are registered. Disposal of these securities may involve time-consuming negotiations and expense, and a prompt sale at an acceptable price may be difficult.\nDistributions to Shareholders\nDistributions to shareholders are recorded on the ex-dividend date.\nIncome Taxes\nIt is the policy of the Company to meet the requirements for qualification as a RIC under Subchapter M of the Code. As a RIC, the Company is not subject to income tax to the extent that it distributes all of its investment company taxable income and net realized capital gains for its taxable year. The Company is also exempt from excise tax if it distributes at least 98% of its income and 98.2% of its capital gains during each calendar year.\nOur consolidated operating subsidiary, MVCFS, is subject to federal and state income tax. We use the liability method in accounting for income taxes. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recorded for temporary differences between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and their reported amounts in the financial statements, using statutory tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse. A valuation allowance is provided against deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized.\nASC 740, Income Taxes, provides guidance for how uncertain tax positions should be recognized, measured, presented and disclosed in the financial statements. ASC 740 requires the evaluation of tax positions taken or expected to be taken in the course of preparing the Company's tax returns to determine whether the tax positions are \u201cmore-likely-than-not\u201d of being sustained by the applicable tax authority. Tax positions deemed to meet a \u201cmore-likely-than-not\u201d threshold would be recorded as a tax benefit or expense in the current period. The Company recognizes interest and penalties, if any, related to unrecognized tax benefits as income tax expense in the consolidated statement of operations. During the fiscal year ended October 31, 2016, the Company did not incur any interest or penalties. Although we file federal and state tax returns, our major tax jurisdiction is federal for the Company and MVCFS. The fiscal years 2013, 2014, 2015 and 2016 for the Company and MVCFS remain subject to examination by federal, state and local tax authorities.", "item_7_truncated": "ITEM 7.

Readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date hereof. The Company undertakes no obligation to publicly revise these forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances occurring after the date hereof or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events. The following analysis of the financial condition and results of operations of the Company should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements, the notes thereto and the other financial information included elsewhere in this report.\nOVERVIEW\nThe Company is an externally managed, non-diversified, closed-end management investment company that has elected to be regulated as a business development company under the 1940 Act. The Company's investment objective is to seek to maximize total return from capital appreciation and/or income, though our current focus is more on yield generating investments.\nOn November 6, 2003, Mr. Tokarz assumed his positions as Chairman and Portfolio Manager of the Company. He and the Company's management team are seeking to implement our investment\nobjective (i.e., to maximize total return from capital appreciation and/or income) through making a broad range of private investments in a variety of industries.\nThe investments can include senior or subordinated loans, convertible debt and convertible preferred securities, common or preferred stock, equity interests, warrants or rights to acquire equity interests and other private equity transactions, among other investments. During the fiscal year ended October 31, 2015, the Company made eight new investments and made 5 follow-on investments in 4 existing portfolio companies committing a total of approximately $62.4 million to these investments. During the fiscal year ended October 31, 2016, the Company made six new and 9 follow-on investments in 6 existing portfolio companies totaling approximately $44.2 million.\nPrior to the adoption of our current investment objective, the Company's investment objective had been to achieve long-term capital appreciation from venture capital investments in information technology companies. The Company's investments had thus previously focused on investments in equity and debt securities of information technology companies. As of October 31, 2016, 1.4% of the current fair value of our assets consisted of Legacy Investments. We are, however, managing these Legacy Investments to try and realize maximum returns. We generally seek to capitalize on opportunities to realize cash returns on these investments when presented with a potential \u201cliquidity event,\u201d i.e., a sale, public offering, merger or other reorganization.\nOur new portfolio investments are made pursuant to our current objective and strategy. We are concentrating our investment efforts on small and middle-market companies that, in our view, provide opportunities to maximize total return from capital appreciation and/or income. More recently, the Company has been focusing its strategy more on yield generating investments. Under our investment approach, we have the authority to invest, without limit, in any one portfolio company, subject to any diversification limits required in order for us to continue to qualify as a RIC under Subchapter M of the Code. Presently, due to our asset growth and composition, compliance with the RIC requirements limits our ability to make Non-Diversified Investments.\nWe participate in the private equity business generally by providing privately negotiated long-term equity and/or debt investment capital to small and middle-market companies. Our financings are generally used to fund growth, buyouts, acquisitions, recapitalizations, note purchases and/or bridge financings. We generally invest in private companies, though, from time to time, we may invest in public companies that may lack adequate access to public capital.\nWe may also seek to achieve our investment objective by establishing a subsidiary or subsidiaries that would serve as general partner to a private equity or other investment fund(s). In fact, during fiscal year 2006, we established MVC Partners for this purpose. Furthermore, the Board of Directors authorized the establishment of a PE Fund, for which an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company serves as the GP and which may raise up to $250 million. On October 29, 2010, through MVC Partners and MVCFS, the Company committed to invest approximately $20.1 million in the PE Fund. The PE Fund closed on approximately $104 million of capital commitments. The Company's Board of Directors authorized the establishment of, and investment in, the PE Fund for a variety of reasons, including the Company's ability to make Non-Diversified Investments through the PE Fund. As previously disclosed, the Company is restricted in its ability to make Non-Diversified Investments. For services provided to the PE Fund, the GP and MVC Partners are together entitled to receive 25% of all management fees and other fees paid by the PE Fund and its portfolio companies and up to 30% of the carried interest generated by the PE Fund. Further, at the direction of the Board of Directors, the GP retained TTG Advisers to serve as the\nportfolio manager of the PE Fund. In exchange for providing those services, and pursuant to the Board of Directors' authorization and direction, TTG Advisers is entitled to receive the balance of the fees and any carried interest generated by the PE Fund and its portfolio companies. Given this separate arrangement with the GP and the PE Fund, under the terms of the Company's Advisory Agreement with TTG Advisers, TTG Advisers is not entitled to receive from the Company a management fee or an incentive fee on assets of the Company that are invested in the PE Fund. During the fiscal year ended October 31, 2012 and thereafter, MVC Partners was consolidated with the operations of the Company as MVC Partners' limited partnership interest in the PE Fund is a substantial portion of MVC Partners operations. Previously, MVC Partners was presented as a portfolio company on the Schedule of Investments. The consolidation of MVC Partners has not had any material effect on the financial position or net results of operations of the Company. Also, during fiscal year ended October 31, 2014, MVC Turf, LLC (\u201cMVC Turf\u201d) was consolidated with the Company as MVC Turf is an MVC wholly-owned holding company. The consolidation of MVC Turf has not had any material effect on the financial position or net results of operations of the Company. Please see Note 2 of our consolidated financial statements \u201cConsolidation\u201d for more information.\nAs a result of the closing of the PE Fund, consistent with the Board-approved policy concerning the allocation of investment opportunities, the PE Fund received a priority allocation of all private equity investments that would otherwise be Non-Diversified Investments for the Company during the PE Fund's investment period that ended on October 28, 2014. Additional capital may be called for follow-on investments in existing portfolio companies of the PE Fund or to pay operating expenses of the PE Fund. For a further discussion of this allocation policy, please see \u201cOur Investment Strategy - Allocation of Investment Opportunities\u201d above.\nAdditionally, in pursuit of our objective, we may acquire a portfolio of existing private equity or debt investments held by financial institutions or other investment funds should such opportunities arise.\nFurthermore, pending investments in portfolio companies pursuant to the Company's principal investment strategy, the Company may invest in certain securities on a short-term or temporary basis. In addition to cash-equivalents and other money market-type investments, such short-term investments may include exchange-traded funds and private investment funds offering periodic liquidity.\nOPERATING INCOME\nFor the Fiscal Years Ended October 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014. Total operating income was $37.4 million for the fiscal year ended October 31, 2016 and $23.7 million for the fiscal year ended October 31, 2015, an increase of $13.7 million. Fiscal year 2015 operating income increased by approximately $3.9 million compared to Fiscal year 2014 operating income of $19.8 million.\nFor the Fiscal Year Ended October 31, 2016\nTotal operating income was $37.4 million for the fiscal year ended October 31, 2016. The increase in operating income over the same period last year was primarily due to an increase in dividend income and fee income from the Company's portfolio companies. The Company earned approximately $32.7 million in interest and dividend income from investments in portfolio companies. Of the $32.7 million recorded in interest/dividend income, $12.5 million was dividend\nincome from U.S. Gas and approximately $4.8 million was \u201cpayment in kind\u201d/deferred interest. The \u201cpayment in kind\u201d/deferred interest is computed at the contractual rate specified in each investment agreement and may be added to the principal balance of each investment. The Company's debt investments yielded annualized rates from 5.0% to 16.0%. The Company also received fee income from asset management of the PE Fund and its portfolio companies totaling approximately $1.4 million and fee income from the Company's portfolio companies of approximately $3.3 million, of which $2.3 million was one-time fee income related to the Ohio Medical sale, totaling approximately $4.7 million in fee income. Of the $1.4 million of fee income from asset management activities, 75% of the income is obligated to be paid to TTG Advisers. However, under the PE Fund's agreements, a significant portion of the portfolio fees that are paid by the PE Fund's portfolio companies to the GP and TTG Advisers is subject to recoupment by the PE Fund in the form of an offset to future management fees paid by the PE Fund.\nFor the Fiscal Year Ended October 31, 2015\nTotal operating income was $23.7 million for the fiscal year ended October 31, 2015. The increase in operating income over the same period last year was primarily due to an increase in interest earned on loans partially offset by a decrease in fee income from asset management and other income. The main component of operating income for the fiscal year ended October 31, 2015 was interest earned on loans. The Company earned approximately $20.4 million in interest and dividend income from investments in portfolio companies. Of the $20.4 million recorded in interest/dividend income, approximately $5.2 million was \u201cpayment in kind\u201d/deferred interest. The \u201cpayment in kind\u201d/deferred interest is computed at the contractual rate specified in each investment agreement and may be added to the principal balance of each investment. The Company's debt investments yielded annualized rates from 9.75% to 16.0%. The Company also received fee income from asset management of the PE Fund and its portfolio companies totaling approximately $1.3 million and fee income from the Company's portfolio companies of approximately $2.0 million, totaling approximately $3.3 million. Of the $1.3 million of fee income from asset management activities, 75% of the income is obligated to be paid to TTG Advisers. However, under the PE Fund's agreements, a significant portion of the portfolio fees that are paid by the PE Fund's portfolio companies to the GP and TTG Advisers is subject to recoupment by the PE Fund in the form of an offset to future management fees paid by the PE Fund.\nFor the Fiscal Year Ended October 31, 2014\nTotal operating income was $19.8 million for the fiscal year ended October 31, 2014. The decrease in operating income over the same period last year was primarily due to a decrease in dividend income from portfolio companies, specifically U.S. Gas (which did not pay a dividend in fiscal 2014, as it did in 2013), which was partially offset by an increase in interest income from portfolio companies. The main components of operating income for the fiscal year ended October 31, 2014 were interest earned on loans and fee income from portfolio companies and asset management. The Company earned approximately $15.3 million in interest and dividend income from investments in portfolio companies. Of the $15.3 million recorded in interest/dividend income, approximately $4.2 million was \u201cpayment in kind\u201d interest/dividends. The \u201cpayment in kind\u201d interest/dividends are computed at the contractual rate specified in each investment agreement and added to the principal balance of each investment. The Company's debt investments yielded rates from 5% to 16%. The Company also received fee income from asset management of the PE Fund and its portfolio companies totaling approximately $1.9 million and fee income from the Company's portfolio companies of approximately $1.6 million, totaling approximately $3.5\nmillion. Of the $1.9 million of fee income from asset management activities, 75% of the income is obligated to be paid to TTG Advisers. However, under the PE Fund's agreements, a significant portion of the portfolio fees that are paid by the PE Fund's portfolio companies to the GP and TTG Advisers is subject to recoupment by the PE Fund in the form of an offset to future management fees paid by the PE Fund.\nOPERATING EXPENSES\nFor the Fiscal Years Ended October 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014. Net Operating expenses were $18.0 million for the fiscal year ended October 31, 2016 and $14.4 million for the fiscal year ended October 31, 2015, an increase of $3.6 million. Fiscal year 2015 operating expenses decreased by approximately $3.8 million compared to Fiscal year 2014 operating expenses of $18.2 million.\nFor the Fiscal Year Ended October 31, 2016\nOperating expenses, net of the Voluntary Waivers (as described below), were approximately $18.02 million or 6.35% of the Company's average net assets for the fiscal year ended October 31, 2016. Significant components of operating expenses for the fiscal year ended October 31, 2016 were interest and other borrowing costs of approximately $10.2 million and management fee expense paid by the Company of approximately $5.7 million, which is net of the voluntary management fee waiver of approximately $1.9 million.\nThe approximately $3.6 million increase in the Company's net operating expenses for the fiscal year ended October 31, 2016 compared to the same period in 2015, was primarily due to the approximately $6.7 million increase in the estimated provision for incentive compensation expense, including a $1.0 million incentive fee waiver for the fiscal year ended October 31, 2016, which was partially offset by an approximately $2.2 million decrease in management fee expense that included a voluntary management fee waiver of approximately $1.9 million. The approximately $1.0 million decrease in audit and tax preparation fees for the fiscal year ended October 31, 2016 compared to the same period in 2015 was due to the delay in filing both the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended October 31, 2015 and the Quarterly Report for the period ended January 31, 2016 and the timing of the work performed by the Company's auditors during the fiscal year ended October 31, 2016. The portfolio fees - asset management are payable to TTG Advisers for monitoring and other customary fees received by the GP from portfolio companies of the PE Fund. To the extent the GP or TTG Advisers receives advisory, monitoring, organization or other customary fees from any portfolio company of the PE Fund or management fees related to the PE Fund, 25% of such fees shall be paid to or retained by the GP and 75% of such fees shall be paid to or retained by TTG Advisers. On October 28, 2016, the Board approved the renewal of the Advisory Agreement for the 2017 fiscal year. Further, the Adviser agreed to continue to waive a portion of the base management fee so that it is reduced to 1.50% for fiscal year 2017. In March 2016, the Adviser agreed to modify its prior agreement to waive, effective November 1, 2015, the first $1.0 million of capital gains incentive fee due under the Advisory Agreement, such that the $1.0 million waiver of incentive fee would be applied to any incentive fee due under the agreement, whether it is a capital gains incentive fee or net operating income incentive fee. Furthermore, the Company and the Adviser, similar to fiscal year 2016, agreed on an expense cap for fiscal 2017 of 3.25% under the Modified Methodology. The amount of any payments made by the GP of the PE Fund to TTG Advisers pursuant to the Portfolio Management Agreement between the GP and TTG Advisers respecting the PE Fund continues to be excluded from the calculation of the Company's expense ratio under the Expense Limitation Agreement. In addition, for fiscal years 2010 through\n2016, TTG Advisers voluntarily agreed to waive $150,000 of expenses that the Company is obligated to reimburse to TTG Advisers under the Advisory Agreement (the \u201cVoluntary Waiver\u201d). TTG Advisers also voluntarily agreed that any assets of the Company that are invested in exchange-traded funds would not be taken into account in the calculation of the base management fee due to TTG Advisers under the Advisory Agreement. As of October 31, 2016, the Company did not have an investment in an exchange traded fund. Under the Modified Methodology, for the fiscal year ended October 31, 2016, the Company's expense ratio was 2.47%, (taking into account the same carve outs as those applicable to the expense cap).\nPursuant to the terms of the Advisory Agreement, during the fiscal year ended October 31, 2016, the provision for incentive compensation was decreased by a net amount of approximately $3.0 million to approximately $1.9 million, including both the net operating income incentive fee and the capital gains incentive fee. The net decrease in the provision for incentive compensation during the fiscal year ended October 31, 2016 primarily reflects the Valuation Committee's determination to decrease the fair values of sixteen of the Company's portfolio investments (Custom Alloy, MVC Automotive, Security Holdings, SGDA Europe, Tekers, Turf, JSC Tekers, RuMe, BAC, Biogenics, Morey's, Ohio Medical, Equus, Legal Solutions, MVC Environmental and Initials) by a total of approximately $32.0 million. The net decrease in the provision also reflects the Valuation Committee's determination to increase the fair values of ten of the Company's portfolio investments (NPWT, Centile, SCSD, Agri-Carriers, RX, U.S. Gas, Advantage, Thunderdome, U.S. Tech and Vestal) by a total of approximately $8.5 million. For the fiscal year ended October 31, 2016, no incentive compensation was paid. For the quarter ended April 30, 2016, a $2.1 million provision was recorded for the net operating income portion of the incentive fee as pre-incentive fee net operating income exceeded the hurdle rate. A $1.0 million incentive fee waiver was recorded during the quarter ended April 30, 2016 resulting in a net $1.1 million provision being recorded for the net operating income portion of the incentive fee. For the quarter ended October 31, 2016, no provision was recorded for the net operating income portion of the incentive fee as pre-incentive fee net operating income for the quarter did not exceed the hurdle rate. Please see Note 5 of our consolidated financial statements \u201cIncentive Compensation\u201d for more information.\nFor the Fiscal Year Ended October 31, 2015\nOperating expenses, net of the Voluntary Waivers (as described below), were approximately $14.4 million or 4.54% of the Company's average net assets for the fiscal year ended October 31, 2015. Significant components of operating expenses for the fiscal year ended October 31, 2015 were interest and other borrowing costs of approximately $10.2 million and management fee expense paid by the Company of approximately $7.8 million.\nThe approximately $3.8 million decrease in the Company's net operating expenses for the fiscal year ended October 31, 2015 compared to the same period in 2014, was primarily due to the approximately $5.0 million decrease in the estimated provision for incentive compensation expense and approximately $836,000 decrease in management fees, which was partially offset by an increase in interest and other borrowing costs of approximately $788,000 and an increase in audit and tax preparation fees, which was due to the fiscal year 2014 restatements and related expenses, totaling $836,000. The portfolio fees - asset management are payable to TTG Advisers for monitoring and other customary fees received by the GP from portfolio companies of the PE Fund. To the extent the GP or TTG Advisers receives advisory, monitoring, organization or other customary fees from any portfolio company of the PE Fund or management fees related to the PE\nFund, 25% of such fees shall be paid to or retained by the GP and 75% of such fees shall be paid to or retained by TTG Advisers. For the 2015 fiscal year, TTG Advisers voluntarily agreed to waive $150,000 of expenses that the Company is obligated to reimburse to TTG Advisers under the Advisory Agreement (the \u201cVoluntary Waiver\u201d). TTG Advisers voluntarily agreed that any assets of the Company that were invested in exchange-traded funds would not be taken into account in the calculation of the base management fee due to TTG Advisers under the Advisory Agreement. TTG Advisers has voluntarily agreed to waive any management fees on the Company's assets invested in Equus common stock. The Company and the Adviser have agreed to continue the expense cap of 3.5% (on consolidated expenses of the Company, including any amounts payable to TTG Advisers under the base management fee, but excluding the amount of any interest and other direct borrowing costs, taxes, incentive compensation, payments made by the GP of the PE Fund to TTG Advisers pursuant to the Portfolio Management Agreement between the GP and TTG Advisers respecting the PE Fund and extraordinary expenses taken as a percentage of the Company's average net assets) into fiscal year 2015, though they modified the methodology so that the cap is applied to limit the Company's ratio of expenses to total assets less cash (the \u201cModified Methodology\u201d), consistent with the asset level used to calculate the base management fee. (The expenses covered by the cap remain unchanged.) Under the Modified Methodology, for the fiscal year ended October 31, 2015, the Company's expense ratio was 3.21% (taking into account the same carve outs as those applicable to the expense cap).\nPursuant to the terms of the Advisory Agreement, during the fiscal year ended October 31, 2015, the provision for incentive compensation was decreased by a net amount of approximately $9.7 million to approximately $5.0 million. The net decrease in the provision for incentive compensation during the fiscal year ended October 31, 2015 primarily reflects the Valuation Committee's determination to decrease the fair values of sixteen of the Company's portfolio investments (Custom Alloy, NPWT, BAC, Tekers, PrePaid Legal, Centile, Biovation, Inland, MVC Automotive, Ohio Medical, SGDA Europe, Security Holdings, JSC Tekers, Morey's, Velocitius and Equus) by a total of approximately $58.2 million. The net decrease in the provision also reflects the Valuation Committee's determination to increase the fair values of five of the Company's portfolio investments (Turf, RuMe, Biogenic, Advantage Insurance and SCSD) by a total of approximately $4.3 million. The Valuation Committee also increased the fair value of the Ohio Medical series C convertible preferred stock by approximately $4.7 million due to a PIK distribution, which was treated as a return of capital. For the fiscal year ended October 31, 2015, no incentive compensation fee was paid. Also, for the fiscal year ended October 31, 2015, no provision was recorded for the net operating income portion of the incentive fee as pre-incentive fee net operating income did not exceed the hurdle rate. Please see Note 5 of our consolidated financial statements \u201cIncentive Compensation\u201d for more information.\nFor the Fiscal Year Ended October 31, 2014\nOperating expenses, net of the Voluntary Waivers (as described below), were approximately $18.2 million or 5.04% of the Company's average net assets, for the fiscal year ended October 31, 2014. Significant components of operating expenses for the fiscal year ended October 31, 2014 were management fee expense paid by the Company of approximately $8.7 million and interest and other borrowing costs of approximately $9.4 million.\nThe approximately $5.1 million decrease in the Company's net operating expenses for the fiscal year ended October 31, 2014 compared to the fiscal year ended October 31, 2013, was primarily due to the approximately $8.6 million decrease in the estimated provision for incentive\ncompensation expense, which was partially offset by an increase in interest and other borrowing costs of approximately $2.7 million and an increase in the Company's management fee expense of approximately $849,000. The portfolio fees - asset management are payable to TTG Advisers for monitoring and other customary fees received by the GP from portfolio companies of the PE Fund. To the extent the GP or TTG Advisers receives advisory, monitoring, organization or other customary fees from any portfolio company of the PE Fund or management fees related to the PE Fund, 25% of such fees shall be paid to or retained by the GP and 75% of such fees shall be paid to or retained by TTG Advisers.

The net decrease in the provision for incentive compensation during the fiscal year ended October 31, 2014 primarily reflects the Valuation Committee's determination to decrease the fair values of eleven of the Company's portfolio investments (MVC Automotive, G3K, Ohio Medical, NPWT, U.S. Gas, Velocitius, Octagon, Tekers, JSC Tekers, SGDA Europe and Biovation) by a total of approximately $40.7 million. The net decrease in the provision also reflects the Valuation Committee's determination to increase the fair values of twelve of the Company's portfolio investments (Custom Alloy, Advantage, Biogenic, PrePaid Legal, RuMe, Freshii USA, Inc. (\u201cFreshii\u201d), Centile, Security Holdings, Summit, Morey's, Turf and Vestal) by a total of approximately $11.5 million.

The Company's pro-rata share of the PE Fund's investment in AccuMed Corp. totaled approximately $2.4 million. Assuming full receipt of escrow proceeds, the Company expects to receive an additional $1.2 million for a total of $13.4 million.\nSIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES\nThe following is a summary of significant accounting policies followed by the Company in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements:\nThe preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Actual results could differ from those estimates.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nIn May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (\u201cFASB\u201d) issued Accounting Standards Update (\u201cASU\u201d) No. 2014-09, \u201cRevenue from Contracts with Customers\u201d (Topic 606). ASU 2014-09 addresses the reporting of revenue by most entities and will replace most existing revenue recognition guidance in U.S. GAAP when it becomes effective. In August 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-14 that defers the effective date of ASU 2014-09 for public business entities for\nannual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods therein. Early application is not permitted for public business entities. The Company is currently assessing the impact of this guidance.\nIn August 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-15, \u201cPresentation of Financial Statements - Going Concern (Subtopic 205-40): Disclosure of Uncertainties about an Entity's Ability to Continue as a Going Concern\u201d (\u201cASU 2014-15\u201d). The standard requires management to evaluate, at each interim and annual reporting period, whether there are conditions or events that raise substantial doubt about the entity's ability to continue as a going concern within one year after the date the financial statements are issued, and provide related disclosures. ASU 2014-15 is effective for annual periods ending after December 15, 2016, and for annual and interim periods thereafter, and early adoption is permitted. The Company is currently assessing the impact of this guidance.\nIn February 2015, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update 2015-02, which updated consolidation standards under ASC Topic 810, \u201cConsolidation\u201d. Under this update, a new consolidation analysis is required for variable interest entities (\u201cVIEs\u201d) and will limit the circumstances in which investment managers and similar entities are required to consolidate the entities that they manage. The FASB decided to eliminate some of the criteria under which their fees are considered a variable interest and limit the circumstances in which variable interests in a VIE held by related parties of a reporting enterprise require the reporting enterprise to consolidate the VIE. The guidance is effective for public business entities for annual and interim periods in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2015. This update has had no impact on the Company's financial condition or results of operations.\nIn April 2015, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update 2015-03, Interest-Imputation of Interest (Subtopic 835-30): Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs. Under this guidance, debt issuance costs related to a recognized debt liability are to be presented as a direct deduction from the debt liability rather than as an asset on the balance sheet, consistent with debt discounts. The guidance is effective for public business entities for annual and interim periods in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2015. The Company is currently assessing the impact of this guidance.\nIn May 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-07, Fair Value Measurement (Topic 820): Disclosures for Investments in Certain Entities that Calculate Net Asset Value per Share (or Its Equivalent). The new guidance removes the requirement that investments for which NAV is determined based on practical expedient reliance be reported utilizing the fair value hierarchy. The guidance is effective for public business entities for annual and interim periods in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2015. The Company is currently assessing the impact of this guidance.\nIn November 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-17, which requires deferred tax liabilities and assets to be classified as non-current in a classified statement of financial condition. The amendments are effective for all entities for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2016. Early adoption is permitted. The Company is currently assessing the impact of this guidance.\nIn August 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-15, Statement of Cash Flows - Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments (Topic 230). The amendments provide guidance on eight specific cash flow issues in how certain cash receipts and cash payments are presented and\nclassified in the statement of cash flows with the objective of reducing the existing diversity in practice. The amendments are effective for all entities for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2017. Early adoption is permitted. The Company is currently assessing the impact of this guidance.\nIn October 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-17, to amend the consolidation guidance on how a reporting entity that is the single decision maker of a VIE should treat indirect interests in the entity held through related parties that are under common control with the reporting entity when determining whether it is the primary beneficiary of that VIE. The ASU is effective for public business entities for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim periods within those fiscal years. The Company is currently assessing the impact of this guidance.\nIn November 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-18, Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Restricted Cash. The amendments in this Update require that a statement of cash flows explain the change during the period in the total of cash, cash equivalents, and amounts generally described as restricted cash or restricted cash equivalents. The ASU is effective for public business entities for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within those fiscal years. The Company is currently assessing the impact of this guidance.\nTax Status and Capital Loss Carryforwards\nAs a RIC, the Company is not subject to federal income tax to the extent that it distributes all of its investment company taxable income and net realized capital gains for its taxable year (see Notes 12 \u201cTax Matters\u201d and Note 13 \u201cIncome Taxes\u201d of our notes to the consolidated financial statements). This allows us to attract different kinds of investors than other publicly held corporations. The Company is also exempt from excise tax if it distributes at least (1) 98% of its ordinary income during each calendar year, (2) 98.2% of its capital gains realized in the period from November 1 of the prior year through October 31 of the current year, and (3) all such ordinary income and capital gains for previous years that were not distributed during those years. On October 31, 2016, the Company had a net capital loss carryforward of approximately $50.2 million. The Company also had approximately $18.0 million in unrealized losses associated with Legacy Investments as of October 31, 2016.\nValuation of Portfolio Securities\nPursuant to the requirements of the 1940 Act and in accordance with the Accounting Standards Codification (\u201cASC\u201d), Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures (\u201cASC 820\u201d), we value our portfolio securities at their current market values or, if market quotations are not readily available, at their estimates of fair values. Because our portfolio company investments generally do not have readily ascertainable market values, we record these investments at fair value in accordance with our Valuation Procedures adopted by the Board of Directors, which are consistent with ASC 820. As permitted by the SEC, the Board of Directors has delegated the responsibility of making fair value determinations to its Valuation Committee, subject to the Board of Directors' supervision and pursuant to our Valuation Procedures. Our Board of Directors may also hire independent consultants to review our Valuation Procedures or to conduct an independent valuation of one or more of our portfolio investments. In this regard, the Company has engaged an independent valuation firm to perform valuation services for certain portfolio debt investments.\nPursuant to our Valuation Procedures, the Valuation Committee (which is comprised of three Independent Directors) determines fair values of portfolio company investments on a quarterly basis (or more frequently, if deemed appropriate under the circumstances). In doing so, the Committee considers the recommendations of TTG Advisers and input and reviews by third party consultants retained to support the Company's valuation process. The Company has also adopted other enhanced processes related to valuations of controlled/affiliated portfolio companies. Any changes in valuation are recorded in the consolidated statements of operations as \u201cNet unrealized appreciation (depreciation) on investments.\u201d\nCurrently, our NAV per share is calculated and published on a quarterly basis. The Company calculates our NAV per share by subtracting all liabilities from the total value of our portfolio securities and other assets and dividing the result by the total number of outstanding shares of our common stock on the date of valuation. Fair values of foreign investments reflect exchange rates, as applicable, in effect on the last business day of the quarter end. Exchange rates fluctuate on a daily basis, sometimes significantly. Exchange rate fluctuations following the most recent fiscal year end are not reflected in the valuations reported in this Annual Report. See Item 1A Risk Factor, \u201cInvestments in foreign debt or equity may involve significant risks in addition to the risks inherent in U.S. investments.\u201d\nAt October 31, 2016, approximately 80.97% of total assets represented investments in portfolio companies recorded at fair value (\u201cFair Value Investments\u201d).\nUnder most circumstances, at the time of acquisition, Fair Value Investments are carried at cost (absent the existence of conditions warranting, in management's and the Valuation Committee's view, a different initial value). During the period that an investment is held by the Company, its original cost may cease to approximate fair value as the result of market and investment specific factors. No pre-determined formula can be applied to determine fair value. Rather, the Valuation Committee analyzes fair value measurements based on the value at which the securities of the portfolio company could be sold in an orderly disposition over a reasonable period of time between willing parties, other than in a forced or liquidation sale. The liquidity event whereby the Company ultimately exits an investment is generally the sale, the merger, or the recapitalization of a portfolio company or by a public offering of its securities.\nValuation Methodology\nThere is no one methodology to determine fair value and, in fact, for any portfolio security, fair value may be expressed as a range of values, from which the Company derives a single estimate of fair value. To determine the fair value of a portfolio security, the Valuation Committee analyzes the portfolio company's financial results and projections, publicly traded comparable companies when available, comparable private transactions when available, precedent transactions in the market when available, third-party real estate and asset appraisals if appropriate and available, discounted cash flow analysis, if appropriate, as well as other factors. The Company generally requires, where practicable, Portfolio Companies to provide annual audited and more regular unaudited financial statements, and/or annual projections for the upcoming fiscal year.\nThe fair value of our portfolio securities is inherently subjective. Because of the inherent uncertainty of fair valuation of portfolio securities and escrow receivables that do not have readily ascertainable market values, our estimate of fair value may significantly differ from the value that would have been used had a ready market existed for the securities. Such values also do not reflect\nbrokers' fees or other selling costs, which might become payable on disposition of such investments.\nASC 820 provides a framework for measuring the fair value of assets and liabilities and provides guidance regarding a fair value hierarchy, which prioritizes information used to measure value. In determining fair value, the Valuation Committee primarily uses the level 3 inputs referenced in ASC 820.\nASC 820 defines fair value in terms of the price that would be received upon the sale of an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. The price used to measure the fair value is not adjusted for transaction costs while the cost basis of our investments may include initial transaction costs. Under ASC 820, the fair value measurement also assumes that the transaction to sell an asset occurs in the principal market for the asset or, in the absence of a principal market, the most advantageous market for the asset. The principal market is the market in which the reporting entity would sell or transfer the asset with the greatest volume and level of activity for the asset to which the reporting entity has access to as of the measurement date. If no market for the asset exists or if the reporting entity does not have access to the principal market, the reporting entity should use a hypothetical market.\nOur investments are carried at fair value in accordance with ASC 820. Unrestricted minority-owned publicly traded securities for which market quotations are readily available are valued at the closing market quote on the valuation date and majority-owned publicly traded securities and other privately held securities are valued as determined in good faith by the Valuation Committee of the Board of Directors. For legally or contractually restricted securities of companies that are publicly traded, the value is based on the closing market quote on the valuation date minus a discount for the restriction. At October 31, 2016, we did not own restricted or unrestricted securities of any publicly traded company in which we have a majority-owned interest, but did own one security in which we have a minority-owned interest.\nIf a security is publicly traded, the fair value is generally equal to the market value based on the closing price on the principal exchange on which the security is primarily traded, unless the security is restricted and in such a case, a discount is applied for the restriction.\nFor equity securities of Portfolio Companies, the Valuation Committee estimates the fair value based on market and/or income approach with value then attributed to equity or equity like securities using the enterprise value waterfall (\u201cEnterprise Value Waterfall\u201d) valuation methodology. Under the Enterprise Value Waterfall valuation methodology, the Valuation Committee estimates the enterprise fair value of the portfolio company and then waterfalls the enterprise value over the portfolio company's securities in order of their preference relative to one another. To assess the enterprise value of the portfolio company, the Valuation Committee weighs some or all of the traditional market valuation methods and factors based on the individual circumstances of the portfolio company in order to estimate the enterprise value. The methodologies for performing assets may be based on, among other things: valuations of comparable public companies, recent sales of private and public comparable companies, discounting the forecasted cash flows of the portfolio company, third party valuations of the portfolio company, considering offers from third parties to buy the company, estimating the value to potential strategic buyers and considering the value of recent investments in the equity securities of the portfolio company, and third-party asset and real estate appraisals. For non-performing assets, the Valuation Committee may estimate the liquidation or collateral value of the portfolio\ncompany's assets. The Valuation Committee also takes into account historical and anticipated financial results.\nThe Company does not utilize hedge accounting and instead, when applicable, marks its derivatives to market on the Company's consolidated statement of operations.\nIn assessing enterprise value, the Valuation Committee considers the mergers and acquisitions (\u201cM&A\u201d) market as the principal market in which the Company would sell its investments in portfolio companies under circumstances where the Company has the ability to control or gain control of the board of directors of the portfolio company (\u201cControl Companies\u201d). This approach is consistent with the principal market that the Company would use for its portfolio companies if the Company has the ability to initiate a sale of the portfolio company as of the measurement date, i.e., if it has the ability to control or gain control of the board of directors of the portfolio company as of the measurement date. In evaluating if the Company can control or gain control of a portfolio company as of the measurement date, the Company takes into account its equity securities on a fully diluted basis, as well as other factors.\nFor non-Control Companies, consistent with ASC 820, the Valuation Committee considers a hypothetical secondary market as the principal market in which it would sell investments in those companies. The Company also considers other valuation methodologies such as the Option Pricing Method and liquidity preferences when valuing minority equity positions of a portfolio company.\nFor loans and debt securities of non-Control Companies (for which the Valuation Committee has identified the hypothetical secondary market as the principal market), the Valuation Committee determines fair value based on the assumptions that a hypothetical market participant would use to value the security in a current hypothetical sale using a market yield (\u201cMarket Yield\u201d) valuation methodology. In applying the Market Yield valuation methodology, the Valuation Committee determines the fair value based on such factors as third party broker quotes (if available) and market participant assumptions, including synthetic credit ratings, estimated remaining life, current market yield and interest rate spreads of similar securities as of the measurement date.\nEstimates of average life are generally based on market data of the average life of similar debt securities. However, if the Valuation Committee has information available to it that the debt security is expected to be repaid in the near term, the Valuation Committee would use an estimated life based on the expected repayment date.\nThe Valuation Committee determines fair value of loan and debt securities of Control Companies based on the estimate of the enterprise value of the portfolio company. To the extent the enterprise value exceeds the remaining principal amount of the loan and all other debt securities of the company, the fair value of such securities is generally estimated to be their cost. However, where the enterprise value is less than the remaining principal amount of the loan and all other debt securities, the Valuation Committee may discount the value of such securities to reflect an impairment.\nFor the Company's or its subsidiary's investment in the PE Fund, for which an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company serves as the general partner (the \u201cGP\u201d) of the PE Fund, the Valuation Committee relies on the GP's determination of the fair value of the PE Fund which will be generally valued, as a practical expedient, utilizing the net asset valuations provided by the GP, which will be made: (i) no less frequently than quarterly as of the Company's fiscal quarter end and (ii) with respect to the valuation of PE Fund investments in portfolio companies, will be based on\nmethodologies consistent with those set forth in the Company's valuation procedures. In making its determinations, the GP considers and generally relies on TTG Advisers' recommendations. The determination of the net asset value of the Company's or its subsidiary's investment in the PE Fund will follow the methodologies described for valuing interests in private investment funds (\u201cInvestment Vehicles\u201d) described below. Additionally, when both the Company and the PE Fund hold investments in the same portfolio company, the GP's Fair Value determination shall be based on the Valuation Committee's determination of the Fair Value of the Company's portfolio security in that portfolio company.\nAs permitted under GAAP, the Company's interests in private investment funds are generally valued, as a practical expedient, utilizing the net asset valuations provided by management of the underlying Investment Vehicles, without adjustment, unless TTG Advisers is aware of information indicating that a value reported does not accurately reflect the value of the Investment Vehicle, including any information showing that the valuation has not been calculated in a manner consistent with GAAP. Net unrealized appreciation (depreciation) of such investments is recorded based on the Company's proportionate share of the aggregate amount of appreciation (depreciation) recorded by each underlying Investment Vehicle. The Company's proportionate investment interest includes its share of interest and dividend income and expense, and realized and unrealized gains and losses on securities held by the underlying Investment Vehicles, net of operating expenses and fees. Realized gains and losses on distributions from Investment Vehicles are generally recognized on a first in, first out basis.\nThe Company applies the practical expedient to interests in Investment Vehicles on an investment by investment basis, and consistently with respect to the Company's entire interest in an investment. The Company may adjust the valuation obtained from an Investment Vehicle with a premium, discount or reserve if it determines that the net asset value is not representative of fair value.\nIf the Company intends to sell all or a portion of its interest in an Investment Vehicle to a third-party in a privately negotiated transaction near the valuation date, the Company will consider offers from third parties to buy the interest in an Investment Vehicle in valuations, which may be discounted for both probability of close and time.\nWhen the Company receives nominal cost warrants or free equity securities (\u201cnominal cost equity\u201d) with a debt security, the Company typically allocates its cost basis in the investment between debt securities and nominal cost equity at the time of origination. If the Company is not reimbursed for investment or transaction related costs at the time an investment is made, the Company typically capitalizes those costs to the cost basis of the investment.\nInterest income, adjusted for amortization of premium and accretion of discount on a yield to maturity methodology, is recorded on an accrual basis to the extent that such amounts are expected to be collected. Origination and/or closing fees associated with investments in portfolio companies are accreted into income over the respective terms of the applicable loans. Upon the prepayment of a loan or debt security, any unamortized original issue discount or market discount is recorded as interest income. Prepayment premiums are recorded on loans when received as interest income. Dividend income, if any, is recognized on an accrual basis on the ex-dividend date to the extent that the Company expects to collect such amounts.\nFor loans, debt securities, and preferred securities with contractual payment-in-kind interest or dividends, which represent contractual interest/dividends accrued and added to the loan balance or liquidation preference that generally becomes due at maturity, the Company will not ascribe value to payment-in-kind interest/dividends, if the portfolio company valuation indicates that the payment-in-kind interest is not collectible. However, the Company may ascribe value to payment-in-kind interest if the health of the portfolio company and the underlying securities are not in question. All payment-in-kind interest that has been added to the principal balance or capitalized is subject to ratification by the Valuation Committee. For interest or deferred interest receivables purchased by the Company at a discount to their outstanding amount, the Company amortizes the discount using the effective yield method and records it as interest income over the life of the loan. The Company will not ascribe value to the interest or deferred interest, if the Company has determined that the interest is not collectible.\nEscrows from the sale of a portfolio company are generally valued at an amount, which may be expected to be received from the buyer under the escrow's various conditions and discounted for both risk and time.\nASC 460, Guarantees, requires the Company to estimate the fair value of the guarantee obligation at its inception and requires the Company to assess whether a probable loss contingency exists in accordance with the requirements of ASC 450, Contingencies. The Valuation Committee typically will look at the pricing of the security in which the guarantee provided support for the security and compare it to the price of a similar or hypothetical security without guarantee support. The difference in pricing will be discounted for time and risk over the period in which the guarantee is expected to remain outstanding.\nInvestment Classification\nWe classify our investments by level of control. As defined in the 1940 Act, \u201cControl Investments\u201d are investments in those companies that we are deemed to \u201cControl.\u201d \u201cAffiliate Investments\u201d are investments in those companies that are \u201cAffiliated Companies\u201d of us, as defined in the 1940 Act, other than Control Investments. \u201cNon-Control/Non-Affiliate Investments\u201d are those that are neither Control Investments nor Affiliate Investments. Generally, under the 1940 Act, we are deemed to control a company in which we have invested if we own 25% or more of the voting securities of such company or have greater than 50% representation on its board. We are deemed to be an affiliate of a company in which we have invested if we own 5% or more and less than 25% of the voting securities of such company.\nInvestment Transactions and Related Operating Income\nInvestment transactions and related revenues and expenses are accounted for on the trade date (the date the order to buy or sell is executed). The cost of securities sold is determined on a first-in, first-out basis, unless otherwise specified. Dividend income and distributions on investment securities is recorded on the ex-dividend date. The tax characteristics of such distributions received from our portfolio companies will be determined by whether or not the distribution was made from the investment's current taxable earnings and profits or accumulated taxable earnings and profits from prior years. Interest income, which includes accretion of discount and amortization of premium, if applicable, is recorded on the accrual basis to the extent that such amounts are expected to be collected. Fee income includes fees for guarantees and services rendered by the Company or its wholly-owned subsidiary to portfolio companies and other third parties such as due diligence,\nstructuring, transaction services, monitoring services, and investment advisory services. Guaranty fees are recognized as income over the related period of the guaranty. Due diligence, structuring, and transaction services fees are generally recognized as income when services are rendered or when the related transactions are completed. Monitoring and investment advisory services fees are generally recognized as income as the services are rendered. Any fee income determined to be loan origination fees is recorded as income at the time that the investment is made and any original issue discount and market discount are capitalized and then amortized into income using the effective interest method. Upon the prepayment of a loan or debt security, any unamortized original issue discount or market discount is recorded as interest income. For investments with PIK interest and dividends, we base income and dividend accrual on the valuation of the PIK notes or securities received from the borrower. If the portfolio company indicates a value of the PIK notes or securities that is not sufficient to cover the contractual interest or dividend, we will not accrue interest or dividend income on the notes or securities.\nCash Equivalents\nFor the purpose of the Consolidated Balance Sheets and Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows, the Company considers all money market and all highly liquid temporary cash investments purchased with an original maturity of less than three months to be cash equivalents. The Company places its cash and cash equivalents with financial institutions and cash held in bank accounts may exceed the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (\u201cFDIC\u201d) insured limit. As of October 31, 2016, the Company had approximately $395,000 in cash equivalents, approximately $800,000 in restricted cash and approximately $19.8 million in cash totaling approximately $21.0 million. Of the $19.8 million in cash, approximately $328,000 was held by MVC Turf and approximately $1.1 million was held by MVC Cayman.\nRestricted Cash and Cash Equivalents\nCash and cash equivalent accounts that are not available to the Company for day-to-day use and are legally restricted are classified as restricted cash. Restricted cash and cash equivalents are carried at cost, which approximates fair value. On April 26, 2011, the Company agreed to collateralize a 5.0 million Euro letter of credit from JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., which is related to a project guarantee by AB DnB NORD bankas to Security Holdings, a portfolio company investment and was classified as restricted cash. The Euro letter of credit was equivalent to approximately $5.5 million at October 31, 2015. During the fiscal year ended October 31, 2016, the Euro letter of credit was released and is no longer collateralized by the Company and released from restricted cash. During the fiscal year ended October 31, 2016, the Company agreed to cash collateralize a $500,000 working capital line of credit for an entity partially owned by MVC Environmental and a $300,000 letter of credit for RuMe, which were classified as restricted cash equivalents on the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nRestricted Securities\nThe Company will invest in privately-placed restricted securities. These securities may be resold in transactions exempt from registration or to the public if the securities are registered. Disposal of these securities may involve time-consuming negotiations and expense, and a prompt sale at an acceptable price may be difficult.\nDistributions to Shareholders\nDistributions to shareholders are recorded on the ex-dividend date.\nIncome Taxes\nIt is the policy of the Company to meet the requirements for qualification as a RIC under Subchapter M of the Code. As a RIC, the Company is not subject to income tax to the extent that it distributes all of its investment company taxable income and net realized capital gains for its taxable year. The Company is also exempt from excise tax if it distributes at least 98% of its income and 98.2% of its capital gains during each calendar year.\nOur consolidated operating subsidiary, MVCFS, is subject to federal and state income tax. We use the liability method in accounting for income taxes. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recorded for temporary differences between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and their reported amounts in the financial statements, using statutory tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse. A valuation allowance is provided against deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized.\nASC 740, Income Taxes, provides guidance for how uncertain tax positions should be recognized, measured, presented and disclosed in the financial statements. ASC 740 requires the evaluation of tax positions taken or expected to be taken in the course of preparing the Company's tax returns to determine whether the tax positions are \u201cmore-likely-than-not\u201d of being sustained by the applicable tax authority. Tax positions deemed to meet a \u201cmore-likely-than-not\u201d threshold would be recorded as a tax benefit or expense in the current period. The Company recognizes interest and penalties, if any, related to unrecognized tax benefits as income tax expense in the consolidated statement of operations. During the fiscal year ended October 31, 2016, the Company did not incur any interest or penalties. Although we file federal and state tax returns, our major tax jurisdiction is federal for the Company and MVCFS. The fiscal years 2013, 2014, 2015 and 2016 for the Company and MVCFS remain subject to examination by federal, state and local tax authorities.", "item_7_text": "ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThis report contains certain statements of a forward-looking nature relating to future events or the future financial performance of the Company and its investment portfolio companies.

Forward-looking statements are included in this report pursuant to the \u201cSafe Harbor\u201d provision of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Such statements are predictions only, and the actual events or results may differ materially from those discussed in the forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include, but are not limited to, those relating to adverse conditions in the U.S. and international economies, competition in the markets in which our portfolio companies operate, investment capital demand, pricing, market acceptance, any changes in the regulatory environments in which we operate, changes in our accounting assumptions that regulatory agencies, including the SEC, may require or that result from changes in the accounting rules or their application, competitive forces, adverse conditions in the credit markets impacting the cost, including interest rates and/or availability of financing, the results of financing and investing efforts, the ability to complete transactions, the inability to implement our business strategies and other risks identified below or in the Company's filings with the SEC. Readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date hereof. The Company undertakes no obligation to publicly revise these forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances occurring after the date hereof or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events. The following analysis of the financial condition and results of operations of the Company should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements, the notes thereto and the other financial information included elsewhere in this report.\nOVERVIEW\nThe Company is an externally managed, non-diversified, closed-end management investment company that has elected to be regulated as a business development company under the 1940 Act. The Company's investment objective is to seek to maximize total return from capital appreciation and/or income, though our current focus is more on yield generating investments.\nOn November 6, 2003, Mr. Tokarz assumed his positions as Chairman and Portfolio Manager of the Company. He and the Company's management team are seeking to implement our investment\nobjective (i.e., to maximize total return from capital appreciation and/or income) through making a broad range of private investments in a variety of industries.\nThe investments can include senior or subordinated loans, convertible debt and convertible preferred securities, common or preferred stock, equity interests, warrants or rights to acquire equity interests and other private equity transactions, among other investments. During the fiscal year ended October 31, 2015, the Company made eight new investments and made 5 follow-on investments in 4 existing portfolio companies committing a total of approximately $62.4 million to these investments. During the fiscal year ended October 31, 2016, the Company made six new and 9 follow-on investments in 6 existing portfolio companies totaling approximately $44.2 million.\nPrior to the adoption of our current investment objective, the Company's investment objective had been to achieve long-term capital appreciation from venture capital investments in information technology companies. The Company's investments had thus previously focused on investments in equity and debt securities of information technology companies. As of October 31, 2016, 1.4% of the current fair value of our assets consisted of Legacy Investments. We are, however, managing these Legacy Investments to try and realize maximum returns. We generally seek to capitalize on opportunities to realize cash returns on these investments when presented with a potential \u201cliquidity event,\u201d i.e., a sale, public offering, merger or other reorganization.\nOur new portfolio investments are made pursuant to our current objective and strategy. We are concentrating our investment efforts on small and middle-market companies that, in our view, provide opportunities to maximize total return from capital appreciation and/or income. More recently, the Company has been focusing its strategy more on yield generating investments. Under our investment approach, we have the authority to invest, without limit, in any one portfolio company, subject to any diversification limits required in order for us to continue to qualify as a RIC under Subchapter M of the Code. Presently, due to our asset growth and composition, compliance with the RIC requirements limits our ability to make Non-Diversified Investments.\nWe participate in the private equity business generally by providing privately negotiated long-term equity and/or debt investment capital to small and middle-market companies. Our financings are generally used to fund growth, buyouts, acquisitions, recapitalizations, note purchases and/or bridge financings. We generally invest in private companies, though, from time to time, we may invest in public companies that may lack adequate access to public capital.\nWe may also seek to achieve our investment objective by establishing a subsidiary or subsidiaries that would serve as general partner to a private equity or other investment fund(s). In fact, during fiscal year 2006, we established MVC Partners for this purpose. Furthermore, the Board of Directors authorized the establishment of a PE Fund, for which an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company serves as the GP and which may raise up to $250 million. On October 29, 2010, through MVC Partners and MVCFS, the Company committed to invest approximately $20.1 million in the PE Fund. The PE Fund closed on approximately $104 million of capital commitments. The Company's Board of Directors authorized the establishment of, and investment in, the PE Fund for a variety of reasons, including the Company's ability to make Non-Diversified Investments through the PE Fund. As previously disclosed, the Company is restricted in its ability to make Non-Diversified Investments. For services provided to the PE Fund, the GP and MVC Partners are together entitled to receive 25% of all management fees and other fees paid by the PE Fund and its portfolio companies and up to 30% of the carried interest generated by the PE Fund. Further, at the direction of the Board of Directors, the GP retained TTG Advisers to serve as the\nportfolio manager of the PE Fund. In exchange for providing those services, and pursuant to the Board of Directors' authorization and direction, TTG Advisers is entitled to receive the balance of the fees and any carried interest generated by the PE Fund and its portfolio companies. Given this separate arrangement with the GP and the PE Fund, under the terms of the Company's Advisory Agreement with TTG Advisers, TTG Advisers is not entitled to receive from the Company a management fee or an incentive fee on assets of the Company that are invested in the PE Fund. During the fiscal year ended October 31, 2012 and thereafter, MVC Partners was consolidated with the operations of the Company as MVC Partners' limited partnership interest in the PE Fund is a substantial portion of MVC Partners operations. Previously, MVC Partners was presented as a portfolio company on the Schedule of Investments. The consolidation of MVC Partners has not had any material effect on the financial position or net results of operations of the Company. Also, during fiscal year ended October 31, 2014, MVC Turf, LLC (\u201cMVC Turf\u201d) was consolidated with the Company as MVC Turf is an MVC wholly-owned holding company. The consolidation of MVC Turf has not had any material effect on the financial position or net results of operations of the Company. Please see Note 2 of our consolidated financial statements \u201cConsolidation\u201d for more information.\nAs a result of the closing of the PE Fund, consistent with the Board-approved policy concerning the allocation of investment opportunities, the PE Fund received a priority allocation of all private equity investments that would otherwise be Non-Diversified Investments for the Company during the PE Fund's investment period that ended on October 28, 2014. Additional capital may be called for follow-on investments in existing portfolio companies of the PE Fund or to pay operating expenses of the PE Fund. For a further discussion of this allocation policy, please see \u201cOur Investment Strategy - Allocation of Investment Opportunities\u201d above.\nAdditionally, in pursuit of our objective, we may acquire a portfolio of existing private equity or debt investments held by financial institutions or other investment funds should such opportunities arise.\nFurthermore, pending investments in portfolio companies pursuant to the Company's principal investment strategy, the Company may invest in certain securities on a short-term or temporary basis. In addition to cash-equivalents and other money market-type investments, such short-term investments may include exchange-traded funds and private investment funds offering periodic liquidity.\nOPERATING INCOME\nFor the Fiscal Years Ended October 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014. Total operating income was $37.4 million for the fiscal year ended October 31, 2016 and $23.7 million for the fiscal year ended October 31, 2015, an increase of $13.7 million. Fiscal year 2015 operating income increased by approximately $3.9 million compared to Fiscal year 2014 operating income of $19.8 million.\nFor the Fiscal Year Ended October 31, 2016\nTotal operating income was $37.4 million for the fiscal year ended October 31, 2016. The increase in operating income over the same period last year was primarily due to an increase in dividend income and fee income from the Company's portfolio companies. The Company earned approximately $32.7 million in interest and dividend income from investments in portfolio companies. Of the $32.7 million recorded in interest/dividend income, $12.5 million was dividend\nincome from U.S. Gas and approximately $4.8 million was \u201cpayment in kind\u201d/deferred interest. The \u201cpayment in kind\u201d/deferred interest is computed at the contractual rate specified in each investment agreement and may be added to the principal balance of each investment. The Company's debt investments yielded annualized rates from 5.0% to 16.0%. The Company also received fee income from asset management of the PE Fund and its portfolio companies totaling approximately $1.4 million and fee income from the Company's portfolio companies of approximately $3.3 million, of which $2.3 million was one-time fee income related to the Ohio Medical sale, totaling approximately $4.7 million in fee income. Of the $1.4 million of fee income from asset management activities, 75% of the income is obligated to be paid to TTG Advisers. However, under the PE Fund's agreements, a significant portion of the portfolio fees that are paid by the PE Fund's portfolio companies to the GP and TTG Advisers is subject to recoupment by the PE Fund in the form of an offset to future management fees paid by the PE Fund.\nFor the Fiscal Year Ended October 31, 2015\nTotal operating income was $23.7 million for the fiscal year ended October 31, 2015. The increase in operating income over the same period last year was primarily due to an increase in interest earned on loans partially offset by a decrease in fee income from asset management and other income. The main component of operating income for the fiscal year ended October 31, 2015 was interest earned on loans. The Company earned approximately $20.4 million in interest and dividend income from investments in portfolio companies. Of the $20.4 million recorded in interest/dividend income, approximately $5.2 million was \u201cpayment in kind\u201d/deferred interest. The \u201cpayment in kind\u201d/deferred interest is computed at the contractual rate specified in each investment agreement and may be added to the principal balance of each investment. The Company's debt investments yielded annualized rates from 9.75% to 16.0%. The Company also received fee income from asset management of the PE Fund and its portfolio companies totaling approximately $1.3 million and fee income from the Company's portfolio companies of approximately $2.0 million, totaling approximately $3.3 million. Of the $1.3 million of fee income from asset management activities, 75% of the income is obligated to be paid to TTG Advisers. However, under the PE Fund's agreements, a significant portion of the portfolio fees that are paid by the PE Fund's portfolio companies to the GP and TTG Advisers is subject to recoupment by the PE Fund in the form of an offset to future management fees paid by the PE Fund.\nFor the Fiscal Year Ended October 31, 2014\nTotal operating income was $19.8 million for the fiscal year ended October 31, 2014. The decrease in operating income over the same period last year was primarily due to a decrease in dividend income from portfolio companies, specifically U.S. Gas (which did not pay a dividend in fiscal 2014, as it did in 2013), which was partially offset by an increase in interest income from portfolio companies. The main components of operating income for the fiscal year ended October 31, 2014 were interest earned on loans and fee income from portfolio companies and asset management. The Company earned approximately $15.3 million in interest and dividend income from investments in portfolio companies. Of the $15.3 million recorded in interest/dividend income, approximately $4.2 million was \u201cpayment in kind\u201d interest/dividends. The \u201cpayment in kind\u201d interest/dividends are computed at the contractual rate specified in each investment agreement and added to the principal balance of each investment. The Company's debt investments yielded rates from 5% to 16%. The Company also received fee income from asset management of the PE Fund and its portfolio companies totaling approximately $1.9 million and fee income from the Company's portfolio companies of approximately $1.6 million, totaling approximately $3.5\nmillion. Of the $1.9 million of fee income from asset management activities, 75% of the income is obligated to be paid to TTG Advisers. However, under the PE Fund's agreements, a significant portion of the portfolio fees that are paid by the PE Fund's portfolio companies to the GP and TTG Advisers is subject to recoupment by the PE Fund in the form of an offset to future management fees paid by the PE Fund.\nOPERATING EXPENSES\nFor the Fiscal Years Ended October 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014. Net Operating expenses were $18.0 million for the fiscal year ended October 31, 2016 and $14.4 million for the fiscal year ended October 31, 2015, an increase of $3.6 million. Fiscal year 2015 operating expenses decreased by approximately $3.8 million compared to Fiscal year 2014 operating expenses of $18.2 million.\nFor the Fiscal Year Ended October 31, 2016\nOperating expenses, net of the Voluntary Waivers (as described below), were approximately $18.02 million or 6.35% of the Company's average net assets for the fiscal year ended October 31, 2016. Significant components of operating expenses for the fiscal year ended October 31, 2016 were interest and other borrowing costs of approximately $10.2 million and management fee expense paid by the Company of approximately $5.7 million, which is net of the voluntary management fee waiver of approximately $1.9 million.\nThe approximately $3.6 million increase in the Company's net operating expenses for the fiscal year ended October 31, 2016 compared to the same period in 2015, was primarily due to the approximately $6.7 million increase in the estimated provision for incentive compensation expense, including a $1.0 million incentive fee waiver for the fiscal year ended October 31, 2016, which was partially offset by an approximately $2.2 million decrease in management fee expense that included a voluntary management fee waiver of approximately $1.9 million. The approximately $1.0 million decrease in audit and tax preparation fees for the fiscal year ended October 31, 2016 compared to the same period in 2015 was due to the delay in filing both the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended October 31, 2015 and the Quarterly Report for the period ended January 31, 2016 and the timing of the work performed by the Company's auditors during the fiscal year ended October 31, 2016. The portfolio fees - asset management are payable to TTG Advisers for monitoring and other customary fees received by the GP from portfolio companies of the PE Fund. To the extent the GP or TTG Advisers receives advisory, monitoring, organization or other customary fees from any portfolio company of the PE Fund or management fees related to the PE Fund, 25% of such fees shall be paid to or retained by the GP and 75% of such fees shall be paid to or retained by TTG Advisers. On October 28, 2016, the Board approved the renewal of the Advisory Agreement for the 2017 fiscal year. Further, the Adviser agreed to continue to waive a portion of the base management fee so that it is reduced to 1.50% for fiscal year 2017. In March 2016, the Adviser agreed to modify its prior agreement to waive, effective November 1, 2015, the first $1.0 million of capital gains incentive fee due under the Advisory Agreement, such that the $1.0 million waiver of incentive fee would be applied to any incentive fee due under the agreement, whether it is a capital gains incentive fee or net operating income incentive fee. Furthermore, the Company and the Adviser, similar to fiscal year 2016, agreed on an expense cap for fiscal 2017 of 3.25% under the Modified Methodology. The amount of any payments made by the GP of the PE Fund to TTG Advisers pursuant to the Portfolio Management Agreement between the GP and TTG Advisers respecting the PE Fund continues to be excluded from the calculation of the Company's expense ratio under the Expense Limitation Agreement. In addition, for fiscal years 2010 through\n2016, TTG Advisers voluntarily agreed to waive $150,000 of expenses that the Company is obligated to reimburse to TTG Advisers under the Advisory Agreement (the \u201cVoluntary Waiver\u201d). TTG Advisers also voluntarily agreed that any assets of the Company that are invested in exchange-traded funds would not be taken into account in the calculation of the base management fee due to TTG Advisers under the Advisory Agreement. As of October 31, 2016, the Company did not have an investment in an exchange traded fund. Under the Modified Methodology, for the fiscal year ended October 31, 2016, the Company's expense ratio was 2.47%, (taking into account the same carve outs as those applicable to the expense cap).\nPursuant to the terms of the Advisory Agreement, during the fiscal year ended October 31, 2016, the provision for incentive compensation was decreased by a net amount of approximately $3.0 million to approximately $1.9 million, including both the net operating income incentive fee and the capital gains incentive fee. The net decrease in the provision for incentive compensation during the fiscal year ended October 31, 2016 primarily reflects the Valuation Committee's determination to decrease the fair values of sixteen of the Company's portfolio investments (Custom Alloy, MVC Automotive, Security Holdings, SGDA Europe, Tekers, Turf, JSC Tekers, RuMe, BAC, Biogenics, Morey's, Ohio Medical, Equus, Legal Solutions, MVC Environmental and Initials) by a total of approximately $32.0 million. The net decrease in the provision also reflects the Valuation Committee's determination to increase the fair values of ten of the Company's portfolio investments (NPWT, Centile, SCSD, Agri-Carriers, RX, U.S. Gas, Advantage, Thunderdome, U.S. Tech and Vestal) by a total of approximately $8.5 million. For the fiscal year ended October 31, 2016, no incentive compensation was paid. For the quarter ended April 30, 2016, a $2.1 million provision was recorded for the net operating income portion of the incentive fee as pre-incentive fee net operating income exceeded the hurdle rate. A $1.0 million incentive fee waiver was recorded during the quarter ended April 30, 2016 resulting in a net $1.1 million provision being recorded for the net operating income portion of the incentive fee. For the quarter ended October 31, 2016, no provision was recorded for the net operating income portion of the incentive fee as pre-incentive fee net operating income for the quarter did not exceed the hurdle rate. Please see Note 5 of our consolidated financial statements \u201cIncentive Compensation\u201d for more information.\nFor the Fiscal Year Ended October 31, 2015\nOperating expenses, net of the Voluntary Waivers (as described below), were approximately $14.4 million or 4.54% of the Company's average net assets for the fiscal year ended October 31, 2015. Significant components of operating expenses for the fiscal year ended October 31, 2015 were interest and other borrowing costs of approximately $10.2 million and management fee expense paid by the Company of approximately $7.8 million.\nThe approximately $3.8 million decrease in the Company's net operating expenses for the fiscal year ended October 31, 2015 compared to the same period in 2014, was primarily due to the approximately $5.0 million decrease in the estimated provision for incentive compensation expense and approximately $836,000 decrease in management fees, which was partially offset by an increase in interest and other borrowing costs of approximately $788,000 and an increase in audit and tax preparation fees, which was due to the fiscal year 2014 restatements and related expenses, totaling $836,000. The portfolio fees - asset management are payable to TTG Advisers for monitoring and other customary fees received by the GP from portfolio companies of the PE Fund. To the extent the GP or TTG Advisers receives advisory, monitoring, organization or other customary fees from any portfolio company of the PE Fund or management fees related to the PE\nFund, 25% of such fees shall be paid to or retained by the GP and 75% of such fees shall be paid to or retained by TTG Advisers. For the 2015 fiscal year, TTG Advisers voluntarily agreed to waive $150,000 of expenses that the Company is obligated to reimburse to TTG Advisers under the Advisory Agreement (the \u201cVoluntary Waiver\u201d). TTG Advisers voluntarily agreed that any assets of the Company that were invested in exchange-traded funds would not be taken into account in the calculation of the base management fee due to TTG Advisers under the Advisory Agreement. TTG Advisers has voluntarily agreed to waive any management fees on the Company's assets invested in Equus common stock. The Company and the Adviser have agreed to continue the expense cap of 3.5% (on consolidated expenses of the Company, including any amounts payable to TTG Advisers under the base management fee, but excluding the amount of any interest and other direct borrowing costs, taxes, incentive compensation, payments made by the GP of the PE Fund to TTG Advisers pursuant to the Portfolio Management Agreement between the GP and TTG Advisers respecting the PE Fund and extraordinary expenses taken as a percentage of the Company's average net assets) into fiscal year 2015, though they modified the methodology so that the cap is applied to limit the Company's ratio of expenses to total assets less cash (the \u201cModified Methodology\u201d), consistent with the asset level used to calculate the base management fee. (The expenses covered by the cap remain unchanged.) Under the Modified Methodology, for the fiscal year ended October 31, 2015, the Company's expense ratio was 3.21% (taking into account the same carve outs as those applicable to the expense cap).\nPursuant to the terms of the Advisory Agreement, during the fiscal year ended October 31, 2015, the provision for incentive compensation was decreased by a net amount of approximately $9.7 million to approximately $5.0 million. The net decrease in the provision for incentive compensation during the fiscal year ended October 31, 2015 primarily reflects the Valuation Committee's determination to decrease the fair values of sixteen of the Company's portfolio investments (Custom Alloy, NPWT, BAC, Tekers, PrePaid Legal, Centile, Biovation, Inland, MVC Automotive, Ohio Medical, SGDA Europe, Security Holdings, JSC Tekers, Morey's, Velocitius and Equus) by a total of approximately $58.2 million. The net decrease in the provision also reflects the Valuation Committee's determination to increase the fair values of five of the Company's portfolio investments (Turf, RuMe, Biogenic, Advantage Insurance and SCSD) by a total of approximately $4.3 million. The Valuation Committee also increased the fair value of the Ohio Medical series C convertible preferred stock by approximately $4.7 million due to a PIK distribution, which was treated as a return of capital. For the fiscal year ended October 31, 2015, no incentive compensation fee was paid. Also, for the fiscal year ended October 31, 2015, no provision was recorded for the net operating income portion of the incentive fee as pre-incentive fee net operating income did not exceed the hurdle rate. Please see Note 5 of our consolidated financial statements \u201cIncentive Compensation\u201d for more information.\nFor the Fiscal Year Ended October 31, 2014\nOperating expenses, net of the Voluntary Waivers (as described below), were approximately $18.2 million or 5.04% of the Company's average net assets, for the fiscal year ended October 31, 2014. Significant components of operating expenses for the fiscal year ended October 31, 2014 were management fee expense paid by the Company of approximately $8.7 million and interest and other borrowing costs of approximately $9.4 million.\nThe approximately $5.1 million decrease in the Company's net operating expenses for the fiscal year ended October 31, 2014 compared to the fiscal year ended October 31, 2013, was primarily due to the approximately $8.6 million decrease in the estimated provision for incentive\ncompensation expense, which was partially offset by an increase in interest and other borrowing costs of approximately $2.7 million and an increase in the Company's management fee expense of approximately $849,000. The portfolio fees - asset management are payable to TTG Advisers for monitoring and other customary fees received by the GP from portfolio companies of the PE Fund. To the extent the GP or TTG Advisers receives advisory, monitoring, organization or other customary fees from any portfolio company of the PE Fund or management fees related to the PE Fund, 25% of such fees shall be paid to or retained by the GP and 75% of such fees shall be paid to or retained by TTG Advisers. For the 2011 through 2015 fiscal years, TTG Advisers voluntarily agreed to waive $150,000 of expenses that the Company is obligated to reimburse to TTG Advisers under the Advisory Agreement (the \u201cVoluntary Waiver\u201d). TTG Advisers voluntarily agreed that any assets of the Company that were invested in exchange-traded funds would not be taken into account in the calculation of the base management fee due to TTG Advisers under the Advisory Agreement. TTG Advisers has voluntarily agreed to waive any management fees on the Company's assets invested in Equus common stock. The Company and the Adviser agreed to continue the expense cap of 3.5% (on consolidated expenses of the Company, including any amounts payable to TTG Advisers under the base management fee, but excluding the amount of any interest and other direct borrowing costs, taxes, incentive compensation, payments made by the GP of the PE Fund to TTG Advisers pursuant to the Portfolio Management Agreement between the GP and TTG Advisers respecting the PE Fund and extraordinary expenses taken as a percentage of the Company's average net assets) into fiscal year 2015, though they reserved the ability to revise the calculation methodology later that year. For the fiscal year ended October 31, 2014, no incentive compensation fee was paid. Also, for fiscal year 2013 and fiscal year 2014, the Company's expense ratio was 3.03% and 3.37%, respectively, (taking into account the same carve outs as those applicable to the expense cap).\nPursuant to the terms of the Advisory Agreement, during the fiscal year ended October 31, 2014, the provision for incentive compensation was decreased by a net amount of approximately $4.7 million to approximately $14.7 million. The net decrease in the provision for incentive compensation during the fiscal year ended October 31, 2014 primarily reflects the Valuation Committee's determination to decrease the fair values of eleven of the Company's portfolio investments (MVC Automotive, G3K, Ohio Medical, NPWT, U.S. Gas, Velocitius, Octagon, Tekers, JSC Tekers, SGDA Europe and Biovation) by a total of approximately $40.7 million. The net decrease in the provision also reflects the Valuation Committee's determination to increase the fair values of twelve of the Company's portfolio investments (Custom Alloy, Advantage, Biogenic, PrePaid Legal, RuMe, Freshii USA, Inc. (\u201cFreshii\u201d), Centile, Security Holdings, Summit, Morey's, Turf and Vestal) by a total of approximately $11.5 million.

As such, the balance of the guarantee as of October 31, 2016 is approximately 5.7 million Euro (equivalent to approximately $6.3 million).\nThe Company guaranteed $1.0 million of Turf's indebtedness to Berkshire Bank, which had a fair value of approximately -$13,000 or a liability of $13,000 as of October 31, 2016.\nThe Company guaranteed $1.0 million of RuMe's indebtedness to Colorado Business Bank, which had a fair value of approximately -$278,000 or negative $278,000 as of October 31, 2016.\nOn March 31, 2010, the Company pledged its Series I and Series J preferred stock of U.S. Gas to Macquarie Energy, LLC (\u201cMacquarie Energy\u201d) as collateral for Macquarie Energy's trade supply credit facility to U.S. Gas.\nOn October 29, 2010, through MVC Partners and MVCFS, the Company committed to invest approximately $20.1 million in the PE Fund, for which an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company serves as GP. The PE Fund closed on approximately $104 million of capital commitments. During the fiscal year ended October 31, 2012 and thereafter, MVC Partners was consolidated with the operations of the Company as MVC Partners' limited partnership interest in the PE Fund is a substantial portion of MVC Partners operations. The investment period related to the PE Fund has ended. Additional capital may be called for follow-on investments in existing portfolio companies of the PE Fund or to pay operating expenses of the PE Fund. As of October 31, 2016, $14.6 million of the Company's commitment has been contributed.\nOn April 26, 2011, the Company agreed to collateralize a 5.0 million Euro letter of credit from JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., which is related to a project guarantee by AB DnB NORD bankas to Security Holdings, a portfolio company investment, and was classified as restricted cash equivalents on the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheets. The Euro letter of credit was equivalent to approximately $5.5 million at October 31, 2015. During the fiscal year ended October 31, 2016, the Euro letter of credit was released and is no longer collateralized by the Company and released from restricted cash equivalents.\nDuring the fiscal year ended October 31, 2016, the Company agreed to cash collateralize a $500,000 working capital line of credit for an entity partially owned by MVC Environmental provided by Branch Banking and Trust Company (\u201cBB&T\u201d).\nDuring the fiscal year ended October 31, 2016, the Company agreed to cash collateralize a $300,000 third party working capital line of credit for RuMe.\nCommitments of the Company\nOn February 19, 2013, the Company sold $70.0 million of senior unsecured notes (the \u201cSenior Notes\u201d) in a public offering. The Senior Notes will mature on January 15, 2023 and may be redeemed in whole or in part at any time or from time to time at the Company's option on or after April 15, 2016. The Senior Notes bear interest at a rate of 7.25% per year payable quarterly on January 15, April 15, July 15, and October 15 of each year, beginning April 15, 2013. The Company had also granted the underwriters a 30-day option to purchase up to an additional $10.5 million of Senior Notes to cover overallotments. The additional $10.5 million in principal was purchased and the total principal amount of the Senior Notes totaled $80.5 million. The net proceeds to the Company from the sale of the Senior Notes, after offering expenses, were approximately $77.4 million. The offering expenses incurred are amortized over the term of the Senior Notes.\nOn February 26, 2013, the Company received the funds related to the Senior Notes offering, net of expenses, and subsequently repaid the credit facility (the \u201cCredit Facility\u201d) with Guggenheim as administrative agent for the lenders in full, including all accrued interest. The Company used the excess net proceeds after the repayment of the Credit Facility for general corporate purposes, including, for example, investing in portfolio companies according to our investment objective and strategy, repurchasing shares pursuant to the share repurchase program adopted by our Board of Directors, funding distributions, and/or funding the activities of our subsidiaries.\nOn May 3, 2013, the Company sold approximately $33.9 million of additional Senior Notes in a direct offering. The additional Senior Notes will also mature on January 15, 2023 and may be redeemed in whole or in part at any time or from time to time at the Company's option on or after April 15, 2016. The Notes bear interest at a rate of 7.25% per year payable quarterly on January 15, April 15, July 15, and October 15 of each year. As of October 31, 2016, the total outstanding amount of the Senior Notes was approximately $114.4 million with a market value of approximately $116.6 million. The market value of the Senior Notes is based on the closing price of the security as of October 31, 2016 on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE:MVCB).\nOn July 31, 2013, the Company entered into a one-year, $50 million revolving credit facility (\u201cCredit Facility II\u201d) with BB&T. On January 31, 2014, Credit Facility II was increased to a $100 million revolving credit facility. At October 31, 2015, the balance of Credit Facility II was $90.0 million. On December 1, 2015, Credit Facility II was renewed and expired on May 31, 2016, at which time all outstanding amounts under it were due and repaid. On June 30, 2016, Credit Facility II was renewed and reduced to a $50 million revolving credit facility, which expires on February 28, 2017. During the fiscal year ended October 31, 2016, the Company's net borrowings on Credit Facility II were $35.0 million, resulting in an outstanding balance of $35.0 million at October 31, 2016. See \u201cSubsequent Events\u201d for more information. Credit Facility II is used to provide the Company with better overall financial flexibility in managing its investment portfolio. Borrowings under Credit Facility II bear interest at LIBOR plus 125 basis points. In addition, the Company is also subject to a 25 basis point commitment fee for the average amount of Credit Facility II that is unused during each fiscal quarter. The Company paid closing fees, legal and other costs associated with these transactions. These costs will be amortized over the life of the facility. Borrowings under Credit Facility II will be secured by cash, short-term and long-term U.S. Treasury securities and other governmental agency securities. The Company received waivers from BB&T with respect to the delivery of financial reports required under Credit Facility II, due to the Company's delayed filing of certain prior annual and quarterly reports.\nOn December 30, 2014, the Company entered into a 6 month, $25.0 million bridge loan (\u201cBridge Loan\u201d) with Firstrust Bank. Prior to maturity, the Bridge Loan was extended to December 31, 2015. At October 31, 2015, the balance of the Bridge Loan was $8.0 million. During the fiscal year ended October 31, 2016, the Bridge Loan was repaid in full. On December 9, 2015, the Bridge Loan was replaced with Credit Facility III (as described below). Borrowings under the Bridge Loan bore interest at 5%. The Company paid closing fees, legal and other costs associated with the transaction. These costs were amortized over the life of the Bridge Loan. The Company received extensions from Firstrust Bank as to the delivery of financial reports required under the Amended and Restated Loan Agreement, due to the Company's delayed quarterly filings.\nOn December 9, 2015, the Company entered into a three-year, $50 million revolving borrowing base credit facility (\u201cCredit Facility III\u201d) with Santander Bank N.A. as a lender and lead agent and Wintrust Bank as a lender and syndication agent. As of October 31, 2016, there was no\noutstanding balance on Credit Facility III. Credit Facility III can, under certain conditions, be increased up to $85 million. The new facility bears an interest rate of LIBOR plus 3.75% or the prime rate plus 1% (at the Company's option), and includes a 1% closing fee of the commitment amount and a 0.75% unused fee. The compensating balance for the revolving credit facility is $10.0 million. The Company received extensions from Santander Bank N.A. related to its delayed quarterly filings, including the quarterly filing for the period ended April 30, 2016.\nThe Company enters into contracts with portfolio companies and other parties that contain a variety of indemnifications. The Company's maximum exposure under these arrangements is unknown. However, the Company has not experienced claims or losses pursuant to these contracts and believes the risk of loss related to indemnifications to be remote.\nSUBSEQUENT EVENTS\nOn November 9, 2016, the Company invested $59,000 in MVC Environmental and received an additional 30 shares of common stock.\nOn November 21, 2016, the Company repaid Credit Facility II in full, including all accrued interest.\nOn December 1, 2016, the Company loaned an additional $500,000 to U.S. Technologies increasing the total amount outstanding to $5.5 million.\nOn December 13, 2016, the Company loaned an additional $475,000 to MVC Automotive increasing the amount outstanding on the bridge loan to approximately $3.8 million. The maturity date was also extended to December 31, 2017.\nOn December 23, 2016, the Company received proceeds of approximately $12.2 million from the PE Fund related to the sale of AccuMed Corp., a portfolio company of the PE Fund. The Company's pro-rata share of the PE Fund's investment in AccuMed Corp. totaled approximately $2.4 million. Assuming full receipt of escrow proceeds, the Company expects to receive an additional $1.2 million for a total of $13.4 million.\nSIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES\nThe following is a summary of significant accounting policies followed by the Company in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements:\nThe preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Actual results could differ from those estimates.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nIn May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (\u201cFASB\u201d) issued Accounting Standards Update (\u201cASU\u201d) No. 2014-09, \u201cRevenue from Contracts with Customers\u201d (Topic 606). ASU 2014-09 addresses the reporting of revenue by most entities and will replace most existing revenue recognition guidance in U.S. GAAP when it becomes effective. In August 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-14 that defers the effective date of ASU 2014-09 for public business entities for\nannual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods therein. Early application is not permitted for public business entities. The Company is currently assessing the impact of this guidance.\nIn August 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-15, \u201cPresentation of Financial Statements - Going Concern (Subtopic 205-40): Disclosure of Uncertainties about an Entity's Ability to Continue as a Going Concern\u201d (\u201cASU 2014-15\u201d). The standard requires management to evaluate, at each interim and annual reporting period, whether there are conditions or events that raise substantial doubt about the entity's ability to continue as a going concern within one year after the date the financial statements are issued, and provide related disclosures. ASU 2014-15 is effective for annual periods ending after December 15, 2016, and for annual and interim periods thereafter, and early adoption is permitted. The Company is currently assessing the impact of this guidance.\nIn February 2015, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update 2015-02, which updated consolidation standards under ASC Topic 810, \u201cConsolidation\u201d. Under this update, a new consolidation analysis is required for variable interest entities (\u201cVIEs\u201d) and will limit the circumstances in which investment managers and similar entities are required to consolidate the entities that they manage. The FASB decided to eliminate some of the criteria under which their fees are considered a variable interest and limit the circumstances in which variable interests in a VIE held by related parties of a reporting enterprise require the reporting enterprise to consolidate the VIE. The guidance is effective for public business entities for annual and interim periods in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2015. This update has had no impact on the Company's financial condition or results of operations.\nIn April 2015, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update 2015-03, Interest-Imputation of Interest (Subtopic 835-30): Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs. Under this guidance, debt issuance costs related to a recognized debt liability are to be presented as a direct deduction from the debt liability rather than as an asset on the balance sheet, consistent with debt discounts. The guidance is effective for public business entities for annual and interim periods in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2015. The Company is currently assessing the impact of this guidance.\nIn May 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-07, Fair Value Measurement (Topic 820): Disclosures for Investments in Certain Entities that Calculate Net Asset Value per Share (or Its Equivalent). The new guidance removes the requirement that investments for which NAV is determined based on practical expedient reliance be reported utilizing the fair value hierarchy. The guidance is effective for public business entities for annual and interim periods in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2015. The Company is currently assessing the impact of this guidance.\nIn November 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-17, which requires deferred tax liabilities and assets to be classified as non-current in a classified statement of financial condition. The amendments are effective for all entities for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2016. Early adoption is permitted. The Company is currently assessing the impact of this guidance.\nIn August 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-15, Statement of Cash Flows - Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments (Topic 230). The amendments provide guidance on eight specific cash flow issues in how certain cash receipts and cash payments are presented and\nclassified in the statement of cash flows with the objective of reducing the existing diversity in practice. The amendments are effective for all entities for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2017. Early adoption is permitted. The Company is currently assessing the impact of this guidance.\nIn October 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-17, to amend the consolidation guidance on how a reporting entity that is the single decision maker of a VIE should treat indirect interests in the entity held through related parties that are under common control with the reporting entity when determining whether it is the primary beneficiary of that VIE. The ASU is effective for public business entities for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim periods within those fiscal years. The Company is currently assessing the impact of this guidance.\nIn November 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-18, Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Restricted Cash. The amendments in this Update require that a statement of cash flows explain the change during the period in the total of cash, cash equivalents, and amounts generally described as restricted cash or restricted cash equivalents. The ASU is effective for public business entities for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within those fiscal years. The Company is currently assessing the impact of this guidance.\nTax Status and Capital Loss Carryforwards\nAs a RIC, the Company is not subject to federal income tax to the extent that it distributes all of its investment company taxable income and net realized capital gains for its taxable year (see Notes 12 \u201cTax Matters\u201d and Note 13 \u201cIncome Taxes\u201d of our notes to the consolidated financial statements). This allows us to attract different kinds of investors than other publicly held corporations. The Company is also exempt from excise tax if it distributes at least (1) 98% of its ordinary income during each calendar year, (2) 98.2% of its capital gains realized in the period from November 1 of the prior year through October 31 of the current year, and (3) all such ordinary income and capital gains for previous years that were not distributed during those years. On October 31, 2016, the Company had a net capital loss carryforward of approximately $50.2 million. The Company also had approximately $18.0 million in unrealized losses associated with Legacy Investments as of October 31, 2016.\nValuation of Portfolio Securities\nPursuant to the requirements of the 1940 Act and in accordance with the Accounting Standards Codification (\u201cASC\u201d), Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures (\u201cASC 820\u201d), we value our portfolio securities at their current market values or, if market quotations are not readily available, at their estimates of fair values. Because our portfolio company investments generally do not have readily ascertainable market values, we record these investments at fair value in accordance with our Valuation Procedures adopted by the Board of Directors, which are consistent with ASC 820. As permitted by the SEC, the Board of Directors has delegated the responsibility of making fair value determinations to its Valuation Committee, subject to the Board of Directors' supervision and pursuant to our Valuation Procedures. Our Board of Directors may also hire independent consultants to review our Valuation Procedures or to conduct an independent valuation of one or more of our portfolio investments. In this regard, the Company has engaged an independent valuation firm to perform valuation services for certain portfolio debt investments.\nPursuant to our Valuation Procedures, the Valuation Committee (which is comprised of three Independent Directors) determines fair values of portfolio company investments on a quarterly basis (or more frequently, if deemed appropriate under the circumstances). In doing so, the Committee considers the recommendations of TTG Advisers and input and reviews by third party consultants retained to support the Company's valuation process. The Company has also adopted other enhanced processes related to valuations of controlled/affiliated portfolio companies. Any changes in valuation are recorded in the consolidated statements of operations as \u201cNet unrealized appreciation (depreciation) on investments.\u201d\nCurrently, our NAV per share is calculated and published on a quarterly basis. The Company calculates our NAV per share by subtracting all liabilities from the total value of our portfolio securities and other assets and dividing the result by the total number of outstanding shares of our common stock on the date of valuation. Fair values of foreign investments reflect exchange rates, as applicable, in effect on the last business day of the quarter end. Exchange rates fluctuate on a daily basis, sometimes significantly. Exchange rate fluctuations following the most recent fiscal year end are not reflected in the valuations reported in this Annual Report. See Item 1A Risk Factor, \u201cInvestments in foreign debt or equity may involve significant risks in addition to the risks inherent in U.S. investments.\u201d\nAt October 31, 2016, approximately 80.97% of total assets represented investments in portfolio companies recorded at fair value (\u201cFair Value Investments\u201d).\nUnder most circumstances, at the time of acquisition, Fair Value Investments are carried at cost (absent the existence of conditions warranting, in management's and the Valuation Committee's view, a different initial value). During the period that an investment is held by the Company, its original cost may cease to approximate fair value as the result of market and investment specific factors. No pre-determined formula can be applied to determine fair value. Rather, the Valuation Committee analyzes fair value measurements based on the value at which the securities of the portfolio company could be sold in an orderly disposition over a reasonable period of time between willing parties, other than in a forced or liquidation sale. The liquidity event whereby the Company ultimately exits an investment is generally the sale, the merger, or the recapitalization of a portfolio company or by a public offering of its securities.\nValuation Methodology\nThere is no one methodology to determine fair value and, in fact, for any portfolio security, fair value may be expressed as a range of values, from which the Company derives a single estimate of fair value. To determine the fair value of a portfolio security, the Valuation Committee analyzes the portfolio company's financial results and projections, publicly traded comparable companies when available, comparable private transactions when available, precedent transactions in the market when available, third-party real estate and asset appraisals if appropriate and available, discounted cash flow analysis, if appropriate, as well as other factors. The Company generally requires, where practicable, Portfolio Companies to provide annual audited and more regular unaudited financial statements, and/or annual projections for the upcoming fiscal year.\nThe fair value of our portfolio securities is inherently subjective. Because of the inherent uncertainty of fair valuation of portfolio securities and escrow receivables that do not have readily ascertainable market values, our estimate of fair value may significantly differ from the value that would have been used had a ready market existed for the securities. Such values also do not reflect\nbrokers' fees or other selling costs, which might become payable on disposition of such investments.\nASC 820 provides a framework for measuring the fair value of assets and liabilities and provides guidance regarding a fair value hierarchy, which prioritizes information used to measure value. In determining fair value, the Valuation Committee primarily uses the level 3 inputs referenced in ASC 820.\nASC 820 defines fair value in terms of the price that would be received upon the sale of an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. The price used to measure the fair value is not adjusted for transaction costs while the cost basis of our investments may include initial transaction costs. Under ASC 820, the fair value measurement also assumes that the transaction to sell an asset occurs in the principal market for the asset or, in the absence of a principal market, the most advantageous market for the asset. The principal market is the market in which the reporting entity would sell or transfer the asset with the greatest volume and level of activity for the asset to which the reporting entity has access to as of the measurement date. If no market for the asset exists or if the reporting entity does not have access to the principal market, the reporting entity should use a hypothetical market.\nOur investments are carried at fair value in accordance with ASC 820. Unrestricted minority-owned publicly traded securities for which market quotations are readily available are valued at the closing market quote on the valuation date and majority-owned publicly traded securities and other privately held securities are valued as determined in good faith by the Valuation Committee of the Board of Directors. For legally or contractually restricted securities of companies that are publicly traded, the value is based on the closing market quote on the valuation date minus a discount for the restriction. At October 31, 2016, we did not own restricted or unrestricted securities of any publicly traded company in which we have a majority-owned interest, but did own one security in which we have a minority-owned interest.\nIf a security is publicly traded, the fair value is generally equal to the market value based on the closing price on the principal exchange on which the security is primarily traded, unless the security is restricted and in such a case, a discount is applied for the restriction.\nFor equity securities of Portfolio Companies, the Valuation Committee estimates the fair value based on market and/or income approach with value then attributed to equity or equity like securities using the enterprise value waterfall (\u201cEnterprise Value Waterfall\u201d) valuation methodology. Under the Enterprise Value Waterfall valuation methodology, the Valuation Committee estimates the enterprise fair value of the portfolio company and then waterfalls the enterprise value over the portfolio company's securities in order of their preference relative to one another. To assess the enterprise value of the portfolio company, the Valuation Committee weighs some or all of the traditional market valuation methods and factors based on the individual circumstances of the portfolio company in order to estimate the enterprise value. The methodologies for performing assets may be based on, among other things: valuations of comparable public companies, recent sales of private and public comparable companies, discounting the forecasted cash flows of the portfolio company, third party valuations of the portfolio company, considering offers from third parties to buy the company, estimating the value to potential strategic buyers and considering the value of recent investments in the equity securities of the portfolio company, and third-party asset and real estate appraisals. For non-performing assets, the Valuation Committee may estimate the liquidation or collateral value of the portfolio\ncompany's assets. The Valuation Committee also takes into account historical and anticipated financial results.\nThe Company does not utilize hedge accounting and instead, when applicable, marks its derivatives to market on the Company's consolidated statement of operations.\nIn assessing enterprise value, the Valuation Committee considers the mergers and acquisitions (\u201cM&A\u201d) market as the principal market in which the Company would sell its investments in portfolio companies under circumstances where the Company has the ability to control or gain control of the board of directors of the portfolio company (\u201cControl Companies\u201d). This approach is consistent with the principal market that the Company would use for its portfolio companies if the Company has the ability to initiate a sale of the portfolio company as of the measurement date, i.e., if it has the ability to control or gain control of the board of directors of the portfolio company as of the measurement date. In evaluating if the Company can control or gain control of a portfolio company as of the measurement date, the Company takes into account its equity securities on a fully diluted basis, as well as other factors.\nFor non-Control Companies, consistent with ASC 820, the Valuation Committee considers a hypothetical secondary market as the principal market in which it would sell investments in those companies. The Company also considers other valuation methodologies such as the Option Pricing Method and liquidity preferences when valuing minority equity positions of a portfolio company.\nFor loans and debt securities of non-Control Companies (for which the Valuation Committee has identified the hypothetical secondary market as the principal market), the Valuation Committee determines fair value based on the assumptions that a hypothetical market participant would use to value the security in a current hypothetical sale using a market yield (\u201cMarket Yield\u201d) valuation methodology. In applying the Market Yield valuation methodology, the Valuation Committee determines the fair value based on such factors as third party broker quotes (if available) and market participant assumptions, including synthetic credit ratings, estimated remaining life, current market yield and interest rate spreads of similar securities as of the measurement date.\nEstimates of average life are generally based on market data of the average life of similar debt securities. However, if the Valuation Committee has information available to it that the debt security is expected to be repaid in the near term, the Valuation Committee would use an estimated life based on the expected repayment date.\nThe Valuation Committee determines fair value of loan and debt securities of Control Companies based on the estimate of the enterprise value of the portfolio company. To the extent the enterprise value exceeds the remaining principal amount of the loan and all other debt securities of the company, the fair value of such securities is generally estimated to be their cost. However, where the enterprise value is less than the remaining principal amount of the loan and all other debt securities, the Valuation Committee may discount the value of such securities to reflect an impairment.\nFor the Company's or its subsidiary's investment in the PE Fund, for which an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company serves as the general partner (the \u201cGP\u201d) of the PE Fund, the Valuation Committee relies on the GP's determination of the fair value of the PE Fund which will be generally valued, as a practical expedient, utilizing the net asset valuations provided by the GP, which will be made: (i) no less frequently than quarterly as of the Company's fiscal quarter end and (ii) with respect to the valuation of PE Fund investments in portfolio companies, will be based on\nmethodologies consistent with those set forth in the Company's valuation procedures. In making its determinations, the GP considers and generally relies on TTG Advisers' recommendations. The determination of the net asset value of the Company's or its subsidiary's investment in the PE Fund will follow the methodologies described for valuing interests in private investment funds (\u201cInvestment Vehicles\u201d) described below. Additionally, when both the Company and the PE Fund hold investments in the same portfolio company, the GP's Fair Value determination shall be based on the Valuation Committee's determination of the Fair Value of the Company's portfolio security in that portfolio company.\nAs permitted under GAAP, the Company's interests in private investment funds are generally valued, as a practical expedient, utilizing the net asset valuations provided by management of the underlying Investment Vehicles, without adjustment, unless TTG Advisers is aware of information indicating that a value reported does not accurately reflect the value of the Investment Vehicle, including any information showing that the valuation has not been calculated in a manner consistent with GAAP. Net unrealized appreciation (depreciation) of such investments is recorded based on the Company's proportionate share of the aggregate amount of appreciation (depreciation) recorded by each underlying Investment Vehicle. The Company's proportionate investment interest includes its share of interest and dividend income and expense, and realized and unrealized gains and losses on securities held by the underlying Investment Vehicles, net of operating expenses and fees. Realized gains and losses on distributions from Investment Vehicles are generally recognized on a first in, first out basis.\nThe Company applies the practical expedient to interests in Investment Vehicles on an investment by investment basis, and consistently with respect to the Company's entire interest in an investment. The Company may adjust the valuation obtained from an Investment Vehicle with a premium, discount or reserve if it determines that the net asset value is not representative of fair value.\nIf the Company intends to sell all or a portion of its interest in an Investment Vehicle to a third-party in a privately negotiated transaction near the valuation date, the Company will consider offers from third parties to buy the interest in an Investment Vehicle in valuations, which may be discounted for both probability of close and time.\nWhen the Company receives nominal cost warrants or free equity securities (\u201cnominal cost equity\u201d) with a debt security, the Company typically allocates its cost basis in the investment between debt securities and nominal cost equity at the time of origination. If the Company is not reimbursed for investment or transaction related costs at the time an investment is made, the Company typically capitalizes those costs to the cost basis of the investment.\nInterest income, adjusted for amortization of premium and accretion of discount on a yield to maturity methodology, is recorded on an accrual basis to the extent that such amounts are expected to be collected. Origination and/or closing fees associated with investments in portfolio companies are accreted into income over the respective terms of the applicable loans. Upon the prepayment of a loan or debt security, any unamortized original issue discount or market discount is recorded as interest income. Prepayment premiums are recorded on loans when received as interest income. Dividend income, if any, is recognized on an accrual basis on the ex-dividend date to the extent that the Company expects to collect such amounts.\nFor loans, debt securities, and preferred securities with contractual payment-in-kind interest or dividends, which represent contractual interest/dividends accrued and added to the loan balance or liquidation preference that generally becomes due at maturity, the Company will not ascribe value to payment-in-kind interest/dividends, if the portfolio company valuation indicates that the payment-in-kind interest is not collectible. However, the Company may ascribe value to payment-in-kind interest if the health of the portfolio company and the underlying securities are not in question. All payment-in-kind interest that has been added to the principal balance or capitalized is subject to ratification by the Valuation Committee. For interest or deferred interest receivables purchased by the Company at a discount to their outstanding amount, the Company amortizes the discount using the effective yield method and records it as interest income over the life of the loan. The Company will not ascribe value to the interest or deferred interest, if the Company has determined that the interest is not collectible.\nEscrows from the sale of a portfolio company are generally valued at an amount, which may be expected to be received from the buyer under the escrow's various conditions and discounted for both risk and time.\nASC 460, Guarantees, requires the Company to estimate the fair value of the guarantee obligation at its inception and requires the Company to assess whether a probable loss contingency exists in accordance with the requirements of ASC 450, Contingencies. The Valuation Committee typically will look at the pricing of the security in which the guarantee provided support for the security and compare it to the price of a similar or hypothetical security without guarantee support. The difference in pricing will be discounted for time and risk over the period in which the guarantee is expected to remain outstanding.\nInvestment Classification\nWe classify our investments by level of control. As defined in the 1940 Act, \u201cControl Investments\u201d are investments in those companies that we are deemed to \u201cControl.\u201d \u201cAffiliate Investments\u201d are investments in those companies that are \u201cAffiliated Companies\u201d of us, as defined in the 1940 Act, other than Control Investments. \u201cNon-Control/Non-Affiliate Investments\u201d are those that are neither Control Investments nor Affiliate Investments. Generally, under the 1940 Act, we are deemed to control a company in which we have invested if we own 25% or more of the voting securities of such company or have greater than 50% representation on its board. We are deemed to be an affiliate of a company in which we have invested if we own 5% or more and less than 25% of the voting securities of such company.\nInvestment Transactions and Related Operating Income\nInvestment transactions and related revenues and expenses are accounted for on the trade date (the date the order to buy or sell is executed). The cost of securities sold is determined on a first-in, first-out basis, unless otherwise specified. Dividend income and distributions on investment securities is recorded on the ex-dividend date. The tax characteristics of such distributions received from our portfolio companies will be determined by whether or not the distribution was made from the investment's current taxable earnings and profits or accumulated taxable earnings and profits from prior years. Interest income, which includes accretion of discount and amortization of premium, if applicable, is recorded on the accrual basis to the extent that such amounts are expected to be collected. Fee income includes fees for guarantees and services rendered by the Company or its wholly-owned subsidiary to portfolio companies and other third parties such as due diligence,\nstructuring, transaction services, monitoring services, and investment advisory services. Guaranty fees are recognized as income over the related period of the guaranty. Due diligence, structuring, and transaction services fees are generally recognized as income when services are rendered or when the related transactions are completed. Monitoring and investment advisory services fees are generally recognized as income as the services are rendered. Any fee income determined to be loan origination fees is recorded as income at the time that the investment is made and any original issue discount and market discount are capitalized and then amortized into income using the effective interest method. Upon the prepayment of a loan or debt security, any unamortized original issue discount or market discount is recorded as interest income. For investments with PIK interest and dividends, we base income and dividend accrual on the valuation of the PIK notes or securities received from the borrower. If the portfolio company indicates a value of the PIK notes or securities that is not sufficient to cover the contractual interest or dividend, we will not accrue interest or dividend income on the notes or securities.\nCash Equivalents\nFor the purpose of the Consolidated Balance Sheets and Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows, the Company considers all money market and all highly liquid temporary cash investments purchased with an original maturity of less than three months to be cash equivalents. The Company places its cash and cash equivalents with financial institutions and cash held in bank accounts may exceed the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (\u201cFDIC\u201d) insured limit. As of October 31, 2016, the Company had approximately $395,000 in cash equivalents, approximately $800,000 in restricted cash and approximately $19.8 million in cash totaling approximately $21.0 million. Of the $19.8 million in cash, approximately $328,000 was held by MVC Turf and approximately $1.1 million was held by MVC Cayman.\nRestricted Cash and Cash Equivalents\nCash and cash equivalent accounts that are not available to the Company for day-to-day use and are legally restricted are classified as restricted cash. Restricted cash and cash equivalents are carried at cost, which approximates fair value. On April 26, 2011, the Company agreed to collateralize a 5.0 million Euro letter of credit from JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., which is related to a project guarantee by AB DnB NORD bankas to Security Holdings, a portfolio company investment and was classified as restricted cash. The Euro letter of credit was equivalent to approximately $5.5 million at October 31, 2015. During the fiscal year ended October 31, 2016, the Euro letter of credit was released and is no longer collateralized by the Company and released from restricted cash. During the fiscal year ended October 31, 2016, the Company agreed to cash collateralize a $500,000 working capital line of credit for an entity partially owned by MVC Environmental and a $300,000 letter of credit for RuMe, which were classified as restricted cash equivalents on the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nRestricted Securities\nThe Company will invest in privately-placed restricted securities. These securities may be resold in transactions exempt from registration or to the public if the securities are registered. Disposal of these securities may involve time-consuming negotiations and expense, and a prompt sale at an acceptable price may be difficult.\nDistributions to Shareholders\nDistributions to shareholders are recorded on the ex-dividend date.\nIncome Taxes\nIt is the policy of the Company to meet the requirements for qualification as a RIC under Subchapter M of the Code. As a RIC, the Company is not subject to income tax to the extent that it distributes all of its investment company taxable income and net realized capital gains for its taxable year. The Company is also exempt from excise tax if it distributes at least 98% of its income and 98.2% of its capital gains during each calendar year.\nOur consolidated operating subsidiary, MVCFS, is subject to federal and state income tax. We use the liability method in accounting for income taxes. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recorded for temporary differences between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and their reported amounts in the financial statements, using statutory tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse. A valuation allowance is provided against deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized.\nASC 740, Income Taxes, provides guidance for how uncertain tax positions should be recognized, measured, presented and disclosed in the financial statements. ASC 740 requires the evaluation of tax positions taken or expected to be taken in the course of preparing the Company's tax returns to determine whether the tax positions are \u201cmore-likely-than-not\u201d of being sustained by the applicable tax authority. Tax positions deemed to meet a \u201cmore-likely-than-not\u201d threshold would be recorded as a tax benefit or expense in the current period. The Company recognizes interest and penalties, if any, related to unrecognized tax benefits as income tax expense in the consolidated statement of operations. During the fiscal year ended October 31, 2016, the Company did not incur any interest or penalties. Although we file federal and state tax returns, our major tax jurisdiction is federal for the Company and MVCFS. The fiscal years 2013, 2014, 2015 and 2016 for the Company and MVCFS remain subject to examination by federal, state and local tax authorities.", "item_7_tables": "Table 12: <table> <tr> <td> Portfolio Company\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Amount Committed\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Amount Funded at October 31, 2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> MVC Private Equity Fund LP\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $20.1 million\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $14.6 million\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $20.1 million\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $14.6 million\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>Table 13: <table> <tr> <td> Portfolio Company\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Amount Committed\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Amount Funded at October 31, 2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> MVC Private Equity Fund LP\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $20.1 million\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $14.6 million\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $20.1 million\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $14.6 million\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>Table 14: <table> <tr> <td> Guarantee\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Amount Committed\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Amount Funded at October 31, 2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> MVC Automotive\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $6.3 million\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> RuMe\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $1.0 million\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Turf\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $1.0 million\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $8.3 million\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>Table 15: <table> <tr> <td> Guarantee\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Amount Committed\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Amount Funded at October 31, 2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> MVC Automotive\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $7.2 million\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Tekers\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Turf\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $1.0 million\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $8.2 million\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>", "summary": " Here are the key points from the MD&A report:\n\n- The Company's investment objective is to maximize total return from capital appreciation and income. It invests primarily in debt and equity securities of small and mid-sized companies. \n\n- As of October 31, 2016, the Company had total investments of $360.1 million, with $5.9 million in legacy investments and $354.2 million in investments made under current management. This is down from $400.9 million total investments at October 31, 2015.\n\n- During fiscal 2016, the Company made 6 new investments totaling $35.7 million and 9 follow-on investments of $8.5 million. Significant realizations/sales included Ohio Medical ($40M proceeds, $30.5M realized loss) and Inland ($5.5M realized loss).\n\n- Net operating income was $37.4 million in fiscal 2016 versus $23.7 million in fiscal 2015, primarily due to higher dividend and fee income. Net operating expenses increased to $18.0 million from $14.4 million.  \n\n- Net unrealized appreciation on investments was $28.6 million in fiscal 2016 versus depreciation of $50.6 million in fiscal 2015, largely due to reversals of unrealized depreciation.\n\n- As of October 31, 2016, the Company had $21 million in cash, $35 million drawn on its credit facility, and $114.4 million in senior notes outstanding. It has commitments of $20.1 million to the MVC Private Equity Fund.\n\nIn summary, the Company continues to shift its focus to yield-oriented investments, made a number of new and follow-on investments in fiscal 2016, and saw an improvement in net unrealized appreciation on the portfolio versus the prior year. Liquidity remains adequate to support operations."}
