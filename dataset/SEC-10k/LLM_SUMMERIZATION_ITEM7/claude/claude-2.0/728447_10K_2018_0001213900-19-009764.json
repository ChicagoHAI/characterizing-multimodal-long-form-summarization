( EVO Inc.,\u201d we,\u201d us,\u201d our\u201d or the Company\u201d), was incorporated on October 22, 2010. EVO Inc. was incorporated to effect the re-domestication of Minn Shares Inc., a Minnesota corporation ( Minn Shares Minnesota\u201d), to the State of Delaware. From December 2001 until November 22, 2016, the Company and its predecessor entity, Minn Shares Minnesota, did not engage in any business activities other than for the purpose of collecting and distributing its assets, paying, satisfying and discharging any existing debts and obligations and doing other acts required to liquidate and wind up its business and affairs. The business purpose of EVO Inc. was to seek the acquisition of or merger with an existing company.\nSecurities Exchange with Thunder Ridge Transportation, Inc.\nOn June 1, 2018, the Company entered into an equity purchase agreement (the Purchase Agreement\u201d) with Billy (Trey) Peck Jr. ( Peck\u201d) pursuant to which the Company acquired all of the issued and outstanding shares (the TRT Shares\u201d) in Thunder Ridge Transport, Inc., a Missouri corporation ( Thunder Ridge\u201d), from Peck and Thunder Ridge became a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company. Thunder Ridge is based in Springfield, Missouri and is engaged in the business of fulfilling government and corporate contracts for freight trucking services.\nThe following discussion highlights our plan of operations and the principal factors that have affected our financial condition as well as our liquidity and capital resources for the periods described. This discussion contains forward-looking statements. The following discussion and analysis are based on our financial statements, which we have prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting. You should read the discussion and analysis together with such financial statements and the related notes thereto.\nGeneral Overview\nThe Company was incorporated in the State of Delaware on October 22, 2010, and is a holding company based in Peoria, Arizona that owns operating subsidiaries that are in the businesses of fulfilling government and corporate contracts for freight trucking services and compressed natural gas ( CNG\u201d) service stations. Titan is the management company that oversees operations of the El Toro, Diamond Bar, and Blaine CNG service stations. As of June 30, 2017, El Toro ceased operations and all of the assets related to this site were written off. Blaine and Diamond Bar were formed in 2015. In March 2016, Diamond Bar began operations of its CNG station under a lease agreement with the State of California South Coast Air Quality Management District ( SCAQMD\u201d) in Diamond Bar, California. In February 2018, the Company entered into a management agreement with a third party to operate Diamond Bar. Under the terms of the agreement, the management company is responsible for all operating expenses and thereby receives all revenue related to the site. The Company discontinued construction of Blaine during the fourth quarter of 2017. EAF was originally organized on March 28, 2012 under the name Clean-n-Green Alternative Fuels, LLC\u201d in the State of Delaware. Effective May 1, 2012, EAF changed its name to Environmental Alternative Fuels, LLC.\u201d EVO CNG, EAF's wholly owned subsidiary, was originally organized in the State of Delaware on April 1, 2013 under the name EVO Trillium, LLC\u201d and subsequently changed its name to EVO CNG, LLC\u201d effective March 1, 2016. Together, EAF and EVO CNG operate six compressed natural gas fueling stations located in California, Texas, Arizona and Wisconsin.\nThunder Ridge was founded in Missouri during 2000 and its primary business is interstate highway contract trucking routes operated for the USPS. Graham was founded in 1972 and its primary business also is interstate highway contract trucking routes operated for the USPS.\nThe Company plans to expand operations into interstate contract trucking routes operated for the USPS by acquiring trucking companies that already operate in this market. The USPS has repeatedly stated its desire to reduce cost and streamline service providers. This growth strategy complements our existing CNG business as we believe the USPS strategy to reduce fuel consumption and increase fleet efficiency is beneficial to contract proposals that include alternative fuel options such as CNG. Upon acquiring Sheehy Mail in January 2019, EVO Inc. operates the largest CNG fleet servicing the USPS.\nGoing Concern\nThe Company is an early stage company in the process of acquiring several businesses with highway contract routes operated for the United States Postal Service ( USPS\u201d) and Compressed Natural Gas ( CNG\u201d) fuel stations. As of December 31, 2018, the Company has a working capital deficit of approximately $13.0 million, stockholders' deficit of approximately $10.3 million, and negative operating cashflows of $6.8 million. Management anticipates rectifying these deficits with additional public and private offerings. Also, the Company is evaluating certain cash flow improvement measures by consolidating costs with the acquired entities, the purchase of vehicles to reduce purchased transportation and repricing contracts with USPS. However, there can be no assurance that the Company will be successful in these efforts. Further, for the year ended December 31, 2018, the USPS accounted for 95% of the Company's total consolidated revenues. The loss of the USPS as a customer, or a significant reduction in the Company's relationship with the USPS would have a material adverse effect on the Company's business.\nThe accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern for the next twelve months from the issuance of these consolidated statements within the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K. However, the above conditions raise substantial doubt about the Company's ability to do so. The consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments to reflect the possible future effects on the recoverability and classification of assets or the amounts and classifications of liabilities that may result should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern for the next twelve months from the issuance of these consolidated statements within the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nTo meet its current and future obligations, the Company has taken the following steps to capitalize the business and successfully achieve its business plan during 2019:\nManagement is working with related party debt holders and equipment lenders to extend or convert existing debt. However, there can be no assurance that the Company will be successful in these efforts.\nOn January 2, 2019, the Company acquired Sheehy Mail a mail contractor headquartered in Waterloo, Wisconsin. Sheehy Mail operates 104 trucks that service 16 USPS contracts across 18 states.\nOn February 1, 2019, the Company acquired Ursa Major Corporation ( Ursa\u201d) and J.B. Lease Corporation ( J.B. Lease\u201d), a mail contractor located in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. Ursa operates 250 trucks that service 42 USPS contracts across 22 states.\nDuring February 2019, El Toro received a waiver from Tradition Capital Bank of its 2018 defaults of certain debt service coverage ratio, minimum tangible equity, and debt to equity ratio covenants in the El Toro SBA loan, which waiver also eliminates those covenants for 2019 and thereafter.\nOn April 30, 2019, the Company and Peck entered into a fourth amendment to the Purchase Agreement (the Fourth Purchase Agreement Amendment\u201d). The Fourth Purchase Agreement Amendment extended the April 30, 2019 portion of the original maturity date to June 30, 2019. As of December 31, 2018, the outstanding balance was $2,386,778.\nThe cash balance as of December 31, 2018 was $1,630,022 and is sufficient to cover the negative cash flows generated from operations through the first half of 2019. Management is in the process of identifying sources of capital through debt refinancing and equity investments through one or more private placements. Management believes these additional sources will give the Company sufficient liquidity until it achieves projected positive cash flows from operations in the third quarter of 2019.\nSources of Revenue\nTitan was founded in 2012 and for the first four years only had management fee revenues. Beginning in 2016 Titan generated revenues from its CNG stations El Toro and Diamond Bar, and with the acquisition of EAF, the Company generated revenue from six stations beginning February 2017. With the acquisition of Thunder Ridge on June 1, 2018, and Graham on November 18, 2018, the Company has begun to recognize revenue from interstate highway contract routes. The transportation services include operations in Alabama, California, Florida, Georgia, Louisiana, Maryland, Michigan, Mississippi, Missouri, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Tennessee, and Texas.\nKey Trends\nInterstate Highway Contracts\nThe USPS has for more than 100 years contracted with third parties for the transportation of mail. The contractors competitively bid on transportation contracts that detail the movement of mail between processing facilities destination post offices and destination mailing addresses. The USPS evaluates the bids based on price, past performance, operational plans, financial resources, and the use of innovation or alternative fuels. The contracts are generally two to six years and are renewable for additional terms, usually indefinitely. As of September 30, 2018, there were 5,509 routes contracted with the USPS, utilizing 2,240 contractors with contracts totaling $3.3 billion.\nDuring July and August 2018, Thunder Ridge was awarded seven Dynamic Route Optimization (DRO) contracts with the USPS. These awards expand Thunder Ridge's operations into five states-California, Louisiana, Florida, Texas, and Michigan. This is in addition to the seven other states it services through 12 contracts with the USPS. Under the seven contracts, operations will include locations in Santa Clarita, California, Flint, Michigan, Austin, Texas, Pensacola, Florida, the Northern Bay of California, Baltimore, Maryland, and Baton Rouge, Louisiana. Additionally, the new contracts will provide a larger network for the development of new transportation opportunities. The annual contract revenues for the seven DRO contracts are approximately $26 million.\nAs part of the Graham acquisition in November 2018, the Company gained three additional USPS contracts serving Tennessee, Alabama, Georgia, and Mississippi which generate approximately $1.6 million in revenue annually.\nCNG\nIn general, CNG has become the primary alternative fueling choice for truck and bus fleets operating in the $134 billion fleet fueling market. Natural gas is sold on a gas gallon equivalent ( GGE\u201d) basis and as of December 2018 was selling at an average price nationally of approximately $2.19 per GGE versus average prices of gasoline and diesel of $2.27 and $2.98 per gallon, respectively. In addition, CNG is a significantly cleaner fuel than is gasoline or diesel. With increased focus on the environment, the benefits from natural gas-powered vehicles have an immediate positive impact on the issues of air quality, U.S. energy security and public health. Using renewable CNG can result in greater than 95% less greenhouse gases than traditional petroleum products, and because CNG fuel systems are completely sealed, CNG vehicles produce no evaporative emissions, which are a common hazard when using liquid fuel. Also, CNG creates less engine wear, thereby making its use even more desirable. As of December 2018, there were approximately 1,700 public CNG stations in the United States, compared to over 125,000 gasoline stations across the country.\nDuring December 2017 we received a $0.50 per GGE federal tax credit for each GGE sold. In some cases, we share this credit with our CNG customers. The federal tax credit program had not been approved for fiscal year 2018 by the time this Report on Form 10K was available to be issued.\nAnticipated Future Trends\nIn 2014, the USPS announced plans to significantly reduce their number of contractors from over 4,000 in 2014 to less 1,000 by 2022. The USPS's goal is to manage fewer relationships and work with larger prime contractors. The USPS is in the process of taking all of the contracts in a defined geographical area and consolidating them into one contract. It is estimated that over $1 billion in USPS contracts will become available in the next five years, which affords the opportunity for the Company to grow organically in addition to growing through acquisition.\nThe Company expects to further increase its footprint into the transportation industry by owning and operating transportation companies. The Company intends to acquire additional transportation companies that have won contracts to provide trucking services for the USPS. Our CNG business complements this expansion strategy since fueling our CNG trucks at our own stations in cases where our routes are located near our CNG facilities will allow us to implement cost saving strategies that will increase profitability and increase our presence in this space.\nIf we are successful in our future acquisition strategy, we will competitively bid on transportation contracts that detail the movement of mail between processing facilities, destination post offices and destination mailing addresses. Those contracts typically provide for an initial four-year term and are often renewed to the incumbent service provider if appropriate services have been performed. The contracts are bid and performed in accordance with various requirements, including, but not limited to requirements under the Service Contract Act, Department of Transportation regulations (federal and state), and other applicable local and state regulations.\nAlthough natural gas continues to be less expensive than gasoline and diesel in most markets, the price of natural gas has been significantly closer to the prices of gasoline and diesel in recent years as a result of declining oil prices, thereby reducing the price advantage of natural gas as a vehicle fuel. We anticipate that, over the long term, the prices for gasoline and diesel will continue to be higher than the price of natural gas as a vehicle fuel and will increase overall, which would improve the cost savings of natural gas as a vehicle fuel compared to diesel and gasoline. However, the amount of time needed for oil prices to recover from their recent decline is uncertain and we expect that adoption of natural gas as a vehicle fuel, growth in our customer base and gross revenue will be negatively affected until oil prices increase and this price advantage increases. Our belief that natural gas will continue, over the long term, to be a cheaper vehicle fuel than gasoline or diesel is based in large part on the growth in United States natural gas production in recent years.\nWe believe natural gas fuels are well-suited for use by vehicle fleets that consume high volumes of fuel, refuel at centralized locations or along well-defined routes and/or are increasingly required to reduce emissions. The nature of our USPS contracts and some of our general freight transit lanes fits this profile. As a result, we believe there will be growth in the consumption of natural gas as a vehicle fuel among certain vehicle fleets. However, we expect competition in the market for natural gas vehicle fuel to remain steady in the near-term. To the extent competition increases, we would be subject to greater pricing pressure, reduced operating margins and potentially fewer expansion opportunities.\nRecent Developments\nDuring 2018, the Company converted Titan subordinated notes payable and interest of $1,363,885 (the Junior Bridge Notes\u201d) into 272,777 shares of common stock.\nDuring 2018, the Company converted Titan promissory notes payable and interest of $688,958 (the Senior Bridge Notes\u201d) into 275,583 shares of common stock. In addition, two Senior Bridge Notes and the related interest were paid in full for $800,000 and $272,000, respectively. As of December 31, 2018, the outstanding balance of the Senior Bridge notes is $75,000 with interest accruing at 15% per year.\nDuring 2018, the Company converted three promissory notes (the Minn Shares Notes\u201d) in the aggregate of principal and interest of $468,655 to Joseph H. Whitney, The Globe Resources Group, LLC and Richard E. Gilbert into 187,462 units. Each unit included one share of common stock and one warrant to purchase one share of common stock with an exercise prices of $2.50 exercisable ten years after issuance.\nOn February 1, 2017, pursuant to the EAF Exchange Agreement, the Company acquired all of the membership interests of EAF. As consideration for the EAF Interests, EVO, Inc. issued a promissory note payable at maturity in the principal amount of $3.8 million to Danny Cuzick (the Senior Promissory Note\u201d) and convertible promissory notes in the aggregate principal amount of $9.5 million to the EAF Members (the Convertible Notes\u201d). The Senior Promissory Note bears interest at 7.5% per year with a default interest rate of 12.5% per year and has a maturity date of the earlier of (a) the date that is ten days after the initial closing of a private offering of capital stock of EVO, Inc. in an amount not less than $10 million (a Private Offering\u201d); (b) December 31, 2017 and (c) declaration by Danny Cuzick of an event of default under the Senior Promissory Note. The Convertible Notes bear interest at 1.5% per year and have a maturity date of February 1, 2026. The Company imputed an interest rate of 5.1% on the convertible promissory notes. During 2018, the Senior Promissory Note maturity date was extended to July 2019. Principal and interest are due at maturity.\nThe Convertible Notes were initially convertible into 1,400,000 shares (the Transaction Shares\u201d) of EVO, Inc.'s Common Stock, subject to adjustment for any stock splits, combinations or similar transactions, representing approximately 81.1% of EVO Inc.'s total outstanding shares of Common Stock on a post-transaction basis. Accordingly, the conversion of the Convertible Notes would result in a change in control of EVO Inc. The number of Transaction Shares were subject to increase to equal 70% of the issued and outstanding Common Stock if the issuance of Common Stock pursuant to a private offering of Common Stock of up to $2 million and the conversion of Minn Shares' and Titan's junior bridge notes, senior bridge notes, convertible promissory notes, and certain accounts payable into Common Stock would otherwise cause the Transaction Shares to represent less than 70% of the issued and outstanding Common Stock. Pursuant to the terms of the EAF Exchange Agreement, the EAF Members are entitled to demand registration rights and piggyback registration rights with respect to the Transaction Shares upon customary terms, limitations, exceptions and conditions. The Convertible Notes are secured by all of the assets of EAF and the EAF Interests, which EVO, Inc. pledged to the EAF Members as security for the Convertible Notes. In October 2018, the Company amended the Convertible Notes to eliminate the variable number of shares issuable under the conversion feature to a fixed amount of 7,000,000 shares upon conversion.\nEach Convertible Note is convertible at the applicable holder's option upon (1) consummation of a reorganization, merger or similar transaction where the Company is not the surviving or resulting entity or (2) the sale of all or substantially all of the Company's assets, subject to customary restrictions. The Convertible Notes are also subject to mandatory conversion at the Company's option beginning on the first anniversary of the issue date if: (i) the closing price of the common stock is greater than $10.00 and (ii) the average daily trading volume of shares of common stock has equaled 100,000 or more for the 30 days prior to the applicable date. Upon a conversion of the Convertible Notes, accrued interest may also be converted into shares of common stock at the greater of (1) 1.357, subject to adjustment for stock splits or combinations, or (2) the closing price of a share of common stock as reported on the business day that immediately precedes the date of the notice of conversion provided by the party making the election.\nIn connection with the closing of the EAF Exchange Agreement, on February 1, 2017, EVO, Inc. issued promissory notes to the EAF Members in the aggregate principal amount of $250,000. During 2018, the promissory notes were paid in full.\nIn connection with the closing of the EAF Exchange Agreement, on February 1, 2017, EVO, Inc. assumed a note payable from EAF to Danny Cuzick dated January 30, 2017 in the principal amount of $4.0 million (the EAF Note\u201d). The EAF Note is secured by all assets of EAF and is guaranteed by EVO, Inc. The EAF Note bears interest at 7.5% per annum with a default rate of 12.5% per annum and has a maturity date of the earlier of (a) February 1, 2020 and (b) declaration by Danny Cuzick of an event of default under the EAF Note. Principal and interest are due at maturity.\nOn April 6, 2017, the Company effected a 50-for-1 reverse stock split of its common stock pursuant to which each 50 shares of issued and outstanding common stock became one share of common stock (the Reverse Split\u201d). No fractional shares were issued as a result of the Reverse Split. All references to numbers of shares of common stock and per share amounts give retroactive effect to the Reverse Split for all periods presented.\nDuring July and August 2018, the Company issued $4,005,000 of Secured Convertible Promissory Notes ( Secured Convertible Notes\u201d). The Company paid debt issuance costs commissions of $524,987 in connection with the Secured Convertible Notes. They bear interest at 9.0%, compounded quarterly, and have a maturity date two years after issuance. The holders may agree, at their discretion, to add accrued interest in lieu of payment to the principal balance of the Secured Convertible Notes on the first day of each calendar quarter. The Secured Convertible Notes are secured by all the assets of the Company and are subordinate to the EAF notes. The holder may agree, at its discretion, to add accrued interest to the principal balance of the Secured Convertible Notes on the first day of each calendar quarter. The Secured Convertible Notes may not be prepaid prior to the first anniversary of the date of issuance but may be prepaid without penalty after the first anniversary of the date of issuance.\nThe Secured Convertible Notes are convertible into shares (the Note Shares\u201d) of the Company's common stock at a conversion rate of $2.50 per share of common stock at the holder's option: 1) at any time after the first anniversary of the date of issuance; or 2) at any time within 90 days after a triggering event,\u201d including a sale, reorganization, merger, or similar transaction where the Company is not the surviving entity. The Secured Convertible Notes are also subject to mandatory conversion at any time after the first anniversary of the date of issuance if the average volume of shares of common stock traded on the Nasdaq Capital Market, NYSE American Market or a higher tier of either exchange is 100,000 or more for the 10 trading days prior to the applicable date.\nThe Secured Convertible Notes also provide that the Company will prepare and file with the Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC\u201d), as promptly as reasonably practical following the issuance date of the Secured Convertible Notes, but in no event later than 45 days following the issuance date, a registration statement on Form S-1 (the Registration Statement\u201d) covering the resale of the common stock and the warrant shares and as soon as reasonably practical thereafter effect such registration. As of the filing date, the Registration Statement, which was filed on February 11, 2019 and has not been declared effective. The Company will be required to pay liquidated damages of 1.0% of the outstanding principal amount of the Secured Convertible Notes each 30 days if the Registration Statement is not declared effective by the SEC within 180 days of the filing date of the Registration Statement.\nAs additional consideration for the Secured Convertible Notes, the Company issued warrants to the holders to purchase 1,602,000 shares of common stock at an exercise price of $2.50 per share, exercisable for ten years from the date of issuance.\nOn June 1, 2018, Company entered into an equity purchase agreement (the Purchase Agreement\u201d) with Billy (Trey) Peck Jr. ( Peck\u201d) pursuant to which the Company acquired all of the issued and outstanding shares (the TR Shares\u201d) in Thunder Ridge Transport, Inc., a Missouri corporation ( Thunder Ridge\u201d), from Peck and Thunder Ridge became a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company. Thunder Ridge is based in Springfield, Missouri and is engaged in the business of fulfilling government and corporate contracts for freight trucking services.\nAs consideration for the TR Shares, the Company issued a promissory note dated June 1, 2018, in the principal amount of $2,500,000 to Peck (the TR Note\u201d). The TR Note bears interest at 6% per year with a default interest rate of 9% per year and had an original maturity date of the earlier of (a) the date the Company raises $40,000,000 in public or private offerings of debt or equity; (b) December 31, 2018, and (c) termination of Peck's employment with the Company by the Company without cause or by Peck for good reason. The TR Note is secured by all of the assets of Thunder Ridge pursuant to a security agreement dated June 1, 2018, between the Company, Thunder Ridge, and Peck (the Security Agreement\u201d), and is also secured by the TR Shares, which the Company pledged to Peck pursuant to a stock pledge agreement dated June 1, 2018, between the Company and Peck (the Pledge Agreement\u201d). On December 26, 2018, the Company and Peck entered into an amendment to the Purchase Agreement (the First Purchase Agreement Amendment\u201d). The First Purchase Agreement Amendment extended the December 31, 2018, portion of the original maturity date to February 28, 2019. On February 28, 2019, the Company and Peck entered into a second amendment to the Purchase Agreement (the Second Purchase Agreement Amendment\u201d). The Second Purchase Agreement Amendment extended the December 31, 2018, portion of the original maturity date to April 30, 2019, On April 30, 2019, the Company and Peck entered into a fourth amendment to the Purchase Agreement (the Fourth Purchase Agreement Amendment\u201d). The Fourth Purchase Agreement Amendment extended the April 30, 2019, portion of the original maturity date to June 30, 2019. The note calls for monthly principal payments of $14,000. All accrued and unpaid interest is due at maturity.\nIf the Company fails to repay the amounts outstanding under the TR Note on or before June 30, 2019, Peck has the right to require the Company to return the TR Shares and effectively rescind the sale of the TR Shares to the Company.\nOn April 12, 2019, the Company and Peck entered into a third amendment to the Purchase Agreement ( Third Purchase Agreement Amendment\u201d) to delete and replace the working capital exhibit to the equity purchase agreement. Pursuant to the Third Purchase Agreement Amendment, target working capital was reduced from $(638,094) to $(1,620,022).\nSources of Liquidity and Anticipated Capital Expenditures and Other Uses of Cash\nHistorically, our principal sources of liquidity have consisted of cash on hand, cash provided by financing activities, and cash provided by investors. Our cash position at December 31, 2018, was approximately $1,600,000 and we had a working capital deficit of $13 million. Our current liquidity will be impacted by the results of current operations; the ability to raise funds; and ability to manage the maturities of our debt obligations. The December 31, 2018 cash balance is sufficient to cover the negative cash flows generated from operations through the first half of 2019. Management is in the process of identifying sources of capital through debt refinancing and equity investments through one or more private placements. Management believes these additional sources will give the Company sufficient liquidity until it achieves projected positive cash flows from operations in the third quarter of 2019. There is no assurance that we will be able to raise sufficient capital or renegotiate our existing debt arrangements.\nWe incur liquidity risk as trucking is a capital-intensive operation. As we acquire additional assets, contractual awards, joint ventures, or new acquisitions, our liquidity objective is to maintain access to a diverse set of on and off-balance sheet liquidity sources. We seek to maintain liquidity sources to maintain our expected future obligations in the event we are not able to raise new funding due to our funding efforts. The liquidity risks that we are exposed to could arise from a variety of scenarios. Our liquidity management strategy includes a number of elements, including, but not limited to:\nTable 48: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>Cash from Operations </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 49: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>Debt refinancing </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 50: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>Maintaining unencumbered liquid assets </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 51: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>Public offering </td> </tr>\n</table>\nAs of December 31, 2018, the Company had total indebtedness of approximately $26,000,000 (net of approximately $8,100,000 of unamortized debt discount and debt issuance costs), of which approximately $6,900,000 is classified as current debt. Our total consolidated interest payment obligations relating to our indebtedness was approximately $1,900,000, which included amortization of debt discount and debt issuance costs of approximately $500,000 for the year ended December 31, 2018.\nWe may also elect to invest additional amounts in companies, assets or joint ventures in the vehicle or services industries, or use capital for other activities or pursuits, subject to the availability of capital. We will need to raise additional capital to fund any capital expenditures, investments or debt repayments that we cannot fund through available cash or cash generated by operations or that we cannot fund through other sources, such as with the sale of our stock. We may not be able to raise capital when needed on terms that are favorable to us, or at all. Any inability to raise capital may impair our ability to build new stations, develop natural gas fueling infrastructure, invest in strategic transactions or acquisitions or repay our outstanding indebtedness and may reduce our ability to grow our business and generate sustained or increased revenues. See Liquidity and Capital Resources\u201d below.\nBusiness Risks and Uncertainties\nOur business and prospects are exposed to numerous risks and uncertainties. For more information, see Risk Factors - Risks Related to the Company;\u201d Risks Related to the Company's Trucking Operations;\u201d and Risk Factors - Risks Related to the CNG Industry.\u201d\nResults from Operations\nFiscal Year Ended December 31, 2018, Compared to Fiscal Year Ended December 31, 2017\nRevenue. EVO Inc. has refocused its corporate strategy to leverage our footprint of CNG stations and relationships with owner-operators to build a national fleet of haulers primarily focused on servicing the U.S. Postal Service (USPS). While we expect the vast majority of our future sales growth in the trucking segment, our CNG stations will remain as a complementary part of our strategy. The CNG stations provide us with a cost effective fueling source for our own fleet and enable us to respond to the USPS' preference for environmentally-friendly fuel alternatives in the contract bidding process. We continue to operate public and private CNG filling stations.\nThe combination of the company's recent pivot into the trucking industry and acquisitions of Thunder Ridge and Graham in June 2018 and November 2018, respectively, make many of the traditional year over year variance comparisons irrelevant for this reporting period. Variance commentary of the CNG segment, which operated throughout 2018 and 2017 is as follows:\nCNG revenue: Sales for the CNG stations were $1,348,301 and $1,968,563 for the years December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. The decrease resulted from revenue loss of approximately $169,000 from the Diamond Bar station due to the third-party management agreement implemented during 2018, and approximately $340,000 at the Tolleson station due to a customer's discontinuation of its CNG fleet. In addition, the Company experienced an overall downward trend in CNG sales over the past year.\nThe third-party management agreement was executed with the management company to work with SCAQMD to renegotiate ownership of the CNG station. Upon SCAQMD's approval, the Company will transfer ownership to the management company.\nCNG operating expense: We changed the format of the statement of operations to mirror the trucking industry presentation norms since trucking now represents 95% of our revenue. Costs formerly classified as CNG cost of sales have now been moved to the Operating Expense section with the label CNG expenses. This expense line is comprised of natural gas, electricity, federal excise tax, vendor use fuel tax and credit card fees. The margins at the Titan and EVO CNG stations were approximately 33% and 24% for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. Margins decreased primarily because the site management fee to operate the stations remained fixed while sales volume fell.\nTrucking revenue: The Company earned trucking revenue for the first time in 2018 as a result of the Thunder Ridge and Graham acquisitions in June and November 2018, respectively. Approximately 95% of the trucking revenue is derived from contracts with the USPS to haul U.S. mail. The remainder of the revenue is derived from corporate freight hauling. The USPS contracts are typically four years in duration and are priced on a rate per mile basis which varies by contract. The USPS contracts also include a monthly fuel adjustment.\nPayroll: Of the Company's 290 employees at year-end, 269 were drivers. Driver wages are fixed per contract with USPS and are eligible for renegotiation with USPS on a bi-annual basis. In addition to an hourly wage that is set by the Department of Labor, drivers also earn a $5.11 hourly rate for benefits. The Company is installing transportation management automation in its fleet to improve driver scheduling and more closely manage labor productivity.\nPurchased transportation: Purchased transportation represents payments to subcontracted third party companies that serve as independent contractors for particular routes. These contracts are negotiated on a rate per mile basis and the subcontracting company is responsible for supplying all resources to perform the service including, but not limited to labor, equipment, fuel and associated expenses. As of December 31, 2018, the Company had 15 independent contractors, who accounted for approximately 38% of the Company's total miles for the year ended December 31, 2018.\nGeneral and administrative expenses were $3,294,111 and $2,416,071 for the year ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. Approximately $592,000 of the increase is attributable to Thunder Ridge expenses and $391,000 is attributable to business license and regulatory fees.\nEquipment rent: Presently, the Company rents and leases the majority of its trucks and trailers through a combination of short and long-term arrangements. Efforts are currently underway to rebalance the fleet towards having more company-owned assets to achieve the expected returns, subject to financing availability\nInsurance and Claims: Insurance and claims is comprised of auto liability and workers comp expense related to the trucking segment of the business.\nFuel: Fuel expense is comprised of diesel and CNG fuel required to operate the truck fleet. The Company manages fuel cost by negotiating volume discounts from rack fuel rates with select vendors.\nDepreciation and amortization: Approximately $655,000 of the Company's expense is related to its CNG stations and approximately $304,000 is related to the trucking segment.\nMaintenance and Supplies: Maintenance and supplies expense primarily includes the costs to maintain the fleet.\nOperating Supplies and Expense: Operating and supplies expense includes all other direct costs in the trucking segment such as onboard technology (approximately $178,000), truck parking (approximately $130,000) and tolls (approximately $50,000).\nImpairment: During the year, the Company impaired a $240,000 CNG asset that was previously held for sale. Impairment charges in 2017 totaled $4,906,217, comprised of $3,993,730 for goodwill, $106,270 for customer lists and $806,217 for El Toro's fixed assets.\nInterest expense. Interest expense increased to $1,892,375 in 2018 from $1,658,104 in 2017. Interest expense incurred during 2018 included $157,000 from Thunder Ridge from factoring and the fuel discount.\nWarrant expense. Warrant expense increased to $171,813 in 2018 from $77,500 in 2017. The warrant expense is primarily for issuance of warrants for acquisitions and warrants issued with capital raised in equity transactions. Warrant expense represents the estimated fair value calculated on the date of issuance of the warrant using the Black-Scholes option pricing model, which requires the input of subjective assumptions, including the expected term of warrants, expected stock price volatility, and expected dividends. These estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application of management's judgment.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nFiscal Year Ended December 31, 2018, Compared to Fiscal Year Ended December 31, 2017\nWe had cash and cash equivalents of $1,630,022 and $83,867 at December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively.

Cash provided by financing activities in 2017 consisted of $332,859 in stockholders' advances, $310,000 in proceeds from the sale of common stock, and proceeds of $400,000 from issuance of senior debt. Cash received in 2017 was partially offset by $101,298 in payments on the SBA loan.\nOur future liquidity and capital requirements will be influenced by numerous factors, including the extent and duration of future operating losses, the level and timing of future sales and expenditures, working capital required to support our business expansion, the level of our outstanding indebtedness and principal and interest we are obligated to pay on our indebtedness, our capital expenditure requirements (which will consist primarily of truck purchases in the future), demand for trucking services, the continuing acceptance of our product in the marketplace, competing technologies, market and regulatory developments, ongoing facility requirements, and potential strategic transactions.\nDebt Compliance\nAs of December 31, 2018, the Company had total indebtedness of approximately $26,000,000, (net of approximately $8,100,000 of unamortized debt discount and debt issuance costs), of which approximately $6,900,000 is classified as current debt.

Accordingly, the conversion of the Convertible Notes would result in a change in control of the Company. The number of Transaction Shares will be increased to equal 70% of the issued and outstanding Common Stock if the issuance of Common Stock pursuant to a private offering of Common Stock of up to $2 million and the conversion into Common Stock of the Company's subordinated notes payable to members, Senior Bridge Notes, convertible promissory notes, and certain accounts payable would otherwise cause the Transaction Shares to represent less than 70% of the issued and outstanding Common Stock.

On April 1, 2019, the Company agreed to issue 117,092 shares of common stock to settle the Separation Agreement which includes the $97,069 accounts payable - related party.\nSeries A Preferred Stock\nOn April 13, 2018, the Company issued 100,000 shares of Series A Preferred stock ( Preferred Stock\u201d) to a related party in return for advisory services rendered to the Company. The fair value of the services rendered was assessed at $234,000.\nDividends\nThe holders of the Preferred Stock are entitled to receive if, when, and as declared by the board of directors, an annual non-compounding dividend, payable at the rate of 8% and payable quarterly in arrears in cash, or, at the Company's option, an annual non-compounding dividend of 12%, payable quarterly in arrears in the form of shares of Preferred Stock at a rate of $3.00 per share. Such dividends will begin to accrue as of the date on which the Preferred Stock is issued and will accrue whether or not declared and whether or not there will be funds legally available for the payment of dividends. For the year ended December 31, 2018, the Company accrued $17,227 in dividends at 8%.\nAccrued and unpaid dividends upon conversion will automatically be converted into shares of the Company's common stock, par value $0.0001 per share. An assumed value of $3.00 per share of common stock will be used to determine the number of shares of common stock to be issued for such accrued and unpaid dividends.\nLiquidation Preference\nIn the event of any liquidation the holders of record of shares of Preferred Stock will be entitled to receive, prior and in preference to any distributions of any assets of the Company to the holders of the common stock out of the assets of the Company legally available therefore, $3.00 per share of Preferred Stock, plus accrued and unpaid dividends on each share of Preferred Stock.\nRedemption\nThe holder, upon written notice to the Company, can elect to put to the Company the Preferred Stock at any time after August 1, 2018, at the liquidation price plus all declared and unpaid dividends. In addition, the Company will have an ongoing right to purchase all or any portion of the outstanding shares of the Preferred Stock at $3.00 per share. The conversion rights require the Company to present the Preferred Stock in the mezzanine level of the accompanying balance sheet.\nVoting Rights\nGenerally, holders of shares of Preferred Stock are entitled to vote with the holders of common stock as a single class on all matters submitted to a vote of the stockholders and are entitled to 15 votes for each share of Preferred Stock held on the record date for the determination of the stockholders entitled to vote or, if no record date is established, on the date the vote is taken.\nConversion Rights\nEach share of Preferred Stock will convert to one fully paid and nonassessable share of the Company's common stock at any time at the option of the holder or the Company, subject to adjustments for stock dividends, splits, combinations and similar events. If the closing price on all domestic securities exchanges on which the Common Stock may at the time be listed exceeds $6.00 per share for 30 consecutive trading days and the daily trading volume of the common stock is at least 20,000 shares for that same period, each share of Preferred Stock will automatically convert to one share of the Company's common stock.\nStock Options\nOn April 12, 2018, the Company's board of directors approved the EVO Transportation and Energy Services, Inc. 2018 Stock Incentive Plan (the 2018 Plan\u201d) pursuant to which a total of 4,250,000 shares of common stock have been reserved for issuance to eligible employees, consultants, and directors of the Company. Further, on August 13, 2018, the board of directors approved the Company's Amended and Restated 2018 Stock Incentive Plan (the Amended 2018 Plan\u201d), which amended and restated the Company's 2018 Stock Incentive Plan. The Amended 2018 Plan increased options available for grant to 6,250,000.\nThe Amended 2018 Plan provides for awards of non-statutory stock options, incentive stock options, and restrictive stock awards within the meaning of Section 422 of the IRC and stock purchase rights to purchase shares of the Company's common stock.\nThe Amended 2018 Plan is administered by the board of directors, which has the authority to select the individuals to whom awards will be granted and to determine whether and to what extent stock options and stock purchase rights are to be granted, the number of shares of common stock to be covered by each award, the vesting schedule of stock options (generally straight-line over a period of four years), and all other terms and conditions of each award. Stock options have a maximum term of ten years, and it is the Company's practice to grant options to employees with exercise prices equal to or greater than the estimated fair market value of its common stock.\nThe board of directors may suspend or terminate the Amended 2018 Plan or any portion thereof at any time, and may amend the Amended 2018 Plan from time to time in such respects as the board of directors may deem advisable in order that incentive awards under the Amended 2018 Plan will conform to any change in applicable laws or regulations or in any other respect the board of directors may deem to be in the best interests of the Company; provided, however, that amendments to the Amended 2018 Plan will not be effective without approval of the stockholders of the Company if stockholder approval of the amendment is then required pursuant to Section 422 of the Code or the rules of any stock exchange or Nasdaq or similar regulatory body. No termination, suspension or amendment of the Amended 2018 Plan may adversely affect any outstanding incentive award without the consent of the affected participant.\nRestricted stock awards are made by the issuance to the participant of the actual shares represented by that grant. Any shares of restricted stock issued are registered in the name of the participant and bear an appropriate legend referring to the terms, conditions, and restrictions applicable to the award. Shares of restricted stock granted under the Amended 2018 Plan may not be sold, transferred, pledged, or assigned until the termination of the applicable period of restriction. After the last day of the period of restriction, shares of restricted stock become freely transferable by the participant. During the period of restriction, a participant holding shares of restricted stock granted under the Amended 2018 Plan may exercise full voting rights with respect to those shares, unless otherwise specified in the applicable award agreement. As of December 31, 2018, there were no shares of restricted stock outstanding.\nThe fair value of each award is estimated on the date of grant. Stock option values are estimated using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model, which requires the input of subjective assumptions, including the expected term of the option award, expected stock price volatility, and expected dividends. These estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application of management's judgment. For purposes of estimating the expected term of options granted, the Company aggregates option recipients into groups that have similar option exercise behavioral traits. Expected volatilities used in the valuation model are based on the average volatility of the Company's stock. The risk-free rate for the expected term of the option is based on the United States Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant. The valuation model assumes no dividends. There is no estimated forfeiture rate. During the year ended December 31, 2018, the Company has recorded stock-based compensation expense of $459,735 associated with stock options. As of December 31, 2018, the Company has estimated approximately $798,000 of future compensation cost related to the unvested portions of outstanding stock options. Options vest ratably over 3 years. One quarter (1/4) of the options vest and become exercisable on the grant date. The remaining vest and become exercisable ratably on the first, second, and third anniversary of the date of grant. As of December 31, 2018, there was no intrinsic value to the stock options.\nWarrants\nThe fair value of the warrants is estimated on the date of issuance using the Black-Scholes option pricing model, which requires the input of subjective assumptions, including the expected term of the warrants, expected stock price volatility, and expected dividends. These estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application of management's judgment. Expected volatilities used in the valuation model are based on the average volatility of the Company's stock. The risk-free rate for the expected term of the option is based on the United States Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nOperating Leases\nThe Company leased office space in Minnesota on a month to month basis with payments of $977 per month through June 2017.\nThunder Ridge leases approximately 4,300 square feet of office space from 319 N. Main, LLC, a Missouri limited liability company. The lease terminates during July 2020, with monthly rent of approximately $3,400.\nThunder Ridge leases equipment and vehicles under monthly and non-cancelable operating leases. Payments on these leases range between $249 and $2,254 and mature between January 2019 and September 2024.\nProperty rent expense for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, was approximately $135,000 and $132,000, respectively.\nTruck lease expense for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, was approximately $1,217,000 and $0, respectively.\nOther than the above operating leases, we have no off-balance sheet arrangements.\nCritical Accounting Policies\nOur discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ( US GAAP\u201d). The preparation of consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements, and revenues and expenses recorded during the reporting periods.\nOn a periodic basis we evaluate our estimates based on historical experience and various other assumptions we believe are reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results could differ from those estimates under different assumptions or conditions. For further information on our significant accounting policies, see note 1 to our consolidated financial statements included in this report.\nWe believe the following critical accounting policies involve the most significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements.\nBasis of Presentation\nThese financial statements represent the consolidated financial statements of EVO Transportation & Energy Services, Inc. ( EVO Inc.\u201d or the Company\u201d), and its wholly owned subsidiaries.\nGoing Concern\nThe Company is an early stage company in the process of acquiring several businesses with highway contract routes operated for the United States Postal Service ( USPS\u201d) and Compressed Natural Gas ( CNG\u201d) fuel stations. As of December 31, 2018, the Company has a working capital deficit of approximately $13.0 million, stockholders' deficit of approximately $10.3 million, and negative operating cashflows of $6.8 million. Management anticipates rectifying these deficits with additional public and private offerings. Also, the Company is evaluating certain cash flow improvement measures by consolidating costs with the acquired entities, the purchase of vehicles to reduce purchased transportation and repricing contracts with USPS. However, there can be no assurance that the Company will be successful in these efforts. Further, for the year ended December 31, 2018, the USPS accounted for 95% of the Company's total consolidated revenues. The loss of the USPS as a customer, or a significant reduction in the Company's relationship with the USPS would have a material adverse effect on the Company's business.\nThe accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern from the issuance of these consolidated statements within the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K. However, the above conditions raise substantial doubt about the Company's ability to do so. The consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments to reflect the possible future effects on the recoverability and classification of assets or the amounts and classifications of liabilities that may result should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern from the issuance of these consolidated statements within the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nTo meet its current and future obligations, the Company has taken the following steps to capitalize the business and successfully achieve its business plan during 2019:\nManagement is working with related party debt holders and equipment lenders to extend or convert existing debt. However, there can be no assurance that the Company will be successful in these efforts.\nOn January 2, 2019, the Company acquired Sheehy Mail a mail contractor headquartered in Waterloo, Wisconsin. Sheehy Mail operates 104 trucks that service 16 USPS contracts across 18 states.\nOn February 1, 2019, the Company acquired Ursa Major Corporation ( Ursa\u201d) and J.B. Lease Corporation ( J.B. Lease\u201d), a mail contractor located in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. Ursa operates 250 trucks that service 42 USPS contracts across 22 states.\nDuring February 2019, El Toro received a waiver from Tradition Capital Bank of its 2018 defaults of certain debt service coverage ratio, minimum tangible equity, and debt to equity ratio covenants in the El Toro SBA loan, which waiver also eliminates those covenants for 2019 and thereafter.\nOn April 1, 2019, the Company issued 117,092 shares of common stock to settle the Separation Agreement with the former officer. The settlement included reimbursement of the $37,500 of advances from the related party and approximately $300,000 of the accounts payable - related party.\nOn April 30, 2019, the Company and Peck entered into a fourth amendment to the Purchase Agreement (the Fourth Purchase Agreement Amendment\u201d). The Fourth Purchase Agreement Amendment extended the April 30, 2019 portion of the original maturity date to June 30, 2019. As of December 31, 2018, the outstanding balance was $2,386,778.\nThe cash balance as of December 31, 2018 was $1,630,022 and is sufficient to cover the negative cash flows generated from operations through the first half of 2019. Management is in the process of identifying sources of capital through debt refinancing and equity investments with private placement of the common stock. Management believes these additional sources will give the Company sufficient liquidity until it achieves projected positive cash flows from operations in the third quarter of 2019.\nUse of Estimates\nThe preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ( GAAP\u201d) requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.\nThe consolidated financial statements include some amounts that are based on management's best estimates and judgments. The most significant estimates relate to revenue recognition, goodwill and long-lived intangible asset valuations, fixed asset impairment assessments, debt discount, beneficial conversion feature, contingencies, purchase price allocation related to the Thunder Ridge acquisition, and going concern. These estimates may be adjusted as more current information becomes available, and any adjustment could be significant. The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.\nAccounts Receivable\nThe Company provides an allowance for doubtful accounts equal to the estimated uncollectible amounts. The Company's estimate is based on historical collection experience and a review of the current status of the accounts receivable. It is reasonably possible that the Company's estimate of the allowance for doubtful accounts will change and that losses ultimately incurred could differ materially from the amounts estimated in determining the allowance.\nProperty, Equipment and Land\nProperty and equipment are stated at cost. Depreciation is provided utilizing the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives for owned assets, ranging from five to 15 years.\nGoodwill and Intangibles\nGoodwill\nGoodwill represents the excess of the purchase price of a business acquisition over the net fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed. Goodwill and intangible assets that do not have finite lives are not amortized, but rather are assessed for impairment at least annually or more frequently if certain impairment indicators are present.\nThe Company evaluates goodwill on an annual basis in the fourth quarter or more frequently if management believes indicators of impairment exist. Such indicators could include but are not limited to 1) a significant adverse change in legal factors or in business climate, 2) unanticipated competition, or 3) an adverse action or assessment by a regulator. The Company first assesses qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, including goodwill. If management concludes that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, management conducts a two-step quantitative goodwill impairment test. The first step of the impairment test involves comparing the fair value of the applicable reporting unit with its carrying value. The Company estimates the fair values of its reporting units using a combination of the income or discounted cash flows approach and the market approach, which utilizes comparable companies' data. If the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds the reporting unit's fair value, management performs the second step of the goodwill impairment test. The second step of the goodwill impairment test involves comparing the implied fair value of the affected reporting unit's goodwill with the carrying value of that goodwill. The amount by which the carrying value of the goodwill exceeds its implied fair value, if any, is recognized as an impairment loss.\nIntangibles\nIntangible assets consist of finite lived and indefinite lived intangibles. The Company's finite lived intangibles include favorable leases, customer relationships and the trade name. Finite lived intangibles are amortized over their estimated useful lives. For the Company's lease related intangibles, the estimated useful life is based on the agreement of a one-time payment of $1 and the term of the mortgages, of the properties owned by the Company of approximately five years. For the Company's trade names and customer list the estimated lives are based on life cycle of a customer of approximately five years.\nLong-Lived Assets\nThe Company evaluates the recoverability of long-lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that an asset's carrying amount may not be recoverable. Such circumstances could include, but are not limited to (1) a significant decrease in the market value of an asset, (2) a significant adverse change in the extent or manner in which an asset is used, or (3) an accumulation of costs significantly in excess of the amount originally expected for the acquisition of an asset. The Company measures the carrying amount of the asset against the estimated undiscounted future cash flows associated with it. Should the sum of the expected future net cash flows be less than the carrying value of the asset being evaluated, an impairment loss would be recognized. The impairment loss would be calculated as the amount by which the carrying value of the asset exceeds its fair value. The fair value is measured based on quoted market prices, if available.\nIf quoted market prices are not available, the estimate of fair value is based on various valuation techniques, including the discounted value of estimated future cash flows. The evaluation of asset impairment requires the Company to make assumptions about future cash flows over the life of the asset being evaluated. These assumptions require significant judgment and actual results may differ from assumed and estimated amounts. The Company assesses the useful lives and possible impairment of the fixed assets or goodwill and intangibles when an event occurs that may trigger such review. Factors considered important which could trigger a review include:\nSignificant under-performance of the stations or transportation service contracts relative to historical or projected future operating results;\nSignificant negative economic trends in the CNG industry or freight trucking services industry; and\nIdentification of other impaired assets within a reporting unit.\nAdoption of New Standard Related to Revenue Recognition and Revenue Recognition\nAdoption of New Standard Related to Revenue Recognition\nOn January 1, 2018, the Company adopted Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Accounting Standards Codification Topic 606) ( Topic 606\u201d or new guidance\u201d) retrospectively. The adoption of Topic 606 did not have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements. The new guidance had no impact on the timing or classification of the Company's cash flows as reported in the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows. The Company did not record any adjustments as a result of applying Topic 606.\nRevenue Recognition\nTrucking Operations\nUSPS - USPS trucking operations generates revenue from transportation services under multi-year contracts with the USPS, generally on a rate per mile basis that adjusts monthly for fuel pricing indexes.\nTable 55: <table><tr> <td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>Contract Identification - Each delivery represents a distinct service that is a separately identified performance obligation for each contract.

At the same time, operating expenses increase and fuel efficiency declines because of engine idling and harsh weather creating higher accident frequency, increased claims and higher equipment repair expenditures. The Company also may suffer from weather-related or other events such as tornadoes, hurricanes, blizzards, ice storms, floods, fires, earthquakes and explosions. These events may disrupt fuel supplies, increase fuel costs, disrupt freight shipments or routes, affect regional economies, destroy the Company's assets or adversely affect the business or financial condition of customers, any of which could adversely affect the Company's results or make the Company's results more volatile.\nTo some extent, we experience seasonality with the CNG business. Natural gas vehicle fuel amounts consumed by some of our customers tend to be higher in summer months when fleet vehicles use more fuel to power their air conditioning systems. Natural gas commodity prices tend to be higher in the fall and winter months due to increased overall demand for natural gas for heating during these periods. With the USPS contracts the trucking segment experiences a significant increase in business from the last week of November through the end of December\nSince our inception, inflation has not significantly affected our operating results. However, costs for construction, repairs, maintenance, electricity and insurance are all subject to inflationary pressures, which could affect our ability to maintain our stations adequately, build new stations, expand our existing facilities or pursue additional CNG production projects, or could materially increase our operating costs.", "item_7_truncated": "Item 7.

( EVO Inc.,\u201d we,\u201d us,\u201d our\u201d or the Company\u201d), was incorporated on October 22, 2010. EVO Inc. was incorporated to effect the re-domestication of Minn Shares Inc., a Minnesota corporation ( Minn Shares Minnesota\u201d), to the State of Delaware. From December 2001 until November 22, 2016, the Company and its predecessor entity, Minn Shares Minnesota, did not engage in any business activities other than for the purpose of collecting and distributing its assets, paying, satisfying and discharging any existing debts and obligations and doing other acts required to liquidate and wind up its business and affairs. The business purpose of EVO Inc. was to seek the acquisition of or merger with an existing company.\nSecurities Exchange with Thunder Ridge Transportation, Inc.\nOn June 1, 2018, the Company entered into an equity purchase agreement (the Purchase Agreement\u201d) with Billy (Trey) Peck Jr. ( Peck\u201d) pursuant to which the Company acquired all of the issued and outstanding shares (the TRT Shares\u201d) in Thunder Ridge Transport, Inc., a Missouri corporation ( Thunder Ridge\u201d), from Peck and Thunder Ridge became a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company. Thunder Ridge is based in Springfield, Missouri and is engaged in the business of fulfilling government and corporate contracts for freight trucking services.\nThe following discussion highlights our plan of operations and the principal factors that have affected our financial condition as well as our liquidity and capital resources for the periods described. This discussion contains forward-looking statements. The following discussion and analysis are based on our financial statements, which we have prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting. You should read the discussion and analysis together with such financial statements and the related notes thereto.\nGeneral Overview\nThe Company was incorporated in the State of Delaware on October 22, 2010, and is a holding company based in Peoria, Arizona that owns operating subsidiaries that are in the businesses of fulfilling government and corporate contracts for freight trucking services and compressed natural gas ( CNG\u201d) service stations. Titan is the management company that oversees operations of the El Toro, Diamond Bar, and Blaine CNG service stations. As of June 30, 2017, El Toro ceased operations and all of the assets related to this site were written off. Blaine and Diamond Bar were formed in 2015. In March 2016, Diamond Bar began operations of its CNG station under a lease agreement with the State of California South Coast Air Quality Management District ( SCAQMD\u201d) in Diamond Bar, California. In February 2018, the Company entered into a management agreement with a third party to operate Diamond Bar. Under the terms of the agreement, the management company is responsible for all operating expenses and thereby receives all revenue related to the site. The Company discontinued construction of Blaine during the fourth quarter of 2017. EAF was originally organized on March 28, 2012 under the name Clean-n-Green Alternative Fuels, LLC\u201d in the State of Delaware. Effective May 1, 2012, EAF changed its name to Environmental Alternative Fuels, LLC.\u201d EVO CNG, EAF's wholly owned subsidiary, was originally organized in the State of Delaware on April 1, 2013 under the name EVO Trillium, LLC\u201d and subsequently changed its name to EVO CNG, LLC\u201d effective March 1, 2016. Together, EAF and EVO CNG operate six compressed natural gas fueling stations located in California, Texas, Arizona and Wisconsin.\nThunder Ridge was founded in Missouri during 2000 and its primary business is interstate highway contract trucking routes operated for the USPS. Graham was founded in 1972 and its primary business also is interstate highway contract trucking routes operated for the USPS.\nThe Company plans to expand operations into interstate contract trucking routes operated for the USPS by acquiring trucking companies that already operate in this market. The USPS has repeatedly stated its desire to reduce cost and streamline service providers. This growth strategy complements our existing CNG business as we believe the USPS strategy to reduce fuel consumption and increase fleet efficiency is beneficial to contract proposals that include alternative fuel options such as CNG. Upon acquiring Sheehy Mail in January 2019, EVO Inc. operates the largest CNG fleet servicing the USPS.\nGoing Concern\nThe Company is an early stage company in the process of acquiring several businesses with highway contract routes operated for the United States Postal Service ( USPS\u201d) and Compressed Natural Gas ( CNG\u201d) fuel stations. As of December 31, 2018, the Company has a working capital deficit of approximately $13.0 million, stockholders' deficit of approximately $10.3 million, and negative operating cashflows of $6.8 million. Management anticipates rectifying these deficits with additional public and private offerings. Also, the Company is evaluating certain cash flow improvement measures by consolidating costs with the acquired entities, the purchase of vehicles to reduce purchased transportation and repricing contracts with USPS. However, there can be no assurance that the Company will be successful in these efforts. Further, for the year ended December 31, 2018, the USPS accounted for 95% of the Company's total consolidated revenues. The loss of the USPS as a customer, or a significant reduction in the Company's relationship with the USPS would have a material adverse effect on the Company's business.\nThe accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern for the next twelve months from the issuance of these consolidated statements within the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K. However, the above conditions raise substantial doubt about the Company's ability to do so. The consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments to reflect the possible future effects on the recoverability and classification of assets or the amounts and classifications of liabilities that may result should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern for the next twelve months from the issuance of these consolidated statements within the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nTo meet its current and future obligations, the Company has taken the following steps to capitalize the business and successfully achieve its business plan during 2019:\nManagement is working with related party debt holders and equipment lenders to extend or convert existing debt. However, there can be no assurance that the Company will be successful in these efforts.\nOn January 2, 2019, the Company acquired Sheehy Mail a mail contractor headquartered in Waterloo, Wisconsin. Sheehy Mail operates 104 trucks that service 16 USPS contracts across 18 states.\nOn February 1, 2019, the Company acquired Ursa Major Corporation ( Ursa\u201d) and J.B. Lease Corporation ( J.B. Lease\u201d), a mail contractor located in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. Ursa operates 250 trucks that service 42 USPS contracts across 22 states.\nDuring February 2019, El Toro received a waiver from Tradition Capital Bank of its 2018 defaults of certain debt service coverage ratio, minimum tangible equity, and debt to equity ratio covenants in the El Toro SBA loan, which waiver also eliminates those covenants for 2019 and thereafter.\nOn April 30, 2019, the Company and Peck entered into a fourth amendment to the Purchase Agreement (the Fourth Purchase Agreement Amendment\u201d). The Fourth Purchase Agreement Amendment extended the April 30, 2019 portion of the original maturity date to June 30, 2019. As of December 31, 2018, the outstanding balance was $2,386,778.\nThe cash balance as of December 31, 2018 was $1,630,022 and is sufficient to cover the negative cash flows generated from operations through the first half of 2019. Management is in the process of identifying sources of capital through debt refinancing and equity investments through one or more private placements. Management believes these additional sources will give the Company sufficient liquidity until it achieves projected positive cash flows from operations in the third quarter of 2019.\nSources of Revenue\nTitan was founded in 2012 and for the first four years only had management fee revenues. Beginning in 2016 Titan generated revenues from its CNG stations El Toro and Diamond Bar, and with the acquisition of EAF, the Company generated revenue from six stations beginning February 2017. With the acquisition of Thunder Ridge on June 1, 2018, and Graham on November 18, 2018, the Company has begun to recognize revenue from interstate highway contract routes. The transportation services include operations in Alabama, California, Florida, Georgia, Louisiana, Maryland, Michigan, Mississippi, Missouri, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Tennessee, and Texas.\nKey Trends\nInterstate Highway Contracts\nThe USPS has for more than 100 years contracted with third parties for the transportation of mail. The contractors competitively bid on transportation contracts that detail the movement of mail between processing facilities destination post offices and destination mailing addresses. The USPS evaluates the bids based on price, past performance, operational plans, financial resources, and the use of innovation or alternative fuels. The contracts are generally two to six years and are renewable for additional terms, usually indefinitely. As of September 30, 2018, there were 5,509 routes contracted with the USPS, utilizing 2,240 contractors with contracts totaling $3.3 billion.\nDuring July and August 2018, Thunder Ridge was awarded seven Dynamic Route Optimization (DRO) contracts with the USPS. These awards expand Thunder Ridge's operations into five states-California, Louisiana, Florida, Texas, and Michigan. This is in addition to the seven other states it services through 12 contracts with the USPS. Under the seven contracts, operations will include locations in Santa Clarita, California, Flint, Michigan, Austin, Texas, Pensacola, Florida, the Northern Bay of California, Baltimore, Maryland, and Baton Rouge, Louisiana. Additionally, the new contracts will provide a larger network for the development of new transportation opportunities. The annual contract revenues for the seven DRO contracts are approximately $26 million.\nAs part of the Graham acquisition in November 2018, the Company gained three additional USPS contracts serving Tennessee, Alabama, Georgia, and Mississippi which generate approximately $1.6 million in revenue annually.\nCNG\nIn general, CNG has become the primary alternative fueling choice for truck and bus fleets operating in the $134 billion fleet fueling market. Natural gas is sold on a gas gallon equivalent ( GGE\u201d) basis and as of December 2018 was selling at an average price nationally of approximately $2.19 per GGE versus average prices of gasoline and diesel of $2.27 and $2.98 per gallon, respectively. In addition, CNG is a significantly cleaner fuel than is gasoline or diesel. With increased focus on the environment, the benefits from natural gas-powered vehicles have an immediate positive impact on the issues of air quality, U.S. energy security and public health. Using renewable CNG can result in greater than 95% less greenhouse gases than traditional petroleum products, and because CNG fuel systems are completely sealed, CNG vehicles produce no evaporative emissions, which are a common hazard when using liquid fuel. Also, CNG creates less engine wear, thereby making its use even more desirable. As of December 2018, there were approximately 1,700 public CNG stations in the United States, compared to over 125,000 gasoline stations across the country.\nDuring December 2017 we received a $0.50 per GGE federal tax credit for each GGE sold. In some cases, we share this credit with our CNG customers. The federal tax credit program had not been approved for fiscal year 2018 by the time this Report on Form 10K was available to be issued.\nAnticipated Future Trends\nIn 2014, the USPS announced plans to significantly reduce their number of contractors from over 4,000 in 2014 to less 1,000 by 2022. The USPS's goal is to manage fewer relationships and work with larger prime contractors. The USPS is in the process of taking all of the contracts in a defined geographical area and consolidating them into one contract. It is estimated that over $1 billion in USPS contracts will become available in the next five years, which affords the opportunity for the Company to grow organically in addition to growing through acquisition.\nThe Company expects to further increase its footprint into the transportation industry by owning and operating transportation companies. The Company intends to acquire additional transportation companies that have won contracts to provide trucking services for the USPS. Our CNG business complements this expansion strategy since fueling our CNG trucks at our own stations in cases where our routes are located near our CNG facilities will allow us to implement cost saving strategies that will increase profitability and increase our presence in this space.\nIf we are successful in our future acquisition strategy, we will competitively bid on transportation contracts that detail the movement of mail between processing facilities, destination post offices and destination mailing addresses. Those contracts typically provide for an initial four-year term and are often renewed to the incumbent service provider if appropriate services have been performed. The contracts are bid and performed in accordance with various requirements, including, but not limited to requirements under the Service Contract Act, Department of Transportation regulations (federal and state), and other applicable local and state regulations.\nAlthough natural gas continues to be less expensive than gasoline and diesel in most markets, the price of natural gas has been significantly closer to the prices of gasoline and diesel in recent years as a result of declining oil prices, thereby reducing the price advantage of natural gas as a vehicle fuel. We anticipate that, over the long term, the prices for gasoline and diesel will continue to be higher than the price of natural gas as a vehicle fuel and will increase overall, which would improve the cost savings of natural gas as a vehicle fuel compared to diesel and gasoline. However, the amount of time needed for oil prices to recover from their recent decline is uncertain and we expect that adoption of natural gas as a vehicle fuel, growth in our customer base and gross revenue will be negatively affected until oil prices increase and this price advantage increases. Our belief that natural gas will continue, over the long term, to be a cheaper vehicle fuel than gasoline or diesel is based in large part on the growth in United States natural gas production in recent years.\nWe believe natural gas fuels are well-suited for use by vehicle fleets that consume high volumes of fuel, refuel at centralized locations or along well-defined routes and/or are increasingly required to reduce emissions. The nature of our USPS contracts and some of our general freight transit lanes fits this profile. As a result, we believe there will be growth in the consumption of natural gas as a vehicle fuel among certain vehicle fleets. However, we expect competition in the market for natural gas vehicle fuel to remain steady in the near-term. To the extent competition increases, we would be subject to greater pricing pressure, reduced operating margins and potentially fewer expansion opportunities.\nRecent Developments\nDuring 2018, the Company converted Titan subordinated notes payable and interest of $1,363,885 (the Junior Bridge Notes\u201d) into 272,777 shares of common stock.\nDuring 2018, the Company converted Titan promissory notes payable and interest of $688,958 (the Senior Bridge Notes\u201d) into 275,583 shares of common stock. In addition, two Senior Bridge Notes and the related interest were paid in full for $800,000 and $272,000, respectively. As of December 31, 2018, the outstanding balance of the Senior Bridge notes is $75,000 with interest accruing at 15% per year.\nDuring 2018, the Company converted three promissory notes (the Minn Shares Notes\u201d) in the aggregate of principal and interest of $468,655 to Joseph H. Whitney, The Globe Resources Group, LLC and Richard E. Gilbert into 187,462 units. Each unit included one share of common stock and one warrant to purchase one share of common stock with an exercise prices of $2.50 exercisable ten years after issuance.\nOn February 1, 2017, pursuant to the EAF Exchange Agreement, the Company acquired all of the membership interests of EAF. As consideration for the EAF Interests, EVO, Inc. issued a promissory note payable at maturity in the principal amount of $3.8 million to Danny Cuzick (the Senior Promissory Note\u201d) and convertible promissory notes in the aggregate principal amount of $9.5 million to the EAF Members (the Convertible Notes\u201d). The Senior Promissory Note bears interest at 7.5% per year with a default interest rate of 12.5% per year and has a maturity date of the earlier of (a) the date that is ten days after the initial closing of a private offering of capital stock of EVO, Inc. in an amount not less than $10 million (a Private Offering\u201d); (b) December 31, 2017 and (c) declaration by Danny Cuzick of an event of default under the Senior Promissory Note. The Convertible Notes bear interest at 1.5% per year and have a maturity date of February 1, 2026. The Company imputed an interest rate of 5.1% on the convertible promissory notes. During 2018, the Senior Promissory Note maturity date was extended to July 2019. Principal and interest are due at maturity.\nThe Convertible Notes were initially convertible into 1,400,000 shares (the Transaction Shares\u201d) of EVO, Inc.'s Common Stock, subject to adjustment for any stock splits, combinations or similar transactions, representing approximately 81.1% of EVO Inc.'s total outstanding shares of Common Stock on a post-transaction basis. Accordingly, the conversion of the Convertible Notes would result in a change in control of EVO Inc. The number of Transaction Shares were subject to increase to equal 70% of the issued and outstanding Common Stock if the issuance of Common Stock pursuant to a private offering of Common Stock of up to $2 million and the conversion of Minn Shares' and Titan's junior bridge notes, senior bridge notes, convertible promissory notes, and certain accounts payable into Common Stock would otherwise cause the Transaction Shares to represent less than 70% of the issued and outstanding Common Stock. Pursuant to the terms of the EAF Exchange Agreement, the EAF Members are entitled to demand registration rights and piggyback registration rights with respect to the Transaction Shares upon customary terms, limitations, exceptions and conditions. The Convertible Notes are secured by all of the assets of EAF and the EAF Interests, which EVO, Inc. pledged to the EAF Members as security for the Convertible Notes. In October 2018, the Company amended the Convertible Notes to eliminate the variable number of shares issuable under the conversion feature to a fixed amount of 7,000,000 shares upon conversion.\nEach Convertible Note is convertible at the applicable holder's option upon (1) consummation of a reorganization, merger or similar transaction where the Company is not the surviving or resulting entity or (2) the sale of all or substantially all of the Company's assets, subject to customary restrictions. The Convertible Notes are also subject to mandatory conversion at the Company's option beginning on the first anniversary of the issue date if: (i) the closing price of the common stock is greater than $10.00 and (ii) the average daily trading volume of shares of common stock has equaled 100,000 or more for the 30 days prior to the applicable date. Upon a conversion of the Convertible Notes, accrued interest may also be converted into shares of common stock at the greater of (1) 1.357, subject to adjustment for stock splits or combinations, or (2) the closing price of a share of common stock as reported on the business day that immediately precedes the date of the notice of conversion provided by the party making the election.\nIn connection with the closing of the EAF Exchange Agreement, on February 1, 2017, EVO, Inc. issued promissory notes to the EAF Members in the aggregate principal amount of $250,000. During 2018, the promissory notes were paid in full.\nIn connection with the closing of the EAF Exchange Agreement, on February 1, 2017, EVO, Inc. assumed a note payable from EAF to Danny Cuzick dated January 30, 2017 in the principal amount of $4.0 million (the EAF Note\u201d). The EAF Note is secured by all assets of EAF and is guaranteed by EVO, Inc. The EAF Note bears interest at 7.5% per annum with a default rate of 12.5% per annum and has a maturity date of the earlier of (a) February 1, 2020 and (b) declaration by Danny Cuzick of an event of default under the EAF Note. Principal and interest are due at maturity.\nOn April 6, 2017, the Company effected a 50-for-1 reverse stock split of its common stock pursuant to which each 50 shares of issued and outstanding common stock became one share of common stock (the Reverse Split\u201d). No fractional shares were issued as a result of the Reverse Split. All references to numbers of shares of common stock and per share amounts give retroactive effect to the Reverse Split for all periods presented.\nDuring July and August 2018, the Company issued $4,005,000 of Secured Convertible Promissory Notes ( Secured Convertible Notes\u201d). The Company paid debt issuance costs commissions of $524,987 in connection with the Secured Convertible Notes. They bear interest at 9.0%, compounded quarterly, and have a maturity date two years after issuance. The holders may agree, at their discretion, to add accrued interest in lieu of payment to the principal balance of the Secured Convertible Notes on the first day of each calendar quarter. The Secured Convertible Notes are secured by all the assets of the Company and are subordinate to the EAF notes. The holder may agree, at its discretion, to add accrued interest to the principal balance of the Secured Convertible Notes on the first day of each calendar quarter. The Secured Convertible Notes may not be prepaid prior to the first anniversary of the date of issuance but may be prepaid without penalty after the first anniversary of the date of issuance.\nThe Secured Convertible Notes are convertible into shares (the Note Shares\u201d) of the Company's common stock at a conversion rate of $2.50 per share of common stock at the holder's option: 1) at any time after the first anniversary of the date of issuance; or 2) at any time within 90 days after a triggering event,\u201d including a sale, reorganization, merger, or similar transaction where the Company is not the surviving entity. The Secured Convertible Notes are also subject to mandatory conversion at any time after the first anniversary of the date of issuance if the average volume of shares of common stock traded on the Nasdaq Capital Market, NYSE American Market or a higher tier of either exchange is 100,000 or more for the 10 trading days prior to the applicable date.\nThe Secured Convertible Notes also provide that the Company will prepare and file with the Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC\u201d), as promptly as reasonably practical following the issuance date of the Secured Convertible Notes, but in no event later than 45 days following the issuance date, a registration statement on Form S-1 (the Registration Statement\u201d) covering the resale of the common stock and the warrant shares and as soon as reasonably practical thereafter effect such registration. As of the filing date, the Registration Statement, which was filed on February 11, 2019 and has not been declared effective. The Company will be required to pay liquidated damages of 1.0% of the outstanding principal amount of the Secured Convertible Notes each 30 days if the Registration Statement is not declared effective by the SEC within 180 days of the filing date of the Registration Statement.\nAs additional consideration for the Secured Convertible Notes, the Company issued warrants to the holders to purchase 1,602,000 shares of common stock at an exercise price of $2.50 per share, exercisable for ten years from the date of issuance.\nOn June 1, 2018, Company entered into an equity purchase agreement (the Purchase Agreement\u201d) with Billy (Trey) Peck Jr. ( Peck\u201d) pursuant to which the Company acquired all of the issued and outstanding shares (the TR Shares\u201d) in Thunder Ridge Transport, Inc., a Missouri corporation ( Thunder Ridge\u201d), from Peck and Thunder Ridge became a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company. Thunder Ridge is based in Springfield, Missouri and is engaged in the business of fulfilling government and corporate contracts for freight trucking services.\nAs consideration for the TR Shares, the Company issued a promissory note dated June 1, 2018, in the principal amount of $2,500,000 to Peck (the TR Note\u201d). The TR Note bears interest at 6% per year with a default interest rate of 9% per year and had an original maturity date of the earlier of (a) the date the Company raises $40,000,000 in public or private offerings of debt or equity; (b) December 31, 2018, and (c) termination of Peck's employment with the Company by the Company without cause or by Peck for good reason. The TR Note is secured by all of the assets of Thunder Ridge pursuant to a security agreement dated June 1, 2018, between the Company, Thunder Ridge, and Peck (the Security Agreement\u201d), and is also secured by the TR Shares, which the Company pledged to Peck pursuant to a stock pledge agreement dated June 1, 2018, between the Company and Peck (the Pledge Agreement\u201d). On December 26, 2018, the Company and Peck entered into an amendment to the Purchase Agreement (the First Purchase Agreement Amendment\u201d). The First Purchase Agreement Amendment extended the December 31, 2018, portion of the original maturity date to February 28, 2019. On February 28, 2019, the Company and Peck entered into a second amendment to the Purchase Agreement (the Second Purchase Agreement Amendment\u201d). The Second Purchase Agreement Amendment extended the December 31, 2018, portion of the original maturity date to April 30, 2019, On April 30, 2019, the Company and Peck entered into a fourth amendment to the Purchase Agreement (the Fourth Purchase Agreement Amendment\u201d). The Fourth Purchase Agreement Amendment extended the April 30, 2019, portion of the original maturity date to June 30, 2019. The note calls for monthly principal payments of $14,000. All accrued and unpaid interest is due at maturity.\nIf the Company fails to repay the amounts outstanding under the TR Note on or before June 30, 2019, Peck has the right to require the Company to return the TR Shares and effectively rescind the sale of the TR Shares to the Company.\nOn April 12, 2019, the Company and Peck entered into a third amendment to the Purchase Agreement ( Third Purchase Agreement Amendment\u201d) to delete and replace the working capital exhibit to the equity purchase agreement. Pursuant to the Third Purchase Agreement Amendment, target working capital was reduced from $(638,094) to $(1,620,022).\nSources of Liquidity and Anticipated Capital Expenditures and Other Uses of Cash\nHistorically, our principal sources of liquidity have consisted of cash on hand, cash provided by financing activities, and cash provided by investors. Our cash position at December 31, 2018, was approximately $1,600,000 and we had a working capital deficit of $13 million. Our current liquidity will be impacted by the results of current operations; the ability to raise funds; and ability to manage the maturities of our debt obligations. The December 31, 2018 cash balance is sufficient to cover the negative cash flows generated from operations through the first half of 2019. Management is in the process of identifying sources of capital through debt refinancing and equity investments through one or more private placements. Management believes these additional sources will give the Company sufficient liquidity until it achieves projected positive cash flows from operations in the third quarter of 2019. There is no assurance that we will be able to raise sufficient capital or renegotiate our existing debt arrangements.\nWe incur liquidity risk as trucking is a capital-intensive operation. As we acquire additional assets, contractual awards, joint ventures, or new acquisitions, our liquidity objective is to maintain access to a diverse set of on and off-balance sheet liquidity sources. We seek to maintain liquidity sources to maintain our expected future obligations in the event we are not able to raise new funding due to our funding efforts. The liquidity risks that we are exposed to could arise from a variety of scenarios. Our liquidity management strategy includes a number of elements, including, but not limited to:\n \u25cf Cash from Operations \n \u25cf Debt refinancing \n \u25cf Maintaining unencumbered liquid assets \n \u25cf Public offering \nAs of December 31, 2018, the Company had total indebtedness of approximately $26,000,000 (net of approximately $8,100,000 of unamortized debt discount and debt issuance costs), of which approximately $6,900,000 is classified as current debt. Our total consolidated interest payment obligations relating to our indebtedness was approximately $1,900,000, which included amortization of debt discount and debt issuance costs of approximately $500,000 for the year ended December 31, 2018.\nWe may also elect to invest additional amounts in companies, assets or joint ventures in the vehicle or services industries, or use capital for other activities or pursuits, subject to the availability of capital. We will need to raise additional capital to fund any capital expenditures, investments or debt repayments that we cannot fund through available cash or cash generated by operations or that we cannot fund through other sources, such as with the sale of our stock. We may not be able to raise capital when needed on terms that are favorable to us, or at all. Any inability to raise capital may impair our ability to build new stations, develop natural gas fueling infrastructure, invest in strategic transactions or acquisitions or repay our outstanding indebtedness and may reduce our ability to grow our business and generate sustained or increased revenues. See Liquidity and Capital Resources\u201d below.\nBusiness Risks and Uncertainties\nOur business and prospects are exposed to numerous risks and uncertainties. For more information, see Risk Factors - Risks Related to the Company;\u201d Risks Related to the Company's Trucking Operations;\u201d and Risk Factors - Risks Related to the CNG Industry.\u201d\nResults from Operations\nFiscal Year Ended December 31, 2018, Compared to Fiscal Year Ended December 31, 2017\nRevenue. EVO Inc. has refocused its corporate strategy to leverage our footprint of CNG stations and relationships with owner-operators to build a national fleet of haulers primarily focused on servicing the U.S. Postal Service (USPS). While we expect the vast majority of our future sales growth in the trucking segment, our CNG stations will remain as a complementary part of our strategy. The CNG stations provide us with a cost effective fueling source for our own fleet and enable us to respond to the USPS' preference for environmentally-friendly fuel alternatives in the contract bidding process. We continue to operate public and private CNG filling stations.\nThe combination of the company's recent pivot into the trucking industry and acquisitions of Thunder Ridge and Graham in June 2018 and November 2018, respectively, make many of the traditional year over year variance comparisons irrelevant for this reporting period. Variance commentary of the CNG segment, which operated throughout 2018 and 2017 is as follows:\nCNG revenue: Sales for the CNG stations were $1,348,301 and $1,968,563 for the years December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. The decrease resulted from revenue loss of approximately $169,000 from the Diamond Bar station due to the third-party management agreement implemented during 2018, and approximately $340,000 at the Tolleson station due to a customer's discontinuation of its CNG fleet. In addition, the Company experienced an overall downward trend in CNG sales over the past year.\nThe third-party management agreement was executed with the management company to work with SCAQMD to renegotiate ownership of the CNG station. Upon SCAQMD's approval, the Company will transfer ownership to the management company.\nCNG operating expense: We changed the format of the statement of operations to mirror the trucking industry presentation norms since trucking now represents 95% of our revenue. Costs formerly classified as CNG cost of sales have now been moved to the Operating Expense section with the label CNG expenses. This expense line is comprised of natural gas, electricity, federal excise tax, vendor use fuel tax and credit card fees. The margins at the Titan and EVO CNG stations were approximately 33% and 24% for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. Margins decreased primarily because the site management fee to operate the stations remained fixed while sales volume fell.\nTrucking revenue: The Company earned trucking revenue for the first time in 2018 as a result of the Thunder Ridge and Graham acquisitions in June and November 2018, respectively. Approximately 95% of the trucking revenue is derived from contracts with the USPS to haul U.S. mail. The remainder of the revenue is derived from corporate freight hauling. The USPS contracts are typically four years in duration and are priced on a rate per mile basis which varies by contract. The USPS contracts also include a monthly fuel adjustment.\nPayroll: Of the Company's 290 employees at year-end, 269 were drivers. Driver wages are fixed per contract with USPS and are eligible for renegotiation with USPS on a bi-annual basis. In addition to an hourly wage that is set by the Department of Labor, drivers also earn a $5.11 hourly rate for benefits. The Company is installing transportation management automation in its fleet to improve driver scheduling and more closely manage labor productivity.\nPurchased transportation: Purchased transportation represents payments to subcontracted third party companies that serve as independent contractors for particular routes. These contracts are negotiated on a rate per mile basis and the subcontracting company is responsible for supplying all resources to perform the service including, but not limited to labor, equipment, fuel and associated expenses. As of December 31, 2018, the Company had 15 independent contractors, who accounted for approximately 38% of the Company's total miles for the year ended December 31, 2018.\nGeneral and administrative expenses were $3,294,111 and $2,416,071 for the year ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. Approximately $592,000 of the increase is attributable to Thunder Ridge expenses and $391,000 is attributable to business license and regulatory fees.\nEquipment rent: Presently, the Company rents and leases the majority of its trucks and trailers through a combination of short and long-term arrangements. Efforts are currently underway to rebalance the fleet towards having more company-owned assets to achieve the expected returns, subject to financing availability\nInsurance and Claims: Insurance and claims is comprised of auto liability and workers comp expense related to the trucking segment of the business.\nFuel: Fuel expense is comprised of diesel and CNG fuel required to operate the truck fleet. The Company manages fuel cost by negotiating volume discounts from rack fuel rates with select vendors.\nDepreciation and amortization: Approximately $655,000 of the Company's expense is related to its CNG stations and approximately $304,000 is related to the trucking segment.\nMaintenance and Supplies: Maintenance and supplies expense primarily includes the costs to maintain the fleet.\nOperating Supplies and Expense: Operating and supplies expense includes all other direct costs in the trucking segment such as onboard technology (approximately $178,000), truck parking (approximately $130,000) and tolls (approximately $50,000).\nImpairment: During the year, the Company impaired a $240,000 CNG asset that was previously held for sale. Impairment charges in 2017 totaled $4,906,217, comprised of $3,993,730 for goodwill, $106,270 for customer lists and $806,217 for El Toro's fixed assets.\nInterest expense. Interest expense increased to $1,892,375 in 2018 from $1,658,104 in 2017. Interest expense incurred during 2018 included $157,000 from Thunder Ridge from factoring and the fuel discount.\nWarrant expense. Warrant expense increased to $171,813 in 2018 from $77,500 in 2017. The warrant expense is primarily for issuance of warrants for acquisitions and warrants issued with capital raised in equity transactions. Warrant expense represents the estimated fair value calculated on the date of issuance of the warrant using the Black-Scholes option pricing model, which requires the input of subjective assumptions, including the expected term of warrants, expected stock price volatility, and expected dividends.

These estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application of management's judgment. Expected volatilities used in the valuation model are based on the average volatility of the Company's stock.

Any shares of restricted stock issued are registered in the name of the participant and bear an appropriate legend referring to the terms, conditions, and restrictions applicable to the award. Shares of restricted stock granted under the Amended 2018 Plan may not be sold, transferred, pledged, or assigned until the termination of the applicable period of restriction. After the last day of the period of restriction, shares of restricted stock become freely transferable by the participant. During the period of restriction, a participant holding shares of restricted stock granted under the Amended 2018 Plan may exercise full voting rights with respect to those shares, unless otherwise specified in the applicable award agreement. As of December 31, 2018, there were no shares of restricted stock outstanding.\nThe fair value of each award is estimated on the date of grant. Stock option values are estimated using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model, which requires the input of subjective assumptions, including the expected term of the option award, expected stock price volatility, and expected dividends. These estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application of management's judgment. For purposes of estimating the expected term of options granted, the Company aggregates option recipients into groups that have similar option exercise behavioral traits. Expected volatilities used in the valuation model are based on the average volatility of the Company's stock. The risk-free rate for the expected term of the option is based on the United States Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant. The valuation model assumes no dividends. There is no estimated forfeiture rate. During the year ended December 31, 2018, the Company has recorded stock-based compensation expense of $459,735 associated with stock options. As of December 31, 2018, the Company has estimated approximately $798,000 of future compensation cost related to the unvested portions of outstanding stock options. Options vest ratably over 3 years. One quarter (1/4) of the options vest and become exercisable on the grant date. The remaining vest and become exercisable ratably on the first, second, and third anniversary of the date of grant. As of December 31, 2018, there was no intrinsic value to the stock options.\nWarrants\nThe fair value of the warrants is estimated on the date of issuance using the Black-Scholes option pricing model, which requires the input of subjective assumptions, including the expected term of the warrants, expected stock price volatility, and expected dividends. These estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application of management's judgment. Expected volatilities used in the valuation model are based on the average volatility of the Company's stock. The risk-free rate for the expected term of the option is based on the United States Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nOperating Leases\nThe Company leased office space in Minnesota on a month to month basis with payments of $977 per month through June 2017.\nThunder Ridge leases approximately 4,300 square feet of office space from 319 N. Main, LLC, a Missouri limited liability company. The lease terminates during July 2020, with monthly rent of approximately $3,400.\nThunder Ridge leases equipment and vehicles under monthly and non-cancelable operating leases. Payments on these leases range between $249 and $2,254 and mature between January 2019 and September 2024.\nProperty rent expense for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, was approximately $135,000 and $132,000, respectively.\nTruck lease expense for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, was approximately $1,217,000 and $0, respectively.\nOther than the above operating leases, we have no off-balance sheet arrangements.\nCritical Accounting Policies\nOur discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ( US GAAP\u201d). The preparation of consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements, and revenues and expenses recorded during the reporting periods.\nOn a periodic basis we evaluate our estimates based on historical experience and various other assumptions we believe are reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results could differ from those estimates under different assumptions or conditions. For further information on our significant accounting policies, see note 1 to our consolidated financial statements included in this report.\nWe believe the following critical accounting policies involve the most significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements.\nBasis of Presentation\nThese financial statements represent the consolidated financial statements of EVO Transportation & Energy Services, Inc. ( EVO Inc.\u201d or the Company\u201d), and its wholly owned subsidiaries.\nGoing Concern\nThe Company is an early stage company in the process of acquiring several businesses with highway contract routes operated for the United States Postal Service ( USPS\u201d) and Compressed Natural Gas ( CNG\u201d) fuel stations. As of December 31, 2018, the Company has a working capital deficit of approximately $13.0 million, stockholders' deficit of approximately $10.3 million, and negative operating cashflows of $6.8 million. Management anticipates rectifying these deficits with additional public and private offerings. Also, the Company is evaluating certain cash flow improvement measures by consolidating costs with the acquired entities, the purchase of vehicles to reduce purchased transportation and repricing contracts with USPS. However, there can be no assurance that the Company will be successful in these efforts. Further, for the year ended December 31, 2018, the USPS accounted for 95% of the Company's total consolidated revenues. The loss of the USPS as a customer, or a significant reduction in the Company's relationship with the USPS would have a material adverse effect on the Company's business.\nThe accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern from the issuance of these consolidated statements within the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K. However, the above conditions raise substantial doubt about the Company's ability to do so. The consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments to reflect the possible future effects on the recoverability and classification of assets or the amounts and classifications of liabilities that may result should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern from the issuance of these consolidated statements within the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nTo meet its current and future obligations, the Company has taken the following steps to capitalize the business and successfully achieve its business plan during 2019:\nManagement is working with related party debt holders and equipment lenders to extend or convert existing debt. However, there can be no assurance that the Company will be successful in these efforts.\nOn January 2, 2019, the Company acquired Sheehy Mail a mail contractor headquartered in Waterloo, Wisconsin. Sheehy Mail operates 104 trucks that service 16 USPS contracts across 18 states.\nOn February 1, 2019, the Company acquired Ursa Major Corporation ( Ursa\u201d) and J.B. Lease Corporation ( J.B. Lease\u201d), a mail contractor located in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. Ursa operates 250 trucks that service 42 USPS contracts across 22 states.\nDuring February 2019, El Toro received a waiver from Tradition Capital Bank of its 2018 defaults of certain debt service coverage ratio, minimum tangible equity, and debt to equity ratio covenants in the El Toro SBA loan, which waiver also eliminates those covenants for 2019 and thereafter.\nOn April 1, 2019, the Company issued 117,092 shares of common stock to settle the Separation Agreement with the former officer. The settlement included reimbursement of the $37,500 of advances from the related party and approximately $300,000 of the accounts payable - related party.\nOn April 30, 2019, the Company and Peck entered into a fourth amendment to the Purchase Agreement (the Fourth Purchase Agreement Amendment\u201d). The Fourth Purchase Agreement Amendment extended the April 30, 2019 portion of the original maturity date to June 30, 2019. As of December 31, 2018, the outstanding balance was $2,386,778.\nThe cash balance as of December 31, 2018 was $1,630,022 and is sufficient to cover the negative cash flows generated from operations through the first half of 2019. Management is in the process of identifying sources of capital through debt refinancing and equity investments with private placement of the common stock. Management believes these additional sources will give the Company sufficient liquidity until it achieves projected positive cash flows from operations in the third quarter of 2019.\nUse of Estimates\nThe preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ( GAAP\u201d) requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.\nThe consolidated financial statements include some amounts that are based on management's best estimates and judgments. The most significant estimates relate to revenue recognition, goodwill and long-lived intangible asset valuations, fixed asset impairment assessments, debt discount, beneficial conversion feature, contingencies, purchase price allocation related to the Thunder Ridge acquisition, and going concern. These estimates may be adjusted as more current information becomes available, and any adjustment could be significant. The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.\nAccounts Receivable\nThe Company provides an allowance for doubtful accounts equal to the estimated uncollectible amounts. The Company's estimate is based on historical collection experience and a review of the current status of the accounts receivable. It is reasonably possible that the Company's estimate of the allowance for doubtful accounts will change and that losses ultimately incurred could differ materially from the amounts estimated in determining the allowance.\nProperty, Equipment and Land\nProperty and equipment are stated at cost. Depreciation is provided utilizing the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives for owned assets, ranging from five to 15 years.\nGoodwill and Intangibles\nGoodwill\nGoodwill represents the excess of the purchase price of a business acquisition over the net fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed. Goodwill and intangible assets that do not have finite lives are not amortized, but rather are assessed for impairment at least annually or more frequently if certain impairment indicators are present.\nThe Company evaluates goodwill on an annual basis in the fourth quarter or more frequently if management believes indicators of impairment exist. Such indicators could include but are not limited to 1) a significant adverse change in legal factors or in business climate, 2) unanticipated competition, or 3) an adverse action or assessment by a regulator. The Company first assesses qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, including goodwill. If management concludes that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, management conducts a two-step quantitative goodwill impairment test. The first step of the impairment test involves comparing the fair value of the applicable reporting unit with its carrying value. The Company estimates the fair values of its reporting units using a combination of the income or discounted cash flows approach and the market approach, which utilizes comparable companies' data. If the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds the reporting unit's fair value, management performs the second step of the goodwill impairment test. The second step of the goodwill impairment test involves comparing the implied fair value of the affected reporting unit's goodwill with the carrying value of that goodwill. The amount by which the carrying value of the goodwill exceeds its implied fair value, if any, is recognized as an impairment loss.\nIntangibles\nIntangible assets consist of finite lived and indefinite lived intangibles. The Company's finite lived intangibles include favorable leases, customer relationships and the trade name. Finite lived intangibles are amortized over their estimated useful lives. For the Company's lease related intangibles, the estimated useful life is based on the agreement of a one-time payment of $1 and the term of the mortgages, of the properties owned by the Company of approximately five years. For the Company's trade names and customer list the estimated lives are based on life cycle of a customer of approximately five years.\nLong-Lived Assets\nThe Company evaluates the recoverability of long-lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that an asset's carrying amount may not be recoverable. Such circumstances could include, but are not limited to (1) a significant decrease in the market value of an asset, (2) a significant adverse change in the extent or manner in which an asset is used, or (3) an accumulation of costs significantly in excess of the amount originally expected for the acquisition of an asset. The Company measures the carrying amount of the asset against the estimated undiscounted future cash flows associated with it. Should the sum of the expected future net cash flows be less than the carrying value of the asset being evaluated, an impairment loss would be recognized. The impairment loss would be calculated as the amount by which the carrying value of the asset exceeds its fair value. The fair value is measured based on quoted market prices, if available.\nIf quoted market prices are not available, the estimate of fair value is based on various valuation techniques, including the discounted value of estimated future cash flows. The evaluation of asset impairment requires the Company to make assumptions about future cash flows over the life of the asset being evaluated. These assumptions require significant judgment and actual results may differ from assumed and estimated amounts. The Company assesses the useful lives and possible impairment of the fixed assets or goodwill and intangibles when an event occurs that may trigger such review. Factors considered important which could trigger a review include:\nSignificant under-performance of the stations or transportation service contracts relative to historical or projected future operating results;\nSignificant negative economic trends in the CNG industry or freight trucking services industry; and\nIdentification of other impaired assets within a reporting unit.\nAdoption of New Standard Related to Revenue Recognition and Revenue Recognition\nAdoption of New Standard Related to Revenue Recognition\nOn January 1, 2018, the Company adopted Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Accounting Standards Codification Topic 606) ( Topic 606\u201d or new guidance\u201d) retrospectively. The adoption of Topic 606 did not have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements. The new guidance had no impact on the timing or classification of the Company's cash flows as reported in the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows. The Company did not record any adjustments as a result of applying Topic 606.\nRevenue Recognition\nTrucking Operations\nUSPS - USPS trucking operations generates revenue from transportation services under multi-year contracts with the USPS, generally on a rate per mile basis that adjusts monthly for fuel pricing indexes.\n \u25cf Contract Identification - Each delivery represents a distinct service that is a separately identified performance obligation for each contract. A single delivery may comprise of multiple stops prior to completion. Therefore, a legally enforceable contract is executed by both parties at the first point of pickup for each delivery. Although the Company has master agreements with the USPS, these master agreements only establish general terms. There is no financial obligation until the load is tendered/accepted and the Company takes possession of the load. \n \u25cf Performance Obligations - The Company's performance obligation arises from the annualized contract to transport USPS freight and is satisfied upon completion of each delivery. The Company's delivery, accessorial, and dedicated truck capacity represent a bundle of services that are highly interdependent and have the same pattern of transfer to the customer. These services are not capable of being distinct from one another. Thus, the Company's only performance obligation of USPS trucking operations is transportation services. \n \u25cf Transaction Price - The transaction price is based on the awarded agreement for the multi-year contract. The prices are based on miles travelled that adjusts monthly for fuel pricing indexes. Depending on the contract, the total transaction price may consist of mileage revenue, fuel adjustments, accessorial fees and fees for additional deliveries outside of the scope of the annual contract. There is no significant financing component in the transaction price, as the USPS generally pay within the contractual payment terms of 30 to 60 days. \n \u25cf Allocating Transaction Price to Performance Obligations - The transaction price is allocated in its entirety to transportation services, as this is the only performance obligation. \n \u25cf Revenue Recognition - Revenues are recognized over time as satisfaction of the promised contractual delivery agreements are completed, in an amount that reflects the rate per mile set in the contract. Generally, each delivery is completed within a single day. Deliveries may have scheduled completion times that carry over to the next day. In these instances, the delivery is determined to be a part of the contractual requirement for the day the initial pick-up is scheduled. The year ended December 31, 2018 is the first year the Company had USPS trucking revenues. As such, there is no change in timing of revenue recognition for USPS trucking revenues between reportable periods. \nFreight\n \u25cf Contract Identification - A legally enforceable contract is executed by both parties at the point of pickup at the shipper's location, as evidenced by a bill of lading. Although the Company may have master agreements with its customers, these master agreements only establish general terms. There is no financial obligation until the load is tendered/accepted and the Company takes possession of the load. \n \u25cf Performance Obligations - The Company's only performance obligation for freight trucking operations is transportation services. The Company's delivery, accessorial, and dedicated truck capacity represent a bundle of services that are highly interdependent and have the same pattern of transfer to the customer. These services are not capable of being distinct from one another and the Company does not offer them on a stand-alone basis. \n \u25cf Transaction Price -Depending on the contract, the total transaction price may consist of mileage revenue, fuel adjustments, and accessorial fees. There is no significant financing component in the transaction price, as the USPS generally pay within the contractual payment terms of 30 to 60 days. \n \u25cf Allocating Transaction Price to Performance Obligations - The transaction price is allocated in its entirety to transportation services, as this is the only performance obligation. \n \u25cf Revenue Recognition - Revenues are recognized over time as satisfaction of the promised contractual delivery agreements are completed. Generally, the Company does not have revenue in transit at period end. The year ended December 31, 2018 is the first year the Company had USPS trucking revenues. As such, there is no change in timing of revenue recognition for USPS trucking revenues between reportable periods. \nCNG Operations\nThe Company's CNG is sold predominately pursuant to contractual commitments. These contracts typically include a stand-ready obligation to supply natural gas daily.\n \u25cf Contract Identification - A legally enforceable contract is executed by both parties at the time a customer pumps the fuel from the station. Although the Company may have contractual agreements, these agreements only establish general terms. There is no financial obligation until the customer receives and consumes the benefits provided by the Company's performance as the stand-ready obligations are being performed \n \u25cf Performance Obligations - The Company's performance obligation arises from the sale of fuel to the customer. Thus, the Company's only performance obligation of CNG operations is CNG sales. \n \u25cf Transaction Price - The transaction price is based stand-alone selling price for fuel. The primary method used to estimate the stand-alone selling price for fuel is observable stand-alone sales, \n \u25cf Allocating Transaction Price to Performance Obligations - The transaction price is allocated in its entirety to CNG sales, as this is the only performance obligation. \n \u25cf Revenue Recognition - The Company recognizes revenue over time for the fuel sales as the customer receives and consumes the benefits. This does not represent a change from the Company's past practice, therefore, there was no change in timing of revenue recognition between periods on the adoption of ASC 605, Revenue Recognition. \nThere was no change in management's determination that the Company acts as the principal (rather than the agent) with respect to revenue recognition within its logistics businesses, under ASC 606, compared to ASC 605. Accordingly, the Company continues to recognize revenue on a gross basis, consistent with past practices.\nSignificant judgments involved in the Company's revenue recognition and corresponding accounts receivable balances include:\n \u25cf Estimating the allowance for doubtful accounts. The Company establishes an allowance for doubtful accounts based on historical experience and any known trends or uncertainties related to customer billing and account collectability. Management reviews the adequacy of its allowance for doubtful accounts on a quarterly basis. Uncollectible accounts are written off when deemed uncollectible, and accounts receivable are presented net of an allowance for doubtful accounts. \nRecently Issued Accounting Pronouncements\nSee Note 1 to our consolidated financial statements included in this report.\nSeasonality and Inflation\nDue to increased USPS volume, the Company's tractor productivity typically increases during the last quarter of each calendar year. At the same time, operating expenses increase and fuel efficiency declines because of engine idling and harsh weather creating higher accident frequency, increased claims and higher equipment repair expenditures. The Company also may suffer from weather-related or other events such as tornadoes, hurricanes, blizzards, ice storms, floods, fires, earthquakes and explosions. These events may disrupt fuel supplies, increase fuel costs, disrupt freight shipments or routes, affect regional economies, destroy the Company's assets or adversely affect the business or financial condition of customers, any of which could adversely affect the Company's results or make the Company's results more volatile.\nTo some extent, we experience seasonality with the CNG business. Natural gas vehicle fuel amounts consumed by some of our customers tend to be higher in summer months when fleet vehicles use more fuel to power their air conditioning systems. Natural gas commodity prices tend to be higher in the fall and winter months due to increased overall demand for natural gas for heating during these periods. With the USPS contracts the trucking segment experiences a significant increase in business from the last week of November through the end of December\nSince our inception, inflation has not significantly affected our operating results. However, costs for construction, repairs, maintenance, electricity and insurance are all subject to inflationary pressures, which could affect our ability to maintain our stations adequately, build new stations, expand our existing facilities or pursue additional CNG production projects, or could materially increase our operating costs.", "item_7_text": "Item 7.

( EVO Inc.,\u201d we,\u201d us,\u201d our\u201d or the Company\u201d), was incorporated on October 22, 2010. EVO Inc. was incorporated to effect the re-domestication of Minn Shares Inc., a Minnesota corporation ( Minn Shares Minnesota\u201d), to the State of Delaware. From December 2001 until November 22, 2016, the Company and its predecessor entity, Minn Shares Minnesota, did not engage in any business activities other than for the purpose of collecting and distributing its assets, paying, satisfying and discharging any existing debts and obligations and doing other acts required to liquidate and wind up its business and affairs. The business purpose of EVO Inc. was to seek the acquisition of or merger with an existing company.\nSecurities Exchange with Thunder Ridge Transportation, Inc.\nOn June 1, 2018, the Company entered into an equity purchase agreement (the Purchase Agreement\u201d) with Billy (Trey) Peck Jr. ( Peck\u201d) pursuant to which the Company acquired all of the issued and outstanding shares (the TRT Shares\u201d) in Thunder Ridge Transport, Inc., a Missouri corporation ( Thunder Ridge\u201d), from Peck and Thunder Ridge became a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company. Thunder Ridge is based in Springfield, Missouri and is engaged in the business of fulfilling government and corporate contracts for freight trucking services.\nThe following discussion highlights our plan of operations and the principal factors that have affected our financial condition as well as our liquidity and capital resources for the periods described. This discussion contains forward-looking statements. The following discussion and analysis are based on our financial statements, which we have prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting. You should read the discussion and analysis together with such financial statements and the related notes thereto.\nGeneral Overview\nThe Company was incorporated in the State of Delaware on October 22, 2010, and is a holding company based in Peoria, Arizona that owns operating subsidiaries that are in the businesses of fulfilling government and corporate contracts for freight trucking services and compressed natural gas ( CNG\u201d) service stations. Titan is the management company that oversees operations of the El Toro, Diamond Bar, and Blaine CNG service stations. As of June 30, 2017, El Toro ceased operations and all of the assets related to this site were written off. Blaine and Diamond Bar were formed in 2015. In March 2016, Diamond Bar began operations of its CNG station under a lease agreement with the State of California South Coast Air Quality Management District ( SCAQMD\u201d) in Diamond Bar, California. In February 2018, the Company entered into a management agreement with a third party to operate Diamond Bar. Under the terms of the agreement, the management company is responsible for all operating expenses and thereby receives all revenue related to the site. The Company discontinued construction of Blaine during the fourth quarter of 2017. EAF was originally organized on March 28, 2012 under the name Clean-n-Green Alternative Fuels, LLC\u201d in the State of Delaware. Effective May 1, 2012, EAF changed its name to Environmental Alternative Fuels, LLC.\u201d EVO CNG, EAF's wholly owned subsidiary, was originally organized in the State of Delaware on April 1, 2013 under the name EVO Trillium, LLC\u201d and subsequently changed its name to EVO CNG, LLC\u201d effective March 1, 2016. Together, EAF and EVO CNG operate six compressed natural gas fueling stations located in California, Texas, Arizona and Wisconsin.\nThunder Ridge was founded in Missouri during 2000 and its primary business is interstate highway contract trucking routes operated for the USPS. Graham was founded in 1972 and its primary business also is interstate highway contract trucking routes operated for the USPS.\nThe Company plans to expand operations into interstate contract trucking routes operated for the USPS by acquiring trucking companies that already operate in this market. The USPS has repeatedly stated its desire to reduce cost and streamline service providers. This growth strategy complements our existing CNG business as we believe the USPS strategy to reduce fuel consumption and increase fleet efficiency is beneficial to contract proposals that include alternative fuel options such as CNG. Upon acquiring Sheehy Mail in January 2019, EVO Inc. operates the largest CNG fleet servicing the USPS.\nGoing Concern\nThe Company is an early stage company in the process of acquiring several businesses with highway contract routes operated for the United States Postal Service ( USPS\u201d) and Compressed Natural Gas ( CNG\u201d) fuel stations. As of December 31, 2018, the Company has a working capital deficit of approximately $13.0 million, stockholders' deficit of approximately $10.3 million, and negative operating cashflows of $6.8 million. Management anticipates rectifying these deficits with additional public and private offerings. Also, the Company is evaluating certain cash flow improvement measures by consolidating costs with the acquired entities, the purchase of vehicles to reduce purchased transportation and repricing contracts with USPS. However, there can be no assurance that the Company will be successful in these efforts. Further, for the year ended December 31, 2018, the USPS accounted for 95% of the Company's total consolidated revenues. The loss of the USPS as a customer, or a significant reduction in the Company's relationship with the USPS would have a material adverse effect on the Company's business.\nThe accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern for the next twelve months from the issuance of these consolidated statements within the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K. However, the above conditions raise substantial doubt about the Company's ability to do so. The consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments to reflect the possible future effects on the recoverability and classification of assets or the amounts and classifications of liabilities that may result should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern for the next twelve months from the issuance of these consolidated statements within the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nTo meet its current and future obligations, the Company has taken the following steps to capitalize the business and successfully achieve its business plan during 2019:\nManagement is working with related party debt holders and equipment lenders to extend or convert existing debt. However, there can be no assurance that the Company will be successful in these efforts.\nOn January 2, 2019, the Company acquired Sheehy Mail a mail contractor headquartered in Waterloo, Wisconsin. Sheehy Mail operates 104 trucks that service 16 USPS contracts across 18 states.\nOn February 1, 2019, the Company acquired Ursa Major Corporation ( Ursa\u201d) and J.B. Lease Corporation ( J.B. Lease\u201d), a mail contractor located in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. Ursa operates 250 trucks that service 42 USPS contracts across 22 states.\nDuring February 2019, El Toro received a waiver from Tradition Capital Bank of its 2018 defaults of certain debt service coverage ratio, minimum tangible equity, and debt to equity ratio covenants in the El Toro SBA loan, which waiver also eliminates those covenants for 2019 and thereafter.\nOn April 30, 2019, the Company and Peck entered into a fourth amendment to the Purchase Agreement (the Fourth Purchase Agreement Amendment\u201d). The Fourth Purchase Agreement Amendment extended the April 30, 2019 portion of the original maturity date to June 30, 2019. As of December 31, 2018, the outstanding balance was $2,386,778.\nThe cash balance as of December 31, 2018 was $1,630,022 and is sufficient to cover the negative cash flows generated from operations through the first half of 2019. Management is in the process of identifying sources of capital through debt refinancing and equity investments through one or more private placements. Management believes these additional sources will give the Company sufficient liquidity until it achieves projected positive cash flows from operations in the third quarter of 2019.\nSources of Revenue\nTitan was founded in 2012 and for the first four years only had management fee revenues. Beginning in 2016 Titan generated revenues from its CNG stations El Toro and Diamond Bar, and with the acquisition of EAF, the Company generated revenue from six stations beginning February 2017. With the acquisition of Thunder Ridge on June 1, 2018, and Graham on November 18, 2018, the Company has begun to recognize revenue from interstate highway contract routes. The transportation services include operations in Alabama, California, Florida, Georgia, Louisiana, Maryland, Michigan, Mississippi, Missouri, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Tennessee, and Texas.\nKey Trends\nInterstate Highway Contracts\nThe USPS has for more than 100 years contracted with third parties for the transportation of mail. The contractors competitively bid on transportation contracts that detail the movement of mail between processing facilities destination post offices and destination mailing addresses. The USPS evaluates the bids based on price, past performance, operational plans, financial resources, and the use of innovation or alternative fuels. The contracts are generally two to six years and are renewable for additional terms, usually indefinitely. As of September 30, 2018, there were 5,509 routes contracted with the USPS, utilizing 2,240 contractors with contracts totaling $3.3 billion.\nDuring July and August 2018, Thunder Ridge was awarded seven Dynamic Route Optimization (DRO) contracts with the USPS. These awards expand Thunder Ridge's operations into five states-California, Louisiana, Florida, Texas, and Michigan. This is in addition to the seven other states it services through 12 contracts with the USPS. Under the seven contracts, operations will include locations in Santa Clarita, California, Flint, Michigan, Austin, Texas, Pensacola, Florida, the Northern Bay of California, Baltimore, Maryland, and Baton Rouge, Louisiana. Additionally, the new contracts will provide a larger network for the development of new transportation opportunities. The annual contract revenues for the seven DRO contracts are approximately $26 million.\nAs part of the Graham acquisition in November 2018, the Company gained three additional USPS contracts serving Tennessee, Alabama, Georgia, and Mississippi which generate approximately $1.6 million in revenue annually.\nCNG\nIn general, CNG has become the primary alternative fueling choice for truck and bus fleets operating in the $134 billion fleet fueling market. Natural gas is sold on a gas gallon equivalent ( GGE\u201d) basis and as of December 2018 was selling at an average price nationally of approximately $2.19 per GGE versus average prices of gasoline and diesel of $2.27 and $2.98 per gallon, respectively. In addition, CNG is a significantly cleaner fuel than is gasoline or diesel. With increased focus on the environment, the benefits from natural gas-powered vehicles have an immediate positive impact on the issues of air quality, U.S. energy security and public health. Using renewable CNG can result in greater than 95% less greenhouse gases than traditional petroleum products, and because CNG fuel systems are completely sealed, CNG vehicles produce no evaporative emissions, which are a common hazard when using liquid fuel. Also, CNG creates less engine wear, thereby making its use even more desirable. As of December 2018, there were approximately 1,700 public CNG stations in the United States, compared to over 125,000 gasoline stations across the country.\nDuring December 2017 we received a $0.50 per GGE federal tax credit for each GGE sold. In some cases, we share this credit with our CNG customers. The federal tax credit program had not been approved for fiscal year 2018 by the time this Report on Form 10K was available to be issued.\nAnticipated Future Trends\nIn 2014, the USPS announced plans to significantly reduce their number of contractors from over 4,000 in 2014 to less 1,000 by 2022. The USPS's goal is to manage fewer relationships and work with larger prime contractors. The USPS is in the process of taking all of the contracts in a defined geographical area and consolidating them into one contract. It is estimated that over $1 billion in USPS contracts will become available in the next five years, which affords the opportunity for the Company to grow organically in addition to growing through acquisition.\nThe Company expects to further increase its footprint into the transportation industry by owning and operating transportation companies. The Company intends to acquire additional transportation companies that have won contracts to provide trucking services for the USPS. Our CNG business complements this expansion strategy since fueling our CNG trucks at our own stations in cases where our routes are located near our CNG facilities will allow us to implement cost saving strategies that will increase profitability and increase our presence in this space.\nIf we are successful in our future acquisition strategy, we will competitively bid on transportation contracts that detail the movement of mail between processing facilities, destination post offices and destination mailing addresses. Those contracts typically provide for an initial four-year term and are often renewed to the incumbent service provider if appropriate services have been performed. The contracts are bid and performed in accordance with various requirements, including, but not limited to requirements under the Service Contract Act, Department of Transportation regulations (federal and state), and other applicable local and state regulations.\nAlthough natural gas continues to be less expensive than gasoline and diesel in most markets, the price of natural gas has been significantly closer to the prices of gasoline and diesel in recent years as a result of declining oil prices, thereby reducing the price advantage of natural gas as a vehicle fuel. We anticipate that, over the long term, the prices for gasoline and diesel will continue to be higher than the price of natural gas as a vehicle fuel and will increase overall, which would improve the cost savings of natural gas as a vehicle fuel compared to diesel and gasoline. However, the amount of time needed for oil prices to recover from their recent decline is uncertain and we expect that adoption of natural gas as a vehicle fuel, growth in our customer base and gross revenue will be negatively affected until oil prices increase and this price advantage increases. Our belief that natural gas will continue, over the long term, to be a cheaper vehicle fuel than gasoline or diesel is based in large part on the growth in United States natural gas production in recent years.\nWe believe natural gas fuels are well-suited for use by vehicle fleets that consume high volumes of fuel, refuel at centralized locations or along well-defined routes and/or are increasingly required to reduce emissions. The nature of our USPS contracts and some of our general freight transit lanes fits this profile. As a result, we believe there will be growth in the consumption of natural gas as a vehicle fuel among certain vehicle fleets. However, we expect competition in the market for natural gas vehicle fuel to remain steady in the near-term. To the extent competition increases, we would be subject to greater pricing pressure, reduced operating margins and potentially fewer expansion opportunities.\nRecent Developments\nDuring 2018, the Company converted Titan subordinated notes payable and interest of $1,363,885 (the Junior Bridge Notes\u201d) into 272,777 shares of common stock.\nDuring 2018, the Company converted Titan promissory notes payable and interest of $688,958 (the Senior Bridge Notes\u201d) into 275,583 shares of common stock. In addition, two Senior Bridge Notes and the related interest were paid in full for $800,000 and $272,000, respectively. As of December 31, 2018, the outstanding balance of the Senior Bridge notes is $75,000 with interest accruing at 15% per year.\nDuring 2018, the Company converted three promissory notes (the Minn Shares Notes\u201d) in the aggregate of principal and interest of $468,655 to Joseph H. Whitney, The Globe Resources Group, LLC and Richard E. Gilbert into 187,462 units. Each unit included one share of common stock and one warrant to purchase one share of common stock with an exercise prices of $2.50 exercisable ten years after issuance.\nOn February 1, 2017, pursuant to the EAF Exchange Agreement, the Company acquired all of the membership interests of EAF. As consideration for the EAF Interests, EVO, Inc. issued a promissory note payable at maturity in the principal amount of $3.8 million to Danny Cuzick (the Senior Promissory Note\u201d) and convertible promissory notes in the aggregate principal amount of $9.5 million to the EAF Members (the Convertible Notes\u201d). The Senior Promissory Note bears interest at 7.5% per year with a default interest rate of 12.5% per year and has a maturity date of the earlier of (a) the date that is ten days after the initial closing of a private offering of capital stock of EVO, Inc. in an amount not less than $10 million (a Private Offering\u201d); (b) December 31, 2017 and (c) declaration by Danny Cuzick of an event of default under the Senior Promissory Note. The Convertible Notes bear interest at 1.5% per year and have a maturity date of February 1, 2026. The Company imputed an interest rate of 5.1% on the convertible promissory notes. During 2018, the Senior Promissory Note maturity date was extended to July 2019. Principal and interest are due at maturity.\nThe Convertible Notes were initially convertible into 1,400,000 shares (the Transaction Shares\u201d) of EVO, Inc.'s Common Stock, subject to adjustment for any stock splits, combinations or similar transactions, representing approximately 81.1% of EVO Inc.'s total outstanding shares of Common Stock on a post-transaction basis. Accordingly, the conversion of the Convertible Notes would result in a change in control of EVO Inc. The number of Transaction Shares were subject to increase to equal 70% of the issued and outstanding Common Stock if the issuance of Common Stock pursuant to a private offering of Common Stock of up to $2 million and the conversion of Minn Shares' and Titan's junior bridge notes, senior bridge notes, convertible promissory notes, and certain accounts payable into Common Stock would otherwise cause the Transaction Shares to represent less than 70% of the issued and outstanding Common Stock. Pursuant to the terms of the EAF Exchange Agreement, the EAF Members are entitled to demand registration rights and piggyback registration rights with respect to the Transaction Shares upon customary terms, limitations, exceptions and conditions. The Convertible Notes are secured by all of the assets of EAF and the EAF Interests, which EVO, Inc. pledged to the EAF Members as security for the Convertible Notes. In October 2018, the Company amended the Convertible Notes to eliminate the variable number of shares issuable under the conversion feature to a fixed amount of 7,000,000 shares upon conversion.\nEach Convertible Note is convertible at the applicable holder's option upon (1) consummation of a reorganization, merger or similar transaction where the Company is not the surviving or resulting entity or (2) the sale of all or substantially all of the Company's assets, subject to customary restrictions. The Convertible Notes are also subject to mandatory conversion at the Company's option beginning on the first anniversary of the issue date if: (i) the closing price of the common stock is greater than $10.00 and (ii) the average daily trading volume of shares of common stock has equaled 100,000 or more for the 30 days prior to the applicable date. Upon a conversion of the Convertible Notes, accrued interest may also be converted into shares of common stock at the greater of (1) 1.357, subject to adjustment for stock splits or combinations, or (2) the closing price of a share of common stock as reported on the business day that immediately precedes the date of the notice of conversion provided by the party making the election.\nIn connection with the closing of the EAF Exchange Agreement, on February 1, 2017, EVO, Inc. issued promissory notes to the EAF Members in the aggregate principal amount of $250,000. During 2018, the promissory notes were paid in full.\nIn connection with the closing of the EAF Exchange Agreement, on February 1, 2017, EVO, Inc. assumed a note payable from EAF to Danny Cuzick dated January 30, 2017 in the principal amount of $4.0 million (the EAF Note\u201d). The EAF Note is secured by all assets of EAF and is guaranteed by EVO, Inc. The EAF Note bears interest at 7.5% per annum with a default rate of 12.5% per annum and has a maturity date of the earlier of (a) February 1, 2020 and (b) declaration by Danny Cuzick of an event of default under the EAF Note. Principal and interest are due at maturity.\nOn April 6, 2017, the Company effected a 50-for-1 reverse stock split of its common stock pursuant to which each 50 shares of issued and outstanding common stock became one share of common stock (the Reverse Split\u201d). No fractional shares were issued as a result of the Reverse Split. All references to numbers of shares of common stock and per share amounts give retroactive effect to the Reverse Split for all periods presented.\nDuring July and August 2018, the Company issued $4,005,000 of Secured Convertible Promissory Notes ( Secured Convertible Notes\u201d). The Company paid debt issuance costs commissions of $524,987 in connection with the Secured Convertible Notes. They bear interest at 9.0%, compounded quarterly, and have a maturity date two years after issuance. The holders may agree, at their discretion, to add accrued interest in lieu of payment to the principal balance of the Secured Convertible Notes on the first day of each calendar quarter. The Secured Convertible Notes are secured by all the assets of the Company and are subordinate to the EAF notes. The holder may agree, at its discretion, to add accrued interest to the principal balance of the Secured Convertible Notes on the first day of each calendar quarter. The Secured Convertible Notes may not be prepaid prior to the first anniversary of the date of issuance but may be prepaid without penalty after the first anniversary of the date of issuance.\nThe Secured Convertible Notes are convertible into shares (the Note Shares\u201d) of the Company's common stock at a conversion rate of $2.50 per share of common stock at the holder's option: 1) at any time after the first anniversary of the date of issuance; or 2) at any time within 90 days after a triggering event,\u201d including a sale, reorganization, merger, or similar transaction where the Company is not the surviving entity. The Secured Convertible Notes are also subject to mandatory conversion at any time after the first anniversary of the date of issuance if the average volume of shares of common stock traded on the Nasdaq Capital Market, NYSE American Market or a higher tier of either exchange is 100,000 or more for the 10 trading days prior to the applicable date.\nThe Secured Convertible Notes also provide that the Company will prepare and file with the Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC\u201d), as promptly as reasonably practical following the issuance date of the Secured Convertible Notes, but in no event later than 45 days following the issuance date, a registration statement on Form S-1 (the Registration Statement\u201d) covering the resale of the common stock and the warrant shares and as soon as reasonably practical thereafter effect such registration. As of the filing date, the Registration Statement, which was filed on February 11, 2019 and has not been declared effective. The Company will be required to pay liquidated damages of 1.0% of the outstanding principal amount of the Secured Convertible Notes each 30 days if the Registration Statement is not declared effective by the SEC within 180 days of the filing date of the Registration Statement.\nAs additional consideration for the Secured Convertible Notes, the Company issued warrants to the holders to purchase 1,602,000 shares of common stock at an exercise price of $2.50 per share, exercisable for ten years from the date of issuance.\nOn June 1, 2018, Company entered into an equity purchase agreement (the Purchase Agreement\u201d) with Billy (Trey) Peck Jr. ( Peck\u201d) pursuant to which the Company acquired all of the issued and outstanding shares (the TR Shares\u201d) in Thunder Ridge Transport, Inc., a Missouri corporation ( Thunder Ridge\u201d), from Peck and Thunder Ridge became a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company. Thunder Ridge is based in Springfield, Missouri and is engaged in the business of fulfilling government and corporate contracts for freight trucking services.\nAs consideration for the TR Shares, the Company issued a promissory note dated June 1, 2018, in the principal amount of $2,500,000 to Peck (the TR Note\u201d). The TR Note bears interest at 6% per year with a default interest rate of 9% per year and had an original maturity date of the earlier of (a) the date the Company raises $40,000,000 in public or private offerings of debt or equity; (b) December 31, 2018, and (c) termination of Peck's employment with the Company by the Company without cause or by Peck for good reason. The TR Note is secured by all of the assets of Thunder Ridge pursuant to a security agreement dated June 1, 2018, between the Company, Thunder Ridge, and Peck (the Security Agreement\u201d), and is also secured by the TR Shares, which the Company pledged to Peck pursuant to a stock pledge agreement dated June 1, 2018, between the Company and Peck (the Pledge Agreement\u201d). On December 26, 2018, the Company and Peck entered into an amendment to the Purchase Agreement (the First Purchase Agreement Amendment\u201d). The First Purchase Agreement Amendment extended the December 31, 2018, portion of the original maturity date to February 28, 2019. On February 28, 2019, the Company and Peck entered into a second amendment to the Purchase Agreement (the Second Purchase Agreement Amendment\u201d). The Second Purchase Agreement Amendment extended the December 31, 2018, portion of the original maturity date to April 30, 2019, On April 30, 2019, the Company and Peck entered into a fourth amendment to the Purchase Agreement (the Fourth Purchase Agreement Amendment\u201d). The Fourth Purchase Agreement Amendment extended the April 30, 2019, portion of the original maturity date to June 30, 2019. The note calls for monthly principal payments of $14,000. All accrued and unpaid interest is due at maturity.\nIf the Company fails to repay the amounts outstanding under the TR Note on or before June 30, 2019, Peck has the right to require the Company to return the TR Shares and effectively rescind the sale of the TR Shares to the Company.\nOn April 12, 2019, the Company and Peck entered into a third amendment to the Purchase Agreement ( Third Purchase Agreement Amendment\u201d) to delete and replace the working capital exhibit to the equity purchase agreement. Pursuant to the Third Purchase Agreement Amendment, target working capital was reduced from $(638,094) to $(1,620,022).\nSources of Liquidity and Anticipated Capital Expenditures and Other Uses of Cash\nHistorically, our principal sources of liquidity have consisted of cash on hand, cash provided by financing activities, and cash provided by investors. Our cash position at December 31, 2018, was approximately $1,600,000 and we had a working capital deficit of $13 million. Our current liquidity will be impacted by the results of current operations; the ability to raise funds; and ability to manage the maturities of our debt obligations. The December 31, 2018 cash balance is sufficient to cover the negative cash flows generated from operations through the first half of 2019. Management is in the process of identifying sources of capital through debt refinancing and equity investments through one or more private placements. Management believes these additional sources will give the Company sufficient liquidity until it achieves projected positive cash flows from operations in the third quarter of 2019. There is no assurance that we will be able to raise sufficient capital or renegotiate our existing debt arrangements.\nWe incur liquidity risk as trucking is a capital-intensive operation. As we acquire additional assets, contractual awards, joint ventures, or new acquisitions, our liquidity objective is to maintain access to a diverse set of on and off-balance sheet liquidity sources. We seek to maintain liquidity sources to maintain our expected future obligations in the event we are not able to raise new funding due to our funding efforts. The liquidity risks that we are exposed to could arise from a variety of scenarios. Our liquidity management strategy includes a number of elements, including, but not limited to:\n \u25cf Cash from Operations \n \u25cf Debt refinancing \n \u25cf Maintaining unencumbered liquid assets \n \u25cf Public offering \nAs of December 31, 2018, the Company had total indebtedness of approximately $26,000,000 (net of approximately $8,100,000 of unamortized debt discount and debt issuance costs), of which approximately $6,900,000 is classified as current debt. Our total consolidated interest payment obligations relating to our indebtedness was approximately $1,900,000, which included amortization of debt discount and debt issuance costs of approximately $500,000 for the year ended December 31, 2018.\nWe may also elect to invest additional amounts in companies, assets or joint ventures in the vehicle or services industries, or use capital for other activities or pursuits, subject to the availability of capital. We will need to raise additional capital to fund any capital expenditures, investments or debt repayments that we cannot fund through available cash or cash generated by operations or that we cannot fund through other sources, such as with the sale of our stock. We may not be able to raise capital when needed on terms that are favorable to us, or at all. Any inability to raise capital may impair our ability to build new stations, develop natural gas fueling infrastructure, invest in strategic transactions or acquisitions or repay our outstanding indebtedness and may reduce our ability to grow our business and generate sustained or increased revenues. See Liquidity and Capital Resources\u201d below.\nBusiness Risks and Uncertainties\nOur business and prospects are exposed to numerous risks and uncertainties. For more information, see Risk Factors - Risks Related to the Company;\u201d Risks Related to the Company's Trucking Operations;\u201d and Risk Factors - Risks Related to the CNG Industry.\u201d\nResults from Operations\nFiscal Year Ended December 31, 2018, Compared to Fiscal Year Ended December 31, 2017\nRevenue. EVO Inc. has refocused its corporate strategy to leverage our footprint of CNG stations and relationships with owner-operators to build a national fleet of haulers primarily focused on servicing the U.S. Postal Service (USPS). While we expect the vast majority of our future sales growth in the trucking segment, our CNG stations will remain as a complementary part of our strategy. The CNG stations provide us with a cost effective fueling source for our own fleet and enable us to respond to the USPS' preference for environmentally-friendly fuel alternatives in the contract bidding process. We continue to operate public and private CNG filling stations.\nThe combination of the company's recent pivot into the trucking industry and acquisitions of Thunder Ridge and Graham in June 2018 and November 2018, respectively, make many of the traditional year over year variance comparisons irrelevant for this reporting period. Variance commentary of the CNG segment, which operated throughout 2018 and 2017 is as follows:\nCNG revenue: Sales for the CNG stations were $1,348,301 and $1,968,563 for the years December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. The decrease resulted from revenue loss of approximately $169,000 from the Diamond Bar station due to the third-party management agreement implemented during 2018, and approximately $340,000 at the Tolleson station due to a customer's discontinuation of its CNG fleet. In addition, the Company experienced an overall downward trend in CNG sales over the past year.\nThe third-party management agreement was executed with the management company to work with SCAQMD to renegotiate ownership of the CNG station. Upon SCAQMD's approval, the Company will transfer ownership to the management company.\nCNG operating expense: We changed the format of the statement of operations to mirror the trucking industry presentation norms since trucking now represents 95% of our revenue. Costs formerly classified as CNG cost of sales have now been moved to the Operating Expense section with the label CNG expenses. This expense line is comprised of natural gas, electricity, federal excise tax, vendor use fuel tax and credit card fees. The margins at the Titan and EVO CNG stations were approximately 33% and 24% for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. Margins decreased primarily because the site management fee to operate the stations remained fixed while sales volume fell.\nTrucking revenue: The Company earned trucking revenue for the first time in 2018 as a result of the Thunder Ridge and Graham acquisitions in June and November 2018, respectively. Approximately 95% of the trucking revenue is derived from contracts with the USPS to haul U.S. mail. The remainder of the revenue is derived from corporate freight hauling. The USPS contracts are typically four years in duration and are priced on a rate per mile basis which varies by contract. The USPS contracts also include a monthly fuel adjustment.\nPayroll: Of the Company's 290 employees at year-end, 269 were drivers. Driver wages are fixed per contract with USPS and are eligible for renegotiation with USPS on a bi-annual basis. In addition to an hourly wage that is set by the Department of Labor, drivers also earn a $5.11 hourly rate for benefits. The Company is installing transportation management automation in its fleet to improve driver scheduling and more closely manage labor productivity.\nPurchased transportation: Purchased transportation represents payments to subcontracted third party companies that serve as independent contractors for particular routes. These contracts are negotiated on a rate per mile basis and the subcontracting company is responsible for supplying all resources to perform the service including, but not limited to labor, equipment, fuel and associated expenses. As of December 31, 2018, the Company had 15 independent contractors, who accounted for approximately 38% of the Company's total miles for the year ended December 31, 2018.\nGeneral and administrative expenses were $3,294,111 and $2,416,071 for the year ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. Approximately $592,000 of the increase is attributable to Thunder Ridge expenses and $391,000 is attributable to business license and regulatory fees.\nEquipment rent: Presently, the Company rents and leases the majority of its trucks and trailers through a combination of short and long-term arrangements. Efforts are currently underway to rebalance the fleet towards having more company-owned assets to achieve the expected returns, subject to financing availability\nInsurance and Claims: Insurance and claims is comprised of auto liability and workers comp expense related to the trucking segment of the business.\nFuel: Fuel expense is comprised of diesel and CNG fuel required to operate the truck fleet. The Company manages fuel cost by negotiating volume discounts from rack fuel rates with select vendors.\nDepreciation and amortization: Approximately $655,000 of the Company's expense is related to its CNG stations and approximately $304,000 is related to the trucking segment.\nMaintenance and Supplies: Maintenance and supplies expense primarily includes the costs to maintain the fleet.\nOperating Supplies and Expense: Operating and supplies expense includes all other direct costs in the trucking segment such as onboard technology (approximately $178,000), truck parking (approximately $130,000) and tolls (approximately $50,000).\nImpairment: During the year, the Company impaired a $240,000 CNG asset that was previously held for sale. Impairment charges in 2017 totaled $4,906,217, comprised of $3,993,730 for goodwill, $106,270 for customer lists and $806,217 for El Toro's fixed assets.\nInterest expense. Interest expense increased to $1,892,375 in 2018 from $1,658,104 in 2017. Interest expense incurred during 2018 included $157,000 from Thunder Ridge from factoring and the fuel discount.\nWarrant expense. Warrant expense increased to $171,813 in 2018 from $77,500 in 2017. The warrant expense is primarily for issuance of warrants for acquisitions and warrants issued with capital raised in equity transactions. Warrant expense represents the estimated fair value calculated on the date of issuance of the warrant using the Black-Scholes option pricing model, which requires the input of subjective assumptions, including the expected term of warrants, expected stock price volatility, and expected dividends. These estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application of management's judgment.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nFiscal Year Ended December 31, 2018, Compared to Fiscal Year Ended December 31, 2017\nWe had cash and cash equivalents of $1,630,022 and $83,867 at December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. During the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, net cash used by operations was $6,782,936 and $891,395, respectively. We historically funded our operating losses primarily from the issuance of equity, convertible notes payable, and stockholder debt.\nChanges in Liquidity\nCash and Cash Equivalents. Cash and cash equivalents were $1,630,022 and $83,867 at December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. The increase is primarily attributable to financing activities.\nOperating Activities. Net cash used in operations was $6,782,936 and $891,395 as of December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. For the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, the Company had a net loss of $6,576,692 and $9,160,893, respectively. Significant changes in cash used in operations during these periods included:\n \u25cf Accounts receivable increased by $4,162,043 mainly from revenues increased since the acquisition of Thunder Ridge. \n \u25cf Liabilities increased due to the Company's lack of cash and timely payments. In addition, the increase is generated from subcontractor expense paid in the following month related to the Thunder Ridge acquisition and an increase in accrued compensation by $1,300,000 also from the acquisition of Thunder Ridge. \n \u25cf Non-cash operating activities included in the statement of operations include $392,209 from the accretion of debt discount, $958,945 from depreciation and amortization, $171,813 from warrant expense, $491,475 from stock-based compensation and warrant-based compensation, and $234,000 for Series A Preferred Stock issued in exchange for advisory services. \nInvesting Activities. Net cash (used in)/provided by investing was $(170,000) and $8,757 for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. The Company purchased $204,000 of equipment and received $34,000 in proceeds from the sale of assets in 2018. The 2017 investing activity was de minimis.\nFinancing Activities. Net cash provided by financing activities was $8,499,091 and $941,561 for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. The cash provided by financing activities in 2018 consisted of $2,500,000 from the sale of common stock, gross proceeds of $4,005,000, less $524,987 in debt issuance costs from secured convertible debt, and $4,100,341 from advances from factoring receivables. Cash received in 2018 was reduced by $247,909 in payments on the SBA and equipment loans, $19,052 in payments towards the fuel advance, $250,000 used to fully repay the working capital notes - related party, $45,930 in loan payments to related parties, $113,222 in payments on notes to shareholders, and $800,000 in payments on the subordinated convertible senior notes payable to stockholders. Cash provided by financing activities in 2017 consisted of $332,859 in stockholders' advances, $310,000 in proceeds from the sale of common stock, and proceeds of $400,000 from issuance of senior debt. Cash received in 2017 was partially offset by $101,298 in payments on the SBA loan.\nOur future liquidity and capital requirements will be influenced by numerous factors, including the extent and duration of future operating losses, the level and timing of future sales and expenditures, working capital required to support our business expansion, the level of our outstanding indebtedness and principal and interest we are obligated to pay on our indebtedness, our capital expenditure requirements (which will consist primarily of truck purchases in the future), demand for trucking services, the continuing acceptance of our product in the marketplace, competing technologies, market and regulatory developments, ongoing facility requirements, and potential strategic transactions.\nDebt Compliance\nAs of December 31, 2018, the Company had total indebtedness of approximately $26,000,000, (net of approximately $8,100,000 of unamortized debt discount and debt issuance costs), of which approximately $6,900,000 is classified as current debt. Our total consolidated interest payment obligations relating to our indebtedness was approximately $1,900,000 which included the amortization of debt discount and debt issue costs of approximately $500,000 for the year ended December 31, 2018. For the year ending December 31, 2018 the Subordinated convertible senior note payable to stockholders was in default for $75,000. Subsequent to year end, the financial ratio covenants with the SBA loan were waived for 2018 and eliminated for all future periods.\nExisting Indebtedness\nOn December 31, 2014, Titan entered into a co-borrower arrangement with El Toro for a $1,300,000 U.S. Small Business Administration (SBA) note (the SBA Agreement\u201d). The proceeds from the note were received by El Toro. The note bears interest at 5.50% for the first five years, then adjusted to the SBA LIBOR base rate, plus 2.35% for the remaining five years. The note requires interest only payments for the first twelve months. Commencing January 2016, the note requires monthly principal and interest payments of $15,288. The note matures March 2024, is secured by substantially all of Titan's business assets and is personally guaranteed by certain former members of Titan. The Company issued 35,491 units (equivalent to 31,203 common shares) to those members as compensation for the guarantee. As of December 31, 2018, the outstanding balance was $950,582.

Accordingly, the conversion of the Convertible Notes would result in a change in control of the Company.

These estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application of management's judgment. Expected volatilities used in the valuation model are based on the average volatility of the Company's stock. The risk-free rate for the expected term of the option is based on the United States Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant.

If the closing price on all domestic securities exchanges on which the Common Stock may at the time be listed exceeds $6.00 per share for 30 consecutive trading days and the daily trading volume of the common stock is at least 20,000 shares for that same period, each share of Preferred Stock will automatically convert to one share of the Company's common stock.\nStock Options\nOn April 12, 2018, the Company's board of directors approved the EVO Transportation and Energy Services, Inc. 2018 Stock Incentive Plan (the 2018 Plan\u201d) pursuant to which a total of 4,250,000 shares of common stock have been reserved for issuance to eligible employees, consultants, and directors of the Company.

As of December 31, 2018, there were no shares of restricted stock outstanding.\nThe fair value of each award is estimated on the date of grant. Stock option values are estimated using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model, which requires the input of subjective assumptions, including the expected term of the option award, expected stock price volatility, and expected dividends. These estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application of management's judgment. For purposes of estimating the expected term of options granted, the Company aggregates option recipients into groups that have similar option exercise behavioral traits. Expected volatilities used in the valuation model are based on the average volatility of the Company's stock. The risk-free rate for the expected term of the option is based on the United States Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant. The valuation model assumes no dividends. There is no estimated forfeiture rate. During the year ended December 31, 2018, the Company has recorded stock-based compensation expense of $459,735 associated with stock options.

As of December 31, 2018, there was no intrinsic value to the stock options.\nWarrants\nThe fair value of the warrants is estimated on the date of issuance using the Black-Scholes option pricing model, which requires the input of subjective assumptions, including the expected term of the warrants, expected stock price volatility, and expected dividends. These estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application of management's judgment. Expected volatilities used in the valuation model are based on the average volatility of the Company's stock. The risk-free rate for the expected term of the option is based on the United States Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nOperating Leases\nThe Company leased office space in Minnesota on a month to month basis with payments of $977 per month through June 2017.\nThunder Ridge leases approximately 4,300 square feet of office space from 319 N.

The preparation of consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements, and revenues and expenses recorded during the reporting periods.\nOn a periodic basis we evaluate our estimates based on historical experience and various other assumptions we believe are reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results could differ from those estimates under different assumptions or conditions. For further information on our significant accounting policies, see note 1 to our consolidated financial statements included in this report.\nWe believe the following critical accounting policies involve the most significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements.\nBasis of Presentation\nThese financial statements represent the consolidated financial statements of EVO Transportation & Energy Services, Inc. ( EVO Inc.\u201d or the Company\u201d), and its wholly owned subsidiaries.\nGoing Concern\nThe Company is an early stage company in the process of acquiring several businesses with highway contract routes operated for the United States Postal Service ( USPS\u201d) and Compressed Natural Gas ( CNG\u201d) fuel stations. As of December 31, 2018, the Company has a working capital deficit of approximately $13.0 million, stockholders' deficit of approximately $10.3 million, and negative operating cashflows of $6.8 million. Management anticipates rectifying these deficits with additional public and private offerings. Also, the Company is evaluating certain cash flow improvement measures by consolidating costs with the acquired entities, the purchase of vehicles to reduce purchased transportation and repricing contracts with USPS. However, there can be no assurance that the Company will be successful in these efforts. Further, for the year ended December 31, 2018, the USPS accounted for 95% of the Company's total consolidated revenues. The loss of the USPS as a customer, or a significant reduction in the Company's relationship with the USPS would have a material adverse effect on the Company's business.\nThe accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern from the issuance of these consolidated statements within the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K. However, the above conditions raise substantial doubt about the Company's ability to do so. The consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments to reflect the possible future effects on the recoverability and classification of assets or the amounts and classifications of liabilities that may result should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern from the issuance of these consolidated statements within the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nTo meet its current and future obligations, the Company has taken the following steps to capitalize the business and successfully achieve its business plan during 2019:\nManagement is working with related party debt holders and equipment lenders to extend or convert existing debt. However, there can be no assurance that the Company will be successful in these efforts.\nOn January 2, 2019, the Company acquired Sheehy Mail a mail contractor headquartered in Waterloo, Wisconsin. Sheehy Mail operates 104 trucks that service 16 USPS contracts across 18 states.\nOn February 1, 2019, the Company acquired Ursa Major Corporation ( Ursa\u201d) and J.B. Lease Corporation ( J.B. Lease\u201d), a mail contractor located in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. Ursa operates 250 trucks that service 42 USPS contracts across 22 states.\nDuring February 2019, El Toro received a waiver from Tradition Capital Bank of its 2018 defaults of certain debt service coverage ratio, minimum tangible equity, and debt to equity ratio covenants in the El Toro SBA loan, which waiver also eliminates those covenants for 2019 and thereafter.\nOn April 1, 2019, the Company issued 117,092 shares of common stock to settle the Separation Agreement with the former officer. The settlement included reimbursement of the $37,500 of advances from the related party and approximately $300,000 of the accounts payable - related party.\nOn April 30, 2019, the Company and Peck entered into a fourth amendment to the Purchase Agreement (the Fourth Purchase Agreement Amendment\u201d). The Fourth Purchase Agreement Amendment extended the April 30, 2019 portion of the original maturity date to June 30, 2019. As of December 31, 2018, the outstanding balance was $2,386,778.\nThe cash balance as of December 31, 2018 was $1,630,022 and is sufficient to cover the negative cash flows generated from operations through the first half of 2019. Management is in the process of identifying sources of capital through debt refinancing and equity investments with private placement of the common stock. Management believes these additional sources will give the Company sufficient liquidity until it achieves projected positive cash flows from operations in the third quarter of 2019.\nUse of Estimates\nThe preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ( GAAP\u201d) requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.\nThe consolidated financial statements include some amounts that are based on management's best estimates and judgments. The most significant estimates relate to revenue recognition, goodwill and long-lived intangible asset valuations, fixed asset impairment assessments, debt discount, beneficial conversion feature, contingencies, purchase price allocation related to the Thunder Ridge acquisition, and going concern. These estimates may be adjusted as more current information becomes available, and any adjustment could be significant. The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.\nAccounts Receivable\nThe Company provides an allowance for doubtful accounts equal to the estimated uncollectible amounts. The Company's estimate is based on historical collection experience and a review of the current status of the accounts receivable. It is reasonably possible that the Company's estimate of the allowance for doubtful accounts will change and that losses ultimately incurred could differ materially from the amounts estimated in determining the allowance.\nProperty, Equipment and Land\nProperty and equipment are stated at cost. Depreciation is provided utilizing the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives for owned assets, ranging from five to 15 years.\nGoodwill and Intangibles\nGoodwill\nGoodwill represents the excess of the purchase price of a business acquisition over the net fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed. Goodwill and intangible assets that do not have finite lives are not amortized, but rather are assessed for impairment at least annually or more frequently if certain impairment indicators are present.\nThe Company evaluates goodwill on an annual basis in the fourth quarter or more frequently if management believes indicators of impairment exist. Such indicators could include but are not limited to 1) a significant adverse change in legal factors or in business climate, 2) unanticipated competition, or 3) an adverse action or assessment by a regulator. The Company first assesses qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, including goodwill. If management concludes that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, management conducts a two-step quantitative goodwill impairment test. The first step of the impairment test involves comparing the fair value of the applicable reporting unit with its carrying value. The Company estimates the fair values of its reporting units using a combination of the income or discounted cash flows approach and the market approach, which utilizes comparable companies' data. If the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds the reporting unit's fair value, management performs the second step of the goodwill impairment test. The second step of the goodwill impairment test involves comparing the implied fair value of the affected reporting unit's goodwill with the carrying value of that goodwill. The amount by which the carrying value of the goodwill exceeds its implied fair value, if any, is recognized as an impairment loss.\nIntangibles\nIntangible assets consist of finite lived and indefinite lived intangibles. The Company's finite lived intangibles include favorable leases, customer relationships and the trade name. Finite lived intangibles are amortized over their estimated useful lives. For the Company's lease related intangibles, the estimated useful life is based on the agreement of a one-time payment of $1 and the term of the mortgages, of the properties owned by the Company of approximately five years. For the Company's trade names and customer list the estimated lives are based on life cycle of a customer of approximately five years.\nLong-Lived Assets\nThe Company evaluates the recoverability of long-lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that an asset's carrying amount may not be recoverable. Such circumstances could include, but are not limited to (1) a significant decrease in the market value of an asset, (2) a significant adverse change in the extent or manner in which an asset is used, or (3) an accumulation of costs significantly in excess of the amount originally expected for the acquisition of an asset. The Company measures the carrying amount of the asset against the estimated undiscounted future cash flows associated with it. Should the sum of the expected future net cash flows be less than the carrying value of the asset being evaluated, an impairment loss would be recognized. The impairment loss would be calculated as the amount by which the carrying value of the asset exceeds its fair value. The fair value is measured based on quoted market prices, if available.\nIf quoted market prices are not available, the estimate of fair value is based on various valuation techniques, including the discounted value of estimated future cash flows. The evaluation of asset impairment requires the Company to make assumptions about future cash flows over the life of the asset being evaluated. These assumptions require significant judgment and actual results may differ from assumed and estimated amounts. The Company assesses the useful lives and possible impairment of the fixed assets or goodwill and intangibles when an event occurs that may trigger such review. Factors considered important which could trigger a review include:\nSignificant under-performance of the stations or transportation service contracts relative to historical or projected future operating results;\nSignificant negative economic trends in the CNG industry or freight trucking services industry; and\nIdentification of other impaired assets within a reporting unit.\nAdoption of New Standard Related to Revenue Recognition and Revenue Recognition\nAdoption of New Standard Related to Revenue Recognition\nOn January 1, 2018, the Company adopted Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Accounting Standards Codification Topic 606) ( Topic 606\u201d or new guidance\u201d) retrospectively. The adoption of Topic 606 did not have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements. The new guidance had no impact on the timing or classification of the Company's cash flows as reported in the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows. The Company did not record any adjustments as a result of applying Topic 606.\nRevenue Recognition\nTrucking Operations\nUSPS - USPS trucking operations generates revenue from transportation services under multi-year contracts with the USPS, generally on a rate per mile basis that adjusts monthly for fuel pricing indexes.\n \u25cf Contract Identification - Each delivery represents a distinct service that is a separately identified performance obligation for each contract. A single delivery may comprise of multiple stops prior to completion. Therefore, a legally enforceable contract is executed by both parties at the first point of pickup for each delivery. Although the Company has master agreements with the USPS, these master agreements only establish general terms. There is no financial obligation until the load is tendered/accepted and the Company takes possession of the load. \n \u25cf Performance Obligations - The Company's performance obligation arises from the annualized contract to transport USPS freight and is satisfied upon completion of each delivery. The Company's delivery, accessorial, and dedicated truck capacity represent a bundle of services that are highly interdependent and have the same pattern of transfer to the customer. These services are not capable of being distinct from one another. Thus, the Company's only performance obligation of USPS trucking operations is transportation services. \n \u25cf Transaction Price - The transaction price is based on the awarded agreement for the multi-year contract. The prices are based on miles travelled that adjusts monthly for fuel pricing indexes. Depending on the contract, the total transaction price may consist of mileage revenue, fuel adjustments, accessorial fees and fees for additional deliveries outside of the scope of the annual contract. There is no significant financing component in the transaction price, as the USPS generally pay within the contractual payment terms of 30 to 60 days. \n \u25cf Allocating Transaction Price to Performance Obligations - The transaction price is allocated in its entirety to transportation services, as this is the only performance obligation. \n \u25cf Revenue Recognition - Revenues are recognized over time as satisfaction of the promised contractual delivery agreements are completed, in an amount that reflects the rate per mile set in the contract. Generally, each delivery is completed within a single day. Deliveries may have scheduled completion times that carry over to the next day. In these instances, the delivery is determined to be a part of the contractual requirement for the day the initial pick-up is scheduled. The year ended December 31, 2018 is the first year the Company had USPS trucking revenues. As such, there is no change in timing of revenue recognition for USPS trucking revenues between reportable periods. \nFreight\n \u25cf Contract Identification - A legally enforceable contract is executed by both parties at the point of pickup at the shipper's location, as evidenced by a bill of lading. Although the Company may have master agreements with its customers, these master agreements only establish general terms. There is no financial obligation until the load is tendered/accepted and the Company takes possession of the load. \n \u25cf Performance Obligations - The Company's only performance obligation for freight trucking operations is transportation services. The Company's delivery, accessorial, and dedicated truck capacity represent a bundle of services that are highly interdependent and have the same pattern of transfer to the customer. These services are not capable of being distinct from one another and the Company does not offer them on a stand-alone basis. \n \u25cf Transaction Price -Depending on the contract, the total transaction price may consist of mileage revenue, fuel adjustments, and accessorial fees. There is no significant financing component in the transaction price, as the USPS generally pay within the contractual payment terms of 30 to 60 days. \n \u25cf Allocating Transaction Price to Performance Obligations - The transaction price is allocated in its entirety to transportation services, as this is the only performance obligation. \n \u25cf Revenue Recognition - Revenues are recognized over time as satisfaction of the promised contractual delivery agreements are completed. Generally, the Company does not have revenue in transit at period end. The year ended December 31, 2018 is the first year the Company had USPS trucking revenues. As such, there is no change in timing of revenue recognition for USPS trucking revenues between reportable periods. \nCNG Operations\nThe Company's CNG is sold predominately pursuant to contractual commitments. These contracts typically include a stand-ready obligation to supply natural gas daily.\n \u25cf Contract Identification - A legally enforceable contract is executed by both parties at the time a customer pumps the fuel from the station. Although the Company may have contractual agreements, these agreements only establish general terms. There is no financial obligation until the customer receives and consumes the benefits provided by the Company's performance as the stand-ready obligations are being performed \n \u25cf Performance Obligations - The Company's performance obligation arises from the sale of fuel to the customer. Thus, the Company's only performance obligation of CNG operations is CNG sales. \n \u25cf Transaction Price - The transaction price is based stand-alone selling price for fuel. The primary method used to estimate the stand-alone selling price for fuel is observable stand-alone sales, \n \u25cf Allocating Transaction Price to Performance Obligations - The transaction price is allocated in its entirety to CNG sales, as this is the only performance obligation. \n \u25cf Revenue Recognition - The Company recognizes revenue over time for the fuel sales as the customer receives and consumes the benefits. This does not represent a change from the Company's past practice, therefore, there was no change in timing of revenue recognition between periods on the adoption of ASC 605, Revenue Recognition. \nThere was no change in management's determination that the Company acts as the principal (rather than the agent) with respect to revenue recognition within its logistics businesses, under ASC 606, compared to ASC 605. Accordingly, the Company continues to recognize revenue on a gross basis, consistent with past practices.\nSignificant judgments involved in the Company's revenue recognition and corresponding accounts receivable balances include:\n \u25cf Estimating the allowance for doubtful accounts. The Company establishes an allowance for doubtful accounts based on historical experience and any known trends or uncertainties related to customer billing and account collectability. Management reviews the adequacy of its allowance for doubtful accounts on a quarterly basis. Uncollectible accounts are written off when deemed uncollectible, and accounts receivable are presented net of an allowance for doubtful accounts. \nRecently Issued Accounting Pronouncements\nSee Note 1 to our consolidated financial statements included in this report.\nSeasonality and Inflation\nDue to increased USPS volume, the Company's tractor productivity typically increases during the last quarter of each calendar year. At the same time, operating expenses increase and fuel efficiency declines because of engine idling and harsh weather creating higher accident frequency, increased claims and higher equipment repair expenditures. The Company also may suffer from weather-related or other events such as tornadoes, hurricanes, blizzards, ice storms, floods, fires, earthquakes and explosions. These events may disrupt fuel supplies, increase fuel costs, disrupt freight shipments or routes, affect regional economies, destroy the Company's assets or adversely affect the business or financial condition of customers, any of which could adversely affect the Company's results or make the Company's results more volatile.\nTo some extent, we experience seasonality with the CNG business. Natural gas vehicle fuel amounts consumed by some of our customers tend to be higher in summer months when fleet vehicles use more fuel to power their air conditioning systems. Natural gas commodity prices tend to be higher in the fall and winter months due to increased overall demand for natural gas for heating during these periods. With the USPS contracts the trucking segment experiences a significant increase in business from the last week of November through the end of December\nSince our inception, inflation has not significantly affected our operating results. However, costs for construction, repairs, maintenance, electricity and insurance are all subject to inflationary pressures, which could affect our ability to maintain our stations adequately, build new stations, expand our existing facilities or pursue additional CNG production projects, or could materially increase our operating costs.", "item_7_tables": "", "summary": " Here is a summary of the key points from the MD&A report:\n\n- EVO Inc. is a holding company with subsidiaries in trucking and CNG fueling station operations. \n\n- The company has experienced significant losses and negative cash flow, raising substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern. It is taking steps to improve its financial position through debt refinancing, equity investments, cost reductions, and acquisitions.\n\n- In 2018, the company acquired two trucking companies, resulting in trucking becoming its largest revenue source at 95% of total 2018 revenue. This makes comparison to 2017 revenue difficult. \n\n- Trucking revenue comes mainly from USPS contracts paid on a per mile basis. CNG revenue comes from fuel sales at stations.\n\n- The company adopted a new revenue recognition standard in 2018 with no material impact. Revenue is recognized over time as transportation services are provided for trucking and as fuel is consumed for CNG.\n\n- The company has significant debt obligations, with interest expense of $1.9 million in 2018. It is working to restructure and refinance debt.\n\n- The company is subject to seasonality, with higher trucking volumes and lower fuel efficiency in winter months. CNG demand rises in summer.\n\n- Inflation has not significantly impacted operating results but could raise costs for repairs, maintenance, electricity and insurance."}
