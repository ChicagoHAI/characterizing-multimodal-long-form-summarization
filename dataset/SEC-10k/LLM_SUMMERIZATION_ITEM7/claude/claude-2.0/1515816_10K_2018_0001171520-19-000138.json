MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe following discussion and analysis is based on, and should be read in conjunction with our audited historical financial statements and related notes thereto as of and for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017.\nOverview\nWe are a full service, vertically integrated, self-administered and self-managed REIT focused on the acquisition, ownership and management of single- and multi-tenant Class B industrial properties, including distribution centers, warehouses and light industrial properties. The Company Portfolio consists of 55 industrial properties located in ten states with an aggregate of approximately 12 million rentable square feet leased to 182 different tenants.\nOur strategy is to invest in single- and multi-tenant Class B industrial properties located primarily in secondary markets across the U.S.; however, we may make opportunistic acquisitions of Class A industrial properties or industrial properties located in primary markets. We seek to generate attractive risk-adjusted returns for our stockholders through a combination of dividends and capital appreciation.\nFactors That May Influence Future Results of Operations\nBusiness and Strategy\nOur core investment strategy is to acquire primarily Class B industrial properties predominantly in secondary markets across the U.S. We expect to acquire these properties through third-party purchases and structured sale-leasebacks where we believe we can achieve high initial yields and strong ongoing cash-on-cash returns. In addition, we may make opportunistic acquisitions of Class A industrial properties or industrial properties in primary markets that offer similar return characteristics.\nOur target markets are comprised primarily of secondary markets because we believe these markets tend to have less occupancy and rental rate volatility and less buyer competition relative to primary markets. We also believe that the systematic aggregation of such properties will result in a diversified portfolio that will produce sustainable risk-adjusted returns. Future results of operations may be affected, either positively or negatively, by our ability to effectively execute this strategy.\nWe also intend to pursue joint venture arrangements with institutional partners which could provide management fee income as well as residual profit-sharing income. Such joint ventures may involve investing in industrial assets that would be characterized as opportunistic or value-add investments. These may involve development or re-development strategies that may require significant up-front capital expenditures, lengthy lease-up periods and result in inconsistent cash flows. As such, these properties' risk profiles and return metrics would likely differ from the non-joint venture properties that we target for acquisition.\nRental Revenue and Tenant Recoveries\nWe receive income primarily from rental revenue and tenant recoveries from our properties. The amount of rental revenue generated by the Company Portfolio depends principally on the occupancy levels and lease rates at our properties, our ability to lease currently available space and space that becomes available as a result of lease expirations and on the rental rates at our properties. As of December 31, 2018, the Company Portfolio was approximately 95% occupied. Our occupancy rate is impacted by general market conditions in the geographic areas which our properties are located and the financial condition of tenants in our target markets.\nScheduled Lease Expirations\nOur ability to re-lease space subject to expiring leases will impact our results of operations and will be affected by economic and competitive conditions in the markets in which we operate and by the desirability of our individual properties. During the period from January 1, 2019 through to December 31, 2020, an aggregate of 26.9% of the annualized base rent leases in the Company Portfolio are scheduled to expire, which we believe will provide us an opportunity to adjust below market rates as market conditions continue to improve.\nDuring 2017 and 2018, leases for space totaling 1,995,389 square feet (16.7% of the Company Portfolio) either was subject to renewal or expired. Approximately 41.4% of the expired space was renewed and an additional 1,013,475 square feet (including a net 207,114 square feet of previously vacant space) was leased long term with new tenants. As of December 31, 2018, the vacancy rate of the Company Portfolio was 5.0%.\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2018, we negotiated 29 leases with durations in excess of six months encompassing 1,730,221 square feet and negotiated 5 leases with a duration of less than 6 months encompassing 121,735 square feet. Renewed leases made up 41.4% of the square footage covered by the 29 leases in excess of 6 months, and the rent under the renewed leases decreased an average of -1.7% over the prior leases. Leases to new tenants comprised the other 58.6% of the square footage covered by the 29 leases in excess of 6 months, and the rent under the new leases increased an average of 17.0% over the prior leases. The rental rates under the 29 leases in excess of 6 months entered into during 2017 and 2018, increased by an average of 6.5% over the rates of the prior leases.\nThe table below reflects certain data about our new and renewed leases with terms of greater than six months executed in the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2018.\nTable 26: <table> <tr> <td>Year </td> <td> </td> <td>Type </td> <td> </td> <td>Square\nFootage </td> <td> </td> <td>% of Total\nSquare\nFootage </td> <td> </td> <td>Expiring\nRent </td> <td> </td> <td>New\nRent </td> <td> </td> <td>%\nChange </td> <td> </td> <td>Tenant\nImprovements\n$/SF/YR </td> <td> </td> <td>Lease\nCommissions\n$/SF/YR </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>2017 </td> <td> </td> <td>Renewals </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>234,679 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>84.1% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>4.25 </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>4.51 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6.2% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>0.07 </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>0.13 </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>New Leases </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>44,268 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>15.9% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2.16 </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>3.00 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>38.7% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>0.41 </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>0.27 </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Total </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>278,947 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>100.0% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>3.92 </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>4.27 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>9.1% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>0.13 </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>0.15 </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>2018 </td> <td> </td> <td>Renewals </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>482,067 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>33.2% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>5.84 </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>5.57 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>-4.6% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>0.24 </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>0.13 </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>New Leases </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>969,207 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>66.8% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2.85 </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>3.31 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>16.1% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>0.39 </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>0.21 </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Total </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,451,274 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>100.0% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>3.84 </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>4.06 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5.7% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>0.34 </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>0.18 </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Total </td> <td> </td> <td>Renewals </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>716,746 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>41.4% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>5.32 </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>5.23 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>-1.7% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>0.18 </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>0.13 </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>New Leases </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,013,475 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>58.6% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2.82 </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>3.30 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>17.0% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>0.39 </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>0.22 </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Total </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,730,221 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>100.0% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>3.85 </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>4.10 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6.5% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>0.30 </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>0.18 </td> </tr>\n</table>\nConditions in Our Markets\nThe Company Portfolio is located primarily in various secondary markets in the eastern half of the U.S. Positive or negative changes in economic or other conditions, adverse weather conditions and natural disasters in these markets are likely to affect our overall performance.\nRental Expenses\nOur rental expenses generally consist of utilities, real estate taxes, insurance and site repair and maintenance costs. For the majority of the Company Portfolio, rental expenses are controlled, in part, by either the triple net provisions or modified gross lease expense reimbursement provisions in tenant leases. However, the terms of our tenant leases vary and in some instances the leases may provide that we are responsible for certain rental expenses. Accordingly, our overall financial results will be impacted by the extent to which we are able to pass-through rental expenses to our tenants.\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses\nWe expect to incur increased general and administrative expenses, including legal, accounting and other expenses related to corporate governance and public reporting and compliance. In addition, we anticipate that our staffing levels will increase slightly from fifteen employees as of the date of this annual report on Form 10-K to between 16 and 18 employees during the 12 to 24 months following December 31, 2018 and, as a result, our general and administrative expenses will increase further.\nCritical Accounting Policies\nOur discussion and analysis of our company's historical financial condition and results of operations are based upon its consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of these financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions in certain circumstances that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amount of revenue and expenses in the reporting period. Actual amounts may differ from these estimates and assumptions.\nWe believe our most critical accounting policies are the regular evaluation of whether the value of a real estate asset has been impaired and accounting for acquisitions. Each of these items involves estimates that require management to make judgments that are subjective in nature. We collect historical data and current market data, and based on our experience we analyze these assumptions in order to arrive at what we believe to be reasonable estimates. Under different conditions or assumptions, materially different amounts could be reported related to the accounting policies described below. In addition, application of these accounting policies involves the exercise of judgments on the use of assumptions as to future uncertainties and, as a result, actual results could materially differ from these estimates.\nUse of Estimates\nThe preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the condensed consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Management makes significant estimates regarding the allocation of tangible and intangible assets or business acquisitions, impairments of long-lived assets, stock-based compensation and its common stock warrant liability. These estimates and assumptions are based on management's best estimates and judgment. Management evaluates its estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis using historical experience and other factors, including the current economic environment. Management adjusts such estimates when facts and circumstances dictate. As future events and their effects cannot be determined with precision, actual results could differ from those estimates and assumptions.\nCash\nWe maintain our cash in bank deposit accounts, which at times may exceed federally insured limits. As of December 31, 2018, we had not realized any losses in such cash accounts and believe that we are not exposed to any significant risk of loss.\nIncome Taxes\nWe elected to be taxed as a REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes commencing with our taxable year ended December 31, 2012 and we believe that our organization and method of operation enable us to continue to meet the requirements for qualification and taxation as a REIT. We had no taxable income prior to electing REIT status. To maintain our qualification as a REIT, we must meet certain organizational and operational requirements, including a requirement to distribute at least 90% of our annual REIT taxable income to stockholders (which is computed without regard to the dividends-paid deduction or net capital gain and which does not necessarily equal net income as calculated in accordance with GAAP). As a REIT, we generally will not be subject to federal income tax on income that we distribute as dividends to our stockholders. If we fail to maintain our qualification as a REIT in any tax year, we will be subject to federal income tax on our taxable income at regular corporate income tax rates and generally will not be permitted to qualify for treatment as a REIT for federal income tax purposes for the four taxable years following the year during which qualification is lost, unless we are able to obtain relief under certain statutory provisions. Such an event could materially and adversely affect our net income and net cash available for distribution to stockholders.\nInvestments in Real Estate\nWe generally acquire individual properties, and, in some instances, a portfolio of properties. When we acquire individual operating properties with the intention to hold the investment for the long-term, we allocate the purchase price to the various components of the acquisition based upon the fair value of each component. The components typically include land, building, debt, intangible assets related to above and below market leases, value of costs to obtain tenants, and other assumed assets and liabilities. We consider Level 3 inputs such as the replacement cost of such assets, appraisals, property condition reports, comparable market rental data and other related information in determining the fair value of the tangible assets. The recorded fair value of intangible lease assets or liabilities includes Level 3 inputs including the value associated with leasing commissions, legal and other costs, as well as the estimated period necessary to lease such property and lease commencement. An intangible asset or liability resulting from in-place leases that are above or below the market rental rates are valued based upon our estimates of prevailing market rates for similar leases. Intangible lease assets or liabilities are amortized over the estimated, reasonably assured lease term of the remaining in-place leases as an adjustment to Rental revenues\u201d or Real estate related depreciation and amortization\u201d depending on the nature of the intangible. The valuation of assumed liabilities is based on our estimate of the current market rates for similar liabilities in effect at the acquisition date.\nIn an acquisition of multiple properties, we must also allocate the purchase price among the properties. The allocation of the purchase price is based on our assessment of estimated fair value and often is based upon the expected future cash flows of the property and various characteristics of the markets where the property is located. The fair value may also include an enterprise value premium that we estimate a third party would be willing to pay for a portfolio of properties. The initial allocation of the purchase price is based on management's preliminary assessment, which may differ when final information becomes available.\nCapitalization of Costs and Depreciation and Amortization\nWe capitalize costs incurred in developing, renovating, rehabilitating and improving real estate assets as part of the investment basis. Costs incurred in making repairs and maintaining real estate assets are expensed as incurred. During the land development and construction periods, we capitalize interest costs, insurance, real estate taxes and certain general and administrative costs of the personnel performing development, renovations and rehabilitation if such costs are incremental and identifiable to a specific activity to get the asset ready for its intended use. Capitalized costs are included in the investment basis of real estate assets. We also capitalize costs incurred to successfully originate a lease that result directly from, and are essential to, the acquisition of that lease. Leasing costs that meet the requirements for capitalization are presented as a component of other assets. Upon our adoption of ASU 2017-01 Business Combinations (Topic 805) Clarifying the Definition of a Business, all acquisitions made subsequent to June 30, 2017 will generally be accounted for as asset acquisitions. As such all acquisition costs incurred as part of the purchase of real estate property acquisitions will be capitalized. Acquisition costs incurred as part of our real estate property prior to July 1, 2017 were expensed as acquisition costs.\nReal estate, including land, building and land improvements, tenant improvements, and furniture, fixtures and equipment, leasing costs and intangible lease assets and liabilities are stated at historical cost less accumulated depreciation and amortization, unless circumstances indicate that the cost cannot be recovered, in which case, the carrying value of the property is reduced to estimated fair value as discussed below in our policy with regards to impairment of long-lived assets. We estimate the depreciable portion of our real estate assets and related useful lives in order to record depreciation expense. Our ability to estimate the depreciable portions of our real estate assets and useful lives is critical to the determination of the appropriate amount of depreciation and amortization expense recorded and the carrying value of the underlying assets. Any change to the assets to be depreciated and the estimated depreciable lives of these assets would have an impact on the depreciation expense recognized.\nAs discussed above in investments in real estate, in connection with property acquisitions, we may acquire leases with rental rates above or below the market rental rates. Such differences are recorded as an intangible lease asset or liability and amortized to Rental revenues\u201d over the reasonably assured term of the related leases. The unamortized balances of these assets and liabilities associated with the early termination of leases are fully amortized to their respective revenue line items in our consolidated financial statements over the shorter of the expected life of such assets and liabilities or the remaining lease term.\nOur estimate of the useful life of our assets is evaluated upon acquisition and when circumstances indicate a change in the useful life, which requires significant judgment regarding the economic obsolescence of tangible and intangible assets.\nImpairment of Long-Lived Assets\nWe assess the carrying values of our respective long-lived assets, including goodwill, whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts of these assets may not be fully recoverable.\nRecoverability of real estate assets is measured by comparison of the carrying amount of the asset to the estimated future undiscounted cash flows. In order to review our real estate assets for recoverability, we consider current market conditions, as well as our intent with respect to holding or disposing of the asset. Our intent with regard to the underlying assets might change as market conditions change, as well as other factors, especially in the current global economic environment. Fair value is determined through various valuation techniques, including discounted cash flow models, applying a capitalization rate to estimated net operating income of a property and quoted market values and third-party appraisals, where considered necessary. The use of projected future cash flows is based on assumptions that are consistent with our estimates of future expectations and the strategic plan we use to manage our underlying business. If our analysis indicates that the carrying value of the real estate asset is not recoverable on an undiscounted cash flow basis, we recognize an impairment charge for the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the current estimated fair value of the real estate property.\nAssumptions and estimates used in the recoverability analyses for future cash flows, discount rates and capitalization rates are complex and subjective. Changes in economic and operating conditions or our intent with regard to our investment that occurs subsequent to our impairment analyses could impact these assumptions and result in future impairment of our real estate properties.\nValuation of Receivables\nWe are subject to tenant defaults and bankruptcies that could affect the collection of outstanding receivables. In order to mitigate these risks, we perform credit reviews and analyses on prospective tenants before significant leases are executed and on existing tenants before properties are acquired. We specifically analyze aged receivables, customer credit-worthiness, historical bad debts and current economic trends when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts. As a result of our periodic analysis, we maintain an allowance for estimated losses that may result from the inability of our tenants to make required payments. This estimate requires significant judgment related to the lessees' ability to fulfill their obligations under the leases. If a tenant is insolvent or files for bankruptcy protection and fails to make contractual payments beyond any allowance, we may recognize additional bad debt expense in future periods equal to the net outstanding balances, which include amounts recognized as straight-line revenue not realizable until future periods.\nConsolidation\nWe consolidate all entities that are wholly owned and those in which we own less than 100% but control, as well as any variable interest entities in which we are the primary beneficiary. We evaluate our ability to control an entity and whether the entity is a variable interest entity and we are the primary beneficiary through consideration of the substantive terms of the arrangement to identify which enterprise has the power to direct the activities of a variable interest entity that most significantly impacts the entity's economic performance and the obligation to absorb losses of the entity or the right to receive benefits from the entity. Investments in entities in which we do not control but over which we have the ability to exercise significant influence over operating and financial policies are presented under the equity method. Investments in entities that we do not control and over which we do not exercise significant influence are carried at the lower of cost or fair value, as appropriate. Our ability to correctly assess our influence and/or control over an entity affects the presentation of these investments in our consolidated financial statements.\nResults of Operations (dollars in thousands)\nYear Ended December 31, 2018 Compared to December 31, 2017\nWe define same store portfolio as a subset of our consolidated portfolio and includes properties that were wholly-owned by us for the entire period presented. We define acquisitions/dispositions as any properties that were acquired or sold during the period from January 1, 2017 through December 31, 2018.\nTable 27: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td>

for the year ended December 31, 2017. The increase was primarily related to rental revenue from the acquired properties from the date of acquisition in 2018 of $19,324 offset by a decrease of $1,064 from same store properties primarily driven by vacancies within the same store portfolio.\nTenant recoveries: Tenant recoveries increased by approximately $5,608 to $12,051 for the year ended December 31, 2018 as compared to $6,443 for the year ended December 31, 2017. The increase was primarily related to tenant recoveries from the acquisitions made during 2018 of $5,510 and an increase in tenant recoveries of $98 from same store properties for the year ended December 31, 2018.\nProperty expenses: Property expenses increased $9,244 for the year ended December 31, 2018 to $17,449 as compared to $8,205 for the year ended December 31, 2017 primarily for expenses related to the new property acquisitions of $9,157. Property expenses for the same store properties increased approximately $87 for the year ended December 31, 2018.\nDepreciation and amortization: Depreciation and amortization expense increased by approximately $12,790 to approximately $26,788 for the year ended December 31, 2018 as compared to $13,998 for the year ended December 31, 2017, primarily due to depreciation and amortization on the new property acquisitions of $13,534 offset by lower depreciation and amortization expense for the same store properties of $744.\nGeneral and administrative: General and administrative expenses increased approximately $843 to $6,032 for the year ended December 31, 2018 as compared to $5,189 for the year ended December 31, 2017. The increase is attributable primarily to an increase in salaries and benefits of $912 due to higher head count, increased occupancy costs due to our headquarters expansion of $176 and increased insurance costs of $92, partially offset by a decrease in professional fees of $461 due to lower non-capitalizable transaction legal and other professional costs.\nAcquisition expenses: Acquisition costs decreased $103 to $0 for the year ended December 31, 2018 as compared to $103 for the year ended December 31, 2017. Acquisition expenses for the year ended December 31, 2017 included costs for acquisitions we decided not to pursue.\nOther operating revenue: Other revenue represents interest income and other items not directly related to the operations of our portfolio. The increase in other revenue by $531 to $534 for the year ended December 31, 2018 as compared to $3 for the year ended December 31, 2017, was due to a non-recurring fee for services provided by the Company for a joint venture that did not materialize.\nInterest expense: Interest expense increased by approximately $4,153 to $15,734 for the year ended December 31, 2018 as compared to $11,581 for the year ended December 31, 2017. The increase was due to increased debt resulting from acquisitions, offset by decreases as a result of the refinancing of the Company's debt throughout 2018. The schedule below is a comparative analysis of the components of interest expense for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017. For more information about our 2018 financing transactions, see Note 5 to our consolidated audited financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2018 included elsewhere in this annual report.\nTable 28: <table> <tr> <td>(In thousands) </td> <td> </td> <td>Year Ended December 31, </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2018 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2017 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Accrued interest </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>656 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,531 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Accretion of financing fees </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,482 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>868 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Total accretion of interest and deferred interest </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,138 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,399 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Cash interest paid </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>13,596 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>9,182 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Total interest expense </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>15,734 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>11,581 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nLoss on extinguishment of debt: Loss on extinguishment of debt of $5,393 in 2018 was due to the early repayment of the Torchlight Mezzanine Loan, MWG Loan, KeyBank Term Loan and partial repayment of the Transamerica Loan.\nGain on sale of real estate: Gain on sale of real estate of $1,004 represents the gain realized on the sale of real estate in 2018. There were no sales of real estate in 2017.\nGain on disposition of equity investment: Gain on disposition of equity investment represents amounts received in excess of our basis for an equity investment in real estate liquidated in 2016. In 2017, we recognized gain of $231 which represented the final settlement of the joint venture.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nIn this annual report on Form 10-K, we disclose NOI, EBITDA, FFO and AFFO, each of which meet the definition of non-GAAP financial measure\u201d set forth in Item 10(e) of Regulation S-K promulgated by the SEC. As a result, we are required to include in this report a statement of why management believes that presentation of these measures provides useful information to investors.\nNone of NOI, EBITDA, FFO or AFFO should be considered as an alternative to net income (determined in accordance with GAAP) as an indication of our performance, and we believe that to understand our performance further NOI, EBITDA, FFO, and AFFO should be compared with our reported net income or net loss and considered in addition to cash flows in accordance with GAAP, as presented in our consolidated financial statements.\nNOI\nWe consider net operating income, or NOI, to be an appropriate supplemental measure to net income because it helps both investors and management understand the core operations of our properties. We define NOI as total revenue (including rental revenue, tenant reimbursements, management, leasing and development services revenue and other income) less property-level operating expenses including allocated overhead. NOI excludes depreciation and amortization, general and administrative expenses, impairments, gain/loss on sale of real estate, interest expense, and other non-operating items.\nThe following is a reconciliation from historical reported net loss, the most directly comparable financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP, to NOI:\nTable 29: <table> <tr> <td>(In thousands) </td> <td> </td> <td>Year Ended December 31, </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Historical Consolidated </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2018 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2017 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>NOI: </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Net loss </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(21,175 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(14,027 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>General and administrative </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6,032 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5,189 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Acquisition costs </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>103 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Depreciation and amortization </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>26,788 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>13,998 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Interest expense </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>15,734 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>11,581 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Loss on debt extinguishment </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5,393 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Gain on sale of Real Estate </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(1,004 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Other expense (income) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(534 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(234 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>NOI </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>31,234 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>16,610 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nEBITDA\nWe believe that earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, or EBITDA, is helpful to investors as a supplemental measure of our operating performance as a real estate company because it is a direct measure of the actual operating results of our industrial properties. We also use this measure in ratios to compare our performance to that of our industry peers. The following table sets forth a reconciliation of our historical net loss to EBITDA for the periods presented.\nTable 30: <table> <tr> <td>(In thousands) </td> <td> </td> <td>Year Ended December 31, </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Historical Consolidated </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2018 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2017 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>EBITDA: </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Net loss </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(21,175 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(14,027 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Depreciation and amortization </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>26,788 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>13,998 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Interest expense </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>15,734 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>11,581 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Loss on debt extinguishment </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5,393 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Gain on sale of Real Estate </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(1,004 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>EBITDA </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>25,736 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>11,552 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nFFO\nFunds from operations, or FFO, is a non-GAAP financial measure that is widely recognized as a measure of REIT operating performance. We consider FFO to be an appropriate supplemental measure of our operating performance as it is based on a net income analysis of property portfolio performance that excludes non-cash items such as depreciation. The historical accounting convention used for real estate assets requires straight-line depreciation of buildings and improvements, which implies that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time. Since real estate values rise and fall with market conditions, presentations of operating results for a REIT, using historical accounting for depreciation, could be less informative. We define FFO, consistent with the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts, or NAREIT, definition, as net income, computed in accordance with GAAP, excluding: gains (or losses) from sales of property, depreciation and amortization of real estate assets, impairment losses, losses on extinguishment of debt and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures. Adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures will be calculated to reflect FFO on the same basis. Other equity REITs may not calculate FFO (in accordance with the NAREIT definition) as we do, and, accordingly, our FFO may not be comparable to such other REITs' FFO. FFO should not be used as a measure of our liquidity, and is not indicative of funds available for our cash needs, including our ability to pay dividends. FFO attributable to common stockholders and unitholders represents FFO reduced by dividends paid (or declared) to holders of our preferred stock.\nThe following table sets forth a reconciliation of our historical net loss to FFO available to common stockholders and unit holders for the periods presented:\nTable 31: <table> <tr> <td>(In thousands) </td> <td> </td> <td>Year Ended December 31, </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Historical Consolidated </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2018 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2017 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>FFO: </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Net loss </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(21,175 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(14,027 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Depreciation and amortization </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>26,788 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>13,998 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Loss on debt extinguishment </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5,393 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Gain on sale of Real Estate </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(1,004 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Gain on disposition of equity investment </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(231 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>FFO </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>10,002 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(260 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Preferred stock dividends </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(3,940 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(723 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>FFO available to common stockholders and unit holders </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>6,062 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(983 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n</table>\nAFFO\nAdjusted funds from operation, or AFFO, is presented in addition to FFO. AFFO is defined as FFO, excluding certain non-cash operating revenues and expenses, acquisition and transaction related costs for transactions not completed and recurring capitalized expenditures. Recurring capitalized expenditures includes expenditures required to maintain and re-tenant our properties, tenant improvements and leasing commissions. AFFO further adjusts FFO for certain other non-cash items, including the amortization or accretion of above or below market rents included in revenues, straight line rent adjustments, impairment losses, non-cash equity compensation and non-cash interest expense.\nWe believe AFFO provides a useful supplemental measure of our operating performance because it provides a consistent comparison of our operating performance across time periods that is comparable for each type of real estate investment and is consistent with management's analysis of the operating performance of our properties. As a result, we believe that the use of AFFO, together with the required GAAP presentations, provide a more complete understanding of our operating performance.\nAs with FFO, our reported AFFO may not be comparable to other REITs' AFFO, should not be used as a measure of our liquidity, and is not indicative of our funds available for our cash needs, including our ability to pay dividends.\nThe following table sets forth a reconciliation of FFO attributable to common stockholders and unit holders to AFFO.\nTable 32: <table> <tr> <td>(In thousands) </td> <td> </td> <td>Year Ended December 31, </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Historical Consolidated </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2018 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2017 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>FFO attributable to common stockholders and unit holders </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>6,062 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(983 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Deferred finance fee amortization </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,482 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>868 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Non-cash interest expense </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>656 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,531 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Acquisition costs </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>103 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Stock compensation </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>805 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>435 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Straight line rent </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(996 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(191 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Above/below market lease rents </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(1,304 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(423 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Recurring capital expenditures (1) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(2,695 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(522 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>AFFO </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>4,010 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>818 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\n_______________\nTable 33: <table> <tr> <td>(1) </td> <td>Excludes non-recurring capital expenditures of $2,601 and $1,272 for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. </td> </tr>\n</table>\nCash Flow\nA summary of our cash flows for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 are as follows:\nTable 34: <table> <tr> <td>(In thousands) </td> <td> </td> <td>Year Ended </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2018 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2017 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Net cash provided by operating activities </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>14,867 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>8,104 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Net cash used in investing activities </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(141,923 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(171,844 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Net cash provided by financing activities </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>122,854 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>172,702 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nOperating activities: Net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2018 increased approximately $6,763 compared to the year ended December 31, 2017 primarily due to an increase in operating cash flows from property acquisitions, accounts payable and accrued expenses and depreciation expense, partially offset by fluctuations within working capital due to the timing of payments and rent receipts.\nInvesting activities: Net cash used in investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2018 decreased approximately $29,921 compared to the year ended December 31, 2017 primarily due a decrease in cash paid for acquisitions in 2018 of $142,635 compared to $170,788 in 2017, offset by the sale of property in 2018 for $4,562 and increase in real estate improvements expenditure of $2,563.\nFinancing activities: Net cash provided by financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2018 decreased approximately $49,848 to $122,854 for the year ended December 31, 2018, compared to $172,702 during the year ended December 31, 2017. Net cash provided by financing activities during the year ended December 31, 2018 included net proceeds from the issuance of common and preferred stock of approximately $89,613 and net borrowings of $49,378, offset by cash used for dividends of $11,083 and the repurchase of common stock of $5,054. Net cash provided by financing activities during the year ended December 31, 2017 included net proceeds from the issuance of common and preferred stock of approximately $101,490 and net borrowings of $98,549, offset by cash used for dividends of $1,755 and the redemption of the non-controlling interest of $25,582.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nWe intend to make reserve allocations as necessary to aid our objective of preserving capital for our investors by supporting the maintenance and viability of properties we acquire in the future. If reserves and any other available income become insufficient to cover our operating expenses and liabilities, it may be necessary to obtain additional funds by borrowing, refinancing properties or liquidating our investments.\nOur short-term liquidity requirements consist primarily of funds to pay for operating expenses and other expenditures directly associated with our properties, including:\nTable 35: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u00b7 </td> <td>property expenses that are not borne by our tenants under our leases; </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td>\u00b7 </td> <td>interest expense on outstanding indebtedness; </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td>\u00b7 </td> <td>general and administrative expenses; and </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td>\u00b7 </td> <td>capital expenditures for tenant improvements and leasing commissions. </td> </tr>\n</table>\nIn addition, we will require funds for future dividends required to be paid on our Series A and Series B Preferred Stock.\nWe intend to satisfy our short-term liquidity requirements through our existing cash, cash flow from operating activities and the net proceeds of any potential future offerings.\nOur long-term liquidity needs consist primarily of funds necessary to pay for acquisitions, recurring and non-recurring capital expenditures and scheduled debt maturities. We intend to satisfy our long-term liquidity needs through cash flow from operations, long-term secured and unsecured borrowings, future issuances of equity and debt securities, property dispositions and joint venture transactions, and, in connection with acquisitions of additional properties, the issuance of OP units.\nExisting Indebtedness as of December 31, 2018 (dollars in thousands)\n$120,000 AIG Loan\nCertain indirect subsidiaries of the Operating Partnership have entered into a senior secured loan agreement with investment entities managed by AIG Asset Management (the AIG Loan\u201d).\nAs of December 31, 2018 and 2017, there was $120,000 of principal indebtedness outstanding under the AIG Loan. The AIG Loan bears interest at 4.08% per annum and has a seven-year term maturing in October, 2023. The AIG Loan provides for monthly payments of interest only for the first three years of the term and thereafter monthly principal and interest payments based on a 27-year amortization period.\nThe borrowings under the AIG Loan are secured by first lien mortgages on the properties held by wholly-owned subsidiaries of Plymouth Industrial 20 LLC (see Note 8 to the consolidated financial statements). The obligations under the AIG Loan are also guaranteed in certain circumstances by the Company and certain of the Operating Partnership's wholly-owned subsidiaries.\nThe AIG Loan agreement contains customary representations and warranties, as well as affirmative and negative covenants. The negative covenants include restrictions on additional indebtedness, restrictions on liens, fundamental changes, dispositions, restricted payments, change in nature of business, transactions with affiliates and burdensome agreements. The AIG Loan contains financial covenants that require minimum liquidity and Net Worth. The AIG Loan is subject to acceleration upon certain specified events of defaults, including breaches of representations or covenants, failure to pay other material indebtedness, failure to pay taxes or a change of control of our company, as defined in the senior secured loan agreement. The Company is in compliance with the respective covenants at December 31, 2018. The Company has no right to prepay all or any part of the AIG Loan before November 1, 2019. Following that date, the AIG Loan can only be paid in full, and a prepayment penalty would be assessed, as defined in the agreement.\nThe borrowings amounted to $117,263 and $116,700, net of $2,737 and $3,300 of unamortized debt issuance costs at December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively.\nMinnesota Life Loan\nOn April 30, 2018, certain subsidiaries of our operating partnership entered into a secured loan agreement with Minnesota Life Insurance Company, or the Minnesota Life Loan, in the original principal amount of $21,500. The Minnesota Life Loan bears interest at 3.78% per annum and has a ten-year term, maturing on May 1, 2028. The Minnesota Life Loan provides for monthly payments of interest only for the first year of the term and thereafter monthly principal and interest payments based on a 30-year amortization period. The borrowings under the Minnesota Life Loan are secured by first lien mortgages on seven of the Company's properties.\nThe Minnesota Life Loan contains customary affirmative and negative covenants, including limitations with respect to indebtedness, liens, investments, distributions, mergers and acquisitions, dispositions of assets and transactions with affiliates. The Company is in compliance with the respective covenants at December 31, 2018.\nBorrowings outstanding amounted to $21,133, net of $367 of unamortized debt issuance costs at December 31, 2018.\nTransamerica Loan\nOn July 10, 2018, certain wholly-owned subsidiaries (the Borrowers\u201d) of the Company entered into a loan agreement (the Transamerica Loan\u201d) with Transamerica Life Insurance Company providing for commercial mortgage loans to the Borrowers in the aggregate principal amount of $78,000. The Transamerica Loan matures on August 1, 2028 and bears interest at the fixed rate of 4.35% per annum. The promissory notes (the Notes\u201d) evidencing the Transamerica Loan require the Borrowers to make monthly interest-only payments through August 2019 and thereafter the Transamerica Loan requires equal monthly installments of principal plus accrued interest based on a 30-year amortization period. The Borrowers may repay the Transamerica Loan at any time following the first twelve full calendar months of the Transamerica Loan's term, subject to paying a premium equal to the greater of (a) 1% of the prepayment amount and (b) the Yield Protection Amount,\u201d as defined in the Notes.\nThe Transamerica Loan and the Notes contain customary events of default, including non-payment of principal or interest and bankruptcy. Any default under the Transamerica Loan or any Note will constitute a default under each of the other Notes. Each Borrower has guaranteed the payment obligations of all the other Borrowers under the Notes.\nOn December 19, 2018, the Company repaid $3,380 of the Transamerica Loan as part of the sale of 525 West Marquette, 1 of the 18 properties that serves as collateral for the Transamerica Loan. The Company recognized a $395 loss on extinguishment of debt at the time of the partial repayment. Borrowings outstanding amounted to $73,609, net of $1,011 of unamortized debt issuance costs at December 31, 2018.\nFisher Park Mortgage\nOn October 15, 2018, the Operating Partnership (the Borrower\u201d) assumed a mortgage (the Fisher Park Mortgage\u201d) with a balance of $13,907 as part of our acquisition of the property in greater Cincinnati. The Fisher Park Mortgage, held by JP Morgan Chase Bank, matures on January 1, 2027, bears interest at 5.229% and is secured by the property. The Fisher Park Mortgage requires monthly installments of principal plus accrued interest based on a 30-year amortization. As part of the allocation of the Fisher Park purchase price per ASC 805, the Company recorded a $92 premium on the assumed debt value.\nThe Fisher Park Mortgage contains customary events of default, including non-payment of principal or interest and bankruptcy and certain trigger events to occur upon the Debt Service Coverage Ratio going below certain thresholds as defined within the loan agreement.\nBorrowings outstanding amounted to $13,873 at December 31, 2018.\nKeyBank Bridge Loan\nOn December 14, 2018, the Operating Partnership and certain of its subsidiaries entered into a loan agreement (the KeyBank Bridge Loan\u201d) with KeyBank National Association ( KeyBank\u201d). The Key Bank Bridge Loan provides for a secured loan in the amount of $63,115. The KeyBank Bridge Loan bears interest at a rate per annum at either (1) the base rate (determined from the highest of (a) KeyBank's prime rate, (b) the federal funds rate plus 0.50% and (c) the one month LIBOR rate plus 1.0%) or (2) LIBOR plus 2%. At December 31, 2018 the interest rate was 4.44%. The KeyBank Bridge Loan matures on the earlier of March 14, 2019 or the date KeyBank ceases to serve as the administrative agent under the Company's revolving credit facility; however, the Operating Partnership has the right to prepay the KeyBank Bridge Loan at any time without penalty. Borrowings under the KeyBank Bridge Loan are secured by the Jacksonville Property and are guaranteed by the Company and each subsidiary of the Operating Partnership that is the direct or indirect owner of any collateral for the KeyBank Bridge Loan.\nThe KeyBank Bridge Loan contains customary affirmative and negative and financial covenants, including limitations with respect to indebtedness, liens, investments, distributions, mergers and transactions with affiliates as outlined within the loan agreement. The Company is in compliance with the respective covenants at December 31, 2018.\nBorrowings outstanding amounted to $63,115 at December 31, 2018.\nLine of Credit Agreement\nOn August 11, 2017 the Company's operating partnership entered into a secured line of credit agreement (Line of Credit Agreement) with KeyBank National Association, or KeyBank and the other lenders, which matures in August 2020 with an optional extension through August 2021, subject to certain conditions. Borrowings under the Line of Credit Agreement bear interest at either (1) the base rate (determined from the highest of (a) KeyBank's prime rate, (b) the federal funds rate plus 0.50% and (c) the one month LIBOR rate plus 1.0%) or (2) LIBOR, plus, in either case, a spread between 250 and 300 basis points depending on our total leverage ratio. At December 31, 2018 the interest rate was 5.4%.\nOn March 8, 2018, the Company entered into an Increase Agreement to our Line of Credit Agreement with KeyBank National Association to increase our revolving credit facility to $45,000. All other terms of the Line of Credit Agreement remained unchanged.\nThe Line of Credit Agreement, consistent with the KeyBank Bridege Loan covenants, contains customary affirmative and negative and financial covenants, including limitations with respect to indebtedness, liens, investments, distributions, mergers and transactions with affiliates as outlined within the Line of Credit Agreement. The Company is in compliance with the respective covenants at December 31, 2018. The Line of Credit Agreement is secured by certain assets of the Company's operating partnership and certain of its subsidiaries and includes a Company's guarantee for the payment of all indebtedness under the Line of Credit Agreement. Borrowings outstanding amounted to $28,187 and $20,837, net of unamortized debt issuance costs of $363 and $488 at December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively.\nContractual Obligations and Commitments\nThe following table sets forth our principal obligations and commitments as of December 31, 2018:\nFuture Minimum Rents\n($ in thousands)\nTable 36: <table> <tr> <td>Corporate Office </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>378 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>385 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2021 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>393 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2022 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>400 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2023 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>407 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Thereafter </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>519 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nIn addition to the contractual obligations set forth in the table above, we have entered into employment agreements with certain of our executive officers. As approved by the compensation committee of the Board of Directors the agreements provide for base salaries ranging from $200 to $300 annually with discretionary cash performance awards. The agreements contain provisions for equity awards, general benefits, and termination and severance provisions, consistent with similar positions and companies.\nWe also enter into contracts for maintenance and other services at certain properties from time to time.\nRedeemable Preferred Member Interests\nOn October 17, 2016, and in connection with its refinancing of its Senior Loan with Torchlight, the Company issued Torchlight a 99.5% redeemable preferred member interest in 20 LLC in exchange for $30,553. The redeemable preferred member interest was redeemed in full as of June 14, 2017. The redemption resulted in elimination of the non-controlling interest and an adjustment to equity (deficit) in the amount of $56,795. An adjustment to the redemption price in the first quarter of 2017 was deemed a non-cash capital contribution in the amount of $1,019.\nThe Company had classified this amount as a liability in accordance with ASC 480, Distinguishing Liabilities from Equity (ASC 480). Because the member interest was mandatorily redeemable, the Company concluded that the required redemption of that interest represented a continuing interest in the properties and therefore, the issuance of the redeemable preferred member interest represented a financing of 20 LLC and not a sale of the properties.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe have no off-balance sheet arrangements.\nInflation\nThe majority of our leases are either triple net or provide for tenant reimbursement for costs related to real estate taxes and operating expenses. In addition, most of the leases provide for fixed rent increases. We believe that inflationary increases may be at least partially offset by the contractual rent increases and tenant payment of taxes and expenses described above. We do not believe that inflation has had a material impact on our historical financial position or results of operations.\nInterest Rate Risk\nASC 815, Derivatives and Hedging (formerly known as SFAS No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and hedging Activities, as amended by SFAS No. 138, Accounting for Certain Derivative Instruments and Certain Hedging Activities), requires us to recognize all derivatives on the balance sheet at fair value. Derivatives that are not hedges must be adjusted to fair value and the changes in fair value must be reflected as income or expense. If the derivative is a hedge, depending on the nature of the hedge, changes in the fair value of derivatives are either offset against the change in fair value of the hedged assets, liabilities, or firm commitments through earnings or recognized in other comprehensive income, which is a component of stockholders' equity. The ineffective portion of a derivative's change in fair value is immediately recognized in earnings.\nThe Company uses an interest rate cap as a derivative instrument to manage interest rate risk and is recognized on the balance sheet at fair value. The interest rate cap is not designated as a hedging instrument and changes in fair value is mark to market through earnings. The input values used in the fair value measurement of the interest rate cap were obtained using quoted market prices for similar assets in markets that are not active and therefore are, classified as Level 2 under the fair value hierarchy. The fair value of the interest rate cap is estimated based on discounting future cash flows interest rates that management believes reflect the risks associated with debt instruments of similar risk and duration. The fair value of the interest rate cap agreement was $0 at December 31, 2018. At December 31, 2018 the one-month LIBOR was 2.52%.\nRelated to this interest rate cap agreement, a 100 basis point increase above LIBOR being 4% will decrease our interest expense by approximately $798 per annum.\nAs discussed in Note 5 of our consolidated financial statements, the MWG Loan Agreement was paid in full as of July 10, 2018. The key terms of the interest rate cap agreement with J.P. Morgan remained in place after the repayment of the MWG Loan Agreement and it continues to have a maturity date of December 1, 2019.\nNo assurance can be given that any future hedging activities by us will have the desired beneficial effect on our results of operations or financial condition.\nRecently Issued Accounting Standards\nWe have reviewed all recently issued standards and have determined that, other than as disclosed in Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements appearing in this annual report on Form 10-K, such standards will not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements or do not otherwise apply to our operations.", "item_7_truncated": "Item 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe following discussion and analysis is based on, and should be read in conjunction with our audited historical financial statements and related notes thereto as of and for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017.\nOverview\nWe are a full service, vertically integrated, self-administered and self-managed REIT focused on the acquisition, ownership and management of single- and multi-tenant Class B industrial properties, including distribution centers, warehouses and light industrial properties. The Company Portfolio consists of 55 industrial properties located in ten states with an aggregate of approximately 12 million rentable square feet leased to 182 different tenants.\nOur strategy is to invest in single- and multi-tenant Class B industrial properties located primarily in secondary markets across the U.S.; however, we may make opportunistic acquisitions of Class A industrial properties or industrial properties located in primary markets. We seek to generate attractive risk-adjusted returns for our stockholders through a combination of dividends and capital appreciation.\nFactors That May Influence Future Results of Operations\nBusiness and Strategy\nOur core investment strategy is to acquire primarily Class B industrial properties predominantly in secondary markets across the U.S. We expect to acquire these properties through third-party purchases and structured sale-leasebacks where we believe we can achieve high initial yields and strong ongoing cash-on-cash returns. In addition, we may make opportunistic acquisitions of Class A industrial properties or industrial properties in primary markets that offer similar return characteristics.\nOur target markets are comprised primarily of secondary markets because we believe these markets tend to have less occupancy and rental rate volatility and less buyer competition relative to primary markets. We also believe that the systematic aggregation of such properties will result in a diversified portfolio that will produce sustainable risk-adjusted returns. Future results of operations may be affected, either positively or negatively, by our ability to effectively execute this strategy.\nWe also intend to pursue joint venture arrangements with institutional partners which could provide management fee income as well as residual profit-sharing income. Such joint ventures may involve investing in industrial assets that would be characterized as opportunistic or value-add investments. These may involve development or re-development strategies that may require significant up-front capital expenditures, lengthy lease-up periods and result in inconsistent cash flows. As such, these properties' risk profiles and return metrics would likely differ from the non-joint venture properties that we target for acquisition.\nRental Revenue and Tenant Recoveries\nWe receive income primarily from rental revenue and tenant recoveries from our properties. The amount of rental revenue generated by the Company Portfolio depends principally on the occupancy levels and lease rates at our properties, our ability to lease currently available space and space that becomes available as a result of lease expirations and on the rental rates at our properties. As of December 31, 2018, the Company Portfolio was approximately 95% occupied. Our occupancy rate is impacted by general market conditions in the geographic areas which our properties are located and the financial condition of tenants in our target markets.\nScheduled Lease Expirations\nOur ability to re-lease space subject to expiring leases will impact our results of operations and will be affected by economic and competitive conditions in the markets in which we operate and by the desirability of our individual properties. During the period from January 1, 2019 through to December 31, 2020, an aggregate of 26.9% of the annualized base rent leases in the Company Portfolio are scheduled to expire, which we believe will provide us an opportunity to adjust below market rates as market conditions continue to improve.\nDuring 2017 and 2018, leases for space totaling 1,995,389 square feet (16.7% of the Company Portfolio) either was subject to renewal or expired. Approximately 41.4% of the expired space was renewed and an additional 1,013,475 square feet (including a net 207,114 square feet of previously vacant space) was leased long term with new tenants. As of December 31, 2018, the vacancy rate of the Company Portfolio was 5.0%.\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2018, we negotiated 29 leases with durations in excess of six months encompassing 1,730,221 square feet and negotiated 5 leases with a duration of less than 6 months encompassing 121,735 square feet. Renewed leases made up 41.4% of the square footage covered by the 29 leases in excess of 6 months, and the rent under the renewed leases decreased an average of -1.7% over the prior leases. Leases to new tenants comprised the other 58.6% of the square footage covered by the 29 leases in excess of 6 months, and the rent under the new leases increased an average of 17.0% over the prior leases. The rental rates under the 29 leases in excess of 6 months entered into during 2017 and 2018, increased by an average of 6.5% over the rates of the prior leases.\nThe table below reflects certain data about our new and renewed leases with terms of greater than six months executed in the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2018.\nTable 26: <table> <tr> <td>Year </td> <td> </td> <td>Type </td> <td> </td> <td>Square\nFootage </td> <td> </td> <td>% of Total\nSquare\nFootage </td> <td> </td> <td>Expiring\nRent </td> <td> </td> <td>New\nRent </td> <td> </td> <td>%\nChange </td> <td> </td> <td>Tenant\nImprovements\n$/SF/YR </td> <td> </td> <td>Lease\nCommissions\n$/SF/YR </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>2017 </td> <td> </td> <td>Renewals </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>234,679 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>84.1% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>4.25 </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>4.51 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6.2% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>0.07 </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>0.13 </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>New Leases </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>44,268 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>15.9% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2.16 </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>3.00 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>38.7% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>0.41 </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>0.27 </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Total </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>278,947 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>100.0% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>3.92 </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>4.27 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>9.1% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>0.13 </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>0.15 </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>2018 </td> <td> </td> <td>Renewals </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>482,067 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>33.2% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>5.84 </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>5.57 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>-4.6% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>0.24 </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>0.13 </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>New Leases </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>969,207 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>66.8% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2.85 </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>3.31 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>16.1% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>0.39 </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>0.21 </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Total </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,451,274 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>100.0% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>3.84 </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>4.06 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5.7% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>0.34 </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>0.18 </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Total </td> <td> </td> <td>Renewals </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>716,746 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>41.4% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>5.32 </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>5.23 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>-1.7% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>0.18 </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>0.13 </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>New Leases </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,013,475 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>58.6% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2.82 </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>3.30 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>17.0% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>0.39 </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>0.22 </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Total </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,730,221 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>100.0% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>3.85 </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>4.10 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6.5% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>0.30 </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>0.18 </td> </tr>\n</table>\nConditions in Our Markets\nThe Company Portfolio is located primarily in various secondary markets in the eastern half of the U.S. Positive or negative changes in economic or other conditions, adverse weather conditions and natural disasters in these markets are likely to affect our overall performance.\nRental Expenses\nOur rental expenses generally consist of utilities, real estate taxes, insurance and site repair and maintenance costs. For the majority of the Company Portfolio, rental expenses are controlled, in part, by either the triple net provisions or modified gross lease expense reimbursement provisions in tenant leases. However, the terms of our tenant leases vary and in some instances the leases may provide that we are responsible for certain rental expenses. Accordingly, our overall financial results will be impacted by the extent to which we are able to pass-through rental expenses to our tenants.\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses\nWe expect to incur increased general and administrative expenses, including legal, accounting and other expenses related to corporate governance and public reporting and compliance. In addition, we anticipate that our staffing levels will increase slightly from fifteen employees as of the date of this annual report on Form 10-K to between 16 and 18 employees during the 12 to 24 months following December 31, 2018 and, as a result, our general and administrative expenses will increase further.\nCritical Accounting Policies\nOur discussion and analysis of our company's historical financial condition and results of operations are based upon its consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of these financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions in certain circumstances that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amount of revenue and expenses in the reporting period. Actual amounts may differ from these estimates and assumptions.\nWe believe our most critical accounting policies are the regular evaluation of whether the value of a real estate asset has been impaired and accounting for acquisitions. Each of these items involves estimates that require management to make judgments that are subjective in nature. We collect historical data and current market data, and based on our experience we analyze these assumptions in order to arrive at what we believe to be reasonable estimates. Under different conditions or assumptions, materially different amounts could be reported related to the accounting policies described below. In addition, application of these accounting policies involves the exercise of judgments on the use of assumptions as to future uncertainties and, as a result, actual results could materially differ from these estimates.\nUse of Estimates\nThe preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the condensed consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Management makes significant estimates regarding the allocation of tangible and intangible assets or business acquisitions, impairments of long-lived assets, stock-based compensation and its common stock warrant liability. These estimates and assumptions are based on management's best estimates and judgment. Management evaluates its estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis using historical experience and other factors, including the current economic environment. Management adjusts such estimates when facts and circumstances dictate. As future events and their effects cannot be determined with precision, actual results could differ from those estimates and assumptions.\nCash\nWe maintain our cash in bank deposit accounts, which at times may exceed federally insured limits. As of December 31, 2018, we had not realized any losses in such cash accounts and believe that we are not exposed to any significant risk of loss.\nIncome Taxes\nWe elected to be taxed as a REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes commencing with our taxable year ended December 31, 2012 and we believe that our organization and method of operation enable us to continue to meet the requirements for qualification and taxation as a REIT. We had no taxable income prior to electing REIT status. To maintain our qualification as a REIT, we must meet certain organizational and operational requirements, including a requirement to distribute at least 90% of our annual REIT taxable income to stockholders (which is computed without regard to the dividends-paid deduction or net capital gain and which does not necessarily equal net income as calculated in accordance with GAAP). As a REIT, we generally will not be subject to federal income tax on income that we distribute as dividends to our stockholders. If we fail to maintain our qualification as a REIT in any tax year, we will be subject to federal income tax on our taxable income at regular corporate income tax rates and generally will not be permitted to qualify for treatment as a REIT for federal income tax purposes for the four taxable years following the year during which qualification is lost, unless we are able to obtain relief under certain statutory provisions. Such an event could materially and adversely affect our net income and net cash available for distribution to stockholders.\nInvestments in Real Estate\nWe generally acquire individual properties, and, in some instances, a portfolio of properties. When we acquire individual operating properties with the intention to hold the investment for the long-term, we allocate the purchase price to the various components of the acquisition based upon the fair value of each component. The components typically include land, building, debt, intangible assets related to above and below market leases, value of costs to obtain tenants, and other assumed assets and liabilities. We consider Level 3 inputs such as the replacement cost of such assets, appraisals, property condition reports, comparable market rental data and other related information in determining the fair value of the tangible assets. The recorded fair value of intangible lease assets or liabilities includes Level 3 inputs including the value associated with leasing commissions, legal and other costs, as well as the estimated period necessary to lease such property and lease commencement. An intangible asset or liability resulting from in-place leases that are above or below the market rental rates are valued based upon our estimates of prevailing market rates for similar leases. Intangible lease assets or liabilities are amortized over the estimated, reasonably assured lease term of the remaining in-place leases as an adjustment to Rental revenues\u201d or Real estate related depreciation and amortization\u201d depending on the nature of the intangible. The valuation of assumed liabilities is based on our estimate of the current market rates for similar liabilities in effect at the acquisition date.\nIn an acquisition of multiple properties, we must also allocate the purchase price among the properties. The allocation of the purchase price is based on our assessment of estimated fair value and often is based upon the expected future cash flows of the property and various characteristics of the markets where the property is located. The fair value may also include an enterprise value premium that we estimate a third party would be willing to pay for a portfolio of properties. The initial allocation of the purchase price is based on management's preliminary assessment, which may differ when final information becomes available.\nCapitalization of Costs and Depreciation and Amortization\nWe capitalize costs incurred in developing, renovating, rehabilitating and improving real estate assets as part of the investment basis. Costs incurred in making repairs and maintaining real estate assets are expensed as incurred. During the land development and construction periods, we capitalize interest costs, insurance, real estate taxes and certain general and administrative costs of the personnel performing development, renovations and rehabilitation if such costs are incremental and identifiable to a specific activity to get the asset ready for its intended use. Capitalized costs are included in the investment basis of real estate assets. We also capitalize costs incurred to successfully originate a lease that result directly from, and are essential to, the acquisition of that lease. Leasing costs that meet the requirements for capitalization are presented as a component of other assets. Upon our adoption of ASU 2017-01 Business Combinations (Topic 805) Clarifying the Definition of a Business, all acquisitions made subsequent to June 30, 2017 will generally be accounted for as asset acquisitions. As such all acquisition costs incurred as part of the purchase of real estate property acquisitions will be capitalized. Acquisition costs incurred as part of our real estate property prior to July 1, 2017 were expensed as acquisition costs.\nReal estate, including land, building and land improvements, tenant improvements, and furniture, fixtures and equipment, leasing costs and intangible lease assets and liabilities are stated at historical cost less accumulated depreciation and amortization, unless circumstances indicate that the cost cannot be recovered, in which case, the carrying value of the property is reduced to estimated fair value as discussed below in our policy with regards to impairment of long-lived assets. We estimate the depreciable portion of our real estate assets and related useful lives in order to record depreciation expense. Our ability to estimate the depreciable portions of our real estate assets and useful lives is critical to the determination of the appropriate amount of depreciation and amortization expense recorded and the carrying value of the underlying assets. Any change to the assets to be depreciated and the estimated depreciable lives of these assets would have an impact on the depreciation expense recognized.\nAs discussed above in investments in real estate, in connection with property acquisitions, we may acquire leases with rental rates above or below the market rental rates. Such differences are recorded as an intangible lease asset or liability and amortized to Rental revenues\u201d over the reasonably assured term of the related leases. The unamortized balances of these assets and liabilities associated with the early termination of leases are fully amortized to their respective revenue line items in our consolidated financial statements over the shorter of the expected life of such assets and liabilities or the remaining lease term.\nOur estimate of the useful life of our assets is evaluated upon acquisition and when circumstances indicate a change in the useful life, which requires significant judgment regarding the economic obsolescence of tangible and intangible assets.\nImpairment of Long-Lived Assets\nWe assess the carrying values of our respective long-lived assets, including goodwill, whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts of these assets may not be fully recoverable.\nRecoverability of real estate assets is measured by comparison of the carrying amount of the asset to the estimated future undiscounted cash flows. In order to review our real estate assets for recoverability, we consider current market conditions, as well as our intent with respect to holding or disposing of the asset. Our intent with regard to the underlying assets might change as market conditions change, as well as other factors, especially in the current global economic environment. Fair value is determined through various valuation techniques, including discounted cash flow models, applying a capitalization rate to estimated net operating income of a property and quoted market values and third-party appraisals, where considered necessary. The use of projected future cash flows is based on assumptions that are consistent with our estimates of future expectations and the strategic plan we use to manage our underlying business. If our analysis indicates that the carrying value of the real estate asset is not recoverable on an undiscounted cash flow basis, we recognize an impairment charge for the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the current estimated fair value of the real estate property.\nAssumptions and estimates used in the recoverability analyses for future cash flows, discount rates and capitalization rates are complex and subjective. Changes in economic and operating conditions or our intent with regard to our investment that occurs subsequent to our impairment analyses could impact these assumptions and result in future impairment of our real estate properties.\nValuation of Receivables\nWe are subject to tenant defaults and bankruptcies that could affect the collection of outstanding receivables. In order to mitigate these risks, we perform credit reviews and analyses on prospective tenants before significant leases are executed and on existing tenants before properties are acquired. We specifically analyze aged receivables, customer credit-worthiness, historical bad debts and current economic trends when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts. As a result of our periodic analysis, we maintain an allowance for estimated losses that may result from the inability of our tenants to make required payments. This estimate requires significant judgment related to the lessees' ability to fulfill their obligations under the leases. If a tenant is insolvent or files for bankruptcy protection and fails to make contractual payments beyond any allowance, we may recognize additional bad debt expense in future periods equal to the net outstanding balances, which include amounts recognized as straight-line revenue not realizable until future periods.\nConsolidation\nWe consolidate all entities that are wholly owned and those in which we own less than 100% but control, as well as any variable interest entities in which we are the primary beneficiary. We evaluate our ability to control an entity and whether the entity is a variable interest entity and we are the primary beneficiary through consideration of the substantive terms of the arrangement to identify which enterprise has the power to direct the activities of a variable interest entity that most significantly impacts the entity's economic performance and the obligation to absorb losses of the entity or the right to receive benefits from the entity. Investments in entities in which we do not control but over which we have the ability to exercise significant influence over operating and financial policies are presented under the equity method. Investments in entities that we do not control and over which we do not exercise significant influence are carried at the lower of cost or fair value, as appropriate. Our ability to correctly assess our influence and/or control over an entity affects the presentation of these investments in our consolidated financial statements.\nResults of Operations (dollars in thousands)\nYear Ended December 31, 2018 Compared to December 31, 2017\nWe define same store portfolio as a subset of our consolidated portfolio and includes properties that were wholly-owned by us for the entire period presented.

for the year ended December 31, 2017. The increase was primarily related to rental revenue from the acquired properties from the date of acquisition in 2018 of $19,324 offset by a decrease of $1,064 from same store properties primarily driven by vacancies within the same store portfolio.\nTenant recoveries: Tenant recoveries increased by approximately $5,608 to $12,051 for the year ended December 31, 2018 as compared to $6,443 for the year ended December 31, 2017. The increase was primarily related to tenant recoveries from the acquisitions made during 2018 of $5,510 and an increase in tenant recoveries of $98 from same store properties for the year ended December 31, 2018.\nProperty expenses: Property expenses increased $9,244 for the year ended December 31, 2018 to $17,449 as compared to $8,205 for the year ended December 31, 2017 primarily for expenses related to the new property acquisitions of $9,157. Property expenses for the same store properties increased approximately $87 for the year ended December 31, 2018.\nDepreciation and amortization: Depreciation and amortization expense increased by approximately $12,790 to approximately $26,788 for the year ended December 31, 2018 as compared to $13,998 for the year ended December 31, 2017, primarily due to depreciation and amortization on the new property acquisitions of $13,534 offset by lower depreciation and amortization expense for the same store properties of $744.\nGeneral and administrative: General and administrative expenses increased approximately $843 to $6,032 for the year ended December 31, 2018 as compared to $5,189 for the year ended December 31, 2017. The increase is attributable primarily to an increase in salaries and benefits of $912 due to higher head count, increased occupancy costs due to our headquarters expansion of $176 and increased insurance costs of $92, partially offset by a decrease in professional fees of $461 due to lower non-capitalizable transaction legal and other professional costs.\nAcquisition expenses: Acquisition costs decreased $103 to $0 for the year ended December 31, 2018 as compared to $103 for the year ended December 31, 2017. Acquisition expenses for the year ended December 31, 2017 included costs for acquisitions we decided not to pursue.\nOther operating revenue: Other revenue represents interest income and other items not directly related to the operations of our portfolio. The increase in other revenue by $531 to $534 for the year ended December 31, 2018 as compared to $3 for the year ended December 31, 2017, was due to a non-recurring fee for services provided by the Company for a joint venture that did not materialize.\nInterest expense: Interest expense increased by approximately $4,153 to $15,734 for the year ended December 31, 2018 as compared to $11,581 for the year ended December 31, 2017. The increase was due to increased debt resulting from acquisitions, offset by decreases as a result of the refinancing of the Company's debt throughout 2018. The schedule below is a comparative analysis of the components of interest expense for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017.

There were no sales of real estate in 2017.\nGain on disposition of equity investment: Gain on disposition of equity investment represents amounts received in excess of our basis for an equity investment in real estate liquidated in 2016. In 2017, we recognized gain of $231 which represented the final settlement of the joint venture.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nIn this annual report on Form 10-K, we disclose NOI, EBITDA, FFO and AFFO, each of which meet the definition of non-GAAP financial measure\u201d set forth in Item 10(e) of Regulation S-K promulgated by the SEC. As a result, we are required to include in this report a statement of why management believes that presentation of these measures provides useful information to investors.\nNone of NOI, EBITDA, FFO or AFFO should be considered as an alternative to net income (determined in accordance with GAAP) as an indication of our performance, and we believe that to understand our performance further NOI, EBITDA, FFO, and AFFO should be compared with our reported net income or net loss and considered in addition to cash flows in accordance with GAAP, as presented in our consolidated financial statements.\nNOI\nWe consider net operating income, or NOI, to be an appropriate supplemental measure to net income because it helps both investors and management understand the core operations of our properties. We define NOI as total revenue (including rental revenue, tenant reimbursements, management, leasing and development services revenue and other income) less property-level operating expenses including allocated overhead. NOI excludes depreciation and amortization, general and administrative expenses, impairments, gain/loss on sale of real estate, interest expense, and other non-operating items.\nThe following is a reconciliation from historical reported net loss, the most directly comparable financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP, to NOI:\nTable 29: <table> <tr> <td>(In thousands) </td> <td> </td> <td>Year Ended December 31, </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Historical Consolidated </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2018 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2017 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>NOI: </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Net loss </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(21,175 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(14,027 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>General and administrative </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6,032 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5,189 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Acquisition costs </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>103 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Depreciation and amortization </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>26,788 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>13,998 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Interest expense </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>15,734 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>11,581 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Loss on debt extinguishment </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5,393 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Gain on sale of Real Estate </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(1,004 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Other expense (income) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(534 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(234 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>NOI </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>31,234 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>16,610 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nEBITDA\nWe believe that earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, or EBITDA, is helpful to investors as a supplemental measure of our operating performance as a real estate company because it is a direct measure of the actual operating results of our industrial properties. We also use this measure in ratios to compare our performance to that of our industry peers.

We consider FFO to be an appropriate supplemental measure of our operating performance as it is based on a net income analysis of property portfolio performance that excludes non-cash items such as depreciation. The historical accounting convention used for real estate assets requires straight-line depreciation of buildings and improvements, which implies that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time. Since real estate values rise and fall with market conditions, presentations of operating results for a REIT, using historical accounting for depreciation, could be less informative. We define FFO, consistent with the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts, or NAREIT, definition, as net income, computed in accordance with GAAP, excluding: gains (or losses) from sales of property, depreciation and amortization of real estate assets, impairment losses, losses on extinguishment of debt and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures. Adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures will be calculated to reflect FFO on the same basis. Other equity REITs may not calculate FFO (in accordance with the NAREIT definition) as we do, and, accordingly, our FFO may not be comparable to such other REITs' FFO. FFO should not be used as a measure of our liquidity, and is not indicative of funds available for our cash needs, including our ability to pay dividends. FFO attributable to common stockholders and unitholders represents FFO reduced by dividends paid (or declared) to holders of our preferred stock.\nThe following table sets forth a reconciliation of our historical net loss to FFO available to common stockholders and unit holders for the periods presented:\nTable 31: <table> <tr> <td>(In thousands) </td> <td> </td> <td>Year Ended December 31, </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Historical Consolidated </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2018 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2017 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>FFO: </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Net loss </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(21,175 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(14,027 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Depreciation and amortization </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>26,788 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>13,998 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Loss on debt extinguishment </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5,393 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Gain on sale of Real Estate </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(1,004 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Gain on disposition of equity investment </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(231 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>FFO </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>10,002 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(260 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Preferred stock dividends </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(3,940 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(723 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>FFO available to common stockholders and unit holders </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>6,062 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(983 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n</table>\nAFFO\nAdjusted funds from operation, or AFFO, is presented in addition to FFO. AFFO is defined as FFO, excluding certain non-cash operating revenues and expenses, acquisition and transaction related costs for transactions not completed and recurring capitalized expenditures. Recurring capitalized expenditures includes expenditures required to maintain and re-tenant our properties, tenant improvements and leasing commissions. AFFO further adjusts FFO for certain other non-cash items, including the amortization or accretion of above or below market rents included in revenues, straight line rent adjustments, impairment losses, non-cash equity compensation and non-cash interest expense.\nWe believe AFFO provides a useful supplemental measure of our operating performance because it provides a consistent comparison of our operating performance across time periods that is comparable for each type of real estate investment and is consistent with management's analysis of the operating performance of our properties. As a result, we believe that the use of AFFO, together with the required GAAP presentations, provide a more complete understanding of our operating performance.\nAs with FFO, our reported AFFO may not be comparable to other REITs' AFFO, should not be used as a measure of our liquidity, and is not indicative of our funds available for our cash needs, including our ability to pay dividends.\nThe following table sets forth a reconciliation of FFO attributable to common stockholders and unit holders to AFFO.\nTable 32: <table> <tr> <td>(In thousands) </td> <td> </td> <td>Year Ended December 31, </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Historical Consolidated </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2018 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2017 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>FFO attributable to common stockholders and unit holders </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>6,062 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(983 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Deferred finance fee amortization </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,482 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>868 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Non-cash interest expense </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>656 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,531 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Acquisition costs </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>103 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Stock compensation </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>805 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>435 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Straight line rent </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(996 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(191 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Above/below market lease rents </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(1,304 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(423 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Recurring capital expenditures (1) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(2,695 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(522 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>AFFO </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>4,010 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>818 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\n_______________\n (1) Excludes non-recurring capital expenditures of $2,601 and $1,272 for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. \nCash Flow\nA summary of our cash flows for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 are as follows:\nTable 34: <table> <tr> <td>(In thousands) </td> <td> </td> <td>Year Ended </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2018 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2017 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Net cash provided by operating activities </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>14,867 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>8,104 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Net cash used in investing activities </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(141,923 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(171,844 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Net cash provided by financing activities </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>122,854 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>172,702 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nOperating activities: Net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2018 increased approximately $6,763 compared to the year ended December 31, 2017 primarily due to an increase in operating cash flows from property acquisitions, accounts payable and accrued expenses and depreciation expense, partially offset by fluctuations within working capital due to the timing of payments and rent receipts.\nInvesting activities: Net cash used in investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2018 decreased approximately $29,921 compared to the year ended December 31, 2017 primarily due a decrease in cash paid for acquisitions in 2018 of $142,635 compared to $170,788 in 2017, offset by the sale of property in 2018 for $4,562 and increase in real estate improvements expenditure of $2,563.\nFinancing activities: Net cash provided by financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2018 decreased approximately $49,848 to $122,854 for the year ended December 31, 2018, compared to $172,702 during the year ended December 31, 2017. Net cash provided by financing activities during the year ended December 31, 2018 included net proceeds from the issuance of common and preferred stock of approximately $89,613 and net borrowings of $49,378, offset by cash used for dividends of $11,083 and the repurchase of common stock of $5,054. Net cash provided by financing activities during the year ended December 31, 2017 included net proceeds from the issuance of common and preferred stock of approximately $101,490 and net borrowings of $98,549, offset by cash used for dividends of $1,755 and the redemption of the non-controlling interest of $25,582.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nWe intend to make reserve allocations as necessary to aid our objective of preserving capital for our investors by supporting the maintenance and viability of properties we acquire in the future. If reserves and any other available income become insufficient to cover our operating expenses and liabilities, it may be necessary to obtain additional funds by borrowing, refinancing properties or liquidating our investments.\nOur short-term liquidity requirements consist primarily of funds to pay for operating expenses and other expenditures directly associated with our properties, including:\nTable 35: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u00b7 </td> <td>property expenses that are not borne by our tenants under our leases; </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td>\u00b7 </td> <td>interest expense on outstanding indebtedness; </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td>\u00b7 </td> <td>general and administrative expenses; and </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td>\u00b7 </td> <td>capital expenditures for tenant improvements and leasing commissions. </td> </tr>\n</table>\nIn addition, we will require funds for future dividends required to be paid on our Series A and Series B Preferred Stock.\nWe intend to satisfy our short-term liquidity requirements through our existing cash, cash flow from operating activities and the net proceeds of any potential future offerings.\nOur long-term liquidity needs consist primarily of funds necessary to pay for acquisitions, recurring and non-recurring capital expenditures and scheduled debt maturities. We intend to satisfy our long-term liquidity needs through cash flow from operations, long-term secured and unsecured borrowings, future issuances of equity and debt securities, property dispositions and joint venture transactions, and, in connection with acquisitions of additional properties, the issuance of OP units.\nExisting Indebtedness as of December 31, 2018 (dollars in thousands)\n$120,000 AIG Loan\nCertain indirect subsidiaries of the Operating Partnership have entered into a senior secured loan agreement with investment entities managed by AIG Asset Management (the AIG Loan\u201d).\nAs of December 31, 2018 and 2017, there was $120,000 of principal indebtedness outstanding under the AIG Loan. The AIG Loan bears interest at 4.08% per annum and has a seven-year term maturing in October, 2023. The AIG Loan provides for monthly payments of interest only for the first three years of the term and thereafter monthly principal and interest payments based on a 27-year amortization period.\nThe borrowings under the AIG Loan are secured by first lien mortgages on the properties held by wholly-owned subsidiaries of Plymouth Industrial 20 LLC (see Note 8 to the consolidated financial statements). The obligations under the AIG Loan are also guaranteed in certain circumstances by the Company and certain of the Operating Partnership's wholly-owned subsidiaries.\nThe AIG Loan agreement contains customary representations and warranties, as well as affirmative and negative covenants. The negative covenants include restrictions on additional indebtedness, restrictions on liens, fundamental changes, dispositions, restricted payments, change in nature of business, transactions with affiliates and burdensome agreements. The AIG Loan contains financial covenants that require minimum liquidity and Net Worth. The AIG Loan is subject to acceleration upon certain specified events of defaults, including breaches of representations or covenants, failure to pay other material indebtedness, failure to pay taxes or a change of control of our company, as defined in the senior secured loan agreement. The Company is in compliance with the respective covenants at December 31, 2018. The Company has no right to prepay all or any part of the AIG Loan before November 1, 2019. Following that date, the AIG Loan can only be paid in full, and a prepayment penalty would be assessed, as defined in the agreement.\nThe borrowings amounted to $117,263 and $116,700, net of $2,737 and $3,300 of unamortized debt issuance costs at December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively.\nMinnesota Life Loan\nOn April 30, 2018, certain subsidiaries of our operating partnership entered into a secured loan agreement with Minnesota Life Insurance Company, or the Minnesota Life Loan, in the original principal amount of $21,500. The Minnesota Life Loan bears interest at 3.78% per annum and has a ten-year term, maturing on May 1, 2028. The Minnesota Life Loan provides for monthly payments of interest only for the first year of the term and thereafter monthly principal and interest payments based on a 30-year amortization period. The borrowings under the Minnesota Life Loan are secured by first lien mortgages on seven of the Company's properties.\nThe Minnesota Life Loan contains customary affirmative and negative covenants, including limitations with respect to indebtedness, liens, investments, distributions, mergers and acquisitions, dispositions of assets and transactions with affiliates. The Company is in compliance with the respective covenants at December 31, 2018.\nBorrowings outstanding amounted to $21,133, net of $367 of unamortized debt issuance costs at December 31, 2018.\nTransamerica Loan\nOn July 10, 2018, certain wholly-owned subsidiaries (the Borrowers\u201d) of the Company entered into a loan agreement (the Transamerica Loan\u201d) with Transamerica Life Insurance Company providing for commercial mortgage loans to the Borrowers in the aggregate principal amount of $78,000. The Transamerica Loan matures on August 1, 2028 and bears interest at the fixed rate of 4.35% per annum. The promissory notes (the Notes\u201d) evidencing the Transamerica Loan require the Borrowers to make monthly interest-only payments through August 2019 and thereafter the Transamerica Loan requires equal monthly installments of principal plus accrued interest based on a 30-year amortization period. The Borrowers may repay the Transamerica Loan at any time following the first twelve full calendar months of the Transamerica Loan's term, subject to paying a premium equal to the greater of (a) 1% of the prepayment amount and (b) the Yield Protection Amount,\u201d as defined in the Notes.\nThe Transamerica Loan and the Notes contain customary events of default, including non-payment of principal or interest and bankruptcy. Any default under the Transamerica Loan or any Note will constitute a default under each of the other Notes. Each Borrower has guaranteed the payment obligations of all the other Borrowers under the Notes.\nOn December 19, 2018, the Company repaid $3,380 of the Transamerica Loan as part of the sale of 525 West Marquette, 1 of the 18 properties that serves as collateral for the Transamerica Loan. The Company recognized a $395 loss on extinguishment of debt at the time of the partial repayment. Borrowings outstanding amounted to $73,609, net of $1,011 of unamortized debt issuance costs at December 31, 2018.\nFisher Park Mortgage\nOn October 15, 2018, the Operating Partnership (the Borrower\u201d) assumed a mortgage (the Fisher Park Mortgage\u201d) with a balance of $13,907 as part of our acquisition of the property in greater Cincinnati. The Fisher Park Mortgage, held by JP Morgan Chase Bank, matures on January 1, 2027, bears interest at 5.229% and is secured by the property. The Fisher Park Mortgage requires monthly installments of principal plus accrued interest based on a 30-year amortization. As part of the allocation of the Fisher Park purchase price per ASC 805, the Company recorded a $92 premium on the assumed debt value.\nThe Fisher Park Mortgage contains customary events of default, including non-payment of principal or interest and bankruptcy and certain trigger events to occur upon the Debt Service Coverage Ratio going below certain thresholds as defined within the loan agreement.\nBorrowings outstanding amounted to $13,873 at December 31, 2018.\nKeyBank Bridge Loan\nOn December 14, 2018, the Operating Partnership and certain of its subsidiaries entered into a loan agreement (the KeyBank Bridge Loan\u201d) with KeyBank National Association ( KeyBank\u201d). The Key Bank Bridge Loan provides for a secured loan in the amount of $63,115. The KeyBank Bridge Loan bears interest at a rate per annum at either (1) the base rate (determined from the highest of (a) KeyBank's prime rate, (b) the federal funds rate plus 0.50% and (c) the one month LIBOR rate plus 1.0%) or (2) LIBOR plus 2%. At December 31, 2018 the interest rate was 4.44%. The KeyBank Bridge Loan matures on the earlier of March 14, 2019 or the date KeyBank ceases to serve as the administrative agent under the Company's revolving credit facility; however, the Operating Partnership has the right to prepay the KeyBank Bridge Loan at any time without penalty. Borrowings under the KeyBank Bridge Loan are secured by the Jacksonville Property and are guaranteed by the Company and each subsidiary of the Operating Partnership that is the direct or indirect owner of any collateral for the KeyBank Bridge Loan.\nThe KeyBank Bridge Loan contains customary affirmative and negative and financial covenants, including limitations with respect to indebtedness, liens, investments, distributions, mergers and transactions with affiliates as outlined within the loan agreement. The Company is in compliance with the respective covenants at December 31, 2018.\nBorrowings outstanding amounted to $63,115 at December 31, 2018.\nLine of Credit Agreement\nOn August 11, 2017 the Company's operating partnership entered into a secured line of credit agreement (Line of Credit Agreement) with KeyBank National Association, or KeyBank and the other lenders, which matures in August 2020 with an optional extension through August 2021, subject to certain conditions. Borrowings under the Line of Credit Agreement bear interest at either (1) the base rate (determined from the highest of (a) KeyBank's prime rate, (b) the federal funds rate plus 0.50% and (c) the one month LIBOR rate plus 1.0%) or (2) LIBOR, plus, in either case, a spread between 250 and 300 basis points depending on our total leverage ratio. At December 31, 2018 the interest rate was 5.4%.\nOn March 8, 2018, the Company entered into an Increase Agreement to our Line of Credit Agreement with KeyBank National Association to increase our revolving credit facility to $45,000. All other terms of the Line of Credit Agreement remained unchanged.\nThe Line of Credit Agreement, consistent with the KeyBank Bridege Loan covenants, contains customary affirmative and negative and financial covenants, including limitations with respect to indebtedness, liens, investments, distributions, mergers and transactions with affiliates as outlined within the Line of Credit Agreement. The Company is in compliance with the respective covenants at December 31, 2018. The Line of Credit Agreement is secured by certain assets of the Company's operating partnership and certain of its subsidiaries and includes a Company's guarantee for the payment of all indebtedness under the Line of Credit Agreement. Borrowings outstanding amounted to $28,187 and $20,837, net of unamortized debt issuance costs of $363 and $488 at December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively.\nContractual Obligations and Commitments\nThe following table sets forth our principal obligations and commitments as of December 31, 2018:\nFuture Minimum Rents\n($ in thousands)\nTable 36: <table> <tr> <td>Corporate Office </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>378 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>385 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2021 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>393 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2022 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>400 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2023 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>407 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Thereafter </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>519 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nIn addition to the contractual obligations set forth in the table above, we have entered into employment agreements with certain of our executive officers. As approved by the compensation committee of the Board of Directors the agreements provide for base salaries ranging from $200 to $300 annually with discretionary cash performance awards. The agreements contain provisions for equity awards, general benefits, and termination and severance provisions, consistent with similar positions and companies.\nWe also enter into contracts for maintenance and other services at certain properties from time to time.\nRedeemable Preferred Member Interests\nOn October 17, 2016, and in connection with its refinancing of its Senior Loan with Torchlight, the Company issued Torchlight a 99.5% redeemable preferred member interest in 20 LLC in exchange for $30,553. The redeemable preferred member interest was redeemed in full as of June 14, 2017. The redemption resulted in elimination of the non-controlling interest and an adjustment to equity (deficit) in the amount of $56,795. An adjustment to the redemption price in the first quarter of 2017 was deemed a non-cash capital contribution in the amount of $1,019.\nThe Company had classified this amount as a liability in accordance with ASC 480, Distinguishing Liabilities from Equity (ASC 480). Because the member interest was mandatorily redeemable, the Company concluded that the required redemption of that interest represented a continuing interest in the properties and therefore, the issuance of the redeemable preferred member interest represented a financing of 20 LLC and not a sale of the properties.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe have no off-balance sheet arrangements.\nInflation\nThe majority of our leases are either triple net or provide for tenant reimbursement for costs related to real estate taxes and operating expenses. In addition, most of the leases provide for fixed rent increases. We believe that inflationary increases may be at least partially offset by the contractual rent increases and tenant payment of taxes and expenses described above. We do not believe that inflation has had a material impact on our historical financial position or results of operations.\nInterest Rate Risk\nASC 815, Derivatives and Hedging (formerly known as SFAS No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and hedging Activities, as amended by SFAS No. 138, Accounting for Certain Derivative Instruments and Certain Hedging Activities), requires us to recognize all derivatives on the balance sheet at fair value. Derivatives that are not hedges must be adjusted to fair value and the changes in fair value must be reflected as income or expense. If the derivative is a hedge, depending on the nature of the hedge, changes in the fair value of derivatives are either offset against the change in fair value of the hedged assets, liabilities, or firm commitments through earnings or recognized in other comprehensive income, which is a component of stockholders' equity. The ineffective portion of a derivative's change in fair value is immediately recognized in earnings.\nThe Company uses an interest rate cap as a derivative instrument to manage interest rate risk and is recognized on the balance sheet at fair value. The interest rate cap is not designated as a hedging instrument and changes in fair value is mark to market through earnings. The input values used in the fair value measurement of the interest rate cap were obtained using quoted market prices for similar assets in markets that are not active and therefore are, classified as Level 2 under the fair value hierarchy. The fair value of the interest rate cap is estimated based on discounting future cash flows interest rates that management believes reflect the risks associated with debt instruments of similar risk and duration. The fair value of the interest rate cap agreement was $0 at December 31, 2018. At December 31, 2018 the one-month LIBOR was 2.52%.\nRelated to this interest rate cap agreement, a 100 basis point increase above LIBOR being 4% will decrease our interest expense by approximately $798 per annum.\nAs discussed in Note 5 of our consolidated financial statements, the MWG Loan Agreement was paid in full as of July 10, 2018. The key terms of the interest rate cap agreement with J.P. Morgan remained in place after the repayment of the MWG Loan Agreement and it continues to have a maturity date of December 1, 2019.\nNo assurance can be given that any future hedging activities by us will have the desired beneficial effect on our results of operations or financial condition.\nRecently Issued Accounting Standards\nWe have reviewed all recently issued standards and have determined that, other than as disclosed in Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements appearing in this annual report on Form 10-K, such standards will not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements or do not otherwise apply to our operations.", "item_7_text": "Item 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe following discussion and analysis is based on, and should be read in conjunction with our audited historical financial statements and related notes thereto as of and for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017.\nOverview\nWe are a full service, vertically integrated, self-administered and self-managed REIT focused on the acquisition, ownership and management of single- and multi-tenant Class B industrial properties, including distribution centers, warehouses and light industrial properties. The Company Portfolio consists of 55 industrial properties located in ten states with an aggregate of approximately 12 million rentable square feet leased to 182 different tenants.\nOur strategy is to invest in single- and multi-tenant Class B industrial properties located primarily in secondary markets across the U.S.; however, we may make opportunistic acquisitions of Class A industrial properties or industrial properties located in primary markets. We seek to generate attractive risk-adjusted returns for our stockholders through a combination of dividends and capital appreciation.\nFactors That May Influence Future Results of Operations\nBusiness and Strategy\nOur core investment strategy is to acquire primarily Class B industrial properties predominantly in secondary markets across the U.S. We expect to acquire these properties through third-party purchases and structured sale-leasebacks where we believe we can achieve high initial yields and strong ongoing cash-on-cash returns. In addition, we may make opportunistic acquisitions of Class A industrial properties or industrial properties in primary markets that offer similar return characteristics.\nOur target markets are comprised primarily of secondary markets because we believe these markets tend to have less occupancy and rental rate volatility and less buyer competition relative to primary markets. We also believe that the systematic aggregation of such properties will result in a diversified portfolio that will produce sustainable risk-adjusted returns. Future results of operations may be affected, either positively or negatively, by our ability to effectively execute this strategy.\nWe also intend to pursue joint venture arrangements with institutional partners which could provide management fee income as well as residual profit-sharing income. Such joint ventures may involve investing in industrial assets that would be characterized as opportunistic or value-add investments. These may involve development or re-development strategies that may require significant up-front capital expenditures, lengthy lease-up periods and result in inconsistent cash flows. As such, these properties' risk profiles and return metrics would likely differ from the non-joint venture properties that we target for acquisition.\nRental Revenue and Tenant Recoveries\nWe receive income primarily from rental revenue and tenant recoveries from our properties. The amount of rental revenue generated by the Company Portfolio depends principally on the occupancy levels and lease rates at our properties, our ability to lease currently available space and space that becomes available as a result of lease expirations and on the rental rates at our properties. As of December 31, 2018, the Company Portfolio was approximately 95% occupied. Our occupancy rate is impacted by general market conditions in the geographic areas which our properties are located and the financial condition of tenants in our target markets.\nScheduled Lease Expirations\nOur ability to re-lease space subject to expiring leases will impact our results of operations and will be affected by economic and competitive conditions in the markets in which we operate and by the desirability of our individual properties. During the period from January 1, 2019 through to December 31, 2020, an aggregate of 26.9% of the annualized base rent leases in the Company Portfolio are scheduled to expire, which we believe will provide us an opportunity to adjust below market rates as market conditions continue to improve.\nDuring 2017 and 2018, leases for space totaling 1,995,389 square feet (16.7% of the Company Portfolio) either was subject to renewal or expired. Approximately 41.4% of the expired space was renewed and an additional 1,013,475 square feet (including a net 207,114 square feet of previously vacant space) was leased long term with new tenants. As of December 31, 2018, the vacancy rate of the Company Portfolio was 5.0%.\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2018, we negotiated 29 leases with durations in excess of six months encompassing 1,730,221 square feet and negotiated 5 leases with a duration of less than 6 months encompassing 121,735 square feet. Renewed leases made up 41.4% of the square footage covered by the 29 leases in excess of 6 months, and the rent under the renewed leases decreased an average of -1.7% over the prior leases. Leases to new tenants comprised the other 58.6% of the square footage covered by the 29 leases in excess of 6 months, and the rent under the new leases increased an average of 17.0% over the prior leases. The rental rates under the 29 leases in excess of 6 months entered into during 2017 and 2018, increased by an average of 6.5% over the rates of the prior leases.\nThe table below reflects certain data about our new and renewed leases with terms of greater than six months executed in the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2018.\n\nConditions in Our Markets\nThe Company Portfolio is located primarily in various secondary markets in the eastern half of the U.S. Positive or negative changes in economic or other conditions, adverse weather conditions and natural disasters in these markets are likely to affect our overall performance.\nRental Expenses\nOur rental expenses generally consist of utilities, real estate taxes, insurance and site repair and maintenance costs. For the majority of the Company Portfolio, rental expenses are controlled, in part, by either the triple net provisions or modified gross lease expense reimbursement provisions in tenant leases. However, the terms of our tenant leases vary and in some instances the leases may provide that we are responsible for certain rental expenses. Accordingly, our overall financial results will be impacted by the extent to which we are able to pass-through rental expenses to our tenants.\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses\nWe expect to incur increased general and administrative expenses, including legal, accounting and other expenses related to corporate governance and public reporting and compliance. In addition, we anticipate that our staffing levels will increase slightly from fifteen employees as of the date of this annual report on Form 10-K to between 16 and 18 employees during the 12 to 24 months following December 31, 2018 and, as a result, our general and administrative expenses will increase further.\nCritical Accounting Policies\nOur discussion and analysis of our company's historical financial condition and results of operations are based upon its consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of these financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions in certain circumstances that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amount of revenue and expenses in the reporting period. Actual amounts may differ from these estimates and assumptions.\nWe believe our most critical accounting policies are the regular evaluation of whether the value of a real estate asset has been impaired and accounting for acquisitions. Each of these items involves estimates that require management to make judgments that are subjective in nature. We collect historical data and current market data, and based on our experience we analyze these assumptions in order to arrive at what we believe to be reasonable estimates. Under different conditions or assumptions, materially different amounts could be reported related to the accounting policies described below. In addition, application of these accounting policies involves the exercise of judgments on the use of assumptions as to future uncertainties and, as a result, actual results could materially differ from these estimates.\nUse of Estimates\nThe preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the condensed consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Management makes significant estimates regarding the allocation of tangible and intangible assets or business acquisitions, impairments of long-lived assets, stock-based compensation and its common stock warrant liability. These estimates and assumptions are based on management's best estimates and judgment. Management evaluates its estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis using historical experience and other factors, including the current economic environment. Management adjusts such estimates when facts and circumstances dictate. As future events and their effects cannot be determined with precision, actual results could differ from those estimates and assumptions.\nCash\nWe maintain our cash in bank deposit accounts, which at times may exceed federally insured limits. As of December 31, 2018, we had not realized any losses in such cash accounts and believe that we are not exposed to any significant risk of loss.\nIncome Taxes\nWe elected to be taxed as a REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes commencing with our taxable year ended December 31, 2012 and we believe that our organization and method of operation enable us to continue to meet the requirements for qualification and taxation as a REIT. We had no taxable income prior to electing REIT status. To maintain our qualification as a REIT, we must meet certain organizational and operational requirements, including a requirement to distribute at least 90% of our annual REIT taxable income to stockholders (which is computed without regard to the dividends-paid deduction or net capital gain and which does not necessarily equal net income as calculated in accordance with GAAP). As a REIT, we generally will not be subject to federal income tax on income that we distribute as dividends to our stockholders. If we fail to maintain our qualification as a REIT in any tax year, we will be subject to federal income tax on our taxable income at regular corporate income tax rates and generally will not be permitted to qualify for treatment as a REIT for federal income tax purposes for the four taxable years following the year during which qualification is lost, unless we are able to obtain relief under certain statutory provisions. Such an event could materially and adversely affect our net income and net cash available for distribution to stockholders.\nInvestments in Real Estate\nWe generally acquire individual properties, and, in some instances, a portfolio of properties. When we acquire individual operating properties with the intention to hold the investment for the long-term, we allocate the purchase price to the various components of the acquisition based upon the fair value of each component. The components typically include land, building, debt, intangible assets related to above and below market leases, value of costs to obtain tenants, and other assumed assets and liabilities. We consider Level 3 inputs such as the replacement cost of such assets, appraisals, property condition reports, comparable market rental data and other related information in determining the fair value of the tangible assets. The recorded fair value of intangible lease assets or liabilities includes Level 3 inputs including the value associated with leasing commissions, legal and other costs, as well as the estimated period necessary to lease such property and lease commencement. An intangible asset or liability resulting from in-place leases that are above or below the market rental rates are valued based upon our estimates of prevailing market rates for similar leases. Intangible lease assets or liabilities are amortized over the estimated, reasonably assured lease term of the remaining in-place leases as an adjustment to Rental revenues\u201d or Real estate related depreciation and amortization\u201d depending on the nature of the intangible. The valuation of assumed liabilities is based on our estimate of the current market rates for similar liabilities in effect at the acquisition date.\nIn an acquisition of multiple properties, we must also allocate the purchase price among the properties. The allocation of the purchase price is based on our assessment of estimated fair value and often is based upon the expected future cash flows of the property and various characteristics of the markets where the property is located. The fair value may also include an enterprise value premium that we estimate a third party would be willing to pay for a portfolio of properties. The initial allocation of the purchase price is based on management's preliminary assessment, which may differ when final information becomes available.\nCapitalization of Costs and Depreciation and Amortization\nWe capitalize costs incurred in developing, renovating, rehabilitating and improving real estate assets as part of the investment basis. Costs incurred in making repairs and maintaining real estate assets are expensed as incurred. During the land development and construction periods, we capitalize interest costs, insurance, real estate taxes and certain general and administrative costs of the personnel performing development, renovations and rehabilitation if such costs are incremental and identifiable to a specific activity to get the asset ready for its intended use. Capitalized costs are included in the investment basis of real estate assets. We also capitalize costs incurred to successfully originate a lease that result directly from, and are essential to, the acquisition of that lease. Leasing costs that meet the requirements for capitalization are presented as a component of other assets. Upon our adoption of ASU 2017-01 Business Combinations (Topic 805) Clarifying the Definition of a Business, all acquisitions made subsequent to June 30, 2017 will generally be accounted for as asset acquisitions. As such all acquisition costs incurred as part of the purchase of real estate property acquisitions will be capitalized. Acquisition costs incurred as part of our real estate property prior to July 1, 2017 were expensed as acquisition costs.\nReal estate, including land, building and land improvements, tenant improvements, and furniture, fixtures and equipment, leasing costs and intangible lease assets and liabilities are stated at historical cost less accumulated depreciation and amortization, unless circumstances indicate that the cost cannot be recovered, in which case, the carrying value of the property is reduced to estimated fair value as discussed below in our policy with regards to impairment of long-lived assets. We estimate the depreciable portion of our real estate assets and related useful lives in order to record depreciation expense. Our ability to estimate the depreciable portions of our real estate assets and useful lives is critical to the determination of the appropriate amount of depreciation and amortization expense recorded and the carrying value of the underlying assets. Any change to the assets to be depreciated and the estimated depreciable lives of these assets would have an impact on the depreciation expense recognized.\nAs discussed above in investments in real estate, in connection with property acquisitions, we may acquire leases with rental rates above or below the market rental rates. Such differences are recorded as an intangible lease asset or liability and amortized to Rental revenues\u201d over the reasonably assured term of the related leases. The unamortized balances of these assets and liabilities associated with the early termination of leases are fully amortized to their respective revenue line items in our consolidated financial statements over the shorter of the expected life of such assets and liabilities or the remaining lease term.\nOur estimate of the useful life of our assets is evaluated upon acquisition and when circumstances indicate a change in the useful life, which requires significant judgment regarding the economic obsolescence of tangible and intangible assets.\nImpairment of Long-Lived Assets\nWe assess the carrying values of our respective long-lived assets, including goodwill, whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts of these assets may not be fully recoverable.\nRecoverability of real estate assets is measured by comparison of the carrying amount of the asset to the estimated future undiscounted cash flows. In order to review our real estate assets for recoverability, we consider current market conditions, as well as our intent with respect to holding or disposing of the asset. Our intent with regard to the underlying assets might change as market conditions change, as well as other factors, especially in the current global economic environment. Fair value is determined through various valuation techniques, including discounted cash flow models, applying a capitalization rate to estimated net operating income of a property and quoted market values and third-party appraisals, where considered necessary. The use of projected future cash flows is based on assumptions that are consistent with our estimates of future expectations and the strategic plan we use to manage our underlying business. If our analysis indicates that the carrying value of the real estate asset is not recoverable on an undiscounted cash flow basis, we recognize an impairment charge for the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the current estimated fair value of the real estate property.\nAssumptions and estimates used in the recoverability analyses for future cash flows, discount rates and capitalization rates are complex and subjective. Changes in economic and operating conditions or our intent with regard to our investment that occurs subsequent to our impairment analyses could impact these assumptions and result in future impairment of our real estate properties.\nValuation of Receivables\nWe are subject to tenant defaults and bankruptcies that could affect the collection of outstanding receivables. In order to mitigate these risks, we perform credit reviews and analyses on prospective tenants before significant leases are executed and on existing tenants before properties are acquired. We specifically analyze aged receivables, customer credit-worthiness, historical bad debts and current economic trends when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts. As a result of our periodic analysis, we maintain an allowance for estimated losses that may result from the inability of our tenants to make required payments. This estimate requires significant judgment related to the lessees' ability to fulfill their obligations under the leases. If a tenant is insolvent or files for bankruptcy protection and fails to make contractual payments beyond any allowance, we may recognize additional bad debt expense in future periods equal to the net outstanding balances, which include amounts recognized as straight-line revenue not realizable until future periods.\nConsolidation\nWe consolidate all entities that are wholly owned and those in which we own less than 100% but control, as well as any variable interest entities in which we are the primary beneficiary. We evaluate our ability to control an entity and whether the entity is a variable interest entity and we are the primary beneficiary through consideration of the substantive terms of the arrangement to identify which enterprise has the power to direct the activities of a variable interest entity that most significantly impacts the entity's economic performance and the obligation to absorb losses of the entity or the right to receive benefits from the entity. Investments in entities in which we do not control but over which we have the ability to exercise significant influence over operating and financial policies are presented under the equity method. Investments in entities that we do not control and over which we do not exercise significant influence are carried at the lower of cost or fair value, as appropriate. Our ability to correctly assess our influence and/or control over an entity affects the presentation of these investments in our consolidated financial statements.\nResults of Operations (dollars in thousands)\nYear Ended December 31, 2018 Compared to December 31, 2017\nWe define same store portfolio as a subset of our consolidated portfolio and includes properties that were wholly-owned by us for the entire period presented. We define acquisitions/dispositions as any properties that were acquired or sold during the period from January 1, 2017 through December 31, 2018.\n\nRental revenue: Rental revenue increased by approximately $18,260 to $36,632 for the year ended December 31, 2018 as compared to $18,372 for the year ended December 31, 2017. The increase was primarily related to rental revenue from the acquired properties from the date of acquisition in 2018 of $19,324 offset by a decrease of $1,064 from same store properties primarily driven by vacancies within the same store portfolio.\nTenant recoveries: Tenant recoveries increased by approximately $5,608 to $12,051 for the year ended December 31, 2018 as compared to $6,443 for the year ended December 31, 2017. The increase was primarily related to tenant recoveries from the acquisitions made during 2018 of $5,510 and an increase in tenant recoveries of $98 from same store properties for the year ended December 31, 2018.\nProperty expenses: Property expenses increased $9,244 for the year ended December 31, 2018 to $17,449 as compared to $8,205 for the year ended December 31, 2017 primarily for expenses related to the new property acquisitions of $9,157. Property expenses for the same store properties increased approximately $87 for the year ended December 31, 2018.\nDepreciation and amortization: Depreciation and amortization expense increased by approximately $12,790 to approximately $26,788 for the year ended December 31, 2018 as compared to $13,998 for the year ended December 31, 2017, primarily due to depreciation and amortization on the new property acquisitions of $13,534 offset by lower depreciation and amortization expense for the same store properties of $744.\nGeneral and administrative: General and administrative expenses increased approximately $843 to $6,032 for the year ended December 31, 2018 as compared to $5,189 for the year ended December 31, 2017. The increase is attributable primarily to an increase in salaries and benefits of $912 due to higher head count, increased occupancy costs due to our headquarters expansion of $176 and increased insurance costs of $92, partially offset by a decrease in professional fees of $461 due to lower non-capitalizable transaction legal and other professional costs.\nAcquisition expenses: Acquisition costs decreased $103 to $0 for the year ended December 31, 2018 as compared to $103 for the year ended December 31, 2017. Acquisition expenses for the year ended December 31, 2017 included costs for acquisitions we decided not to pursue.\nOther operating revenue: Other revenue represents interest income and other items not directly related to the operations of our portfolio. The increase in other revenue by $531 to $534 for the year ended December 31, 2018 as compared to $3 for the year ended December 31, 2017, was due to a non-recurring fee for services provided by the Company for a joint venture that did not materialize.\nInterest expense: Interest expense increased by approximately $4,153 to $15,734 for the year ended December 31, 2018 as compared to $11,581 for the year ended December 31, 2017. The increase was due to increased debt resulting from acquisitions, offset by decreases as a result of the refinancing of the Company's debt throughout 2018. The schedule below is a comparative analysis of the components of interest expense for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017. For more information about our 2018 financing transactions, see Note 5 to our consolidated audited financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2018 included elsewhere in this annual report.\n\nLoss on extinguishment of debt: Loss on extinguishment of debt of $5,393 in 2018 was due to the early repayment of the Torchlight Mezzanine Loan, MWG Loan, KeyBank Term Loan and partial repayment of the Transamerica Loan.\nGain on sale of real estate: Gain on sale of real estate of $1,004 represents the gain realized on the sale of real estate in 2018. There were no sales of real estate in 2017.\nGain on disposition of equity investment: Gain on disposition of equity investment represents amounts received in excess of our basis for an equity investment in real estate liquidated in 2016. In 2017, we recognized gain of $231 which represented the final settlement of the joint venture.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nIn this annual report on Form 10-K, we disclose NOI, EBITDA, FFO and AFFO, each of which meet the definition of non-GAAP financial measure\u201d set forth in Item 10(e) of Regulation S-K promulgated by the SEC. As a result, we are required to include in this report a statement of why management believes that presentation of these measures provides useful information to investors.\nNone of NOI, EBITDA, FFO or AFFO should be considered as an alternative to net income (determined in accordance with GAAP) as an indication of our performance, and we believe that to understand our performance further NOI, EBITDA, FFO, and AFFO should be compared with our reported net income or net loss and considered in addition to cash flows in accordance with GAAP, as presented in our consolidated financial statements.\nNOI\nWe consider net operating income, or NOI, to be an appropriate supplemental measure to net income because it helps both investors and management understand the core operations of our properties. We define NOI as total revenue (including rental revenue, tenant reimbursements, management, leasing and development services revenue and other income) less property-level operating expenses including allocated overhead. NOI excludes depreciation and amortization, general and administrative expenses, impairments, gain/loss on sale of real estate, interest expense, and other non-operating items.\nThe following is a reconciliation from historical reported net loss, the most directly comparable financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP, to NOI:\n\nEBITDA\nWe believe that earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, or EBITDA, is helpful to investors as a supplemental measure of our operating performance as a real estate company because it is a direct measure of the actual operating results of our industrial properties. We also use this measure in ratios to compare our performance to that of our industry peers. The following table sets forth a reconciliation of our historical net loss to EBITDA for the periods presented.\n\nFFO\nFunds from operations, or FFO, is a non-GAAP financial measure that is widely recognized as a measure of REIT operating performance. We consider FFO to be an appropriate supplemental measure of our operating performance as it is based on a net income analysis of property portfolio performance that excludes non-cash items such as depreciation. The historical accounting convention used for real estate assets requires straight-line depreciation of buildings and improvements, which implies that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time. Since real estate values rise and fall with market conditions, presentations of operating results for a REIT, using historical accounting for depreciation, could be less informative. We define FFO, consistent with the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts, or NAREIT, definition, as net income, computed in accordance with GAAP, excluding: gains (or losses) from sales of property, depreciation and amortization of real estate assets, impairment losses, losses on extinguishment of debt and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures. Adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures will be calculated to reflect FFO on the same basis. Other equity REITs may not calculate FFO (in accordance with the NAREIT definition) as we do, and, accordingly, our FFO may not be comparable to such other REITs' FFO. FFO should not be used as a measure of our liquidity, and is not indicative of funds available for our cash needs, including our ability to pay dividends. FFO attributable to common stockholders and unitholders represents FFO reduced by dividends paid (or declared) to holders of our preferred stock.\nThe following table sets forth a reconciliation of our historical net loss to FFO available to common stockholders and unit holders for the periods presented:\n\nAFFO\nAdjusted funds from operation, or AFFO, is presented in addition to FFO. AFFO is defined as FFO, excluding certain non-cash operating revenues and expenses, acquisition and transaction related costs for transactions not completed and recurring capitalized expenditures. Recurring capitalized expenditures includes expenditures required to maintain and re-tenant our properties, tenant improvements and leasing commissions. AFFO further adjusts FFO for certain other non-cash items, including the amortization or accretion of above or below market rents included in revenues, straight line rent adjustments, impairment losses, non-cash equity compensation and non-cash interest expense.\nWe believe AFFO provides a useful supplemental measure of our operating performance because it provides a consistent comparison of our operating performance across time periods that is comparable for each type of real estate investment and is consistent with management's analysis of the operating performance of our properties. As a result, we believe that the use of AFFO, together with the required GAAP presentations, provide a more complete understanding of our operating performance.\nAs with FFO, our reported AFFO may not be comparable to other REITs' AFFO, should not be used as a measure of our liquidity, and is not indicative of our funds available for our cash needs, including our ability to pay dividends.\nThe following table sets forth a reconciliation of FFO attributable to common stockholders and unit holders to AFFO.\n\n_______________\n (1) Excludes non-recurring capital expenditures of $2,601 and $1,272 for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. \nCash Flow\nA summary of our cash flows for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 are as follows:\n\nOperating activities: Net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2018 increased approximately $6,763 compared to the year ended December 31, 2017 primarily due to an increase in operating cash flows from property acquisitions, accounts payable and accrued expenses and depreciation expense, partially offset by fluctuations within working capital due to the timing of payments and rent receipts.\nInvesting activities: Net cash used in investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2018 decreased approximately $29,921 compared to the year ended December 31, 2017 primarily due a decrease in cash paid for acquisitions in 2018 of $142,635 compared to $170,788 in 2017, offset by the sale of property in 2018 for $4,562 and increase in real estate improvements expenditure of $2,563.\nFinancing activities: Net cash provided by financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2018 decreased approximately $49,848 to $122,854 for the year ended December 31, 2018, compared to $172,702 during the year ended December 31, 2017. Net cash provided by financing activities during the year ended December 31, 2018 included net proceeds from the issuance of common and preferred stock of approximately $89,613 and net borrowings of $49,378, offset by cash used for dividends of $11,083 and the repurchase of common stock of $5,054. Net cash provided by financing activities during the year ended December 31, 2017 included net proceeds from the issuance of common and preferred stock of approximately $101,490 and net borrowings of $98,549, offset by cash used for dividends of $1,755 and the redemption of the non-controlling interest of $25,582.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nWe intend to make reserve allocations as necessary to aid our objective of preserving capital for our investors by supporting the maintenance and viability of properties we acquire in the future. If reserves and any other available income become insufficient to cover our operating expenses and liabilities, it may be necessary to obtain additional funds by borrowing, refinancing properties or liquidating our investments.\nOur short-term liquidity requirements consist primarily of funds to pay for operating expenses and other expenditures directly associated with our properties, including:\n\nIn addition, we will require funds for future dividends required to be paid on our Series A and Series B Preferred Stock.\nWe intend to satisfy our short-term liquidity requirements through our existing cash, cash flow from operating activities and the net proceeds of any potential future offerings.\nOur long-term liquidity needs consist primarily of funds necessary to pay for acquisitions, recurring and non-recurring capital expenditures and scheduled debt maturities. We intend to satisfy our long-term liquidity needs through cash flow from operations, long-term secured and unsecured borrowings, future issuances of equity and debt securities, property dispositions and joint venture transactions, and, in connection with acquisitions of additional properties, the issuance of OP units.\nExisting Indebtedness as of December 31, 2018 (dollars in thousands)\n$120,000 AIG Loan\nCertain indirect subsidiaries of the Operating Partnership have entered into a senior secured loan agreement with investment entities managed by AIG Asset Management (the AIG Loan\u201d).\nAs of December 31, 2018 and 2017, there was $120,000 of principal indebtedness outstanding under the AIG Loan. The AIG Loan bears interest at 4.08% per annum and has a seven-year term maturing in October, 2023. The AIG Loan provides for monthly payments of interest only for the first three years of the term and thereafter monthly principal and interest payments based on a 27-year amortization period.\nThe borrowings under the AIG Loan are secured by first lien mortgages on the properties held by wholly-owned subsidiaries of Plymouth Industrial 20 LLC (see Note 8 to the consolidated financial statements). The obligations under the AIG Loan are also guaranteed in certain circumstances by the Company and certain of the Operating Partnership's wholly-owned subsidiaries.\nThe AIG Loan agreement contains customary representations and warranties, as well as affirmative and negative covenants. The negative covenants include restrictions on additional indebtedness, restrictions on liens, fundamental changes, dispositions, restricted payments, change in nature of business, transactions with affiliates and burdensome agreements. The AIG Loan contains financial covenants that require minimum liquidity and Net Worth. The AIG Loan is subject to acceleration upon certain specified events of defaults, including breaches of representations or covenants, failure to pay other material indebtedness, failure to pay taxes or a change of control of our company, as defined in the senior secured loan agreement. The Company is in compliance with the respective covenants at December 31, 2018. The Company has no right to prepay all or any part of the AIG Loan before November 1, 2019. Following that date, the AIG Loan can only be paid in full, and a prepayment penalty would be assessed, as defined in the agreement.\nThe borrowings amounted to $117,263 and $116,700, net of $2,737 and $3,300 of unamortized debt issuance costs at December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively.\nMinnesota Life Loan\nOn April 30, 2018, certain subsidiaries of our operating partnership entered into a secured loan agreement with Minnesota Life Insurance Company, or the Minnesota Life Loan, in the original principal amount of $21,500. The Minnesota Life Loan bears interest at 3.78% per annum and has a ten-year term, maturing on May 1, 2028. The Minnesota Life Loan provides for monthly payments of interest only for the first year of the term and thereafter monthly principal and interest payments based on a 30-year amortization period. The borrowings under the Minnesota Life Loan are secured by first lien mortgages on seven of the Company's properties.\nThe Minnesota Life Loan contains customary affirmative and negative covenants, including limitations with respect to indebtedness, liens, investments, distributions, mergers and acquisitions, dispositions of assets and transactions with affiliates. The Company is in compliance with the respective covenants at December 31, 2018.\nBorrowings outstanding amounted to $21,133, net of $367 of unamortized debt issuance costs at December 31, 2018.\nTransamerica Loan\nOn July 10, 2018, certain wholly-owned subsidiaries (the Borrowers\u201d) of the Company entered into a loan agreement (the Transamerica Loan\u201d) with Transamerica Life Insurance Company providing for commercial mortgage loans to the Borrowers in the aggregate principal amount of $78,000. The Transamerica Loan matures on August 1, 2028 and bears interest at the fixed rate of 4.35% per annum. The promissory notes (the Notes\u201d) evidencing the Transamerica Loan require the Borrowers to make monthly interest-only payments through August 2019 and thereafter the Transamerica Loan requires equal monthly installments of principal plus accrued interest based on a 30-year amortization period. The Borrowers may repay the Transamerica Loan at any time following the first twelve full calendar months of the Transamerica Loan's term, subject to paying a premium equal to the greater of (a) 1% of the prepayment amount and (b) the Yield Protection Amount,\u201d as defined in the Notes.\nThe Transamerica Loan and the Notes contain customary events of default, including non-payment of principal or interest and bankruptcy. Any default under the Transamerica Loan or any Note will constitute a default under each of the other Notes. Each Borrower has guaranteed the payment obligations of all the other Borrowers under the Notes.\nOn December 19, 2018, the Company repaid $3,380 of the Transamerica Loan as part of the sale of 525 West Marquette, 1 of the 18 properties that serves as collateral for the Transamerica Loan. The Company recognized a $395 loss on extinguishment of debt at the time of the partial repayment. Borrowings outstanding amounted to $73,609, net of $1,011 of unamortized debt issuance costs at December 31, 2018.\nFisher Park Mortgage\nOn October 15, 2018, the Operating Partnership (the Borrower\u201d) assumed a mortgage (the Fisher Park Mortgage\u201d) with a balance of $13,907 as part of our acquisition of the property in greater Cincinnati. The Fisher Park Mortgage, held by JP Morgan Chase Bank, matures on January 1, 2027, bears interest at 5.229% and is secured by the property. The Fisher Park Mortgage requires monthly installments of principal plus accrued interest based on a 30-year amortization. As part of the allocation of the Fisher Park purchase price per ASC 805, the Company recorded a $92 premium on the assumed debt value.\nThe Fisher Park Mortgage contains customary events of default, including non-payment of principal or interest and bankruptcy and certain trigger events to occur upon the Debt Service Coverage Ratio going below certain thresholds as defined within the loan agreement.\nBorrowings outstanding amounted to $13,873 at December 31, 2018.\nKeyBank Bridge Loan\nOn December 14, 2018, the Operating Partnership and certain of its subsidiaries entered into a loan agreement (the KeyBank Bridge Loan\u201d) with KeyBank National Association ( KeyBank\u201d). The Key Bank Bridge Loan provides for a secured loan in the amount of $63,115. The KeyBank Bridge Loan bears interest at a rate per annum at either (1) the base rate (determined from the highest of (a) KeyBank's prime rate, (b) the federal funds rate plus 0.50% and (c) the one month LIBOR rate plus 1.0%) or (2) LIBOR plus 2%. At December 31, 2018 the interest rate was 4.44%. The KeyBank Bridge Loan matures on the earlier of March 14, 2019 or the date KeyBank ceases to serve as the administrative agent under the Company's revolving credit facility; however, the Operating Partnership has the right to prepay the KeyBank Bridge Loan at any time without penalty. Borrowings under the KeyBank Bridge Loan are secured by the Jacksonville Property and are guaranteed by the Company and each subsidiary of the Operating Partnership that is the direct or indirect owner of any collateral for the KeyBank Bridge Loan.\nThe KeyBank Bridge Loan contains customary affirmative and negative and financial covenants, including limitations with respect to indebtedness, liens, investments, distributions, mergers and transactions with affiliates as outlined within the loan agreement. The Company is in compliance with the respective covenants at December 31, 2018.\nBorrowings outstanding amounted to $63,115 at December 31, 2018.\nLine of Credit Agreement\nOn August 11, 2017 the Company's operating partnership entered into a secured line of credit agreement (Line of Credit Agreement) with KeyBank National Association, or KeyBank and the other lenders, which matures in August 2020 with an optional extension through August 2021, subject to certain conditions. Borrowings under the Line of Credit Agreement bear interest at either (1) the base rate (determined from the highest of (a) KeyBank's prime rate, (b) the federal funds rate plus 0.50% and (c) the one month LIBOR rate plus 1.0%) or (2) LIBOR, plus, in either case, a spread between 250 and 300 basis points depending on our total leverage ratio. At December 31, 2018 the interest rate was 5.4%.\nOn March 8, 2018, the Company entered into an Increase Agreement to our Line of Credit Agreement with KeyBank National Association to increase our revolving credit facility to $45,000. All other terms of the Line of Credit Agreement remained unchanged.\nThe Line of Credit Agreement, consistent with the KeyBank Bridege Loan covenants, contains customary affirmative and negative and financial covenants, including limitations with respect to indebtedness, liens, investments, distributions, mergers and transactions with affiliates as outlined within the Line of Credit Agreement. The Company is in compliance with the respective covenants at December 31, 2018. The Line of Credit Agreement is secured by certain assets of the Company's operating partnership and certain of its subsidiaries and includes a Company's guarantee for the payment of all indebtedness under the Line of Credit Agreement. Borrowings outstanding amounted to $28,187 and $20,837, net of unamortized debt issuance costs of $363 and $488 at December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively.\nContractual Obligations and Commitments\nThe following table sets forth our principal obligations and commitments as of December 31, 2018:\nFuture Minimum Rents\n($ in thousands)\n\nIn addition to the contractual obligations set forth in the table above, we have entered into employment agreements with certain of our executive officers. As approved by the compensation committee of the Board of Directors the agreements provide for base salaries ranging from $200 to $300 annually with discretionary cash performance awards. The agreements contain provisions for equity awards, general benefits, and termination and severance provisions, consistent with similar positions and companies.\nWe also enter into contracts for maintenance and other services at certain properties from time to time.\nRedeemable Preferred Member Interests\nOn October 17, 2016, and in connection with its refinancing of its Senior Loan with Torchlight, the Company issued Torchlight a 99.5% redeemable preferred member interest in 20 LLC in exchange for $30,553. The redeemable preferred member interest was redeemed in full as of June 14, 2017. The redemption resulted in elimination of the non-controlling interest and an adjustment to equity (deficit) in the amount of $56,795. An adjustment to the redemption price in the first quarter of 2017 was deemed a non-cash capital contribution in the amount of $1,019.\nThe Company had classified this amount as a liability in accordance with ASC 480, Distinguishing Liabilities from Equity (ASC 480). Because the member interest was mandatorily redeemable, the Company concluded that the required redemption of that interest represented a continuing interest in the properties and therefore, the issuance of the redeemable preferred member interest represented a financing of 20 LLC and not a sale of the properties.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe have no off-balance sheet arrangements.\nInflation\nThe majority of our leases are either triple net or provide for tenant reimbursement for costs related to real estate taxes and operating expenses. In addition, most of the leases provide for fixed rent increases. We believe that inflationary increases may be at least partially offset by the contractual rent increases and tenant payment of taxes and expenses described above. We do not believe that inflation has had a material impact on our historical financial position or results of operations.\nInterest Rate Risk\nASC 815, Derivatives and Hedging (formerly known as SFAS No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and hedging Activities, as amended by SFAS No. 138, Accounting for Certain Derivative Instruments and Certain Hedging Activities), requires us to recognize all derivatives on the balance sheet at fair value. Derivatives that are not hedges must be adjusted to fair value and the changes in fair value must be reflected as income or expense. If the derivative is a hedge, depending on the nature of the hedge, changes in the fair value of derivatives are either offset against the change in fair value of the hedged assets, liabilities, or firm commitments through earnings or recognized in other comprehensive income, which is a component of stockholders' equity. The ineffective portion of a derivative's change in fair value is immediately recognized in earnings.\nThe Company uses an interest rate cap as a derivative instrument to manage interest rate risk and is recognized on the balance sheet at fair value. The interest rate cap is not designated as a hedging instrument and changes in fair value is mark to market through earnings. The input values used in the fair value measurement of the interest rate cap were obtained using quoted market prices for similar assets in markets that are not active and therefore are, classified as Level 2 under the fair value hierarchy. The fair value of the interest rate cap is estimated based on discounting future cash flows interest rates that management believes reflect the risks associated with debt instruments of similar risk and duration. The fair value of the interest rate cap agreement was $0 at December 31, 2018. At December 31, 2018 the one-month LIBOR was 2.52%.\nRelated to this interest rate cap agreement, a 100 basis point increase above LIBOR being 4% will decrease our interest expense by approximately $798 per annum.\nAs discussed in Note 5 of our consolidated financial statements, the MWG Loan Agreement was paid in full as of July 10, 2018. The key terms of the interest rate cap agreement with J.P. Morgan remained in place after the repayment of the MWG Loan Agreement and it continues to have a maturity date of December 1, 2019.\nNo assurance can be given that any future hedging activities by us will have the desired beneficial effect on our results of operations or financial condition.\nRecently Issued Accounting Standards\nWe have reviewed all recently issued standards and have determined that, other than as disclosed in Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements appearing in this annual report on Form 10-K, such standards will not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements or do not otherwise apply to our operations.", "item_7_tables": "Table 26: <table> <tr> <td>Year </td> <td> </td> <td>Type </td> <td> </td> <td>Square\nFootage </td> <td> </td>
