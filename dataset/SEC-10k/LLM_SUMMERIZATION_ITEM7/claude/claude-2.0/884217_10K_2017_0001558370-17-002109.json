MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nExecutive Overview\nBackground\nEffective January 31, 2016, Tailored Brands, Inc., a Texas corporation ( Tailored Brands\u201d), became the successor reporting company to The Men's Wearhouse, Inc., pursuant to a holding company reorganization. We are a leading authority on helping men dress for work, special occasions and everyday life. We serve our customers through an expansive omni-channel network that includes over 1,600 locations in the U.S. and Canada as well as our branded e-commerce websites.\nOn June 18, 2014, we acquired 100% of the outstanding common stock of Jos. A. Bank, a men's specialty apparel retailer, for approximately $1.8 billion. As a result, the comparability of our results is affected by the inclusion of Jos. A. Bank's results for the entire fiscal years of 2016 and 2015 while fiscal 2014's operations include Jos. A. Bank's results beginning on June 18, 2014.\nOn June 10, 2015, we entered into an agreement with Macy's, Inc. to operate men's tuxedo rental shops inside 300 Macy's department stores. In addition, we agreed to collaborate with Macy's to develop an online tuxedo rental shop. As of January 28, 2017, we operated 170 tuxedo shops within Macy's stores under the name The Tuxedo Shop @ Macy's.\u201d We are actively engaged in discussions with Macy's to restructure our agreement. In the meantime, we have agreed with Macy's to put the opening of the additional 130 contracted stores on hold while we explore a potentially new model.\nWe operate two reportable segments as determined by the way we manage, evaluate and internally report our business activities: Retail and Corporate Apparel. In 2016, we revised our segment reporting presentation to reflect changes in how we manage our business, including resource allocation and performance assessment. Specifically, we are now presenting expenses related to our shared services platform separately from the results of our operating segments to promote enhanced comparability of our operating segments. Previously, these shared service expenses were primarily included in our retail segment. Comparable prior period information has been recast to reflect our revised segment presentation. See Item 1, Business\u201d of this Annual Report on Form 10-K as well as Note 17 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements and the discussion included in Results of Operations\u201d below for additional information and disclosures regarding our reporting segments.\nSummary of Financial Performance\nFiscal 2016 was a year of significant strategic progress for Tailored Brands as we executed on our plans to right-size our store base, optimize our cost structure, and return Jos. A. Bank to a path of sustained profitable growth. We delivered on our operational initiatives that we established for 2016. We closed 233 stores under our store rationalization program, we achieved over $60 million in cost savings through our profit improvement plan, and we stabilized and began to turn around Jos. A. Bank. With a focus on continued operational excellence, we have built a strong foundation for future growth.\nUnfortunately, the challenging retail environment resulted in soft traffic across our retail brands, which drove lower than anticipated full year net sales and gross margins in fiscal 2016. In addition, during fiscal 2016, our tuxedo shops within Macy's did not ramp as we expected. We are actively engaged in discussions with Macy's to restructure our agreement. Given current and forecasted results and the likelihood that a restructured agreement will involve a different operating model, we recorded an asset impairment charge of $14.0 million in fiscal 2016 related to fixed assets in the tuxedo shops within Macy's. In addition, during fiscal 2016, our operating loss for the tuxedo shops within Macy's was approximately $14.0 million, excluding the asset impairment charge described above.\nKey operating metrics for the year ended January 28, 2017 include:\nTable 71: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nNet sales decrease of 3.4%.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 72: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nComparable sales at Men's Wearhouse, Jos.

The demand for convenience, a more personalized experience, and casual wardrobe options has never been more pronounced. In response, we expect to improve our online customer experience with new features and functionality to create more personalized interactions with our customers, shift our marketing strategies to drive customer traffic and promote greater awareness of our exclusive offerings, including custom clothing.\nStore Information\nDuring fiscal 2016, we opened 178 stores/tuxedo shops (158 shops within Macy's stores, 13 Men's Wearhouse stores, three Jos. A. Bank stores, two Moores stores and two K&G stores) and closed 235 stores (122 Jos. A. Bank stores, 102 Men's Wearhouse and Tux stores, and 11 Men's Wearhouse stores). The closure of the 235 stores was largely the result of our store rationalization strategy, which we believe is important to our long-term profitability as it eliminated underperforming stores and re-balanced the store fleet and cost structure. In the future, we will continue to monitor our store fleet for opportunities to optimize our cost structure.\nIn fiscal 2017, we plan to open two Men's Wearhouse stores and to relocate approximately 15 stores, primarily at Men's Wearhouse. We also plan to close eight Jos. A. Bank stores and three Men's Wearhouse and Tux stores.\nResults of Operations\nThe following table sets forth our results of operations expressed as a percentage of net sales for the periods

million for fiscal 2016 as compared to fiscal 2015 due mainly to a $154.0 million decrease in retail clothing product revenues primarily at our Jos. A. Bank brand as we transitioned away from the Jos. A. Bank historical promotional model. Total retail sales were also impacted by a $14.2 million decrease in alteration and other services offset by a $14.1 million increase in rental services revenues. The net decrease in total retail sales is attributable to the following:\nTable 85: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n(in millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nAmount attributed to\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n(9.7) \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n0.6% decrease in comparable sales at Men's Wearhouse.\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(70.8) \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n9.5% decrease in comparable sales at Jos.A.

We operate our business using an omni-channel approach and do not differentiate e-commerce sales from our other channels.\nThe decrease in comparable sales at Men's Wearhouse resulted primarily from decreased average transactions per store that more than offset increased average unit retail (net selling prices) while units per transaction were essentially flat. The decrease at Jos. A. Bank was driven by decreased average transactions per store that more than offset increased units per transaction and a slight increase in average unit retail. The decrease at Moores was driven by decreased average transactions per store and units per transaction that more than offset increased average unit retail. The decrease at K&G was driven by decreased average transactions per store that more than offset increased units per transaction and average unit retail. At Men's Wearhouse, rental service comparable sales increased 3.0% primarily due to an increase in rental rates.\nTotal corporate apparel clothing product sales increased $36.5 million to $280.3 million for fiscal 2016 as compared to fiscal 2015 primarily due to the impact of a large new uniform program. The rollout of the new uniform program commenced in June 2016, was completed during the third quarter of 2016 and has now transitioned to a standard replenishment phase. The increase in corporate apparel sales was partially offset by the impact of a weaker British pound this year compared to fiscal 2015 of approximately $26.1 million.\nGross Margin\nProcurement and distribution costs are included in determining our retail and corporate apparel clothing product gross margins. Our gross margin may not be comparable to other specialty retailers, as some companies exclude costs related to their distribution network from cost of sales while others, like us, include all or a portion of such costs in cost of sales and exclude them from SG&A expenses. Distribution costs are not included in determining our rental services gross margin as these costs are included in SG&A expenses.\nOur total gross margin decreased $43.0 million, or 2.9%, to $1,441.5 million for fiscal 2016 as compared to fiscal 2015. Total retail segment gross margin decreased $60.3 million, or 4.3%, in fiscal 2016 as compared to fiscal 2015 primarily due to lower sales at Jos. A. Bank.\nFor the retail segment, total gross margin as a percentage of related sales increased from 43.5% in fiscal 2015 to 43.7% in fiscal 2016. The slight increase in the retail segment gross margin percentage was primarily the result of the mix effect of higher margin rental services revenue and slight leverage on occupancy costs.\nOccupancy costs decreased $24.2 million primarily due to our store rationalization efforts. Occupancy costs as a percentage of retail sales, which is relatively constant on a per store basis and includes store related rent, common area maintenance, utilities, repairs and maintenance, security, property taxes and depreciation, decreased slightly to 13.9% in fiscal 2016 from 14.0% in fiscal 2015.\nCorporate apparel gross margin increased $17.3 million or 24.6% from fiscal 2015 to $87.7 million in fiscal 2016. For the corporate apparel segment, total gross margin as a percentage of related sales increased from 28.9% in fiscal 2015 to 31.3% in fiscal 2016 primarily due to the impact of a large new uniform program as well as pre-tax gains on foreign currency hedging transactions.\nAdvertising Expense\nAdvertising expense decreased to $190.0 million in fiscal 2016 from $205.0 million in fiscal 2015, a decrease of $15.0 million or 7.3%. The decrease in advertising expense was driven by reductions in marketing spend, primarily in television and digital advertising, in response to the softening sales trend, primarily in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016. As a percentage of total net sales, these expenses decreased from 5.9% in fiscal 2015 to 5.6% in fiscal 2016.\nSelling, General and Administrative Expenses\nSG&A expenses increased to $1,099.3 million in fiscal 2016 from $1,085.9 million in fiscal 2015, an increase of $13.4 million or 1.2%. As a percentage of total net sales, these expenses increased from 31.1% in fiscal 2015 to 32.5% in fiscal 2016. The components of this 1.4% net increase in SG&A expenses as a percentage of total net sales and the related dollar changes were as follows:\nTable 87: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nin millions\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nAttributed to\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n1.7 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n55.5 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nIncrease in restructuring, integration and other items as a percentage of sales from 0.6% in fiscal 2015 to 2.3% in fiscal 2016.

Retail segment SG&A expenses decreased $19.3 million primarily due to cost reduction initiatives and the impact of store closures partially offset by lease termination costs.\nIn the corporate apparel segment, SG&A expenses as a percentage of related net sales decreased from 24.9% in fiscal 2015 to 21.7% in fiscal 2016 primarily due to leverage from higher sales. Corporate apparel segment SG&A expenses increased $0.1 million.\nShared service expenses represent costs not specifically related to the operations of our business segments and are included in SG&A. Shared service SG&A expenses as a percentage of total net sales increased from 4.7% in fiscal 2015 to 5.9% in fiscal 2016. Shared service SG&A expenses increased $32.6 million primarily due to costs associated with our profit improvement program and higher incentive compensation accruals.\nGoodwill and Intangible Asset Impairment Charges\nThere were no goodwill and intangible asset impairment charges recorded in fiscal 2016. For further details on fiscal 2015 goodwill and intangible asset impairment charges, see Goodwill and Other Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets as discussed in Critical Accounting Polices and Estimates\u201d and Note 3 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further details.\nAsset Impairment Charges\nNon-cash asset impairment charges were $19.4 million in fiscal 2016 as compared to $27.5 million in fiscal 2015. The asset impairment charges in fiscal 2016 primarily consist of $14.0 million related to fixed assets in our tuxedo shops within Macy's, $2.5 million primarily related to stores closed as part of our store rationalization program and $2.9 million related to a long-lived asset reclassified as held for sale. The asset impairment charges in fiscal 2015 resulted primarily from our store rationalization program, which resulted in store closures in fiscal 2016. See Impairment of Long-Lived Assets as discussed in Critical Accounting Polices and Estimates\u201d and Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further details.\nInterest Expense\nInterest expense decreased to $103.1 million in fiscal 2016 from $106.0 million in fiscal 2015, a decrease of $2.8 million or 2.7%, due to repayment of our indebtedness including $42.5 million on our term loan and repurchase and retirement of $25.0 million of our senior notes.\nProvision for Income Tax\nIn fiscal 2016, our effective income tax rate was 21.0% and is lower than the U.S. statutory rate primarily due to foreign earnings and the lower tax rates in these jurisdictions. Our foreign jurisdictions in which we operate had taxable income, which requires us to provide for income tax, specifically, our operations in Canada and the United Kingdom. For fiscal 2016, the statutory tax rates in Canada and the United Kingdom were approximately 27% and 20%, respectively, which negatively impacted our effective tax rate due to the loss in the U.S. For fiscal 2016, tax expense for our operations in foreign jurisdictions totaled $10.3 million.\nOur income tax expense and effective income tax rate in future periods may be impacted by many factors, including our geographic mix of earnings and changes in tax laws. Currently, we expect our effective tax rate in future periods to be lower than the statutory U.S. combined federal and state tax rate based on the expected geographic mix of earnings.\nIn addition, if our financial results in fiscal 2017 generate a loss or certain deferred tax liabilities decrease, we may need to establish a valuation allowance on our U.S. deferred tax assets, which could have a material impact on our financial condition and results of operations.\nNet Income Attributable to Common Shareholders\nThese factors resulted in a net income attributable to common shareholders of $25.0 million for fiscal 2016, an increase of $1,051.7 million from a net loss of $1,026.7 million for fiscal 2015.\n2015 Compared with 2014\nNet Sales\nTotal net sales increased $243.7 million, or 7.5%, to $3,496.3 million for fiscal 2015 as compared to fiscal 2014.\nTotal retail sales increased $257.3 million, or 8.6%, to $3,252.5 million for fiscal 2015 as compared to fiscal 2014 due mainly to $182.9 million of incremental net sales from Jos. A. Bank, as fiscal 2015 includes full year results from Jos. A. Bank while fiscal 2014 represented results only from the date of acquisition. Total retail sales also increased due to retail clothing product and alteration revenues from our other brands of $81.2 million partially offset by a decrease in rental services revenue from our other brands of $8.3 million. The net increase is attributable to the following:\nTable 88: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n(in millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nAmount Attributed to\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n182.9 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nIncrease in net sales from Jos.

We operate our business using an omni-channel approach and do not differentiate e-commerce sales from our other channels.\nThe increase in comparable sales at Men's Wearhouse resulted primarily from increased average unit retail (net selling prices) and average transactions per store that more than offset decreased units per transaction. The decrease at Moores was driven by decreased average\ntransactions per store and units per transaction that more than offset increased average unit retail. The increase at K&G was driven by increased average transactions per store and units per transaction while average unit retail was flat. At Men's Wearhouse, rental service comparable sales decreased 0.7% primarily due to a decrease in unit rentals partially offset by an increase in rental rates.\nComparable sales for Jos. A. Bank decreased by 16.3% and are calculated in the same manner as our other brands except that it is based on Jos. A. Bank's entire fiscal 2014, a portion of which was prior to our acquisition on June 18, 2014. In addition, as a result of our decision to close all factory stores at Jos. A. Bank in 2016, we have excluded the results of these stores from our comparable sales calculation for Jos. A. Bank.\nTotal corporate apparel clothing product sales decreased $13.6 million to $243.8 million for fiscal 2015 as compared to fiscal 2014. The decrease in corporate apparel sales was primarily due to the impact of a weaker British pound this year compared to fiscal 2014 of approximately $15.0 million.\nGross Margin\nProcurement and distribution costs are included in determining our retail and corporate apparel clothing product gross margins. Our gross margin may not be comparable to other specialty retailers, as some companies exclude costs related to their distribution network from cost of sales while others, like us, include all or a portion of such costs in cost of sales and exclude them from SG&A expenses. Distribution costs are not included in determining our rental services gross margin as these costs are included in SG&A expenses.\nOur total gross margin increased $125.8 million, or 9.3%, to $1,484.4 million for fiscal 2015 as compared to fiscal 2014. During fiscal 2015, as a result of our store rationalization program, we incurred $11.0 million of inventory write-offs as well as a $4.8 million charge related to discontinued rental product, both of which negatively impacted our gross margin results. During fiscal 2014, $33.5 million of inventory valuation step up related to Jos. A. Bank and a $10.6 million charge to rationalize our rental product to allow for more productive rental styles were incurred and negatively impacted our gross margin results.\nTotal retail segment gross margin increased $132.2 million or 10.3% from fiscal 2014 to $1,414.1 million in fiscal 2015. The dollar increase in gross margin was primarily driven by $98.0 million of incremental gross margin generated by Jos. A. Bank as well as by higher sales from our Men's Wearhouse brand.\nFor the retail segment, total gross margin as a percentage of related sales increased from 42.8% in fiscal 2014 to 43.5% in fiscal 2015 driven primarily by an increase in the rental services margin as well as a higher retail clothing product gross margin rate, which was negatively impacted last year by the inventory step up at Jos. A. Bank.\nOccupancy costs increased $60.0 million primarily due to incremental Jos. A. Bank occupancy costs. Occupancy costs as a percentage of retail sales, which is relatively constant on a per store basis and includes store related rent, common area maintenance, utilities, repairs and maintenance, security, property taxes and depreciation, increased from 13.2% in fiscal 2014 to 14.0% in fiscal 2015, primarily due to deleveraging of occupancy costs at Jos. A. Bank as well as Jos A. Bank's occupancy costs being higher as a percentage of sales than our other brands.\nCorporate apparel gross margin decreased $6.4 million or 8.3% from fiscal 2014 to $70.3 million in fiscal 2015. For the corporate apparel segment, total gross margin as a percentage of related sales decreased from 29.8% in fiscal 2014 to 28.9% in fiscal 2015 primarily due to unfavorable currency impacts at our UK operations.\nAdvertising Expense\nAdvertising expense increased to $205.0 million in fiscal 2015 from $168.3 million in fiscal 2014, an increase of $36.7 million or 21.8%. The increase was primarily due to incremental Jos. A. Bank advertising costs as well as increased advertising expense to support branding initiatives. As a percentage of total net sales, these expenses increased from 5.2% in fiscal 2014 to 5.9% in fiscal 2015.\nSelling, General and Administrative Expenses\nSG&A expenses decreased to $1,085.9 million in fiscal 2015 from $1,116.8 million in fiscal 2014, a decrease of $30.9 million or 2.8%.

The asset impairment charges in fiscal 2015 resulted primarily from our store rationalization program, which resulted in store closures in fiscal 2016. See Impairment of Long-Lived Assets as discussed in Critical Accounting Polices and Estimates\u201d and Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further details.\nInterest Expense\nInterest expense increased to $106.0 million in fiscal 2015 from $66.0 million in fiscal 2014, an increase of $40.0 million or 60.5%, due to incremental interest incurred on borrowings entered into in connection with the Jos. A. Bank acquisition.\nProvision for Income Tax\nIn fiscal 2015, our effective income tax rate was (14.1%) and is lower than the U.S. statutory rate due to our overall net loss partially offset by the non-deductibility of the goodwill impairment charge, as discussed above. Our foreign jurisdictions in which we operate had taxable income, which requires us to provide for income tax, specifically, our operations in Canada and the United Kingdom. For fiscal 2015, the statutory tax rates in Canada and the United Kingdom were approximately 27% and 20%, respectively, which negatively impacted our effective tax rate due to the loss in the U.S. For fiscal 2015, tax expense for our operations in foreign jurisdictions totaled $8.9 million.\nOur income tax expense and effective income tax rate in future periods may be impacted by many factors, including our geographic mix of earnings and changes in tax laws. Currently, we expect our effective tax rate in future periods to be lower than the statutory United States combined federal and state tax rate based on the expected geographic mix of earnings.\nNet Loss Attributable to Common Shareholders\nThese factors resulted in a net loss attributable to common shareholders of $1,026.7 million for fiscal 2015, a decrease of $1,026.3 million from a net loss of $0.4 million for fiscal 2014.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nAt January 28, 2017 and January 30, 2016, cash and cash equivalents totaled $70.9 million and $30.0 million, respectively. At January 28, 2017, cash and cash equivalents held by foreign subsidiaries totaled $68.0 million. Under current tax laws and regulations, if cash and cash equivalents held outside the U.S. are repatriated to the U.S., in certain circumstances we may be subject to additional U.S. income taxes and foreign withholding taxes. We currently do not intend to repatriate amounts held by foreign subsidiaries.\nWe had working capital of $705.8 million and $723.6 million at January 28, 2017 and January 30, 2016, respectively. Our primary sources of working capital are cash flows from operations and available borrowings under our financing arrangements, as described below.\nOn June 18, 2014, The Men's Wearhouse, Inc. entered into a term loan credit agreement that provides for a senior secured term loan in the aggregate principal amount of $1.1 billion (the Term Loan\u201d), and a $500.0 million asset-based revolving credit agreement (the ABL Facility\u201d, and together with the Term Loan, the Credit Facilities\u201d) with certain of our U.S. subsidiaries and Moores the Suit People Inc., one of our Canadian subsidiaries, as co-borrowers. In addition, on June 18, 2014, The Men's Wearhouse, Inc. issued $600.0 million in aggregate principal amount of 7.00% Senior Notes due 2022 (the Senior Notes\u201d).\nWe used the net proceeds from the Term Loan, the offering of the Senior Notes and the net proceeds from $340.0 million drawn on the ABL Facility to pay the approximately $1.8 billion purchase price for the acquisition of Jos. A. Bank and to repay all of our obligations under our Third Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, dated as of April 12, 2013 (as amended, the Previous Credit Agreement\u201d), including $95.0 million outstanding under the Previous Credit Agreement as well as settlement of the then existing interest rate swap. The loans under the ABL Facility were subsequently repaid in full promptly following the closing of the Jos. A. Bank acquisition using the cash acquired from Jos. A. Bank.\nThe Credit Facilities and the Senior Notes contain customary non-financial and financial covenants, including fixed charge coverage ratios, total leverage ratios and secured leverage ratios, as well as a restriction on our ability to pay dividends on our common stock in excess of $10.0 million per quarter. Since entering into these financing arrangements and as of January 28, 2017, our total leverage ratio and secured leverage ratio were above the maximums specified in the agreements. As a result, we are currently subject to certain additional restrictions, including limitations on our ability to make acquisitions and incur additional indebtedness. Currently, we believe we will be in compliance with all of the non-financial and financial covenants during fiscal 2018 which will result in the elimination of these additional restrictions. In addition, in accordance with the terms of the Credit Facilities, we have an obligation to make a mandatory excess cash flow prepayment offer of $4.6 million to the Term Loan lenders during fiscal 2017. Our lenders have the option to decline their respective portions of the prepayment.\nCredit Facilities\nThe Term Loan is guaranteed, jointly and severally, by Tailored Brands, Inc. and certain of our U.S. subsidiaries and will mature on June 18, 2021. The interest rate on the Term Loan is currently based on the 1-month LIBOR rate, which was approximately 0.78% at January\n28, 2017. However, the Term Loan interest rate is subject to a LIBOR floor of 1% per annum, plus the applicable margin which is currently 3.50%, resulting in a total interest rate of 4.50%. To minimize the impact of changes in interest rates on our interest payments under the Term Loan, in January 2015, we entered into an interest rate swap agreement to swap variable-rate interest payments for fixed-rate interest payments on a notional amount of $520.0 million, effective in February 2015. At January 28, 2017, the notional amount totaled $330.0 million. The interest rate swap agreement matures in August 2018 and has periodic interest settlements. Under this interest rate swap agreement, we receive a floating rate based on the 3-month LIBOR rate and pay a fixed rate of 5.03% (including the applicable margin of 3.50%) on the outstanding notional amount.\nIn April 2015, we entered into Incremental Facility Agreement No. 1 (the Incremental Agreement\u201d) resulting in a refinancing of $400.0 million aggregate principal amount of our Term Loan from a variable rate to a fixed rate of 5.0% per annum. The Incremental Agreement did not impact the total amount borrowed under the Term Loan, the maturity date of the Term Loan of June 18, 2021, or collateral and guarantees under the existing Term Loan.\nAs a result of the interest rate swap and the Incremental Agreement, we have converted a majority of the variable interest rate under the Term Loan to a fixed rate and, as of January 28, 2017, the Term Loan had a weighted average interest rate of 4.90%.\nThe ABL Facility provides for a senior secured revolving credit facility of $500.0 million, with possible future increases to $650.0 million under an expansion feature that matures on June 18, 2019 and is guaranteed, jointly and severally, by Tailored Brands, Inc. and certain of our U.S. subsidiaries. The ABL Facility has several borrowing and interest rate options including the following indices: (i) adjusted LIBOR, (ii) Canadian Dollar Offered Rate, (iii) Canadian prime rate or (iv) an alternate base rate (equal to the greater of the prime rate, the federal funds effective rate plus 0.5% or adjusted LIBOR for a one-month period plus 1.0%). Advances under the ABL Facility bear interest at a rate per annum using the applicable indices plus a varying interest rate margin of up to 2.00%. The ABL Facility also provides for fees applicable to amounts available to be drawn under outstanding letters of credit which range from 1.50% to 2.00%, and a fee on unused commitments which ranges from 0.25% to 0.375%. As of January 28, 2017, there were no borrowings outstanding under the ABL Facility. During fiscal 2016, the maximum borrowing outstanding under the ABL Facility was $68.5 million.\nThe obligations under the Credit Facilities are secured on a senior basis by a first priority lien on substantially all of the assets of the Company, certain of its U.S. subsidiaries and, in the case of the ABL Facility, Moores The Suit People Inc. The Credit Facilities and the related guarantees and security interests granted thereunder are senior secured obligations of, and will rank equally with all present and future senior indebtedness of, the Company, the co-borrowers and the respective guarantors.\nWe utilize letters of credit primarily to secure inventory purchases and as collateral for workers compensation claims. At January 28, 2017, letters of credit totaling approximately $29.4 million were issued and outstanding. Borrowings available under the ABL Facility as of January 28, 2017 were $414.8 million.\nSenior Notes\nThe Senior Notes are guaranteed, jointly and severally, on an unsecured basis by Tailored Brands, Inc. and certain of our U.S. subsidiaries. The Senior Notes and the related guarantees are senior unsecured obligations of the Company and the guarantors, respectively, and will rank equally with all of the Company's and each guarantor's present and future senior indebtedness. The Senior Notes will mature on July 1, 2022. Interest on the Senior Notes are payable on January 1 and July 1 of each year.\nWe may redeem some or all of the Senior Notes at any time on or after July 1, 2017 at the redemption prices set forth in the indenture governing the Senior Notes. At any time prior to July 1, 2017, we will have the option to redeem some or all of the Senior Notes at a redemption price of 100% of the principal amount of the Senior Notes to be redeemed, plus a make-whole\u201d premium and accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the date of redemption. We may also redeem up to a maximum of 35% of the original aggregate principal amount of the Senior Notes with the proceeds of certain equity offerings prior to July 1, 2017 at a redemption price of 107% of the principal amount of the Senior Notes plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any. Upon the occurrence of certain specific changes of control, we may be required to offer to purchase the Senior Notes at 101% of their aggregate principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest thereon to the date of purchase.\nWe had entered into a registration rights agreement regarding the Senior Notes pursuant to which we agreed, among other things, to use our commercially reasonable efforts to consummate an exchange offer of the Senior Notes for substantially identical notes registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, on or before July 13, 2015. On June 24, 2015, the exchange offer was completed.\nCash Provided by Operating Activities\nNet cash provided by operating activities was $242.6 million and $131.7 million for 2016 and 2015, respectively. The $110.9 million increase was driven by changes in other assets related to income tax refunds as well as a decrease in inventory purchases as we normalize inventory levels, particularly at Jos. A. Bank. These favorable impacts were partially offset by lower net earnings, after adjusting for non-cash items including goodwill, intangible and other asset impairment charges and related changes in deferred taxes. In addition, there were unfavorable fluctuations in accounts payable, accrued expenses and other current liabilities primarily due to timing.\nNet cash provided by operating activities was $131.7 million and $94.8 million for 2015 and 2014, respectively. The $36.9 million increase was driven by higher net earnings, after adjusting for non-cash items including goodwill, intangible and other asset impairment charges, partially offset by the impact of working capital items. Unfavorable changes in working capital include an increase in inventories, primarily due to higher inventory levels from lower sales and increased purchases of rental product partially offset by favorable fluctuations in accounts payable, accrued expenses and other current liabilities.\nCash Used in Investing Activities\nNet cash used in investing activities was $99.1 million and $112.9 million for 2016 and 2015, respectively. The $13.8 million decrease was primarily driven by a decrease in capital expenditures in 2016 compared to 2015 primarily due to fewer full line store openings.\nNet cash used in investing activities was $112.9 million and $1,587.7 million for 2015 and 2014, respectively. The $1,474.8 million decrease was primarily driven by the acquisition of Jos. A. Bank in 2014. The increase in capital expenditures in 2015 compared to 2014 was primarily due to integration projects for Jos. A. Bank as well as store remodels, openings and/or relocations.\nCash Used in Financing Activities\nNet cash used in financing activities was $98.8 million and $46.8 million for 2016 and 2015, respectively. The $52.0 million increase primarily reflects the impact of a $35.5 million prepayment on our Term Loan and the repurchase of $25.0 million of our Senior Notes, which were consummated via borrowings on our ABL Facility.\nNet cash used in financing activities was $46.8 million for 2015 compared to net cash provided by financing activities of $1,500.9 million for 2014. The net change of $1,547.7 million was primarily driven by proceeds on our Term Loan and issuance of Senior Notes for the acquisition of Jos. A. Bank in 2014.\nShare repurchase program- In March 2013, the Board approved a share repurchase program for our common stock. At January 28, 2017, the remaining balance available under the authorization was $48.0 million. During fiscal 2016, 2015, and 2014, no shares were repurchased in open market transactions under the Board's authorization.\nDuring fiscal 2015 and 2014, 5,799 and 5,349 shares, respectively, were repurchased in private transactions to satisfy minimum tax withholding obligations arising upon the vesting of certain restricted stock.\nDividends- Cash dividends paid were approximately $35.2 million, $35.0 million and $34.8 million during fiscal 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. In fiscal 2016, 2015 and 2014, a dividend of $0.18 per share was declared in each quarter, for an annual dividend of $0.72 per share, respectively.\nThe quarterly cash dividend of $0.18 per share declared by our Board of Directors (the Board\u201d) in January 2017 is payable on March 24, 2017 to shareholders of record on March 14, 2017 and is included in accrued expenses and other current liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet as of January 28, 2017.\nFuture sources and uses of cash\nOur primary uses of cash are to finance working capital requirements of our operations and to repay our indebtedness. In addition, we will use cash to fund capital expenditures, income taxes, dividend payments, operating leases and various other commitments and obligations, as they arise.\nCapital expenditures are anticipated to be approximately $90.0 million for 2017. This amount includes the anticipated costs to open two Men's Wearhouse stores and to relocate approximately 15 stores, primarily at Men's Wearhouse. The balance of the capital expenditures for 2017 will be used for point-of-sale and other computer equipment and systems, distribution facilities, store remodeling, and investment in other corporate assets.\nAdditionally, market conditions may produce attractive opportunities for us to make acquisitions. Any such acquisitions may be undertaken as an alternative to opening new stores. We may use cash on hand, together with cash flow from operations, borrowings under our Credit Facilities and issuances of debt or equity securities, to take advantage of any acquisition opportunities.\nCurrent and future domestic and global economic conditions could negatively affect our future operating results as well as our existing cash and cash equivalents balances. In addition, conditions in the financial markets could limit our access to further capital resources, if needed, and could increase associated costs. We believe based on our current business plan that our existing cash and cash flows from operations and availability under our ABL Facility will be sufficient to fund our operating cash requirements, repayment of current indebtedness, and capital expenditures.\nContractual Obligations\nAs of January 28, 2017, we are obligated to make cash payments in connection with our long-term debt, non-cancelable operating leases and other contractual obligations in the amounts listed below. In addition, we utilize letters of credit primarily for inventory purchases and as collateral for workers compensation claims. At January 28, 2017, letters of credit totaling approximately $29.4 million were issued and outstanding.\nTable 93: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nPayments Due by Period\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n(In millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nContractual obligations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nTotal\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n<1 Year\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n1 - 3 Years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n4 - 5 Years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n> 5 Years\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nLong-term debt(1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n2,070.0 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n116.9 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n177.9 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n1,180.1 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n595.1 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nOperating lease base rentals(2)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n1,182.7 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n245.8 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n401.9 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n284.6 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n250.4 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nOther contractual obligations(3)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n156.4 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n38.4 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n34.1 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n26.2 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n57.7 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nTotal contractual obligations(4)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n3,409.1 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n401.1 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n613.9 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n1,490.9 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n903.2 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 94: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n(1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nIncludes interest payments of $103.5 million within one year, $165.7 million between one and three years, $158.9 million between four and five years and $20.1 million beyond five years, at current interest rates including the impact of our interest rate swap.

We have included all minimum payments for the complete term of our licensing agreement with Macy's in the table above. However, subject to certain business conditions, we have the ability to terminate the agreement in fiscal 2021 (the midpoint of the term), which would reduce the total amount of minimum payments set forth above by approximately $71.0 million.

The purchase orders represent executory contracts requiring performance by the suppliers, including the delivery of the merchandise prior to a specified cancellation date and compliance with product specifications, quality standards and other requirements. In the event of the supplier's failure to meet the agreed upon terms and conditions, we may cancel the order.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nOther than the non-cancelable operating leases, other contractual obligations and letters of credit discussed above, we do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that are material to our financial position or results of operations.\nInflation\nWe believe the impact of inflation on the results of operations during the periods presented has been minimal. However, there can be no assurance that our business will not be affected by inflation in the future.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nThe preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires the appropriate application of accounting policies in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. In many instances, this also requires management to make estimates and assumptions about future events that affect the amounts and disclosures included in our financial statements. We base our estimates on historical experience and various assumptions that we believe are reasonable under our current business model. However, because future events and conditions and their effects cannot be determined with certainty, actual results will differ from our estimates and such differences could be material to our financial statements.\nOur accounting policies are described in Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. We consistently apply these policies and periodically evaluate the reasonableness of our estimates in light of actual events. Historically, we have found our accounting policies to be appropriate and our estimates and assumptions reasonable. Our critical accounting policies, which are those most significant to the presentation of our financial position and results of operations and those that require significant judgment or complex estimates by management, are discussed below.\nRevenue Recognition-Clothing product revenue is recognized at the time of sale and delivery of merchandise, net of actual sales returns and a provision for estimated sales returns. For e-commerce sales, revenue is recognized at the time we estimate the customer receives the product, which incorporates shipping terms and estimated delivery times. Revenues from rental, alteration and other services are recognized upon completion of the services. Amounts related to shipping and handling revenues billed to customers are recorded in net sales, and the related shipping and handling costs are recorded in cost of sales.\nWe present all non-income government-assessed taxes (sales, use and value added taxes) collected from our customers and remitted to governmental agencies on a net basis (excluded from net sales) in our consolidated financial statements. The government-assessed taxes are recorded in accrued expenses and other current liabilities until they are remitted to the government agency.\nInventories-Our inventory is carried at the lower of cost and net realizable value. Cost is determined based on the average cost method. Our inventory cost also includes estimated procurement and distribution costs (warehousing, freight, hangers and merchandising costs) associated with the inventory, with the balance of such costs included in cost of sales. Procurement and distribution costs are generally allocated to inventory based on the ratio of annual product purchases to inventory cost. If this ratio were to change significantly, it could materially affect the amount of procurement and distribution costs included in cost of sales. We make assumptions, based primarily on historical experience, as to items in our inventory that may be damaged, obsolete or salable only at marked down prices to reflect the market value of these items. If actual damages, obsolescence or market demand is significantly different from our estimates, additional inventory write-downs could be required.\nImpairment of Long-Lived Assets-Long-lived assets, such as property and equipment and identifiable intangibles with finite useful lives, are periodically evaluated for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. Assets are grouped and evaluated for impairment at the lowest level of which there are identifiable cash flows, which is generally at a store level. Assets are reviewed using factors including, but not limited to, our future operating plans and projected cash flows. The determination of whether impairment has occurred is based on an estimate of undiscounted future cash flows directly related to the assets, compared to the carrying value of the assets. If the sum of the undiscounted future cash flows of the assets does not exceed the carrying value of the assets, full or partial impairment may exist. If the asset carrying amount exceeds its fair value, an impairment charge is recognized in the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the fair value of the asset. Fair value is determined using an income approach, which requires discounting the estimated future cash flows associated with the asset. Estimating future cash flows requires management to make assumptions and to apply judgment, including forecasting future sales, costs and useful lives of assets. Significant judgment is also involved in selecting the appropriate discount rate to be applied in determining the estimated fair value of an asset. Changes to our key assumptions related to future performance, market conditions and other economic factors can significantly affect our impairment evaluation and result in future impairment charges. For example, unanticipated long-term adverse market conditions can cause individual stores to become unprofitable and can result in an impairment charge for the property and equipment assets in those stores. See Notes 1, 3 and 4 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.\nBusiness Combinations-Purchase Price Allocation-For the Jos. A. Bank acquisition, we allocated the purchase price to the various tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed, based on their estimated fair values, which were finalized as of August 1, 2015. Determining the fair value of certain assets and liabilities acquired is subjective in nature and often involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions, which are inherently uncertain. Many of the estimates and assumptions used to determine fair values, such as those used for intangible assets are made based on forecasted information and discount rates. In addition, the judgments made in determining\nthe estimated fair value assigned to each class of assets acquired and liabilities assumed, as well as asset lives, can materially impact our results of operations.\nGoodwill and Other Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets-Goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets are initially recorded at their fair values. Identifiable intangible assets with an indefinite useful life, including goodwill, are not amortized but are evaluated annually as for impairment. A more frequent evaluation is performed if events or circumstances indicate that impairment could have occurred. Such events or circumstances could include, but are not limited to, significant negative industry or economic trends, unanticipated changes in the competitive environment, decisions to significantly modify or dispose of operations and a significant sustained decline in the market price of our stock.\nDuring fiscal 2015, we changed the date of our annual impairment assessment from the last day of our fiscal year to the last day of the second month of our fiscal fourth quarter. The change in date had no impact on our annual impairment test as both the new and old testing dates are within the same fiscal quarter. We changed the assessment date to allow for more time to complete the impairment assessment process before our fiscal year end.\nFor purposes of our goodwill impairment evaluation, the reporting units are our operating segments identified in Note 17 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Goodwill has been assigned to the reporting units based on prior business combinations related to the brands.\nOur goodwill assessment consists of either using a qualitative approach to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of the assets is less than their respective carrying values or a two-step quantitative impairment test, if necessary. In performing the qualitative assessment, we consider many factors in evaluating whether the carrying value of the asset may not be recoverable, including macroeconomic conditions, retail industry considerations, recent financial performance and declines in stock price and market capitalization. In 2016, we applied the qualitative approach to all reporting units, except for the corporate apparel reporting unit.\nIn step one of the quantitative test for our corporate apparel reporting unit, we estimated the fair value of the reporting unit using a combined income and market comparable approach. Our income approach uses projected future cash flows that are discounted using a weighted-average cost of capital analysis that reflects current market conditions. The market comparable approach primarily considers market price multiples of comparable companies and applies those price multiples to certain key drivers of the reporting unit.\nManagement judgment is a significant factor in the goodwill impairment evaluation process. The computations require management to make estimates and assumptions. Actual values may differ significantly from these judgments, particularly if there are significant adverse changes in the operating environment for our reporting units. Critical assumptions that are used as part of these evaluations include:\nTable 98: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nThe potential future cash flows of the reporting unit. The income approach relies on the timing and estimates of future cash flows. The projections use management's estimates of economic and market conditions over the projected period, including growth rates in revenue, gross margin and expense. The cash flows are based on our most recent business operating plans and various growth rates have been assumed for years beyond the current business plan period.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 99: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nSelection of an appropriate discount rate. The income approach requires the selection of an appropriate discount rate, which is based on a weighted-average cost of capital analysis. The discount rate is affected by changes in short-term interest rates and long-term yield as well as variances in the typical capital structure of marketplace participants. Given current economic conditions, it is possible that the discount rate will fluctuate in the near term. The weighted-average cost of capital used to discount the cash flows for the 2016 quantitative test of the corporate apparel reporting unit was 13.0%.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 100: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nSelection of comparable companies within the industry. For purposes of the market comparable approach, valuations were determined by calculating average price multiples of relevant key drivers from a group of companies that are comparable to the corporate apparel reporting unit and applying those price multiples to the key drivers of the corporate apparel reporting unit. While the market price multiple is not an assumption, a presumption that it provides an indicator of the value of the reporting unit is inherent in the valuation. The determination of the market comparable also involves a degree of judgment. Earnings multiples used in the market comparable approach ranged from 10.5 to 11.5 for the 2016 analysis.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nAs discussed above, the fair value of the corporate apparel reporting unit in 2016 was determined using a combined income and market comparable approach. We believe these two approaches are appropriate valuation techniques and we generally weight the two values equally as an estimate of reporting unit fair value for the purposes of our impairment testing. However, we may weigh one value more heavily than the other when conditions merit doing so.\nThe goodwill impairment evaluation process requires management to make estimates and assumptions with regard to the fair value of reporting units. Actual values may differ significantly from these judgments, particularly if there are significant adverse changes in the operating environment for our reporting units. Sustained declines in our market capitalization could also increase the risk of goodwill\nimpairment. Such occurrences could result in future goodwill impairment charges that would, in turn, negatively impact our results of operations. However, any such goodwill impairments would be non-cash charges that would not affect our cash flows or compliance with our debt covenants.\nIndefinite-lived intangible assets are not subject to amortization but are reviewed at least annually for impairment. The indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment evaluation is performed by comparing the fair value of the indefinite-lived intangible assets to their carrying values. Similar to the goodwill approach described above, our annual impairment assessment for indefinite-lived intangible assets contemplates the use of either a qualitative approach to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of the assets is less than their respective carrying values or a quantitative impairment test, if necessary.\nThe quantitative impairment test estimates the fair value of an intangible asset based on an income approach using the relief-from-royalty method. This approach is dependent upon a number of factors, including estimates of future growth and trends, royalty rates, discount rates and other variables. We base our fair value estimates on assumptions we believe to be reasonable, but which are unpredictable and inherently uncertain.\nFiscal 2016 Impairment Assessment Results\nAs a result of our annual impairment evaluations, as of January 28, 2017, we believe that none of our goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are impaired and all of our reporting units have fair values that significantly exceed their carrying values and, therefore, no reporting units are currently deemed at risk\u201d for goodwill impairment.\nRental Product-The cost of our rental product is amortized to cost of sales based on the cost of each unit rented, which is estimated based on the number of times the unit is expected to be rented and the average cost of the rental product. Lost, damaged and retired rental product is also charged to cost of sales. Rental product is amortized to expense generally over a four year period. We make assumptions, based primarily on historical experience, as to the number of times each unit can be rented. If the actual number of times a unit can be rented were to vary significantly from our estimates, it could materially affect the amount of rental product amortization included in cost of sales.\nIncome Taxes-Income taxes are accounted for using the asset and liability method. Deferred tax liabilities or assets are established for temporary differences between financial and tax reporting bases and are subsequently adjusted to reflect changes in enacted tax rates expected to be in effect when the temporary differences reverse. The deferred tax assets are reduced, if necessary, by a valuation allowance if the future realization of those tax benefits is not more likely than not.\nSignificant judgment is required in determining the provision for income taxes, related taxes payable and deferred tax assets and liabilities since, in the ordinary course of business, there are transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax outcome is uncertain. Additionally, our tax returns are subject to audit by various domestic and foreign tax authorities that could result in material adjustments or differing interpretations of the tax laws. Although we believe that our estimates are reasonable and are based on the best available information at the time we prepare the provision, actual results could differ from these estimates resulting in a final tax outcome that may be materially different from that which is reflected in our consolidated financial statements.\nThe tax benefit from an uncertain tax position is recognized only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. The tax benefits recognized in the consolidated financial statements from such positions are then measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon settlement. Additionally, interest and/or penalties related to uncertain tax positions are recognized in income tax expense. Significant judgment is required in determining our uncertain tax positions. We have established reserves for uncertain tax positions using our best judgment and adjust these reserves, as warranted, due to changing facts and circumstances. A change in our uncertain tax positions, in any given period, could have a significant impact on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows for that period.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nExcept as discussed in Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, we have considered all new accounting pronouncements and have concluded that there are no new pronouncements that may have a material impact on our results of operations, financial condition, or cash flows, based on current information.", "item_7_truncated": "ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nExecutive Overview\nBackground\nEffective January 31, 2016, Tailored Brands, Inc., a Texas corporation ( Tailored Brands\u201d), became the successor reporting company to The Men's Wearhouse, Inc., pursuant to a holding company reorganization. We are a leading authority on helping men dress for work, special occasions and everyday life. We serve our customers through an expansive omni-channel network that includes over 1,600 locations in the U.S. and Canada as well as our branded e-commerce websites.\nOn June 18, 2014, we acquired 100% of the outstanding common stock of Jos. A. Bank, a men's specialty apparel retailer, for approximately $1.8 billion. As a result, the comparability of our results is affected by the inclusion of Jos. A. Bank's results for the entire fiscal years of 2016 and 2015 while fiscal 2014's operations include Jos. A. Bank's results beginning on June 18, 2014.\nOn June 10, 2015, we entered into an agreement with Macy's, Inc. to operate men's tuxedo rental shops inside 300 Macy's department stores. In addition, we agreed to collaborate with Macy's to develop an online tuxedo rental shop. As of January 28, 2017, we operated 170 tuxedo shops within Macy's stores under the name The Tuxedo Shop @ Macy's.\u201d We are actively engaged in discussions with Macy's to restructure our agreement. In the meantime, we have agreed with Macy's to put the opening of the additional 130 contracted stores on hold while we explore a potentially new model.\nWe operate two reportable segments as determined by the way we manage, evaluate and internally report our business activities: Retail and Corporate Apparel. In 2016, we revised our segment reporting presentation to reflect changes in how we manage our business, including resource allocation and performance assessment. Specifically, we are now presenting expenses related to our shared services platform separately from the results of our operating segments to promote enhanced comparability of our operating segments. Previously, these shared service expenses were primarily included in our retail segment. Comparable prior period information has been recast to reflect our revised segment presentation. See Item 1, Business\u201d of this Annual Report on Form 10-K as well as Note 17 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements and the discussion included in Results of Operations\u201d below for additional information and disclosures regarding our reporting segments.\nSummary of Financial Performance\nFiscal 2016 was a year of significant strategic progress for Tailored Brands as we executed on our plans to right-size our store base, optimize our cost structure, and return Jos. A. Bank to a path of sustained profitable growth. We delivered on our operational initiatives that we established for 2016. We closed 233 stores under our store rationalization program, we achieved over $60 million in cost savings through our profit improvement plan, and we stabilized and began to turn around Jos. A. Bank. With a focus on continued operational excellence, we have built a strong foundation for future growth.\nUnfortunately, the challenging retail environment resulted in soft traffic across our retail brands, which drove lower than anticipated full year net sales and gross margins in fiscal 2016. In addition, during fiscal 2016, our tuxedo shops within Macy's did not ramp as we expected. We are actively engaged in discussions with Macy's to restructure our agreement. Given current and forecasted results and the likelihood that a restructured agreement will involve a different operating model, we recorded an asset impairment charge of $14.0 million in fiscal 2016 related to fixed assets in the tuxedo shops within Macy's. In addition, during fiscal 2016, our operating loss for the tuxedo shops within Macy's was approximately $14.0 million, excluding the asset impairment charge described above.\nKey operating metrics for the year ended January 28, 2017 include:\n \u00b7 Net sales decrease of 3.4%. \n \u00b7 Comparable sales at Men's Wearhouse, Jos. A. Bank, Moores and K&G decreased 0.6%, 9.5%, 2.6% and 2.4%, respectively. \n \u00b7 Operating income of $132.8 million, compared to operating loss of $1,077.3 million in fiscal 2015, which includes goodwill and intangible asset impairment charges of $1,243.4 million. \n \u00b7 Diluted earnings per share of $0.51 compared to diluted loss per share of $21.26 in fiscal 2015. \nKey liquidity metrics for the year ended January 28, 2017 include:\n \u00b7 Cash provided by operating activities was $242.6 million in fiscal 2016 compared to $131.7 million in fiscal 2015. \n \u00b7 Capital expenditures were $99.7 million in fiscal 2016 compared to $115.5 million in fiscal 2015. \n \u00b7 We repaid $42.5 million on our term loan, repurchased and retired $25.0 million of our senior notes and had no borrowings outstanding on our revolving credit facility as of January 28, 2017. \n \u00b7 Dividends paid totaled $35.2 million in fiscal 2016. \nItems Affecting Comparability of Results\nThe comparability of our results has been impacted by certain items primarily restructuring and other costs reflecting costs related to our store rationalization program and profit improvement programs, asset impairment charges including for tuxedo shops within Macy's, the 2015 impairment of Jos. A. Bank's goodwill and other intangible assets, and acquisition and integration costs for Jos. A. Bank. A summary of the effect of these items on pretax income for each applicable fiscal year is presented below (dollars in millions):\nTable 79: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nFiscal Year\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nImpairment of Jos.

The demand for convenience, a more personalized experience, and casual wardrobe options has never been more pronounced. In response, we expect to improve our online customer experience with new features and functionality to create more personalized interactions with our customers, shift our marketing strategies to drive customer traffic and promote greater awareness of our exclusive offerings, including custom clothing.\nStore Information\nDuring fiscal 2016, we opened 178 stores/tuxedo shops (158 shops within Macy's stores, 13 Men's Wearhouse stores, three Jos. A. Bank stores, two Moores stores and two K&G stores) and closed 235 stores (122 Jos. A. Bank stores, 102 Men's Wearhouse and Tux stores, and 11 Men's Wearhouse stores). The closure of the 235 stores was largely the result of our store rationalization strategy, which we believe is important to our long-term profitability as it eliminated underperforming stores and re-balanced the store fleet and cost structure. In the future, we will continue to monitor our store fleet for opportunities to optimize our cost structure.\nIn fiscal 2017, we plan to open two Men's Wearhouse stores and to relocate approximately 15 stores, primarily at Men's Wearhouse. We also plan to close eight Jos. A. Bank stores and three Men's Wearhouse and Tux stores.\nResults of Operations\nThe following table sets forth our results of operations expressed as a percentage of net sales for the periods

million, or 4.7%, to $3,098.4 million for fiscal 2016 as compared to fiscal 2015 due mainly to a $154.0 million decrease in retail clothing product revenues primarily at our Jos. A. Bank brand as we transitioned away from the Jos. A. Bank historical promotional model. Total retail sales were also impacted by a $14.2 million decrease in alteration and other services offset by a $14.1 million increase in rental services revenues. The net decrease in total retail sales is attributable to the following:\nTable 85: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n(in millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nAmount attributed to\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n(9.7) \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n0.6% decrease in comparable sales at Men's Wearhouse.\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(70.8) \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n9.5% decrease in comparable sales at Jos.A.

We operate our business using an omni-channel approach and do not differentiate e-commerce sales from our other channels.\nThe decrease in comparable sales at Men's Wearhouse resulted primarily from decreased average transactions per store that more than offset increased average unit retail (net selling prices) while units per transaction were essentially flat. The decrease at Jos. A. Bank was driven by decreased average transactions per store that more than offset increased units per transaction and a slight increase in average unit retail. The decrease at Moores was driven by decreased average transactions per store and units per transaction that more than offset increased average unit retail. The decrease at K&G was driven by decreased average transactions per store that more than offset increased units per transaction and average unit retail. At Men's Wearhouse, rental service comparable sales increased 3.0% primarily due to an increase in rental rates.\nTotal corporate apparel clothing product sales increased $36.5 million to $280.3 million for fiscal 2016 as compared to fiscal 2015 primarily due to the impact of a large new uniform program. The rollout of the new uniform program commenced in June 2016, was completed during the third quarter of 2016 and has now transitioned to a standard replenishment phase. The increase in corporate apparel sales was partially offset by the impact of a weaker British pound this year compared to fiscal 2015 of approximately $26.1 million.\nGross Margin\nProcurement and distribution costs are included in determining our retail and corporate apparel clothing product gross margins. Our gross margin may not be comparable to other specialty retailers, as some companies exclude costs related to their distribution network from cost of sales while others, like us, include all or a portion of such costs in cost of sales and exclude them from SG&A expenses. Distribution costs are not included in determining our rental services gross margin as these costs are included in SG&A expenses.\nOur total gross margin decreased $43.0 million, or 2.9%, to $1,441.5 million for fiscal 2016 as compared to fiscal 2015. Total retail segment gross margin decreased $60.3 million, or 4.3%, in fiscal 2016 as compared to fiscal 2015 primarily due to lower sales at Jos. A. Bank.\nFor the retail segment, total gross margin as a percentage of related sales increased from 43.5% in fiscal 2015 to 43.7% in fiscal 2016. The slight increase in the retail segment gross margin percentage was primarily the result of the mix effect of higher margin rental services revenue and slight leverage on occupancy costs.\nOccupancy costs decreased $24.2 million primarily due to our store rationalization efforts. Occupancy costs as a percentage of retail sales, which is relatively constant on a per store basis and includes store related rent, common area maintenance, utilities, repairs and maintenance, security, property taxes and depreciation, decreased slightly to 13.9% in fiscal 2016 from 14.0% in fiscal 2015.\nCorporate apparel gross margin increased $17.3 million or 24.6% from fiscal 2015 to $87.7 million in fiscal 2016. For the corporate apparel segment, total gross margin as a percentage of related sales increased from 28.9% in fiscal 2015 to 31.3% in fiscal 2016 primarily due to the impact of a large new uniform program as well as pre-tax gains on foreign currency hedging transactions.\nAdvertising Expense\nAdvertising expense decreased to $190.0 million in fiscal 2016 from $205.0 million in fiscal 2015, a decrease of $15.0 million or 7.3%. The decrease in advertising expense was driven by reductions in marketing spend, primarily in television and digital advertising, in response to the softening sales trend, primarily in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016. As a percentage of total net sales, these expenses decreased from 5.9% in fiscal 2015 to 5.6% in fiscal 2016.\nSelling, General and Administrative Expenses\nSG&A expenses increased to $1,099.3 million in fiscal 2016 from $1,085.9 million in fiscal 2015, an increase of $13.4 million or 1.2%. As a percentage of total net sales, these expenses increased from 31.1% in fiscal 2015 to 32.5% in fiscal 2016. The components of this 1.4% net increase in SG&A expenses as a percentage of total net sales and the related dollar changes were as follows:\nTable 87: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nin millions\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nAttributed to\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n1.7 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n55.5 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nIncrease in restructuring, integration and other items as a percentage of sales from 0.6% in fiscal 2015 to 2.3% in fiscal 2016.

For fiscal 2015, these costs totaled $22.7 million related primarily to Jos. A.

Retail segment SG&A expenses decreased $19.3 million primarily due to cost reduction initiatives and the impact of store closures partially offset by lease termination costs.\nIn the corporate apparel segment, SG&A expenses as a percentage of related net sales decreased from 24.9% in fiscal 2015 to 21.7% in fiscal 2016 primarily due to leverage from higher sales. Corporate apparel segment SG&A expenses increased $0.1 million.\nShared service expenses represent costs not specifically related to the operations of our business segments and are included in SG&A. Shared service SG&A expenses as a percentage of total net sales increased from 4.7% in fiscal 2015 to 5.9% in fiscal 2016. Shared service SG&A expenses increased $32.6 million primarily due to costs associated with our profit improvement program and higher incentive compensation accruals.\nGoodwill and Intangible Asset Impairment Charges\nThere were no goodwill and intangible asset impairment charges recorded in fiscal 2016. For further details on fiscal 2015 goodwill and intangible asset impairment charges, see Goodwill and Other Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets as discussed in Critical Accounting Polices and Estimates\u201d and Note 3 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further details.\nAsset Impairment Charges\nNon-cash asset impairment charges were $19.4 million in fiscal 2016 as compared to $27.5 million in fiscal 2015. The asset impairment charges in fiscal 2016 primarily consist of $14.0 million related to fixed assets in our tuxedo shops within Macy's, $2.5 million primarily related to stores closed as part of our store rationalization program and $2.9 million related to a long-lived asset reclassified as held for sale. The asset impairment charges in fiscal 2015 resulted primarily from our store rationalization program, which resulted in store closures in fiscal 2016. See Impairment of Long-Lived Assets as discussed in Critical Accounting Polices and Estimates\u201d and Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further details.\nInterest Expense\nInterest expense decreased to $103.1 million in fiscal 2016 from $106.0 million in fiscal 2015, a decrease of $2.8 million or 2.7%, due to repayment of our indebtedness including $42.5 million on our term loan and repurchase and retirement of $25.0 million of our senior notes.\nProvision for Income Tax\nIn fiscal 2016, our effective income tax rate was 21.0% and is lower than the U.S. statutory rate primarily due to foreign earnings and the lower tax rates in these jurisdictions. Our foreign jurisdictions in which we operate had taxable income, which requires us to provide for income tax, specifically, our operations in Canada and the United Kingdom. For fiscal 2016, the statutory tax rates in Canada and the United Kingdom were approximately 27% and 20%, respectively, which negatively impacted our effective tax rate due to the loss in the U.S. For fiscal 2016, tax expense for our operations in foreign jurisdictions totaled $10.3 million.\nOur income tax expense and effective income tax rate in future periods may be impacted by many factors, including our geographic mix of earnings and changes in tax laws. Currently, we expect our effective tax rate in future periods to be lower than the statutory U.S. combined federal and state tax rate based on the expected geographic mix of earnings.\nIn addition, if our financial results in fiscal 2017 generate a loss or certain deferred tax liabilities decrease, we may need to establish a valuation allowance on our U.S. deferred tax assets, which could have a material impact on our financial condition and results of operations.\nNet Income Attributable to Common Shareholders\nThese factors resulted in a net income attributable to common shareholders of $25.0 million for fiscal 2016, an increase of $1,051.7 million from a net loss of $1,026.7 million for fiscal 2015.\n2015 Compared with 2014\nNet Sales\nTotal net sales increased $243.7 million, or 7.5%, to $3,496.3 million for fiscal 2015 as compared to fiscal 2014.\nTotal retail sales increased $257.3 million, or 8.6%, to $3,252.5 million for fiscal 2015 as compared to fiscal 2014 due mainly to $182.9 million of incremental net sales from Jos. A. Bank, as fiscal 2015 includes full year results from Jos. A. Bank while fiscal 2014 represented results only from the date of acquisition. Total retail sales also increased due to retail clothing product and alteration revenues from our other brands of $81.2 million partially offset by a decrease in rental services revenue from our other brands of $8.3 million. The net increase is attributable to the following:\nTable 88: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n(in millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nAmount Attributed to\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n182.9 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nIncrease in net sales from Jos.

A. Bank. \nComparable sales exclude the net sales of a store for any month of one period if the store was not owned or open throughout the same month of the prior period and include e-commerce net sales. We operate our business using an omni-channel approach and do not differentiate e-commerce sales from our other channels.\nThe increase in comparable sales at Men's Wearhouse resulted primarily from increased average unit retail (net selling prices) and average transactions per store that more than offset decreased units per transaction. The decrease at Moores was driven by decreased average\ntransactions per store and units per transaction that more than offset increased average unit retail. The increase at K&G was driven by increased average transactions per store and units per transaction while average unit retail was flat. At Men's Wearhouse, rental service comparable sales decreased 0.7% primarily due to a decrease in unit rentals partially offset by an increase in rental rates.\nComparable sales for Jos. A. Bank decreased by 16.3% and are calculated in the same manner as our other brands except that it is based on Jos. A. Bank's entire fiscal 2014, a portion of which was prior to our acquisition on June 18, 2014. In addition, as a result of our decision to close all factory stores at Jos. A. Bank in 2016, we have excluded the results of these stores from our comparable sales calculation for Jos. A. Bank.\nTotal corporate apparel clothing product sales decreased $13.6 million to $243.8 million for fiscal 2015 as compared to fiscal 2014. The decrease in corporate apparel sales was primarily due to the impact of a weaker British pound this year compared to fiscal 2014 of approximately $15.0 million.\nGross Margin\nProcurement and distribution costs are included in determining our retail and corporate apparel clothing product gross margins. Our gross margin may not be comparable to other specialty retailers, as some companies exclude costs related to their distribution network from cost of sales while others, like us, include all or a portion of such costs in cost of sales and exclude them from SG&A expenses. Distribution costs are not included in determining our rental services gross margin as these costs are included in SG&A expenses.\nOur total gross margin increased $125.8 million, or 9.3%, to $1,484.4 million for fiscal 2015 as compared to fiscal 2014. During fiscal 2015, as a result of our store rationalization program, we incurred $11.0 million of inventory write-offs as well as a $4.8 million charge related to discontinued rental product, both of which negatively impacted our gross margin results. During fiscal 2014, $33.5 million of inventory valuation step up related to Jos. A. Bank and a $10.6 million charge to rationalize our rental product to allow for more productive rental styles were incurred and negatively impacted our gross margin results.\nTotal retail segment gross margin increased $132.2 million or 10.3% from fiscal 2014 to $1,414.1 million in fiscal 2015. The dollar increase in gross margin was primarily driven by $98.0 million of incremental gross margin generated by Jos. A. Bank as well as by higher sales from our Men's Wearhouse brand.\nFor the retail segment, total gross margin as a percentage of related sales increased from 42.8% in fiscal 2014 to 43.5% in fiscal 2015 driven primarily by an increase in the rental services margin as well as a higher retail clothing product gross margin rate, which was negatively impacted last year by the inventory step up at Jos. A. Bank.\nOccupancy costs increased $60.0 million primarily due to incremental Jos. A. Bank occupancy costs. Occupancy costs as a percentage of retail sales, which is relatively constant on a per store basis and includes store related rent, common area maintenance, utilities, repairs and maintenance, security, property taxes and depreciation, increased from 13.2% in fiscal 2014 to 14.0% in fiscal 2015, primarily due to deleveraging of occupancy costs at Jos. A. Bank as well as Jos A. Bank's occupancy costs being higher as a percentage of sales than our other brands.\nCorporate apparel gross margin decreased $6.4 million or 8.3% from fiscal 2014 to $70.3 million in fiscal 2015. For the corporate apparel segment, total gross margin as a percentage of related sales decreased from 29.8% in fiscal 2014 to 28.9% in fiscal 2015 primarily due to unfavorable currency impacts at our UK operations.\nAdvertising Expense\nAdvertising expense increased to $205.0 million in fiscal 2015 from $168.3 million in fiscal 2014, an increase of $36.7 million or 21.8%. The increase was primarily due to incremental Jos. A. Bank advertising costs as well as increased advertising expense to support branding initiatives. As a percentage of total net sales, these expenses increased from 5.2% in fiscal 2014 to 5.9% in fiscal 2015.\nSelling, General and Administrative Expenses\nSG&A expenses decreased to $1,085.9 million in fiscal 2015 from $1,116.8 million in fiscal 2014, a decrease of $30.9 million or 2.8%. As a percentage of total net sales, these expenses decreased from 34.3% in fiscal 2014 to 31.1% in fiscal 2015. The components of this 3.2% net decrease in SG&A expenses as a percentage of total net sales and the related dollar changes were as follows:\nTable 91: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nin millions\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nAttributed to\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n(2.2) \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n(69.4) \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nDecrease in acquisition, integration and other costs as a percentage of sales from 2.8% in fiscal 2014 to 0.6% in fiscal 2015.

Bank acquisition and integration costs, separation costs with former executives and costs associated with our profit improvement plan, partially offset by a $1.8 million gain on the sale of property.

The asset impairment charges in fiscal 2015 resulted primarily from our store rationalization program, which resulted in store closures in fiscal 2016. See Impairment of Long-Lived Assets as discussed in Critical Accounting Polices and Estimates\u201d and Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further details.\nInterest Expense\nInterest expense increased to $106.0 million in fiscal 2015 from $66.0 million in fiscal 2014, an increase of $40.0 million or 60.5%, due to incremental interest incurred on borrowings entered into in connection with the Jos. A. Bank acquisition.\nProvision for Income Tax\nIn fiscal 2015, our effective income tax rate was (14.1%) and is lower than the U.S. statutory rate due to our overall net loss partially offset by the non-deductibility of the goodwill impairment charge, as discussed above. Our foreign jurisdictions in which we operate had taxable income, which requires us to provide for income tax, specifically, our operations in Canada and the United Kingdom. For fiscal 2015, the statutory tax rates in Canada and the United Kingdom were approximately 27% and 20%, respectively, which negatively impacted our effective tax rate due to the loss in the U.S. For fiscal 2015, tax expense for our operations in foreign jurisdictions totaled $8.9 million.\nOur income tax expense and effective income tax rate in future periods may be impacted by many factors, including our geographic mix of earnings and changes in tax laws. Currently, we expect our effective tax rate in future periods to be lower than the statutory United States combined federal and state tax rate based on the expected geographic mix of earnings.\nNet Loss Attributable to Common Shareholders\nThese factors resulted in a net loss attributable to common shareholders of $1,026.7 million for fiscal 2015, a decrease of $1,026.3 million from a net loss of $0.4 million for fiscal 2014.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nAt January 28, 2017 and January 30, 2016, cash and cash equivalents totaled $70.9 million and $30.0 million, respectively. At January 28, 2017, cash and cash equivalents held by foreign subsidiaries totaled $68.0 million. Under current tax laws and regulations, if cash and cash equivalents held outside the U.S. are repatriated to the U.S., in certain circumstances we may be subject to additional U.S. income taxes and foreign withholding taxes. We currently do not intend to repatriate amounts held by foreign subsidiaries.\nWe had working capital of $705.8 million and $723.6 million at January 28, 2017 and January 30, 2016, respectively. Our primary sources of working capital are cash flows from operations and available borrowings under our financing arrangements, as described below.\nOn June 18, 2014, The Men's Wearhouse, Inc. entered into a term loan credit agreement that provides for a senior secured term loan in the aggregate principal amount of $1.1 billion (the Term Loan\u201d), and a $500.0 million asset-based revolving credit agreement (the ABL Facility\u201d, and together with the Term Loan, the Credit Facilities\u201d) with certain of our U.S. subsidiaries and Moores the Suit People Inc., one of our Canadian subsidiaries, as co-borrowers. In addition, on June 18, 2014, The Men's Wearhouse, Inc. issued $600.0 million in aggregate principal amount of 7.00% Senior Notes due 2022 (the Senior Notes\u201d).\nWe used the net proceeds from the Term Loan, the offering of the Senior Notes and the net proceeds from $340.0 million drawn on the ABL Facility to pay the approximately $1.8 billion purchase price for the acquisition of Jos. A. Bank and to repay all of our obligations under our Third Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, dated as of April 12, 2013 (as amended, the Previous Credit Agreement\u201d), including $95.0 million outstanding under the Previous Credit Agreement as well as settlement of the then existing interest rate swap. The loans under the ABL Facility were subsequently repaid in full promptly following the closing of the Jos. A. Bank acquisition using the cash acquired from Jos. A. Bank.\nThe Credit Facilities and the Senior Notes contain customary non-financial and financial covenants, including fixed charge coverage ratios, total leverage ratios and secured leverage ratios, as well as a restriction on our ability to pay dividends on our common stock in excess of $10.0 million per quarter. Since entering into these financing arrangements and as of January 28, 2017, our total leverage ratio and secured leverage ratio were above the maximums specified in the agreements. As a result, we are currently subject to certain additional restrictions, including limitations on our ability to make acquisitions and incur additional indebtedness. Currently, we believe we will be in compliance with all of the non-financial and financial covenants during fiscal 2018 which will result in the elimination of these additional restrictions. In addition, in accordance with the terms of the Credit Facilities, we have an obligation to make a mandatory excess cash flow prepayment offer of $4.6 million to the Term Loan lenders during fiscal 2017. Our lenders have the option to decline their respective portions of the prepayment.\nCredit Facilities\nThe Term Loan is guaranteed, jointly and severally, by Tailored Brands, Inc. and certain of our U.S. subsidiaries and will mature on June 18, 2021. The interest rate on the Term Loan is currently based on the 1-month LIBOR rate, which was approximately 0.78% at January\n28, 2017. However, the Term Loan interest rate is subject to a LIBOR floor of 1% per annum, plus the applicable margin which is currently 3.50%, resulting in a total interest rate of 4.50%. To minimize the impact of changes in interest rates on our interest payments under the Term Loan, in January 2015, we entered into an interest rate swap agreement to swap variable-rate interest payments for fixed-rate interest payments on a notional amount of $520.0 million, effective in February 2015. At January 28, 2017, the notional amount totaled $330.0 million. The interest rate swap agreement matures in August 2018 and has periodic interest settlements. Under this interest rate swap agreement, we receive a floating rate based on the 3-month LIBOR rate and pay a fixed rate of 5.03% (including the applicable margin of 3.50%) on the outstanding notional amount.\nIn April 2015, we entered into Incremental Facility Agreement No. 1 (the Incremental Agreement\u201d) resulting in a refinancing of $400.0 million aggregate principal amount of our Term Loan from a variable rate to a fixed rate of 5.0% per annum. The Incremental Agreement did not impact the total amount borrowed under the Term Loan, the maturity date of the Term Loan of June 18, 2021, or collateral and guarantees under the existing Term Loan.\nAs a result of the interest rate swap and the Incremental Agreement, we have converted a majority of the variable interest rate under the Term Loan to a fixed rate and, as of January 28, 2017, the Term Loan had a weighted average interest rate of 4.90%.\nThe ABL Facility provides for a senior secured revolving credit facility of $500.0 million, with possible future increases to $650.0 million under an expansion feature that matures on June 18, 2019 and is guaranteed, jointly and severally, by Tailored Brands, Inc. and certain of our U.S. subsidiaries. The ABL Facility has several borrowing and interest rate options including the following indices: (i) adjusted LIBOR, (ii) Canadian Dollar Offered Rate, (iii) Canadian prime rate or (iv) an alternate base rate (equal to the greater of the prime rate, the federal funds effective rate plus 0.5% or adjusted LIBOR for a one-month period plus 1.0%). Advances under the ABL Facility bear interest at a rate per annum using the applicable indices plus a varying interest rate margin of up to 2.00%. The ABL Facility also provides for fees applicable to amounts available to be drawn under outstanding letters of credit which range from 1.50% to 2.00%, and a fee on unused commitments which ranges from 0.25% to 0.375%. As of January 28, 2017, there were no borrowings outstanding under the ABL Facility. During fiscal 2016, the maximum borrowing outstanding under the ABL Facility was $68.5 million.\nThe obligations under the Credit Facilities are secured on a senior basis by a first priority lien on substantially all of the assets of the Company, certain of its U.S. subsidiaries and, in the case of the ABL Facility, Moores The Suit People Inc. The Credit Facilities and the related guarantees and security interests granted thereunder are senior secured obligations of, and will rank equally with all present and future senior indebtedness of, the Company, the co-borrowers and the respective guarantors.\nWe utilize letters of credit primarily to secure inventory purchases and as collateral for workers compensation claims. At January 28, 2017, letters of credit totaling approximately $29.4 million were issued and outstanding. Borrowings available under the ABL Facility as of January 28, 2017 were $414.8 million.\nSenior Notes\nThe Senior Notes are guaranteed, jointly and severally, on an unsecured basis by Tailored Brands, Inc. and certain of our U.S. subsidiaries. The Senior Notes and the related guarantees are senior unsecured obligations of the Company and the guarantors, respectively, and will rank equally with all of the Company's and each guarantor's present and future senior indebtedness. The Senior Notes will mature on July 1, 2022. Interest on the Senior Notes are payable on January 1 and July 1 of each year.\nWe may redeem some or all of the Senior Notes at any time on or after July 1, 2017 at the redemption prices set forth in the indenture governing the Senior Notes. At any time prior to July 1, 2017, we will have the option to redeem some or all of the Senior Notes at a redemption price of 100% of the principal amount of the Senior Notes to be redeemed, plus a make-whole\u201d premium and accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the date of redemption. We may also redeem up to a maximum of 35% of the original aggregate principal amount of the Senior Notes with the proceeds of certain equity offerings prior to July 1, 2017 at a redemption price of 107% of the principal amount of the Senior Notes plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any. Upon the occurrence of certain specific changes of control, we may be required to offer to purchase the Senior Notes at 101% of their aggregate principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest thereon to the date of purchase.\nWe had entered into a registration rights agreement regarding the Senior Notes pursuant to which we agreed, among other things, to use our commercially reasonable efforts to consummate an exchange offer of the Senior Notes for substantially identical notes registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, on or before July 13, 2015. On June 24, 2015, the exchange offer was completed.\nCash Provided by Operating Activities\nNet cash provided by operating activities was $242.6 million and $131.7 million for 2016 and 2015, respectively. The $110.9 million increase was driven by changes in other assets related to income tax refunds as well as a decrease in inventory purchases as we normalize inventory levels, particularly at Jos. A. Bank. These favorable impacts were partially offset by lower net earnings, after adjusting for non-cash items including goodwill, intangible and other asset impairment charges and related changes in deferred taxes. In addition, there were unfavorable fluctuations in accounts payable, accrued expenses and other current liabilities primarily due to timing.\nNet cash provided by operating activities was $131.7 million and $94.8 million for 2015 and 2014, respectively. The $36.9 million increase was driven by higher net earnings, after adjusting for non-cash items including goodwill, intangible and other asset impairment charges, partially offset by the impact of working capital items. Unfavorable changes in working capital include an increase in inventories, primarily due to higher inventory levels from lower sales and increased purchases of rental product partially offset by favorable fluctuations in accounts payable, accrued expenses and other current liabilities.\nCash Used in Investing Activities\nNet cash used in investing activities was $99.1 million and $112.9 million for 2016 and 2015, respectively. The $13.8 million decrease was primarily driven by a decrease in capital expenditures in 2016 compared to 2015 primarily due to fewer full line store openings.\nNet cash used in investing activities was $112.9 million and $1,587.7 million for 2015 and 2014, respectively. The $1,474.8 million decrease was primarily driven by the acquisition of Jos. A. Bank in 2014. The increase in capital expenditures in 2015 compared to 2014 was primarily due to integration projects for Jos. A. Bank as well as store remodels, openings and/or relocations.\nCash Used in Financing Activities\nNet cash used in financing activities was $98.8 million and $46.8 million for 2016 and 2015, respectively. The $52.0 million increase primarily reflects the impact of a $35.5 million prepayment on our Term Loan and the repurchase of $25.0 million of our Senior Notes, which were consummated via borrowings on our ABL Facility.\nNet cash used in financing activities was $46.8 million for 2015 compared to net cash provided by financing activities of $1,500.9 million for 2014. The net change of $1,547.7 million was primarily driven by proceeds on our Term Loan and issuance of Senior Notes for the acquisition of Jos. A. Bank in 2014.\nShare repurchase program- In March 2013, the Board approved a share repurchase program for our common stock. At January 28, 2017, the remaining balance available under the authorization was $48.0 million. During fiscal 2016, 2015, and 2014, no shares were repurchased in open market transactions under the Board's authorization.\nDuring fiscal 2015 and 2014, 5,799 and 5,349 shares, respectively, were repurchased in private transactions to satisfy minimum tax withholding obligations arising upon the vesting of certain restricted stock.\nDividends- Cash dividends paid were approximately $35.2 million, $35.0 million and $34.8 million during fiscal 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. In fiscal 2016, 2015 and 2014, a dividend of $0.18 per share was declared in each quarter, for an annual dividend of $0.72 per share, respectively.\nThe quarterly cash dividend of $0.18 per share declared by our Board of Directors (the Board\u201d) in January 2017 is payable on March 24, 2017 to shareholders of record on March 14, 2017 and is included in accrued expenses and other current liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet as of January 28, 2017.\nFuture sources and uses of cash\nOur primary uses of cash are to finance working capital requirements of our operations and to repay our indebtedness. In addition, we will use cash to fund capital expenditures, income taxes, dividend payments, operating leases and various other commitments and obligations, as they arise.\nCapital expenditures are anticipated to be approximately $90.0 million for 2017. This amount includes the anticipated costs to open two Men's Wearhouse stores and to relocate approximately 15 stores, primarily at Men's Wearhouse. The balance of the capital expenditures for 2017 will be used for point-of-sale and other computer equipment and systems, distribution facilities, store remodeling, and investment in other corporate assets.\nAdditionally, market conditions may produce attractive opportunities for us to make acquisitions. Any such acquisitions may be undertaken as an alternative to opening new stores. We may use cash on hand, together with cash flow from operations, borrowings under our Credit Facilities and issuances of debt or equity securities, to take advantage of any acquisition opportunities.\nCurrent and future domestic and global economic conditions could negatively affect our future operating results as well as our existing cash and cash equivalents balances. In addition, conditions in the financial markets could limit our access to further capital resources, if needed, and could increase associated costs. We believe based on our current business plan that our existing cash and cash flows from operations and availability under our ABL Facility will be sufficient to fund our operating cash requirements, repayment of current indebtedness, and capital expenditures.\nContractual Obligations\nAs of January 28, 2017, we are obligated to make cash payments in connection with our long-term debt, non-cancelable operating leases and other contractual obligations in the amounts listed below. In addition, we utilize letters of credit primarily for inventory purchases and as collateral for workers compensation claims. At January 28, 2017, letters of credit totaling approximately $29.4 million were issued and outstanding.\nTable 93: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nPayments Due by Period\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n(In millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nContractual obligations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nTotal\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n<1 Year\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n1 - 3 Years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n4 - 5 Years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n> 5 Years\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nLong-term debt(1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n2,070.0 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n116.9 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n177.9 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n1,180.1 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n595.1 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nOperating lease base rentals(2)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n1,182.7 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n245.8 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n401.9 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n284.6 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n250.4 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nOther contractual obligations(3)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n156.4 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n38.4 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n34.1 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n26.2 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n57.7 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nTotal contractual obligations(4)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n3,409.1 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n401.1 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n613.9 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n1,490.9 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n903.2 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n (1) Includes interest payments of $103.5 million within one year, $165.7 million between one and three years, $158.9 million between four and five years and $20.1 million beyond five years, at current interest rates including the impact of our interest rate swap. The payments due by period do not consider amounts which may become payable under the excess cash flow provision of our Term Loan. See Notes 6 and 16 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. \n (2) We lease retail business locations, office and warehouse facilities and equipment under various non-cancelable operating leases. See Note 18 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. \n (3) Other contractual obligations consist primarily of minimum payments under our agreement with Macy's to operate tuxedo shops within Macy's stores, our agreement with Vera Wang that gives us the exclusive right to Black by Vera Wang\u201d tuxedo products, our partnership with Kenneth Cole and our marketing agreement with David's Bridal, Inc. We have included all minimum payments for the complete term of our licensing agreement with Macy's in the table above. However, subject to certain business conditions, we have the ability to terminate the agreement in fiscal 2021 (the midpoint of the term), which would reduce the total amount of minimum payments set forth above by approximately $71.0 million. Pursuant to our marketing agreement with David's Bridal, Inc., there are performance conditions that may impact future payments. These potential future payments are not included in the table above as such amounts are not readily determinable. \n (4) Excluded from the table above is $19.5 million related to uncertain tax positions. These amounts are not included due to our inability to predict the timing of the settlement of these amounts. See Note 7 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. \nIn the normal course of business, we issue purchase orders to suppliers for merchandise. The purchase orders represent executory contracts requiring performance by the suppliers, including the delivery of the merchandise prior to a specified cancellation date and compliance with product specifications, quality standards and other requirements. In the event of the supplier's failure to meet the agreed upon terms and conditions, we may cancel the order.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nOther than the non-cancelable operating leases, other contractual obligations and letters of credit discussed above, we do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that are material to our financial position or results of operations.\nInflation\nWe believe the impact of inflation on the results of operations during the periods presented has been minimal. However, there can be no assurance that our business will not be affected by inflation in the future.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nThe preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires the appropriate application of accounting policies in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. In many instances, this also requires management to make estimates and assumptions about future events that affect the amounts and disclosures included in our financial statements. We base our estimates on historical experience and various assumptions that we believe are reasonable under our current business model. However, because future events and conditions and their effects cannot be determined with certainty, actual results will differ from our estimates and such differences could be material to our financial statements.\nOur accounting policies are described in Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. We consistently apply these policies and periodically evaluate the reasonableness of our estimates in light of actual events. Historically, we have found our accounting policies to be appropriate and our estimates and assumptions reasonable. Our critical accounting policies, which are those most significant to the presentation of our financial position and results of operations and those that require significant judgment or complex estimates by management, are discussed below.\nRevenue Recognition-Clothing product revenue is recognized at the time of sale and delivery of merchandise, net of actual sales returns and a provision for estimated sales returns. For e-commerce sales, revenue is recognized at the time we estimate the customer receives the product, which incorporates shipping terms and estimated delivery times. Revenues from rental, alteration and other services are recognized upon completion of the services. Amounts related to shipping and handling revenues billed to customers are recorded in net sales, and the related shipping and handling costs are recorded in cost of sales.\nWe present all non-income government-assessed taxes (sales, use and value added taxes) collected from our customers and remitted to governmental agencies on a net basis (excluded from net sales) in our consolidated financial statements. The government-assessed taxes are recorded in accrued expenses and other current liabilities until they are remitted to the government agency.\nInventories-Our inventory is carried at the lower of cost and net realizable value. Cost is determined based on the average cost method. Our inventory cost also includes estimated procurement and distribution costs (warehousing, freight, hangers and merchandising costs) associated with the inventory, with the balance of such costs included in cost of sales. Procurement and distribution costs are generally allocated to inventory based on the ratio of annual product purchases to inventory cost. If this ratio were to change significantly, it could materially affect the amount of procurement and distribution costs included in cost of sales. We make assumptions, based primarily on historical experience, as to items in our inventory that may be damaged, obsolete or salable only at marked down prices to reflect the market value of these items. If actual damages, obsolescence or market demand is significantly different from our estimates, additional inventory write-downs could be required.\nImpairment of Long-Lived Assets-Long-lived assets, such as property and equipment and identifiable intangibles with finite useful lives, are periodically evaluated for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. Assets are grouped and evaluated for impairment at the lowest level of which there are identifiable cash flows, which is generally at a store level. Assets are reviewed using factors including, but not limited to, our future operating plans and projected cash flows. The determination of whether impairment has occurred is based on an estimate of undiscounted future cash flows directly related to the assets, compared to the carrying value of the assets. If the sum of the undiscounted future cash flows of the assets does not exceed the carrying value of the assets, full or partial impairment may exist. If the asset carrying amount exceeds its fair value, an impairment charge is recognized in the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the fair value of the asset. Fair value is determined using an income approach, which requires discounting the estimated future cash flows associated with the asset. Estimating future cash flows requires management to make assumptions and to apply judgment, including forecasting future sales, costs and useful lives of assets. Significant judgment is also involved in selecting the appropriate discount rate to be applied in determining the estimated fair value of an asset. Changes to our key assumptions related to future performance, market conditions and other economic factors can significantly affect our impairment evaluation and result in future impairment charges. For example, unanticipated long-term adverse market conditions can cause individual stores to become unprofitable and can result in an impairment charge for the property and equipment assets in those stores. See Notes 1, 3 and 4 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.\nBusiness Combinations-Purchase Price Allocation-For the Jos. A. Bank acquisition, we allocated the purchase price to the various tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed, based on their estimated fair values, which were finalized as of August 1, 2015. Determining the fair value of certain assets and liabilities acquired is subjective in nature and often involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions, which are inherently uncertain. Many of the estimates and assumptions used to determine fair values, such as those used for intangible assets are made based on forecasted information and discount rates. In addition, the judgments made in determining\nthe estimated fair value assigned to each class of assets acquired and liabilities assumed, as well as asset lives, can materially impact our results of operations.\nGoodwill and Other Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets-Goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets are initially recorded at their fair values. Identifiable intangible assets with an indefinite useful life, including goodwill, are not amortized but are evaluated annually as for impairment. A more frequent evaluation is performed if events or circumstances indicate that impairment could have occurred. Such events or circumstances could include, but are not limited to, significant negative industry or economic trends, unanticipated changes in the competitive environment, decisions to significantly modify or dispose of operations and a significant sustained decline in the market price of our stock.\nDuring fiscal 2015, we changed the date of our annual impairment assessment from the last day of our fiscal year to the last day of the second month of our fiscal fourth quarter. The change in date had no impact on our annual impairment test as both the new and old testing dates are within the same fiscal quarter. We changed the assessment date to allow for more time to complete the impairment assessment process before our fiscal year end.\nFor purposes of our goodwill impairment evaluation, the reporting units are our operating segments identified in Note 17 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Goodwill has been assigned to the reporting units based on prior business combinations related to the brands.\nOur goodwill assessment consists of either using a qualitative approach to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of the assets is less than their respective carrying values or a two-step quantitative impairment test, if necessary. In performing the qualitative assessment, we consider many factors in evaluating whether the carrying value of the asset may not be recoverable, including macroeconomic conditions, retail industry considerations, recent financial performance and declines in stock price and market capitalization. In 2016, we applied the qualitative approach to all reporting units, except for the corporate apparel reporting unit.\nIn step one of the quantitative test for our corporate apparel reporting unit, we estimated the fair value of the reporting unit using a combined income and market comparable approach. Our income approach uses projected future cash flows that are discounted using a weighted-average cost of capital analysis that reflects current market conditions. The market comparable approach primarily considers market price multiples of comparable companies and applies those price multiples to certain key drivers of the reporting unit.\nManagement judgment is a significant factor in the goodwill impairment evaluation process. The computations require management to make estimates and assumptions. Actual values may differ significantly from these judgments, particularly if there are significant adverse changes in the operating environment for our reporting units. Critical assumptions that are used as part of these evaluations include:\n \u00b7 The potential future cash flows of the reporting unit. The income approach relies on the timing and estimates of future cash flows. The projections use management's estimates of economic and market conditions over the projected period, including growth rates in revenue, gross margin and expense. The cash flows are based on our most recent business operating plans and various growth rates have been assumed for years beyond the current business plan period. \n \u00b7 Selection of an appropriate discount rate. The income approach requires the selection of an appropriate discount rate, which is based on a weighted-average cost of capital analysis. The discount rate is affected by changes in short-term interest rates and long-term yield as well as variances in the typical capital structure of marketplace participants. Given current economic conditions, it is possible that the discount rate will fluctuate in the near term. The weighted-average cost of capital used to discount the cash flows for the 2016 quantitative test of the corporate apparel reporting unit was 13.0%. \n \u00b7 Selection of comparable companies within the industry. For purposes of the market comparable approach, valuations were determined by calculating average price multiples of relevant key drivers from a group of companies that are comparable to the corporate apparel reporting unit and applying those price multiples to the key drivers of the corporate apparel reporting unit. While the market price multiple is not an assumption, a presumption that it provides an indicator of the value of the reporting unit is inherent in the valuation. The determination of the market comparable also involves a degree of judgment. Earnings multiples used in the market comparable approach ranged from 10.5 to 11.5 for the 2016 analysis. \nAs discussed above, the fair value of the corporate apparel reporting unit in 2016 was determined using a combined income and market comparable approach. We believe these two approaches are appropriate valuation techniques and we generally weight the two values equally as an estimate of reporting unit fair value for the purposes of our impairment testing. However, we may weigh one value more heavily than the other when conditions merit doing so.\nThe goodwill impairment evaluation process requires management to make estimates and assumptions with regard to the fair value of reporting units. Actual values may differ significantly from these judgments, particularly if there are significant adverse changes in the operating environment for our reporting units. Sustained declines in our market capitalization could also increase the risk of goodwill\nimpairment. Such occurrences could result in future goodwill impairment charges that would, in turn, negatively impact our results of operations. However, any such goodwill impairments would be non-cash charges that would not affect our cash flows or compliance with our debt covenants.\nIndefinite-lived intangible assets are not subject to amortization but are reviewed at least annually for impairment. The indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment evaluation is performed by comparing the fair value of the indefinite-lived intangible assets to their carrying values. Similar to the goodwill approach described above, our annual impairment assessment for indefinite-lived intangible assets contemplates the use of either a qualitative approach to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of the assets is less than their respective carrying values or a quantitative impairment test, if necessary.\nThe quantitative impairment test estimates the fair value of an intangible asset based on an income approach using the relief-from-royalty method. This approach is dependent upon a number of factors, including estimates of future growth and trends, royalty rates, discount rates and other variables. We base our fair value estimates on assumptions we believe to be reasonable, but which are unpredictable and inherently uncertain.\nFiscal 2016 Impairment Assessment Results\nAs a result of our annual impairment evaluations, as of January 28, 2017, we believe that none of our goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are impaired and all of our reporting units have fair values that significantly exceed their carrying values and, therefore, no reporting units are currently deemed at risk\u201d for goodwill impairment.\nRental Product-The cost of our rental product is amortized to cost of sales based on the cost of each unit rented, which is estimated based on the number of times the unit is expected to be rented and the average cost of the rental product. Lost, damaged and retired rental product is also charged to cost of sales. Rental product is amortized to expense generally over a four year period. We make assumptions, based primarily on historical experience, as to the number of times each unit can be rented. If the actual number of times a unit can be rented were to vary significantly from our estimates, it could materially affect the amount of rental product amortization included in cost of sales.\nIncome Taxes-Income taxes are accounted for using the asset and liability method. Deferred tax liabilities or assets are established for temporary differences between financial and tax reporting bases and are subsequently adjusted to reflect changes in enacted tax rates expected to be in effect when the temporary differences reverse. The deferred tax assets are reduced, if necessary, by a valuation allowance if the future realization of those tax benefits is not more likely than not.\nSignificant judgment is required in determining the provision for income taxes, related taxes payable and deferred tax assets and liabilities since, in the ordinary course of business, there are transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax outcome is uncertain. Additionally, our tax returns are subject to audit by various domestic and foreign tax authorities that could result in material adjustments or differing interpretations of the tax laws. Although we believe that our estimates are reasonable and are based on the best available information at the time we prepare the provision, actual results could differ from these estimates resulting in a final tax outcome that may be materially different from that which is reflected in our consolidated financial statements.\nThe tax benefit from an uncertain tax position is recognized only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. The tax benefits recognized in the consolidated financial statements from such positions are then measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon settlement. Additionally, interest and/or penalties related to uncertain tax positions are recognized in income tax expense. Significant judgment is required in determining our uncertain tax positions. We have established reserves for uncertain tax positions using our best judgment and adjust these reserves, as warranted, due to changing facts and circumstances. A change in our uncertain tax positions, in any given period, could have a significant impact on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows for that period.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nExcept as discussed in Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, we have considered all new accounting pronouncements and have concluded that there are no new pronouncements that may have a material impact on our results of operations, financial condition, or cash flows, based on current information.", "item_7_text": "ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nExecutive Overview\nBackground\nEffective January 31, 2016, Tailored Brands, Inc., a Texas corporation ( Tailored Brands\u201d), became the successor reporting company to The Men's Wearhouse, Inc., pursuant to a holding company reorganization. We are a leading authority on helping men dress for work, special occasions and everyday life. We serve our customers through an expansive omni-channel network that includes over 1,600 locations in the U.S. and Canada as well as our branded e-commerce websites.\nOn June 18, 2014, we acquired 100% of the outstanding common stock of Jos. A. Bank, a men's specialty apparel retailer, for approximately $1.8 billion. As a result, the comparability of our results is affected by the inclusion of Jos. A. Bank's results for the entire fiscal years of 2016 and 2015 while fiscal 2014's operations include Jos. A. Bank's results beginning on June 18, 2014.\nOn June 10, 2015, we entered into an agreement with Macy's, Inc. to operate men's tuxedo rental shops inside 300 Macy's department stores. In addition, we agreed to collaborate with Macy's to develop an online tuxedo rental shop. As of January 28, 2017, we operated 170 tuxedo shops within Macy's stores under the name The Tuxedo Shop @ Macy's.\u201d We are actively engaged in discussions with Macy's to restructure our agreement. In the meantime, we have agreed with Macy's to put the opening of the additional 130 contracted stores on hold while we explore a potentially new model.\nWe operate two reportable segments as determined by the way we manage, evaluate and internally report our business activities: Retail and Corporate Apparel. In 2016, we revised our segment reporting presentation to reflect changes in how we manage our business, including resource allocation and performance assessment. Specifically, we are now presenting expenses related to our shared services platform separately from the results of our operating segments to promote enhanced comparability of our operating segments. Previously, these shared service expenses were primarily included in our retail segment. Comparable prior period information has been recast to reflect our revised segment presentation. See Item 1, Business\u201d of this Annual Report on Form 10-K as well as Note 17 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements and the discussion included in Results of Operations\u201d below for additional information and disclosures regarding our reporting segments.\nSummary of Financial Performance\nFiscal 2016 was a year of significant strategic progress for Tailored Brands as we executed on our plans to right-size our store base, optimize our cost structure, and return Jos. A. Bank to a path of sustained profitable growth. We delivered on our operational initiatives that we established for 2016. We closed 233 stores under our store rationalization program, we achieved over $60 million in cost savings through our profit improvement plan, and we stabilized and began to turn around Jos. A. Bank. With a focus on continued operational excellence, we have built a strong foundation for future growth.\nUnfortunately, the challenging retail environment resulted in soft traffic across our retail brands, which drove lower than anticipated full year net sales and gross margins in fiscal 2016. In addition, during fiscal 2016, our tuxedo shops within Macy's did not ramp as we expected. We are actively engaged in discussions with Macy's to restructure our agreement. Given current and forecasted results and the likelihood that a restructured agreement will involve a different operating model, we recorded an asset impairment charge of $14.0 million in fiscal 2016 related to fixed assets in the tuxedo shops within Macy's. In addition, during fiscal 2016, our operating loss for the tuxedo shops within Macy's was approximately $14.0 million, excluding the asset impairment charge described above.\nKey operating metrics for the year ended January 28, 2017 include:\n \u00b7 Net sales decrease of 3.4%. \n \u00b7 Comparable sales at Men's Wearhouse, Jos. A. Bank, Moores and K&G decreased 0.6%, 9.5%, 2.6% and 2.4%, respectively. \n \u00b7 Operating income of $132.8 million, compared to operating loss of $1,077.3 million in fiscal 2015, which includes goodwill and intangible asset impairment charges of $1,243.4 million. \n \u00b7 Diluted earnings per share of $0.51 compared to diluted loss per share of $21.26 in fiscal 2015. \nKey liquidity metrics for the year ended January 28, 2017 include:\n \u00b7 Cash provided by operating activities was $242.6 million in fiscal 2016 compared to $131.7 million in fiscal 2015. \n \u00b7 Capital expenditures were $99.7 million in fiscal 2016 compared to $115.5 million in fiscal 2015. \n \u00b7 We repaid $42.5 million on our term loan, repurchased and retired $25.0 million of our senior notes and had no borrowings outstanding on our revolving credit facility as of January 28, 2017. \n \u00b7 Dividends paid totaled $35.2 million in fiscal 2016. \nItems Affecting Comparability of Results\nThe comparability of our results has been impacted by certain items primarily restructuring and other costs reflecting costs related to our store rationalization program and profit improvement programs, asset impairment charges including for tuxedo shops within Macy's, the 2015 impairment of Jos. A. Bank's goodwill and other intangible assets, and acquisition and integration costs for Jos. A. Bank. A summary of the effect of these items on pretax income for each applicable fiscal year is presented below (dollars in millions):\n\n (1) Includes $1.8 million gain on the sale of property in 2015 and $3.4 million gain on settlement of litigation in 2014. \nThe following table summarizes the costs in the above table by line item in our statements of earnings (loss):\n\n2017 Initiatives\nOur 2017 strategy includes reinvestment of some of the cost savings we achieved in 2016 to support our omni-channel strategies. The demand for convenience, a more personalized experience, and casual wardrobe options has never been more pronounced. In response, we expect to improve our online customer experience with new features and functionality to create more personalized interactions with our customers, shift our marketing strategies to drive customer traffic and promote greater awareness of our exclusive offerings, including custom clothing.\nStore Information\nDuring fiscal 2016, we opened 178 stores/tuxedo shops (158 shops within Macy's stores, 13 Men's Wearhouse stores, three Jos. A. Bank stores, two Moores stores and two K&G stores) and closed 235 stores (122 Jos. A. Bank stores, 102 Men's Wearhouse and Tux stores, and 11 Men's Wearhouse stores). The closure of the 235 stores was largely the result of our store rationalization strategy, which we believe is important to our long-term profitability as it eliminated underperforming stores and re-balanced the store fleet and cost structure. In the future, we will continue to monitor our store fleet for opportunities to optimize our cost structure.\nIn fiscal 2017, we plan to open two Men's Wearhouse stores and to relocate approximately 15 stores, primarily at Men's Wearhouse. We also plan to close eight Jos. A. Bank stores and three Men's Wearhouse and Tux stores.\nResults of Operations\nThe following table sets forth our results of operations expressed as a percentage of net sales for the periods indicated:\n\n (1) Percentage line items may not sum to totals due to the effect of rounding. \n (2) Calculated as a percentage of related sales. \n2016 Compared with 2015\nNet Sales\nTotal net sales decreased $117.6 million, or 3.4%, to $3,378.7 million for fiscal 2016 as compared to fiscal 2015.\nTotal retail sales decreased $154.1 million, or 4.7%, to $3,098.4 million for fiscal 2016 as compared to fiscal 2015 due mainly to a $154.0 million decrease in retail clothing product revenues primarily at our Jos. A. Bank brand as we transitioned away from the Jos. A. Bank historical promotional model. Total retail sales were also impacted by a $14.2 million decrease in alteration and other services offset by a $14.1 million increase in rental services revenues. The net decrease in total retail sales is attributable to the following:\n\n (1) Comparable sales percentages for Moores are calculated using Canadian dollars. \nComparable sales exclude the net sales of a store for any month of one period if the store was not owned or open throughout the same month of the prior period and include e-commerce net sales. We operate our business using an omni-channel approach and do not differentiate e-commerce sales from our other channels.\nThe decrease in comparable sales at Men's Wearhouse resulted primarily from decreased average transactions per store that more than offset increased average unit retail (net selling prices) while units per transaction were essentially flat. The decrease at Jos. A. Bank was driven by decreased average transactions per store that more than offset increased units per transaction and a slight increase in average unit retail. The decrease at Moores was driven by decreased average transactions per store and units per transaction that more than offset increased average unit retail. The decrease at K&G was driven by decreased average transactions per store that more than offset increased units per transaction and average unit retail. At Men's Wearhouse, rental service comparable sales increased 3.0% primarily due to an increase in rental rates.\nTotal corporate apparel clothing product sales increased $36.5 million to $280.3 million for fiscal 2016 as compared to fiscal 2015 primarily due to the impact of a large new uniform program. The rollout of the new uniform program commenced in June 2016, was completed during the third quarter of 2016 and has now transitioned to a standard replenishment phase. The increase in corporate apparel sales was partially offset by the impact of a weaker British pound this year compared to fiscal 2015 of approximately $26.1 million.\nGross Margin\nProcurement and distribution costs are included in determining our retail and corporate apparel clothing product gross margins. Our gross margin may not be comparable to other specialty retailers, as some companies exclude costs related to their distribution network from cost of sales while others, like us, include all or a portion of such costs in cost of sales and exclude them from SG&A expenses. Distribution costs are not included in determining our rental services gross margin as these costs are included in SG&A expenses.\nOur total gross margin decreased $43.0 million, or 2.9%, to $1,441.5 million for fiscal 2016 as compared to fiscal 2015. Total retail segment gross margin decreased $60.3 million, or 4.3%, in fiscal 2016 as compared to fiscal 2015 primarily due to lower sales at Jos. A. Bank.\nFor the retail segment, total gross margin as a percentage of related sales increased from 43.5% in fiscal 2015 to 43.7% in fiscal 2016. The slight increase in the retail segment gross margin percentage was primarily the result of the mix effect of higher margin rental services revenue and slight leverage on occupancy costs.\nOccupancy costs decreased $24.2 million primarily due to our store rationalization efforts. Occupancy costs as a percentage of retail sales, which is relatively constant on a per store basis and includes store related rent, common area maintenance, utilities, repairs and maintenance, security, property taxes and depreciation, decreased slightly to 13.9% in fiscal 2016 from 14.0% in fiscal 2015.\nCorporate apparel gross margin increased $17.3 million or 24.6% from fiscal 2015 to $87.7 million in fiscal 2016. For the corporate apparel segment, total gross margin as a percentage of related sales increased from 28.9% in fiscal 2015 to 31.3% in fiscal 2016 primarily due to the impact of a large new uniform program as well as pre-tax gains on foreign currency hedging transactions.\nAdvertising Expense\nAdvertising expense decreased to $190.0 million in fiscal 2016 from $205.0 million in fiscal 2015, a decrease of $15.0 million or 7.3%. The decrease in advertising expense was driven by reductions in marketing spend, primarily in television and digital advertising, in response to the softening sales trend, primarily in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016. As a percentage of total net sales, these expenses decreased from 5.9% in fiscal 2015 to 5.6% in fiscal 2016.\nSelling, General and Administrative Expenses\nSG&A expenses increased to $1,099.3 million in fiscal 2016 from $1,085.9 million in fiscal 2015, an increase of $13.4 million or 1.2%. As a percentage of total net sales, these expenses increased from 31.1% in fiscal 2015 to 32.5% in fiscal 2016. The components of this 1.4% net increase in SG&A expenses as a percentage of total net sales and the related dollar changes were as follows:\n\nIn the retail segment, SG&A expenses as a percentage of related net sales increased from 26.4% in fiscal 2015 to 27.1% in fiscal 2016 primarily due to deleverage resulting from lower retail sales. Retail segment SG&A expenses decreased $19.3 million primarily due to cost reduction initiatives and the impact of store closures partially offset by lease termination costs.\nIn the corporate apparel segment, SG&A expenses as a percentage of related net sales decreased from 24.9% in fiscal 2015 to 21.7% in fiscal 2016 primarily due to leverage from higher sales. Corporate apparel segment SG&A expenses increased $0.1 million.\nShared service expenses represent costs not specifically related to the operations of our business segments and are included in SG&A. Shared service SG&A expenses as a percentage of total net sales increased from 4.7% in fiscal 2015 to 5.9% in fiscal 2016. Shared service SG&A expenses increased $32.6 million primarily due to costs associated with our profit improvement program and higher incentive compensation accruals.\nGoodwill and Intangible Asset Impairment Charges\nThere were no goodwill and intangible asset impairment charges recorded in fiscal 2016. For further details on fiscal 2015 goodwill and intangible asset impairment charges, see Goodwill and Other Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets as discussed in Critical Accounting Polices and Estimates\u201d and Note 3 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further details.\nAsset Impairment Charges\nNon-cash asset impairment charges were $19.4 million in fiscal 2016 as compared to $27.5 million in fiscal 2015. The asset impairment charges in fiscal 2016 primarily consist of $14.0 million related to fixed assets in our tuxedo shops within Macy's, $2.5 million primarily related to stores closed as part of our store rationalization program and $2.9 million related to a long-lived asset reclassified as held for sale. The asset impairment charges in fiscal 2015 resulted primarily from our store rationalization program, which resulted in store closures in fiscal 2016. See Impairment of Long-Lived Assets as discussed in Critical Accounting Polices and Estimates\u201d and Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further details.\nInterest Expense\nInterest expense decreased to $103.1 million in fiscal 2016 from $106.0 million in fiscal 2015, a decrease of $2.8 million or 2.7%, due to repayment of our indebtedness including $42.5 million on our term loan and repurchase and retirement of $25.0 million of our senior notes.\nProvision for Income Tax\nIn fiscal 2016, our effective income tax rate was 21.0% and is lower than the U.S. statutory rate primarily due to foreign earnings and the lower tax rates in these jurisdictions. Our foreign jurisdictions in which we operate had taxable income, which requires us to provide for income tax, specifically, our operations in Canada and the United Kingdom. For fiscal 2016, the statutory tax rates in Canada and the United Kingdom were approximately 27% and 20%, respectively, which negatively impacted our effective tax rate due to the loss in the U.S. For fiscal 2016, tax expense for our operations in foreign jurisdictions totaled $10.3 million.\nOur income tax expense and effective income tax rate in future periods may be impacted by many factors, including our geographic mix of earnings and changes in tax laws. Currently, we expect our effective tax rate in future periods to be lower than the statutory U.S. combined federal and state tax rate based on the expected geographic mix of earnings.\nIn addition, if our financial results in fiscal 2017 generate a loss or certain deferred tax liabilities decrease, we may need to establish a valuation allowance on our U.S. deferred tax assets, which could have a material impact on our financial condition and results of operations.\nNet Income Attributable to Common Shareholders\nThese factors resulted in a net income attributable to common shareholders of $25.0 million for fiscal 2016, an increase of $1,051.7 million from a net loss of $1,026.7 million for fiscal 2015.\n2015 Compared with 2014\nNet Sales\nTotal net sales increased $243.7 million, or 7.5%, to $3,496.3 million for fiscal 2015 as compared to fiscal 2014.\nTotal retail sales increased $257.3 million, or 8.6%, to $3,252.5 million for fiscal 2015 as compared to fiscal 2014 due mainly to $182.9 million of incremental net sales from Jos. A. Bank, as fiscal 2015 includes full year results from Jos. A. Bank while fiscal 2014 represented results only from the date of acquisition. Total retail sales also increased due to retail clothing product and alteration revenues from our other brands of $81.2 million partially offset by a decrease in rental services revenue from our other brands of $8.3 million. The net increase is attributable to the following:\n\n (1) Comparable sales percentages for Moores are calculated using Canadian dollars. \n (2) Excludes Jos. A. Bank. \nComparable sales exclude the net sales of a store for any month of one period if the store was not owned or open throughout the same month of the prior period and include e-commerce net sales. We operate our business using an omni-channel approach and do not differentiate e-commerce sales from our other channels.\nThe increase in comparable sales at Men's Wearhouse resulted primarily from increased average unit retail (net selling prices) and average transactions per store that more than offset decreased units per transaction. The decrease at Moores was driven by decreased average\ntransactions per store and units per transaction that more than offset increased average unit retail. The increase at K&G was driven by increased average transactions per store and units per transaction while average unit retail was flat. At Men's Wearhouse, rental service comparable sales decreased 0.7% primarily due to a decrease in unit rentals partially offset by an increase in rental rates.\nComparable sales for Jos. A. Bank decreased by 16.3% and are calculated in the same manner as our other brands except that it is based on Jos. A. Bank's entire fiscal 2014, a portion of which was prior to our acquisition on June 18, 2014. In addition, as a result of our decision to close all factory stores at Jos. A. Bank in 2016, we have excluded the results of these stores from our comparable sales calculation for Jos. A. Bank.\nTotal corporate apparel clothing product sales decreased $13.6 million to $243.8 million for fiscal 2015 as compared to fiscal 2014. The decrease in corporate apparel sales was primarily due to the impact of a weaker British pound this year compared to fiscal 2014 of approximately $15.0 million.\nGross Margin\nProcurement and distribution costs are included in determining our retail and corporate apparel clothing product gross margins. Our gross margin may not be comparable to other specialty retailers, as some companies exclude costs related to their distribution network from cost of sales while others, like us, include all or a portion of such costs in cost of sales and exclude them from SG&A expenses. Distribution costs are not included in determining our rental services gross margin as these costs are included in SG&A expenses.\nOur total gross margin increased $125.8 million, or 9.3%, to $1,484.4 million for fiscal 2015 as compared to fiscal 2014. During fiscal 2015, as a result of our store rationalization program, we incurred $11.0 million of inventory write-offs as well as a $4.8 million charge related to discontinued rental product, both of which negatively impacted our gross margin results. During fiscal 2014, $33.5 million of inventory valuation step up related to Jos. A. Bank and a $10.6 million charge to rationalize our rental product to allow for more productive rental styles were incurred and negatively impacted our gross margin results.\nTotal retail segment gross margin increased $132.2 million or 10.3% from fiscal 2014 to $1,414.1 million in fiscal 2015. The dollar increase in gross margin was primarily driven by $98.0 million of incremental gross margin generated by Jos. A. Bank as well as by higher sales from our Men's Wearhouse brand.\nFor the retail segment, total gross margin as a percentage of related sales increased from 42.8% in fiscal 2014 to 43.5% in fiscal 2015 driven primarily by an increase in the rental services margin as well as a higher retail clothing product gross margin rate, which was negatively impacted last year by the inventory step up at Jos. A. Bank.\nOccupancy costs increased $60.0 million primarily due to incremental Jos. A. Bank occupancy costs. Occupancy costs as a percentage of retail sales, which is relatively constant on a per store basis and includes store related rent, common area maintenance, utilities, repairs and maintenance, security, property taxes and depreciation, increased from 13.2% in fiscal 2014 to 14.0% in fiscal 2015, primarily due to deleveraging of occupancy costs at Jos. A. Bank as well as Jos A. Bank's occupancy costs being higher as a percentage of sales than our other brands.\nCorporate apparel gross margin decreased $6.4 million or 8.3% from fiscal 2014 to $70.3 million in fiscal 2015. For the corporate apparel segment, total gross margin as a percentage of related sales decreased from 29.8% in fiscal 2014 to 28.9% in fiscal 2015 primarily due to unfavorable currency impacts at our UK operations.\nAdvertising Expense\nAdvertising expense increased to $205.0 million in fiscal 2015 from $168.3 million in fiscal 2014, an increase of $36.7 million or 21.8%. The increase was primarily due to incremental Jos. A. Bank advertising costs as well as increased advertising expense to support branding initiatives. As a percentage of total net sales, these expenses increased from 5.2% in fiscal 2014 to 5.9% in fiscal 2015.\nSelling, General and Administrative Expenses\nSG&A expenses decreased to $1,085.9 million in fiscal 2015 from $1,116.8 million in fiscal 2014, a decrease of $30.9 million or 2.8%. As a percentage of total net sales, these expenses decreased from 34.3% in fiscal 2014 to 31.1% in fiscal 2015. The components of this 3.2% net decrease in SG&A expenses as a percentage of total net sales and the related dollar changes were as follows:\n\nIn the retail segment, SG&A expenses as a percentage of related net sales decreased from 29.5% in fiscal 2014 to 26.4% in fiscal 2015. Retail segment SG&A expenses decreased $23.6 million primarily due to a decrease in acquisition, integration and other costs and a decrease in expense related to an arbitration award partially offset by a full year of operating expenses for Jos. A. Bank.\nIn the corporate apparel segment, SG&A expenses as a percentage of related net sales decreased from 25.1% in fiscal 2014 to 24.9% in fiscal 2015. Corporate apparel segment SG&A expenses decreased $3.8 million.\nShared service expenses represent costs not specifically related to the operations of our business segments and are included in SG&A. Shared service SG&A expenses as a percentage of total net sales decreased from 5.2% in fiscal 2014 to 4.7% in fiscal 2015. Shared service SG&A expenses decreased $3.5 million.\nGoodwill and Intangible Asset Impairment Charges\nBelow is a table that summarizes the goodwill and other intangible asset impairment charges related to Jos. A. Bank recorded in fiscal 2015 (amounts in thousands):\n\nSee Goodwill and Other Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets as discussed in Critical Accounting Polices and Estimates\u201d and Note 3 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further details.\nAsset Impairment Charges\nNon-cash asset impairment charges increased to $27.5 million in fiscal 2015 as compared to $0.3 million in fiscal 2014. The asset impairment charges in fiscal 2015 resulted primarily from our store rationalization program, which resulted in store closures in fiscal 2016. See Impairment of Long-Lived Assets as discussed in Critical Accounting Polices and Estimates\u201d and Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further details.\nInterest Expense\nInterest expense increased to $106.0 million in fiscal 2015 from $66.0 million in fiscal 2014, an increase of $40.0 million or 60.5%, due to incremental interest incurred on borrowings entered into in connection with the Jos. A. Bank acquisition.\nProvision for Income Tax\nIn fiscal 2015, our effective income tax rate was (14.1%) and is lower than the U.S. statutory rate due to our overall net loss partially offset by the non-deductibility of the goodwill impairment charge, as discussed above. Our foreign jurisdictions in which we operate had taxable income, which requires us to provide for income tax, specifically, our operations in Canada and the United Kingdom. For fiscal 2015, the statutory tax rates in Canada and the United Kingdom were approximately 27% and 20%, respectively, which negatively impacted our effective tax rate due to the loss in the U.S. For fiscal 2015, tax expense for our operations in foreign jurisdictions totaled $8.9 million.\nOur income tax expense and effective income tax rate in future periods may be impacted by many factors, including our geographic mix of earnings and changes in tax laws. Currently, we expect our effective tax rate in future periods to be lower than the statutory United States combined federal and state tax rate based on the expected geographic mix of earnings.\nNet Loss Attributable to Common Shareholders\nThese factors resulted in a net loss attributable to common shareholders of $1,026.7 million for fiscal 2015, a decrease of $1,026.3 million from a net loss of $0.4 million for fiscal 2014.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nAt January 28, 2017 and January 30, 2016, cash and cash equivalents totaled $70.9 million and $30.0 million, respectively. At January 28, 2017, cash and cash equivalents held by foreign subsidiaries totaled $68.0 million. Under current tax laws and regulations, if cash and cash equivalents held outside the U.S. are repatriated to the U.S., in certain circumstances we may be subject to additional U.S. income taxes and foreign withholding taxes. We currently do not intend to repatriate amounts held by foreign subsidiaries.\nWe had working capital of $705.8 million and $723.6 million at January 28, 2017 and January 30, 2016, respectively. Our primary sources of working capital are cash flows from operations and available borrowings under our financing arrangements, as described below.\nOn June 18, 2014, The Men's Wearhouse, Inc. entered into a term loan credit agreement that provides for a senior secured term loan in the aggregate principal amount of $1.1 billion (the Term Loan\u201d), and a $500.0 million asset-based revolving credit agreement (the ABL Facility\u201d, and together with the Term Loan, the Credit Facilities\u201d) with certain of our U.S. subsidiaries and Moores the Suit People Inc., one of our Canadian subsidiaries, as co-borrowers. In addition, on June 18, 2014, The Men's Wearhouse, Inc. issued $600.0 million in aggregate principal amount of 7.00% Senior Notes due 2022 (the Senior Notes\u201d).\nWe used the net proceeds from the Term Loan, the offering of the Senior Notes and the net proceeds from $340.0 million drawn on the ABL Facility to pay the approximately $1.8 billion purchase price for the acquisition of Jos. A. Bank and to repay all of our obligations under our Third Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, dated as of April 12, 2013 (as amended, the Previous Credit Agreement\u201d), including $95.0 million outstanding under the Previous Credit Agreement as well as settlement of the then existing interest rate swap. The loans under the ABL Facility were subsequently repaid in full promptly following the closing of the Jos. A. Bank acquisition using the cash acquired from Jos. A. Bank.\nThe Credit Facilities and the Senior Notes contain customary non-financial and financial covenants, including fixed charge coverage ratios, total leverage ratios and secured leverage ratios, as well as a restriction on our ability to pay dividends on our common stock in excess of $10.0 million per quarter. Since entering into these financing arrangements and as of January 28, 2017, our total leverage ratio and secured leverage ratio were above the maximums specified in the agreements. As a result, we are currently subject to certain additional restrictions, including limitations on our ability to make acquisitions and incur additional indebtedness. Currently, we believe we will be in compliance with all of the non-financial and financial covenants during fiscal 2018 which will result in the elimination of these additional restrictions. In addition, in accordance with the terms of the Credit Facilities, we have an obligation to make a mandatory excess cash flow prepayment offer of $4.6 million to the Term Loan lenders during fiscal 2017. Our lenders have the option to decline their respective portions of the prepayment.\nCredit Facilities\nThe Term Loan is guaranteed, jointly and severally, by Tailored Brands, Inc. and certain of our U.S. subsidiaries and will mature on June 18, 2021. The interest rate on the Term Loan is currently based on the 1-month LIBOR rate, which was approximately 0.78% at January\n28, 2017. However, the Term Loan interest rate is subject to a LIBOR floor of 1% per annum, plus the applicable margin which is currently 3.50%, resulting in a total interest rate of 4.50%. To minimize the impact of changes in interest rates on our interest payments under the Term Loan, in January 2015, we entered into an interest rate swap agreement to swap variable-rate interest payments for fixed-rate interest payments on a notional amount of $520.0 million, effective in February 2015. At January 28, 2017, the notional amount totaled $330.0 million. The interest rate swap agreement matures in August 2018 and has periodic interest settlements. Under this interest rate swap agreement, we receive a floating rate based on the 3-month LIBOR rate and pay a fixed rate of 5.03% (including the applicable margin of 3.50%) on the outstanding notional amount.\nIn April 2015, we entered into Incremental Facility Agreement No. 1 (the Incremental Agreement\u201d) resulting in a refinancing of $400.0 million aggregate principal amount of our Term Loan from a variable rate to a fixed rate of 5.0% per annum. The Incremental Agreement did not impact the total amount borrowed under the Term Loan, the maturity date of the Term Loan of June 18, 2021, or collateral and guarantees under the existing Term Loan.\nAs a result of the interest rate swap and the Incremental Agreement, we have converted a majority of the variable interest rate under the Term Loan to a fixed rate and, as of January 28, 2017, the Term Loan had a weighted average interest rate of 4.90%.\nThe ABL Facility provides for a senior secured revolving credit facility of $500.0 million, with possible future increases to $650.0 million under an expansion feature that matures on June 18, 2019 and is guaranteed, jointly and severally, by Tailored Brands, Inc. and certain of our U.S. subsidiaries. The ABL Facility has several borrowing and interest rate options including the following indices: (i) adjusted LIBOR, (ii) Canadian Dollar Offered Rate, (iii) Canadian prime rate or (iv) an alternate base rate (equal to the greater of the prime rate, the federal funds effective rate plus 0.5% or adjusted LIBOR for a one-month period plus 1.0%). Advances under the ABL Facility bear interest at a rate per annum using the applicable indices plus a varying interest rate margin of up to 2.00%. The ABL Facility also provides for fees applicable to amounts available to be drawn under outstanding letters of credit which range from 1.50% to 2.00%, and a fee on unused commitments which ranges from 0.25% to 0.375%. As of January 28, 2017, there were no borrowings outstanding under the ABL Facility. During fiscal 2016, the maximum borrowing outstanding under the ABL Facility was $68.5 million.\nThe obligations under the Credit Facilities are secured on a senior basis by a first priority lien on substantially all of the assets of the Company, certain of its U.S. subsidiaries and, in the case of the ABL Facility, Moores The Suit People Inc. The Credit Facilities and the related guarantees and security interests granted thereunder are senior secured obligations of, and will rank equally with all present and future senior indebtedness of, the Company, the co-borrowers and the respective guarantors.\nWe utilize letters of credit primarily to secure inventory purchases and as collateral for workers compensation claims. At January 28, 2017, letters of credit totaling approximately $29.4 million were issued and outstanding. Borrowings available under the ABL Facility as of January 28, 2017 were $414.8 million.\nSenior Notes\nThe Senior Notes are guaranteed, jointly and severally, on an unsecured basis by Tailored Brands, Inc. and certain of our U.S. subsidiaries. The Senior Notes and the related guarantees are senior unsecured obligations of the Company and the guarantors, respectively, and will rank equally with all of the Company's and each guarantor's present and future senior indebtedness. The Senior Notes will mature on July 1, 2022. Interest on the Senior Notes are payable on January 1 and July 1 of each year.\nWe may redeem some or all of the Senior Notes at any time on or after July 1, 2017 at the redemption prices set forth in the indenture governing the Senior Notes. At any time prior to July 1, 2017, we will have the option to redeem some or all of the Senior Notes at a redemption price of 100% of the principal amount of the Senior Notes to be redeemed, plus a make-whole\u201d premium and accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the date of redemption. We may also redeem up to a maximum of 35% of the original aggregate principal amount of the Senior Notes with the proceeds of certain equity offerings prior to July 1, 2017 at a redemption price of 107% of the principal amount of the Senior Notes plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any. Upon the occurrence of certain specific changes of control, we may be required to offer to purchase the Senior Notes at 101% of their aggregate principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest thereon to the date of purchase.\nWe had entered into a registration rights agreement regarding the Senior Notes pursuant to which we agreed, among other things, to use our commercially reasonable efforts to consummate an exchange offer of the Senior Notes for substantially identical notes registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, on or before July 13, 2015. On June 24, 2015, the exchange offer was completed.\nCash Provided by Operating Activities\nNet cash provided by operating activities was $242.6 million and $131.7 million for 2016 and 2015, respectively. The $110.9 million increase was driven by changes in other assets related to income tax refunds as well as a decrease in inventory purchases as we normalize inventory levels, particularly at Jos. A. Bank. These favorable impacts were partially offset by lower net earnings, after adjusting for non-cash items including goodwill, intangible and other asset impairment charges and related changes in deferred taxes. In addition, there were unfavorable fluctuations in accounts payable, accrued expenses and other current liabilities primarily due to timing.\nNet cash provided by operating activities was $131.7 million and $94.8 million for 2015 and 2014, respectively. The $36.9 million increase was driven by higher net earnings, after adjusting for non-cash items including goodwill, intangible and other asset impairment charges, partially offset by the impact of working capital items. Unfavorable changes in working capital include an increase in inventories, primarily due to higher inventory levels from lower sales and increased purchases of rental product partially offset by favorable fluctuations in accounts payable, accrued expenses and other current liabilities.\nCash Used in Investing Activities\nNet cash used in investing activities was $99.1 million and $112.9 million for 2016 and 2015, respectively. The $13.8 million decrease was primarily driven by a decrease in capital expenditures in 2016 compared to 2015 primarily due to fewer full line store openings.\nNet cash used in investing activities was $112.9 million and $1,587.7 million for 2015 and 2014, respectively. The $1,474.8 million decrease was primarily driven by the acquisition of Jos. A. Bank in 2014. The increase in capital expenditures in 2015 compared to 2014 was primarily due to integration projects for Jos. A. Bank as well as store remodels, openings and/or relocations.\nCash Used in Financing Activities\nNet cash used in financing activities was $98.8 million and $46.8 million for 2016 and 2015, respectively. The $52.0 million increase primarily reflects the impact of a $35.5 million prepayment on our Term Loan and the repurchase of $25.0 million of our Senior Notes, which were consummated via borrowings on our ABL Facility.\nNet cash used in financing activities was $46.8 million for 2015 compared to net cash provided by financing activities of $1,500.9 million for 2014. The net change of $1,547.7 million was primarily driven by proceeds on our Term Loan and issuance of Senior Notes for the acquisition of Jos. A. Bank in 2014.\nShare repurchase program- In March 2013, the Board approved a share repurchase program for our common stock. At January 28, 2017, the remaining balance available under the authorization was $48.0 million. During fiscal 2016, 2015, and 2014, no shares were repurchased in open market transactions under the Board's authorization.\nDuring fiscal 2015 and 2014, 5,799 and 5,349 shares, respectively, were repurchased in private transactions to satisfy minimum tax withholding obligations arising upon the vesting of certain restricted stock.\nDividends- Cash dividends paid were approximately $35.2 million, $35.0 million and $34.8 million during fiscal 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. In fiscal 2016, 2015 and 2014, a dividend of $0.18 per share was declared in each quarter, for an annual dividend of $0.72 per share, respectively.\nThe quarterly cash dividend of $0.18 per share declared by our Board of Directors (the Board\u201d) in January 2017 is payable on March 24, 2017 to shareholders of record on March 14, 2017 and is included in accrued expenses and other current liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet as of January 28, 2017.\nFuture sources and uses of cash\nOur primary uses of cash are to finance working capital requirements of our operations and to repay our indebtedness. In addition, we will use cash to fund capital expenditures, income taxes, dividend payments, operating leases and various other commitments and obligations, as they arise.\nCapital expenditures are anticipated to be approximately $90.0 million for 2017. This amount includes the anticipated costs to open two Men's Wearhouse stores and to relocate approximately 15 stores, primarily at Men's Wearhouse. The balance of the capital expenditures for 2017 will be used for point-of-sale and other computer equipment and systems, distribution facilities, store remodeling, and investment in other corporate assets.\nAdditionally, market conditions may produce attractive opportunities for us to make acquisitions. Any such acquisitions may be undertaken as an alternative to opening new stores. We may use cash on hand, together with cash flow from operations, borrowings under our Credit Facilities and issuances of debt or equity securities, to take advantage of any acquisition opportunities.\nCurrent and future domestic and global economic conditions could negatively affect our future operating results as well as our existing cash and cash equivalents balances. In addition, conditions in the financial markets could limit our access to further capital resources, if needed, and could increase associated costs. We believe based on our current business plan that our existing cash and cash flows from operations and availability under our ABL Facility will be sufficient to fund our operating cash requirements, repayment of current indebtedness, and capital expenditures.\nContractual Obligations\nAs of January 28, 2017, we are obligated to make cash payments in connection with our long-term debt, non-cancelable operating leases and other contractual obligations in the amounts listed below. In addition, we utilize letters of credit primarily for inventory purchases and as collateral for workers compensation claims. At January 28, 2017, letters of credit totaling approximately $29.4 million were issued and outstanding.\n\n (1) Includes interest payments of $103.5 million within one year, $165.7 million between one and three years, $158.9 million between four and five years and $20.1 million beyond five years, at current interest rates including the impact of our interest rate swap. The payments due by period do not consider amounts which may become payable under the excess cash flow provision of our Term Loan. See Notes 6 and 16 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. \n (2) We lease retail business locations, office and warehouse facilities and equipment under various non-cancelable operating leases. See Note 18 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. \n (3) Other contractual obligations consist primarily of minimum payments under our agreement with Macy's to operate tuxedo shops within Macy's stores, our agreement with Vera Wang that gives us the exclusive right to Black by Vera Wang\u201d tuxedo products, our partnership with Kenneth Cole and our marketing agreement with David's Bridal, Inc. We have included all minimum payments for the complete term of our licensing agreement with Macy's in the table above. However, subject to certain business conditions, we have the ability to terminate the agreement in fiscal 2021 (the midpoint of the term), which would reduce the total amount of minimum payments set forth above by approximately $71.0 million. Pursuant to our marketing agreement with David's Bridal, Inc., there are performance conditions that may impact future payments. These potential future payments are not included in the table above as such amounts are not readily determinable. \n (4) Excluded from the table above is $19.5 million related to uncertain tax positions. These amounts are not included due to our inability to predict the timing of the settlement of these amounts. See Note 7 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. \nIn the normal course of business, we issue purchase orders to suppliers for merchandise. The purchase orders represent executory contracts requiring performance by the suppliers, including the delivery of the merchandise prior to a specified cancellation date and compliance with product specifications, quality standards and other requirements. In the event of the supplier's failure to meet the agreed upon terms and conditions, we may cancel the order.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nOther than the non-cancelable operating leases, other contractual obligations and letters of credit discussed above, we do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that are material to our financial position or results of operations.\nInflation\nWe believe the impact of inflation on the results of operations during the periods presented has been minimal. However, there can be no assurance that our business will not be affected by inflation in the future.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nThe preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires the appropriate application of accounting policies in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. In many instances, this also requires management to make estimates and assumptions about future events that affect the amounts and disclosures included in our financial statements. We base our estimates on historical experience and various assumptions that we believe are reasonable under our current business model. However, because future events and conditions and their effects cannot be determined with certainty, actual results will differ from our estimates and such differences could be material to our financial statements.\nOur accounting policies are described in Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. We consistently apply these policies and periodically evaluate the reasonableness of our estimates in light of actual events. Historically, we have found our accounting policies to be appropriate and our estimates and assumptions reasonable. Our critical accounting policies, which are those most significant to the presentation of our financial position and results of operations and those that require significant judgment or complex estimates by management, are discussed below.\nRevenue Recognition-Clothing product revenue is recognized at the time of sale and delivery of merchandise, net of actual sales returns and a provision for estimated sales returns. For e-commerce sales, revenue is recognized at the time we estimate the customer receives the product, which incorporates shipping terms and estimated delivery times. Revenues from rental, alteration and other services are recognized upon completion of the services. Amounts related to shipping and handling revenues billed to customers are recorded in net sales, and the related shipping and handling costs are recorded in cost of sales.\nWe present all non-income government-assessed taxes (sales, use and value added taxes) collected from our customers and remitted to governmental agencies on a net basis (excluded from net sales) in our consolidated financial statements. The government-assessed taxes are recorded in accrued expenses and other current liabilities until they are remitted to the government agency.\nInventories-Our inventory is carried at the lower of cost and net realizable value. Cost is determined based on the average cost method. Our inventory cost also includes estimated procurement and distribution costs (warehousing, freight, hangers and merchandising costs) associated with the inventory, with the balance of such costs included in cost of sales. Procurement and distribution costs are generally allocated to inventory based on the ratio of annual product purchases to inventory cost. If this ratio were to change significantly, it could materially affect the amount of procurement and distribution costs included in cost of sales. We make assumptions, based primarily on historical experience, as to items in our inventory that may be damaged, obsolete or salable only at marked down prices to reflect the market value of these items. If actual damages, obsolescence or market demand is significantly different from our estimates, additional inventory write-downs could be required.\nImpairment of Long-Lived Assets-Long-lived assets, such as property and equipment and identifiable intangibles with finite useful lives, are periodically evaluated for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. Assets are grouped and evaluated for impairment at the lowest level of which there are identifiable cash flows, which is generally at a store level. Assets are reviewed using factors including, but not limited to, our future operating plans and projected cash flows. The determination of whether impairment has occurred is based on an estimate of undiscounted future cash flows directly related to the assets, compared to the carrying value of the assets. If the sum of the undiscounted future cash flows of the assets does not exceed the carrying value of the assets, full or partial impairment may exist. If the asset carrying amount exceeds its fair value, an impairment charge is recognized in the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the fair value of the asset. Fair value is determined using an income approach, which requires discounting the estimated future cash flows associated with the asset. Estimating future cash flows requires management to make assumptions and to apply judgment, including forecasting future sales, costs and useful lives of assets. Significant judgment is also involved in selecting the appropriate discount rate to be applied in determining the estimated fair value of an asset. Changes to our key assumptions related to future performance, market conditions and other economic factors can significantly affect our impairment evaluation and result in future impairment charges. For example, unanticipated long-term adverse market conditions can cause individual stores to become unprofitable and can result in an impairment charge for the property and equipment assets in those stores. See Notes 1, 3 and 4 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.\nBusiness Combinations-Purchase Price Allocation-For the Jos. A. Bank acquisition, we allocated the purchase price to the various tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed, based on their estimated fair values, which were finalized as of August 1, 2015. Determining the fair value of certain assets and liabilities acquired is subjective in nature and often involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions, which are inherently uncertain. Many of the estimates and assumptions used to determine fair values, such as those used for intangible assets are made based on forecasted information and discount rates. In addition, the judgments made in determining\nthe estimated fair value assigned to each class of assets acquired and liabilities assumed, as well as asset lives, can materially impact our results of operations.\nGoodwill and Other Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets-Goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets are initially recorded at their fair values. Identifiable intangible assets with an indefinite useful life, including goodwill, are not amortized but are evaluated annually as for impairment. A more frequent evaluation is performed if events or circumstances indicate that impairment could have occurred. Such events or circumstances could include, but are not limited to, significant negative industry or economic trends, unanticipated changes in the competitive environment, decisions to significantly modify or dispose of operations and a significant sustained decline in the market price of our stock.\nDuring fiscal 2015, we changed the date of our annual impairment assessment from the last day of our fiscal year to the last day of the second month of our fiscal fourth quarter. The change in date had no impact on our annual impairment test as both the new and old testing dates are within the same fiscal quarter. We changed the assessment date to allow for more time to complete the impairment assessment process before our fiscal year end.\nFor purposes of our goodwill impairment evaluation, the reporting units are our operating segments identified in Note 17 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Goodwill has been assigned to the reporting units based on prior business combinations related to the brands.\nOur goodwill assessment consists of either using a qualitative approach to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of the assets is less than their respective carrying values or a two-step quantitative impairment test, if necessary. In performing the qualitative assessment, we consider many factors in evaluating whether the carrying value of the asset may not be recoverable, including macroeconomic conditions, retail industry considerations, recent financial performance and declines in stock price and market capitalization. In 2016, we applied the qualitative approach to all reporting units, except for the corporate apparel reporting unit.\nIn step one of the quantitative test for our corporate apparel reporting unit, we estimated the fair value of the reporting unit using a combined income and market comparable approach. Our income approach uses projected future cash flows that are discounted using a weighted-average cost of capital analysis that reflects current market conditions. The market comparable approach primarily considers market price multiples of comparable companies and applies those price multiples to certain key drivers of the reporting unit.\nManagement judgment is a significant factor in the goodwill impairment evaluation process. The computations require management to make estimates and assumptions. Actual values may differ significantly from these judgments, particularly if there are significant adverse changes in the operating environment for our reporting units. Critical assumptions that are used as part of these evaluations include:\n \u00b7 The potential future cash flows of the reporting unit. The income approach relies on the timing and estimates of future cash flows. The projections use management's estimates of economic and market conditions over the projected period, including growth rates in revenue, gross margin and expense. The cash flows are based on our most recent business operating plans and various growth rates have been assumed for years beyond the current business plan period. \n \u00b7 Selection of an appropriate discount rate. The income approach requires the selection of an appropriate discount rate, which is based on a weighted-average cost of capital analysis. The discount rate is affected by changes in short-term interest rates and long-term yield as well as variances in the typical capital structure of marketplace participants. Given current economic conditions, it is possible that the discount rate will fluctuate in the near term. The weighted-average cost of capital used to discount the cash flows for the 2016 quantitative test of the corporate apparel reporting unit was 13.0%. \n \u00b7 Selection of comparable companies within the industry. For purposes of the market comparable approach, valuations were determined by calculating average price multiples of relevant key drivers from a group of companies that are comparable to the corporate apparel reporting unit and applying those price multiples to the key drivers of the corporate apparel reporting unit. While the market price multiple is not an assumption, a presumption that it provides an indicator of the value of the reporting unit is inherent in the valuation. The determination of the market comparable also involves a degree of judgment. Earnings multiples used in the market comparable approach ranged from 10.5 to 11.5 for the 2016 analysis. \nAs discussed above, the fair value of the corporate apparel reporting unit in 2016 was determined using a combined income and market comparable approach. We believe these two approaches are appropriate valuation techniques and we generally weight the two values equally as an estimate of reporting unit fair value for the purposes of our impairment testing. However, we may weigh one value more heavily than the other when conditions merit doing so.\nThe goodwill impairment evaluation process requires management to make estimates and assumptions with regard to the fair value of reporting units. Actual values may differ significantly from these judgments, particularly if there are significant adverse changes in the operating environment for our reporting units. Sustained declines in our market capitalization could also increase the risk of goodwill\nimpairment. Such occurrences could result in future goodwill impairment charges that would, in turn, negatively impact our results of operations. However, any such goodwill impairments would be non-cash charges that would not affect our cash flows or compliance with our debt covenants.\nIndefinite-lived intangible assets are not subject to amortization but are reviewed at least annually for impairment. The indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment evaluation is performed by comparing the fair value of the indefinite-lived intangible assets to their carrying values. Similar to the goodwill approach described above, our annual impairment assessment for indefinite-lived intangible assets contemplates the use of either a qualitative approach to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of the assets is less than their respective carrying values or a quantitative impairment test, if necessary.\nThe quantitative impairment test estimates the fair value of an intangible asset based on an income approach using the relief-from-royalty method. This approach is dependent upon a number of factors, including estimates of future growth and trends, royalty rates, discount rates and other variables. We base our fair value estimates on assumptions we believe to be reasonable, but which are unpredictable and inherently uncertain.\nFiscal 2016 Impairment Assessment Results\nAs a result of our annual impairment evaluations, as of January 28, 2017, we believe that none of our goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are impaired and all of our reporting units have fair values that significantly exceed their carrying values and, therefore, no reporting units are currently deemed at risk\u201d for goodwill impairment.\nRental Product-The cost of our rental product is amortized to cost of sales based on the cost of each unit rented, which is estimated based on the number of times the unit is expected to be rented and the average cost of the rental product. Lost, damaged and retired rental product is also charged to cost of sales. Rental product is amortized to expense generally over a four year period. We make assumptions, based primarily on historical experience, as to the number of times each unit can be rented. If the actual number of times a unit can be rented were to vary significantly from our estimates, it could materially affect the amount of rental product amortization included in cost of sales.\nIncome Taxes-Income taxes are accounted for using the asset and liability method. Deferred tax liabilities or assets are established for temporary differences between financial and tax reporting bases and are subsequently adjusted to reflect changes in enacted tax rates expected to be in effect when the temporary differences reverse. The deferred tax assets are reduced, if necessary, by a valuation allowance if the future realization of those tax benefits is not more likely than not.\nSignificant judgment is required in determining the provision for income taxes, related taxes payable and deferred tax assets and liabilities since, in the ordinary course of business, there are transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax outcome is uncertain. Additionally, our tax returns are subject to audit by various domestic and foreign tax authorities that could result in material adjustments or differing interpretations of the tax laws. Although we believe that our estimates are reasonable and are based on the best available information at the time we prepare the provision, actual results could differ from these estimates resulting in a final tax outcome that may be materially different from that which is reflected in our consolidated financial statements.\nThe tax benefit from an uncertain tax position is recognized only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. The tax benefits recognized in the consolidated financial statements from such positions are then measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon settlement. Additionally, interest and/or penalties related to uncertain tax positions are recognized in income tax expense. Significant judgment is required in determining our uncertain tax positions. We have established reserves for uncertain tax positions using our best judgment and adjust these reserves, as warranted, due to changing facts and circumstances. A change in our uncertain tax positions, in any given period, could have a significant impact on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows for that period.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nExcept as discussed in Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, we have considered all new accounting pronouncements and have concluded that there are no new pronouncements that may have a material impact on our results of operations, financial condition, or cash flows, based on current information.", "item_7_tables": "Table 79: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nFiscal Year\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nImpairment of Jos.

It operates retail brands including Men's Wearhouse, Jos. A. Bank, Moores, and K&G. \n\n- In 2016, the company closed 233 stores as part of a store rationalization program, achieved over $60M in cost savings, and stabilized Jos. A. Bank after transitioning away from its historical promotional model. However, retail sales decreased due to soft traffic.\n\n- Net sales decreased 3.4% in 2016 compared to 2015. Comparable sales decreased at all brands except Men's Wearhouse, which was down only 0.6%. \n\n- Gross margin rate increased slightly in 2016 compared to 2015 due to a mix shift towards higher margin rental services revenue. \n\n- SG&A expenses increased as a percentage of sales in 2016 primarily due to restructuring costs, while advertising expenses decreased due to reduced marketing spending.\n\n- There was net income of $25M in 2016 compared to a $1.03B net loss in 2015, which included large goodwill and intangible asset impairment charges.\n\n- Cash from operations increased in 2016 due to tax refunds and lower inventory purchases. Capital expenditures decreased from 2015.\n\n- Long-term debt repayments were made in 2016, but leverage and secured leverage ratios remained above maximums allowed, restricting acquisitions and additional debt.\n\nThe report provides an overview of Tailored Brands' financial performance and liquidity in 2016, a challenging year for retail with lower sales but progress on cost savings initiatives. Performance stabilized after transitioning Jos. A. Bank away from promotions."}
