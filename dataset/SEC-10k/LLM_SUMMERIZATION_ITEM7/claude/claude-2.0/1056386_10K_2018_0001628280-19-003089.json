MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe following discussion should be read in conjunction with the accompanying consolidated financial statements and notes provided under Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\n2018 Highlights\n2018 was a transformative year for our Company. As part of our prior year turnaround plan, we accomplished several critical financial and operating performance objectives:\nTable 119: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>2018 Reported Revenue increase is a combination of organic and acquisition growth, offset by portfolio improvement initiatives and accelerated DC closures;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 120: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>The INAP Sales team is totally rebuilt and active selling larger deals, with overall improved productivity;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 121: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Completed two tuck-in deals in 2018: SingleHop to upgrade Managed Services, and our BofA Data Center in Phoenix to add a new INAP Flagship;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 122: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Margin Expansion continued through best practices / cost rationalization / real estate portfolio management; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 123: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Projects related to the two-year turnaround are completed, with incremental opportunity to always improve cost structure with targeted investments.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOur GAAP net loss attributable to INAP shareholders was $62.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, compared to $45.3 million for the same period in 2017. Our adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (\"EBITDA\") margin, a non-GAAP performance measure, increased 220 basis points to 35.1% for the year ended December 31, 2018, compared to 32.9% for the same period in 2017. We calculate Adjusted EBITDA margin as Adjusted EBITDA, defined below in \"Non-GAAP Financial Measures,\" as a percentage of revenues. We will continue to focus on enhancing margin in 2019 through product mix shift, optimizing our product offerings and other efficiency initiatives.\nFactors Affecting Our Performance\nWe believe all successful IT companies need to compete well in three dimensions: market, product/technology and execution.\nMarket\nWe compete in a large addressable market that is expected to grow at a CAGR of 15% over the next five years and we believe that there is additional growth for the types of products and services we provide. In addition, the market remains fragmented and, given our competitively differentiated products and services, we believe we have an opportunity for growth among a number of different customers. Our ability to take advantage of this market depends, in large part, on effective positioning with our target customers who understand and value the performance capabilities of our offerings. We will continue to market our products and services to customers seeking solutions in our two segments.\nProduct\nAt a high level, there are two primary strategies to successfully compete in the IT infrastructure services market. The first strategy is to compete on scale and low pricing. The second strategy is to compete as a value-added solutions provider with a differentiated and integrated product utilizing proprietary technology. We are pursuing this second strategy. Our high-performance, reliable infrastructure services using proprietary solutions position us to compete with a performance-based value proposition. We continue to prudently invest in innovation through our commitment to research and development, acquisitions, talent acquisition, open source technology, key\ntechnological partnerships and patentable technology to enhance our differentiated high-performance value proposition, in the areas of cloud, hosting and patented IP.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nWe report our consolidated financial statements in accordance with GAAP. We present the non-GAAP performance measures of Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin, discussed above in \"2018 Highlights,\" to assist us in the evaluation of underlying performance trends in our business, which we believe will enhance investors' ability to analyze trends in our business, and the evaluation of our performance relative to other companies. We define Adjusted EBITDA as GAAP net loss plus depreciation and amortization, interest expense; provision for income taxes, other expense (income), (gain) loss on disposals of property and equipment, exit activities, restructuring and impairments, stock-based compensation, non-income tax contingency, strategic alternatives and related costs, organizational realignment costs, claim settlement and acquisition costs. We calculate Adjusted EBITDA margin as Adjusted EBITDA as a percentage of revenues.\nAs a non-GAAP financial measure, Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered in isolation of, or as a substitute for, net loss, income from operations or other GAAP measures as an indicator of operating performance. Our calculation of Adjusted EBITDA may differ from others in our industry and is not necessarily comparable with similar titles used by other companies.\nThe following table reconciles net loss attributable to INAP shareholders as presented in our consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss to Adjusted EBITDA (non-GAAP):\nTable 124: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>

The preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expense and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates, including those summarized below. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances; the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ materially from these estimates.\nIn addition to our significant accounting policies summarized in Note 2 to our accompanying consolidated financial statements, we believe the following policies are the most sensitive to judgments and estimates in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements.\nRevenue Recognition\nWe generate revenues primarily from the sale of data center services, including colocation, hosting and cloud, and IP services. Our revenues typically consist of monthly recurring revenues from contracts with terms of one year or more and we typically recognize the monthly minimum as revenue each month. We recorded installation fees as deferred revenue and recognized the revenue ratably over the estimated customer life, which was approximately five years for 2017 and 2016 before the Company adopted Accounting Standards Update (\"ASU\") No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606) (\"ASC 606\") on January 1, 2018.\nRevenue is recognized to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. The Company enters into contracts that can include various combinations of products and services, which are generally capable of being distinct and accounted for as separate performance obligations.\nThe Company's contracts with customers often include performance obligations to transfer multiple products and services to a customer. Common performance obligations of the Company include delivery of services. Determining whether products and services are considered distinct performance obligations that should be accounted for separately versus together requires significant judgment by the Company.\nA performance obligation is a promise in a contract to transfer a distinct good or service to the customer, and is the unit of account in ASC 606. A contract's transaction price is allocated to each distinct performance obligation and recognized as revenue when, or as, the performance obligation is satisfied. Total transaction price is estimated for impact of variable consideration, such as INAP's service level arrangements, additional usage and late fees, discounts and promotions, and customer care credits. The majority of our contracts have multiple performance obligations, as the promise to transfer individual goods or services is separately identifiable from other promises in the contracts and, therefore, is distinct. For contracts with multiple performance obligations, we allocate the contract's transaction price to each performance obligation based on its relative stand-alone selling price.\nThe stand-alone selling price (\"SSP\") is determined based on observable price. In instances where the SSP is not directly observable, such as when the Company does not sell the product or service separately, INAP determines the SSP using information that may include market conditions and other observable inputs. The Company typically has more than one SSP for individual products and services due to the stratification of those products and services by customers and circumstances. In these instances, the Company may use information such as the size of the customer and geographic region in determining the SSP.\nThe most significant impact of the adoption of the new standard is the requirement for incremental costs to obtain a customer, such as commissions, which previously were expensed as incurred, to be deferred and amortized over the period of contract performance or a longer period if renewals are expected and the renewal commission is not commensurate with the initial commission.\nIn addition, installation revenues are recognized over the initial contract life rather than over the estimated customer life, as they are not significant to the total contract and therefore do not represent a material right.\nMost performance obligations, with the exception of certain sales of equipment or hardware, are satisfied over time as the customer consumes the benefits as we perform. For equipment and hardware sales, the performance obligation is satisfied when control transfers to the customer.\nIn evaluating the treatment of certain contracts, the Company exercised heightened judgment in deferring installation revenue as well as expense fulfillment and commission costs over the appropriate life. With the exception of the revenues noted above, revenue recognition remains materially consistent with historical practice.\nWe routinely review the collectability of our accounts receivable and payment status of our customers. If we determine that collection of revenue is uncertain, we do not recognize revenue until collection is reasonably assured. Additionally, we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments on accounts receivable. We base the allowance for doubtful accounts on our historical write-offs as a percentage of revenue. We assess the payment status of customers by reference to the terms under which we provide services or goods, with any payments not made on or before their due date considered past-due. Once we have exhausted all collection efforts, we write the uncollectible balance off against the allowance for doubtful accounts. We routinely perform credit checks for new and existing customers and require deposits or prepayments for customers that we perceive as being a credit risk. In addition, we record a reserve amount for potential credits to be issued under our service level agreements and other sales adjustments.\nGoodwill and Other Intangible and Long-lived Assets\nOur annual assessment of goodwill for impairment, performed each year on August 1 absent any impairment indicators or other changes that may cause more frequent analysis, includes comparing the fair value of each reporting unit to the carrying value, referred to as \"step one.\" We estimate fair value using a combination of discounted cash flow models and market approaches. If the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying value, goodwill is not impaired and no further testing is necessary. If the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, we record the amount of impairment to goodwill, if any.\nWe base the impairment analysis of goodwill on estimated fair values. Our assumptions, inputs and judgments used in performing the valuation analysis are inherently subjective and reflect estimates based on known facts and circumstances at the time we perform the valuation. These estimates and assumptions primarily include, but are not limited to, discount rates; terminal growth rates; projected revenues and costs; projected EBITDA for expected cash flows; market comparables and capital expenditures forecasts. The use of different assumptions, inputs and judgments, or changes in circumstances, could materially affect the results of the valuation. Due to the inherent uncertainty involved in making these estimates, actual results could differ from our estimates and could result in additional non-cash impairment charges in the future.\nOther intangible assets have finite lives and we record these assets at cost less accumulated amortization. We record amortization of acquired technologies using the greater of (a) the ratio of current revenues to total and anticipated future revenues for the applicable technology or (b) the straight-line method over the remaining estimated useful life. The intangible assets are being amortized over periods which reflect the pattern in which economic benefits of the assets are expected to be realized. We amortize the cost of the acquired technologies and noncompete agreements over their useful lives of 4 to 8 years and 8 to 15 years for trade names. Customer relationships are being amortized on an accelerated basis over their estimated useful life of 10 to 15 years. We assess other intangible assets and long-lived assets on a quarterly basis whenever any events have occurred or circumstances have changed that would indicate impairment could exist. Our assessment is based on estimated future cash flows directly associated with the asset or asset group. If we determine that the carrying value is not recoverable, we may record an impairment charge, reduce the estimated remaining useful life or both.\nProperty and Equipment\nWe carry property and equipment at original acquisition cost less accumulated depreciation and amortization. We calculate depreciation and amortization on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets. Estimated useful lives used for network equipment are generally five years; furniture, equipment and software are three to seven years; and leasehold improvements are the shorter of the lease term or their estimated useful lives. We capitalize additions and improvements that increase the value or extend the life of an asset. We expense maintenance and repairs as incurred. We charge gains or losses from disposals of property and equipment to operations.\nExit Activities and Restructuring\nWhen circumstances warrant, we may elect to exit certain business activities or change the manner in which we conduct ongoing operations. If we make such a change, we will estimate the costs to exit a business, location, service contract or restructure ongoing operations. The components of the estimates may include estimates and assumptions regarding the timing and costs of future events and activities that represent our best expectations based on known facts and circumstances at the time of estimation. If circumstances warrant, we will adjust our previous estimates to reflect what we then believe to be a more accurate representation of expected future costs. Because our estimates and assumptions regarding exit activities and restructuring charges include probabilities of future events, such as our ability to find a sublease tenant within a reasonable period of time or the rate at which a sublease tenant will pay for the available space, such estimates are inherently vulnerable to changes due to unforeseen circumstances that could materially and adversely affect our results of operations. We monitor market conditions at each period end reporting date and will continue to assess our key assumptions and estimates used in the calculation of our exit activities and restructuring accrual.\nIncome Taxes\nWe recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. We measure the tax benefits recognized in our accompanying consolidated financial statements from such a position based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon settlement. We recognize interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions as part of the provision for income taxes and we accrue such items beginning in the period that such interest and penalties would be applicable under relevant tax law until such time that we recognize the related tax benefits.\nWe maintain a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to their estimated realizable value. Although we consider the potential for future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance, if we determine we would be able to realize our deferred tax assets in the future in excess of our net recorded amount, an adjustment to reduce the valuation allowance would increase net income in the period we made such determination. We may recognize deferred tax assets in future periods if and when we estimate them to be realizable and supported by historical trends of profitability and expectations of future profits within each tax jurisdiction.\nBased on an analysis of our historic and projected future U.S. pre-tax income, we do not have sufficient positive evidence to expect a release of our valuation allowance against our U.S. deferred tax assets currently or within the next 12 months; therefore, we continue to maintain the full valuation allowance in the U.S.\nBased on an analysis of the past 12 quarters and projected future pre-tax income, we concluded that there is no longer sufficient positive evidence to support U.K.'s deferred tax assets position. Therefore, we established a full valuation allowance against U.K. deferred tax assets in 2015. U.K. continues to have a full valuation allowance against deferred tax assets in 2018.\nBased on an analysis of our sources of future taxable income and all positive and negative evidence, we concluded in 2018 that there was no longer sufficient positive evidence to support the realization of Germany's net deferred tax assets. Therefore, we established a full valuation allowance against Germany's net deferred tax assets in 2018.\nWe reached the same conclusion regarding our foreign jurisdictions, other than Canada and the Netherlands. Accordingly, we continue to maintain the full valuation allowance against of net deferred tax assets in all foreign jurisdictions, other than Canada and the Netherlands.\nStock-Based Compensation\nWe measure stock-based compensation cost at the grant date based on the calculated fair value of the award. We recognize the expense over the employee's requisite service period, generally the vesting period of the award. The fair value of restricted stock is the market value on the date of grant. The fair value of stock options is estimated at the grant date using the Black-Scholes option pricing model with weighted average assumptions for the activity under our stock plans. Option pricing model input assumptions, such as expected term, expected volatility and risk-free interest rate, impact the fair value estimate. Further, the forfeiture rate impacts the amount of aggregate compensation. These assumptions are subjective and generally require significant analysis and judgment to develop.\nThe expected term represents the weighted average period of time that we expect granted options to be outstanding, considering the vesting schedules and our historical exercise patterns. Because our options are not publicly traded, we assume volatility based on the historical volatility of our stock. The risk-free interest rate is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant for periods corresponding to the expected option term. We have also used historical data to estimate option exercises, employee termination and stock option forfeiture rates. Changes in any of these assumptions could materially impact our results of operations in the period the change is made.\nCapitalized Software Costs\nWe capitalize internal-use software development costs incurred during the application development stage. Amortization begins once the software is ready for its intended use and is computed based on the straight-line method over the economic life. Judgment is required in determining which software projects are capitalized and the resulting economic life.\nWe capitalize certain costs associated with software to be sold. Capitalized costs include all costs incurred to produce the software or the purchase price paid for a master copy of the software that will be sold. Internally incurred costs to develop software are expensed when incurred as research and development costs until technological feasibility is established.\nResults of Operations\nThe following table

Costs of network, sales and services do not include compensation, depreciation or amortization.\nCosts of Customer Support\nCosts of customer support consist primarily of compensation and other personnel costs for employees engaged in connecting customers to our network, installing customer equipment into POPs facilities and servicing customers through our NOCs. In addition, direct costs of customer support include facilities costs associated with the NOCs, including costs related to servicing our data center customers.\nSales, General and Administrative\nSales, general and administrative costs consist primarily of costs related to sales and marketing, compensation and other expense for executive, finance, product development, human resources and administrative personnel, professional fees and other general corporate costs.\nSegment Information\nEffective January 1, 2018, as further described in Note 10 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements, we operate in two business segments: INAP US and INAP INTL.

We view costs of sales and services as generally less-controllable, external costs and we regularly monitor the margin of revenues in excess of these direct costs. We also view the costs of customer support to be an important component of costs of revenues, but believe that the costs of customer support are more within our control and, to some degree, discretionary in that we can adjust those costs by managing personnel needs. We also have excluded depreciation and amortization from segment profit because it is based on estimated useful lives of tangible and intangible assets. Further, we base depreciation and amortization on historical costs incurred to build out our deployed network and the historical costs of these assets may not be indicative of current or future capital expenditures.\nYears Ended December 31, 2018 and 2017\nINAP US\nRevenues for our INAP US segment increased 15.0%, to $248.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, compared to $215.8 million for the same period in 2017. The increase was primarily due to the acquisition of SingleHop and the initiation of organic growth contributed by the new salesforce offset by data center exits.\nCosts of our INAP US segment, exclusive of depreciation and amortization, decreased 2.9%, to $80.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, compared to $83.0 million for the same period in 2017. The decrease was primarily due to $10.8 million of lower costs related to data center exits, conversion of operating to capital leases, lower variable costs related to revenue decline, and on-going cost reduction efforts. Offsetting those decreases were $8.4 million of increases primarily due to the SingleHop and data center acquisitions.\nINAP INTL\nRevenues for our INAP INTL segment increased 6.5% to $69.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, compared to $64.9 million for the same period in 2017. The increase of $4.3 million is primarily due to the consolidation of INAP Japan and the SingleHop acquisition partially offset by a slight decline in small business revenue.\nCosts of our INAP INTL segment, exclusive of depreciation and amortization, increased 15.0%, to $26.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, compared to $23.2 million for the same period in 2017. The increase of $3.5 million was primarily due to the consolidation of INAP Japan and the SingleHop acquisition as well as the acquisition of new data center space.\nGeographic Information\nRevenues are allocated to countries based on location of services.

Total compensation and benefits, including stock-based compensation, was $65.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, compared to $58.0 million for the same period in 2017. The increase was primarily due to the addition of SingleHop employees resulting in $6.0 million increase in cash-based compensation and payroll taxes, $1.7 million increase in stock-based compensation, and $0.6 million increase in bonus accrual, offset by $1.3 million decrease in commissions.\nStock-based compensation, net of amount capitalized for internal software, increased to $4.7 million during the year ended December 31, 2018, from $3.0 million during the same period in 2017 primarily due to the addition of SingleHop employees. The following table summarizes stock-based compensation included in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss (in thousands):\nTable 135: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Customer support\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>165\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>167\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Sales, general and administrative\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,513\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,873\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>4,678\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,040\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nCosts of Customer Support. Costs of customer support increased to $32.5 million during the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to $25.8 million during the same period in 2017. The increase was due to $6.7 million of wages and payroll taxes primarily due to the addition of SingleHop employees.\nSales, General and Administrative. Sales, general and administrative costs increased to $75.4 million during the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to $62.7 million during the same period in 2017. The increase of $12.7 million was primarily due to the SingleHop acquisition consisting of higher compensation of $3.5 million, $2.5 million of increased acquisition costs, $1.9 million increase primarily due to channel partner commissions, $1.7 million increase in stock-based compensation, $0.9 million increase in facility expenses, $0.8 million decrease in internal software costs that were capitalized (resulting in increased compensation costs in \"Sales, general and administrative\" expenses), $0.6 million increase in bonus expense and $0.8 million increase in other miscellaneous expenses.\nDepreciation and Amortization. Depreciation and amortization increased to $90.7 million during the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to $75.0 million during the same period in 2017. The increase is primarily due to higher capital purchases and capital leases entered during the year ended December 31, 2018.\nGoodwill Impairment. There was no goodwill impairment during the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017.\nExit activities, Restructuring and Impairments. Exit activities, restructuring and impairments decreased to $5.4 million during the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to $6.2 million during the same period in 2017. The decrease is primarily due to higher restructuring expenses due to closures of data centers in the prior year.\nInterest Expense. Interest expense increased to $68.1 million during the year ended December 31, 2018 from $50.5 million during the same period in 2017. The increase is primarily due to entering into the new incremental $135.0 million term loan facility and new capital leases entered during the year ended December 31, 2018.\nProvision for Income Taxes. Provision for income taxes increased to $0.7 million during the year ended December 31, 2018 from $0.3 million during the same period in 2017. The increase was primarily due to the consolidation of INAP Japan in 2018 and an increase in our unrecognized tax benefits.\nYears Ended December 31, 2017 and 2016\nINAP US\nRevenues for our INAP US segment decreased 8.6%, to $215.8 million for the years ended December 31, 2017, compared to $229.9 million for the same period in 2016. The decrease was primarily due to lower network services revenue related to downward pricing pressures and a decrease in colocation and managed hosting revenue due to loss of revenue from data center exits.\nCosts of our INAP US segment, exclusive of depreciation and amortization, decreased 15.7%, to $83.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to $98.5 million for the same period in 2016. The decrease of $15.5 million was primarily due to lower expenses related to conversion of operating to capital leases, a data center exit, lower variable costs related to the decline in revenue, and on-going cost reduction efforts.\nINAP INTL\nRevenues for our INAP INTL segment decreased 5.0% to $64.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to $68.4 million for the same period in 2016. The decrease of $3.5 million was primarily due to colocation and cloud services revenue churn from a small number of large customers partially offset by the increase from the consolidation of INAP Japan.\nCosts of our INAP INTL segment, exclusive of depreciation and amortization, decreased 9.8%, to $23.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to $25.7 million for the same period in 2016. The decrease of $2.5 million was primarily due to lower variable costs related to the decline in revenue partially offset by the increase from the consolidation of INAP Japan.\nOther Operating Costs and Expenses\nCompensation. Total compensation and benefits, including stock-based compensation, was $58.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to $66.3 million for the same period in 2016. The change was primarily due to $8.2 million decrease in cash-based compensation and payroll taxes, $2.0 million decrease in stock-based compensation, $0.8 million decrease in sales commissions, $0.5 million decrease in insurance benefit costs, partially offset by $1.8 million increase in bonus accrual and $1.6 million decrease in software costs that were capitalized (resulting in increased compensation costs).\nStock-based compensation, net of amount capitalized, decreased to $3.0 million during the year ended December 31, 2017, from $5.0 million during the same period in 2016. The decrease is primarily due to lower stock-based compensation from prior year terminations. The following table summarizes stock-based compensation included in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss (in thousands):\nTable 136: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Costs of customer support\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>167\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,159\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Sales, general and administrative\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,873\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,838\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,040\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>4,997\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nCosts of Customer Support. Costs of customer support decreased to $25.8 million during the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to $32.2 million during the same period in 2016. The decrease was primarily due to $4.9 million of lower cash-based compensation from\nreduced headcount, $1.1 million decrease in facilities costs and $1.0 million decrease in stock-based compensation, offset by $1.0 million increase in bonus accrual.\nSales, General and Administrative. Sales, general and administrative costs decreased to $62.7 million during the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to $70.6 million during the same period in 2016. The decrease is primarily due to the following: $4.7 million decrease in organizational realignment costs, $3.3 million decrease in cash-based compensation from reduced headcount, $1.1 million decrease in office administration costs, $1.0 million decrease in stock-based compensation, $0.9 million decrease in sales commissions, $0.8 million decrease in tax costs, and $0.6 million decrease in insurance benefit costs, partially offset by $1.9 million increase in facilities costs, $1.6 million decrease in software costs that were capitalized (resulting in increased compensation costs in SG&A), $0.8 million increase in bonus accrual, $0.6 million in settlement costs and $0.4 million in acquisition costs.\nDepreciation and Amortization. Depreciation and amortization decreased slightly to $75.0 million during the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to $76.9 million during the same period in 2016. The decrease is primarily due to lower capital purchases and older assets becoming fully depreciated during 2017.\nGoodwill Impairment. There was no goodwill impairment during the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to an impairment charge of $80.1 million during the same period in 2016.\nExit activities, Restructuring and Impairments. Exit activities, restructuring and impairments decreased to $6.2 million during the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to $7.2 million during the same period in 2016. The decrease is primarily due a non-recurring software impairment charge during 2016.\nInterest Expense. Interest expense increased to $50.5 million during the year ended December 31, 2017 from $30.9 million during the same period in 2016. The increase is primarily due to additional expense related to the modification and extinguishment of debt issuance costs of the previous term loan plus costs related to the new term loan and additional interest expense related to new capital leases.\nProvision for Income Taxes. Provision for income taxes decreased to $0.3 million during the year ended December 31, 2017 from $0.5 million during the same period in 2016. The decrease was primarily due to the tax benefit related to our alternative minimum tax credit becoming refundable due to the newly enacted tax reform and offset by the positive operational improvement in some of our foreign operations.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nNew Credit Agreement\nOn April 6, 2017, we entered into a new Credit Agreement (the \"2017 Credit Agreement\"), which provides for a $300.0 million term loan facility (\"2017 term loan\") and a $25.0 million revolving credit facility (the \"2017 revolving credit facility\"). The proceeds of the 2017 term loan were used to refinance the Company's existing credit facility and to pay costs and expenses associated with the 2017 Credit Agreement.\nCertain portions of the refinancing transaction were considered an extinguishment of debt and certain portions were considered a modification. A total of $5.7 million was paid for debt issuance costs related to the 2017 Credit Agreement. Of the $5.7 million in costs paid, $1.9 million related to the exchange of debt and was expensed, $3.3 million related to 2017 term loan third party costs and will be amortized over the 2017 term loan and $0.4 million prepaid debt issuance costs related to the 2017 revolving credit facility and will be amortized over the term of the 2017 revolving credit facility. In addition, $4.8 million of debt discount and debt issuance costs related to the previous credit facility were expensed due to the extinguishment of that credit facility. The maturity date of the 2017 term loan is April 6, 2022 and the maturity date of the 2017 revolving credit facility is October 6, 2021. As of December 31, 2018, the balance and interest rate of the 2017 term loan were $415.6 million and 8.2%, respectively. The 2017 revolving credit facility had no balance outstanding at December 31, 2018.\nBorrowings under the 2017 Credit Agreement bear interest at a rate per annum equal to an applicable margin plus, at our option, a base rate or an adjusted LIBOR rate. The applicable margin for loans under the 2017 revolving credit facility is 6.0% for loans bearing interest calculated using the base rate (\"Base Rate Loans\") and 7.0% for loans bearing interest calculated using the adjusted LIBOR rate. The applicable margin for loans under the 2017 term loan is 4.75% for Base Rate Loans and 5.75% for adjusted LIBOR rate loans. The base rate is equal to the highest of (a) the adjusted U.S. Prime Lending Rate as published in the Wall Street Journal, (b) with respect to term loans issued on the closing date, 2.00%, (c) the federal funds effective rate from time to time, plus 0.50%, and (d) the adjusted LIBOR rate, as defined below, for a one-month interest period, plus 1.00%. The adjusted LIBOR rate is equal to the rate per annum (adjusted for statutory reserve requirements for Eurocurrency liabilities) at which Eurodollar deposits are offered in the interbank Eurodollar market\nfor the applicable interest period (one, two, three or six months), as quoted on Reuters screen LIBOR (or any successor page or service). The financing commitments of the lenders extending the 2017 revolving credit facility are subject to various conditions, as set forth in the 2017 Credit Agreement. As of December 31, 2018, the Company has been in compliance with all covenants.\nFirst Amendment\nOn June 28, 2017, the Company entered into an amendment to the 2017 Credit Agreement (\"First Amendment\"), by and among the Company, each of the lenders party thereto, and Jefferies Finance LLC, as Administrative Agent. The First Amendment clarified that for all purposes the Company's liabilities pursuant to any lease that was treated as rental and lease expense, and not as a capital lease obligation or indebtedness on the closing date of the 2017 Credit Agreement, would continue to be treated as a rental and lease expense, and not as a capital lease obligations or indebtedness, for all purposes of the 2017 Credit Agreement, notwithstanding any amendment of the lease that results in the treatment of such lease as a capital lease obligation or indebtedness for financial reporting purposes.\nThe table below sets forth information with respect to the current financial covenants as well as the calculation of our performance in relation to the covenant requirements at December 31, 2018.\nTable 137: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Covenants Requirements\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Ratios at December 31, 2018\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Maximum Total Net Leverage Ratio (the ratio of Consolidated Indebtedness to Consolidated EBITDA as defined in the Second Amendment to the 2017 Credit Agreement) should be equal to or less than:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5.9(1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Maximum Consolidated Interest Coverage Ratio (the ratio of Consolidated EBITDA to Consolidated Interest Expense as defined in the Second Amendment to the 2017 Credit Agreement) should be equal to or greater than:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.0(2)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 138: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(1)\n</td> <td>The maximum total leverage ratio decreases to 5.9 to 1 as of March 31, 2019 - June 30, 2019, 5.5 to 1 as of September 30, 2019 - March 31, 2020, 5.25 to 1 as of June 30, 2020 - September 30, 2020, 4.75 to 1 as of December 31, 2020 - June 30, 2021 and 4.5 to 1 as of September 30, 2021 and thereafter.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 139: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(2)\n</td> <td>The minimum consolidated interest coverage ratio increases to 2.00 to 1 as of March 31, 2019 - September 30, 2020, and 2.25 to 1 December 31, 2020 - September 30, 2021 and thereafter.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nSecond Amendment\nOn February 6, 2018, the Company, the Lenders party thereto and Jefferies Finance LLC, as Administrative Agent, entered into a Second Amendment to Credit Agreement (the \"Second Amendment\") that amended the 2017 Credit Agreement.\nThe Second Amendment, among other things, amends the 2017 Credit Agreement to (i) permit the Company to incur incremental term loans under the 2017 Credit Agreement of up to $135.0 million to finance the Company's acquisition of SingleHop and to pay related fees, costs and expenses, and (ii) revise the maximum total net leverage ratio and minimum consolidated interest coverage ratio covenants. The financial covenant amendments became effective upon the consummation of the SingleHop acquisition, while the other provisions of the Second Amendment became effective upon the execution and delivery of the Second Amendment. This transaction was considered a modification.\nA total of $1.0 million was paid for debt issuance costs related to the Second Amendment. Of the $1.0 million in costs paid, $0.2 million related to the payment of legal and professional fees which were expensed, $0.8 million related to term loan lender fees and will be amortized over the term of the 2017 Credit Agreement.\nThird Amendment\nOn February 28, 2018, INAP entered into the Incremental and Third Amendment to the Credit Agreement among the Company, the Lenders party thereto and Jefferies Finance LLC, as Administrative Agent (the \"Third Amendment\"). The Third Amendment provides for a funding of the new incremental term loan facility under the 2017 Credit Agreement of $135.0 million (the \"Incremental Term Loan\"). The Incremental Term Loan has terms and conditions identical to the existing loans under the 2017 Credit Agreement, as amended. Proceeds of the Incremental Term Loan were used to complete the acquisition of SingleHop and to pay fees, costs and expenses related to the acquisition, the Third Amendment and the Incremental Term Loan. This transaction was considered a modification.\nA total of $5.0 million was paid for debt issuance costs related to the Third Amendment. Of the $5.0 million in costs paid, $0.1 million related to the payment of legal and professional fees which were expensed, $4.9 million related to term loan lender fees and will be amortized over the term of the 2017 Credit Agreement.\nFourth Amendment\nOn April 9, 2018, the Company entered into the Fourth Amendment to 2017 Credit Agreement, among the Company, the Lenders party thereto and Jefferies Finance LLC, as Administrative Agent (the \"Fourth Amendment\"). The Fourth Amendment amends the 2017 Credit Agreement to lower the interest rate margins applicable to the outstanding term loans under the 2017 Credit Agreement by 1.25%. This transaction was considered a modification.\nA total of $1.7 million was paid for debt issuance costs related to the Fourth Amendment. Of the $1.7 million in costs paid, $0.1 million related to the payment of legal and professional fees which were expensed, $1.6 million related to term loan lender fees and will be amortized over the term of the 2017 Credit Agreement.\nFifth Amendment\nOn August 28, 2018, the Company entered into the Fifth Amendment to 2017 Credit Agreement, among the Company, the Lenders party thereto and Jefferies Finance LLC, as Administrative Agent (the \"Fifth Amendment\"). The Fifth Amendment amended the 2017 Credit Agreement by increasing the aggregate revolving commitment capacity by $10.0 million to $35.0 million.\nRefer to Note 9 in our accompanying consolidated financial statements for additional information about our credit agreement.\nEquity\nOn October 23, 2018, the Company closed a public offering of 4,210,527 shares of common stock at $9.50 per share to the public and received net proceeds of approximately $37.1 million (net of underwriting discounts and commissions, and other offering expenses).\nOn February 22, 2017, we entered into a securities purchase agreement (the \"Securities Purchase Agreement\") with certain purchasers (the \"Purchasers\"), pursuant to which we issued to the Purchasers an aggregate of 5,950,712 shares of our common stock at a price of $7.24 per share, for the aggregate purchase price of $43.1 million, which closed on February 27, 2017.\nOn November 16, 2017, the Company amended its certificate of incorporation to effect a 1-for-4 reverse stock split of the shares of the Company's common stock, par value $0.001 per share. This reverse stock split became effective as of the close of business on November 20, 2017. As a result of the reverse stock split, every four shares of issued and outstanding common stock were automatically combined into one issued and outstanding share of common stock, without any change in the par value per share. Any fractional shares that would otherwise have resulted from the reverse stock split were paid in cash in a proportionate amount based on the closing price of on the effective date of the reverse stock split. The reverse stock split reduced the number of shares of common stock outstanding from 83.4 million shares to approximately 20.9 million shares, subject to adjustment for the payment of cash in lieu of fractional shares. The number of authorized shares were reduced in the following manner: (i) Common Stock from 200 million shares to 50 million shares, and (ii) Preferred Stock from 20 million shares to 5 million shares. Accordingly, the authorized, issued and outstanding shares, stock options disclosures, net loss per share, and other per share disclosures for all periods presented have been retrospectively adjusted to reflect the impact of this reverse stock split.\nGeneral - Sources and Uses of Capital\nOn an ongoing basis, we require capital to fund our current operations, expand our IT infrastructure services, upgrade existing facilities or establish new facilities, products, services or capabilities and to fund customer support initiatives, as well as various advertising and marketing programs to facilitate sales. As of December 31, 2018, we had $30.7 million of borrowing capacity net of letters of credit of $4.3 million under our 2017 revolving credit facility. Together with our cash and cash equivalents, the Company's liquidity as of December 31, 2018 was $48.5 million. On February 22, 2019, we drew down $5.0 million on our 2017 revolving credit facility.\nAs of December 31, 2018, we had a deficit of $5.9 million in working capital, which represented an excess of current liabilities over current assets. We believe that cash flows from operations, together with our cash and cash equivalents and borrowing capacity under our 2017 revolving credit facility, will be sufficient to meet our cash requirements for the next 12 months and for the foreseeable future. If our cash requirements vary materially from our expectations or if we fail to generate sufficient cash flows from our operations or if we fail to implement our cost reduction strategies, we may require additional financing sooner than anticipated. We can offer no assurance that we will be able to obtain additional financing on commercially favorable terms, or at all, and provisions in our 2017 Credit Agreement limit our ability to incur additional indebtedness. Our anticipated uses of cash include capital expenditures in the range of $40.0 to $50.0 million in 2019, working capital needs and required payments on our credit agreement and other commitments.\nWe have a history of quarterly and annual period net losses. During the year ended December 31, 2018, we had a net loss attributable to INAP stockholders of $62.5 million. As of December 31, 2018, our accumulated deficit was $1.4 billion. We may not be able to achieve profitability on a quarterly basis, and our failure to do so may adversely affect our business, including our ability to raise additional funds.\nOur sources of capital include, but are not limited to, funds derived from selling our services and results of our operations, sales of assets, borrowings under our credit arrangement, the issuance of debt or equity securities or other possible recapitalization transactions. Our short term and long term liquidity depend primarily upon the funds derived from selling our services, working capital management (cash, accounts receivable, accounts payable and other liabilities), bank borrowings, reducing costs and bookings net of churn. In an effort to increase liquidity and generate cash, we may pursue sales of non-strategic assets, reduce our expenses, reduce capital expenditures, amend our credit facility, pursue sales of debt or equity securities or other recapitalization transactions, or seek other external sources of funds.\nCapital Leases. Our future minimum lease payments on all remaining capital lease obligations at December 31, 2018 were $271.5 million. We summarize our existing capital lease obligations in Note 9 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements.\nCommitments and Other Obligations. We have commitments and other obligations that are contractual in nature and will represent a use of cash in the future unless the agreements are modified. Service and purchase commitments primarily relate to IP, telecommunications and data center services. Our ability to improve cash provided by operations in the future would be negatively impacted if we do not grow our business at a rate that would allow us to offset the purchase and service commitments with corresponding revenue growth.\nThe following table summarizes our commitments and other obligations as of December 31, 2018 (in thousands):\nTable 140: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Payments Due by Period\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2020-2021\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2022-2023\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Thereafter\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Current Credit Agreement:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Term loan, including interest\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>543,937\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>39,946\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>78,903\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>425,088\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Capital lease obligations, including interest\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>800,602\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>34,719\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>68,795\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>66,515\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>630,573\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Exit activities and restructuring\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,601\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,526\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>75\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Asset retirement obligation\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,384\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,384\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating lease commitments\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>39,484\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7,980\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>15,232\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12,515\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,757\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Service and purchase commitments\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6,447\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,981\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,362\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>104\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,396,455\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>89,152\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>165,367\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>504,222\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>637,714\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nCash Flows\nOperating Activities\nYear Ended December 31, 2018. Net cash provided by operating activities during the year ended December 31, 2018 was $34.6 million. We generated cash from operations of $44.3 million, while changes in operating assets and liabilities used cash from operations of $9.7 million. We expect to use cash flows from operating activities to fund a portion of our capital expenditures and other requirements and to meet our other commitments and obligations, including outstanding debt.\nYear Ended December 31, 2017. Net cash provided by operating activities during the year ended December 31, 2017 was $41.7 million.

Net cash provided by operating activities during the year ended December 31, 2016 was $48.2 million. We generated cash from operations of $47.1 million, while changes in operating assets and liabilities generated cash from operations of $1.1 million.\nInvesting Activities\nYear Ended December 31, 2018. Net cash used in investing activities during the year ended December 31, 2018 was $174.0 million, primarily due to capital expenditures and acquisition of SingleHop. These capital expenditures were related to the continued expansion and upgrade of our company-controlled data centers and network infrastructure.\nYear Ended December 31, 2017. Net cash used in investing activities during the year ended December 31, 2017 was $32.2 million, primarily due to capital expenditures.

These capital expenditures were related to the continued expansion and upgrade of our company-controlled data centers and network infrastructure.\nFinancing Activities\nYear Ended December 31, 2018. Net cash provided by financing activities during the year ended December 31, 2018 was $142.7 million, primarily due to $35.3 million of payments on our credit facility and capital lease obligations, partially offset by $148.5 million of proceeds from the 2017 Credit Agreement and approximately $37.1 million of net proceeds from the sale of common stock pursuant to a public offering.\nYear Ended December 31, 2017. Net cash used in financing activities during the year ended December 31, 2017 was $5.5 million, primarily due to $349.6 million of principal payments on the credit facilities and capital lease obligations, partially offset by $316.9 million of proceeds from the 2017 Credit Agreement and $40.2 million proceeds from the sale of common stock pursuant to the Securities Purchase Agreement.\nYear Ended December 31, 2016.

Other than our operating leases, we do not engage in off-balance sheet financial arrangements.", "item_7_truncated": "ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe following discussion should be read in conjunction with the accompanying consolidated financial statements and notes provided under Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\n2018 Highlights\n2018 was a transformative year for our Company. As part of our prior year turnaround plan, we accomplished several critical financial and operating performance objectives:\n \u2022 2018 Reported Revenue increase is a combination of organic and acquisition growth, offset by portfolio improvement initiatives and accelerated DC closures; \n \u2022 The INAP Sales team is totally rebuilt and active selling larger deals, with overall improved productivity; \n \u2022 Completed two tuck-in deals in 2018: SingleHop to upgrade Managed Services, and our BofA Data Center in Phoenix to add a new INAP Flagship; \n \u2022 Margin Expansion continued through best practices / cost rationalization / real estate portfolio management; and \n \u2022 Projects related to the two-year turnaround are completed, with incremental opportunity to always improve cost structure with targeted investments. \nOur GAAP net loss attributable to INAP shareholders was $62.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, compared to $45.3 million for the same period in 2017. Our adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (\"EBITDA\") margin, a non-GAAP performance measure, increased 220 basis points to 35.1% for the year ended December 31, 2018, compared to 32.9% for the same period in 2017. We calculate Adjusted EBITDA margin as Adjusted EBITDA, defined below in \"Non-GAAP Financial Measures,\" as a percentage of revenues. We will continue to focus on enhancing margin in 2019 through product mix shift, optimizing our product offerings and other efficiency initiatives.\nFactors Affecting Our Performance\nWe believe all successful IT companies need to compete well in three dimensions: market, product/technology and execution.\nMarket\nWe compete in a large addressable market that is expected to grow at a CAGR of 15% over the next five years and we believe that there is additional growth for the types of products and services we provide. In addition, the market remains fragmented and, given our competitively differentiated products and services, we believe we have an opportunity for growth among a number of different customers. Our ability to take advantage of this market depends, in large part, on effective positioning with our target customers who understand and value the performance capabilities of our offerings. We will continue to market our products and services to customers seeking solutions in our two segments.\nProduct\nAt a high level, there are two primary strategies to successfully compete in the IT infrastructure services market. The first strategy is to compete on scale and low pricing. The second strategy is to compete as a value-added solutions provider with a differentiated and integrated product utilizing proprietary technology. We are pursuing this second strategy. Our high-performance, reliable infrastructure services using proprietary solutions position us to compete with a performance-based value proposition. We continue to prudently invest in innovation through our commitment to research and development, acquisitions, talent acquisition, open source technology, key\ntechnological partnerships and patentable technology to enhance our differentiated high-performance value proposition, in the areas of cloud, hosting and patented IP.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nWe report our consolidated financial statements in accordance with GAAP. We present the non-GAAP performance measures of Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin, discussed above in \"2018 Highlights,\" to assist us in the evaluation of underlying performance trends in our business, which we believe will enhance investors' ability to analyze trends in our business, and the evaluation of our performance relative to other companies. We define Adjusted EBITDA as GAAP net loss plus depreciation and amortization, interest expense; provision for income taxes, other expense (income), (gain) loss on disposals of property and equipment, exit activities, restructuring and impairments, stock-based compensation, non-income tax contingency, strategic alternatives and related costs, organizational realignment costs, claim settlement and acquisition costs. We calculate Adjusted EBITDA margin as Adjusted EBITDA as a percentage of revenues.\nAs a non-GAAP financial measure, Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered in isolation of, or as a substitute for, net loss, income from operations or other GAAP measures as an indicator of operating performance. Our calculation of Adjusted EBITDA may differ from others in our industry and is not necessarily comparable with similar titles used by other companies.\nThe following table reconciles net loss attributable to INAP shareholders as presented in our consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss to Adjusted EBITDA (non-GAAP):\nTable 124: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>

The preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expense and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates, including those summarized below. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances; the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ materially from these estimates.\nIn addition to our significant accounting policies summarized in Note 2 to our accompanying consolidated financial statements, we believe the following policies are the most sensitive to judgments and estimates in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements.\nRevenue Recognition\nWe generate revenues primarily from the sale of data center services, including colocation, hosting and cloud, and IP services. Our revenues typically consist of monthly recurring revenues from contracts with terms of one year or more and we typically recognize the monthly minimum as revenue each month. We recorded installation fees as deferred revenue and recognized the revenue ratably over the estimated customer life, which was approximately five years for 2017 and 2016 before the Company adopted Accounting Standards Update (\"ASU\") No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606) (\"ASC 606\") on January 1, 2018.\nRevenue is recognized to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. The Company enters into contracts that can include various combinations of products and services, which are generally capable of being distinct and accounted for as separate performance obligations.\nThe Company's contracts with customers often include performance obligations to transfer multiple products and services to a customer. Common performance obligations of the Company include delivery of services. Determining whether products and services are considered distinct performance obligations that should be accounted for separately versus together requires significant judgment by the Company.\nA performance obligation is a promise in a contract to transfer a distinct good or service to the customer, and is the unit of account in ASC 606. A contract's transaction price is allocated to each distinct performance obligation and recognized as revenue when, or as, the performance obligation is satisfied. Total transaction price is estimated for impact of variable consideration, such as INAP's service level arrangements, additional usage and late fees, discounts and promotions, and customer care credits. The majority of our contracts have multiple performance obligations, as the promise to transfer individual goods or services is separately identifiable from other promises in the contracts and, therefore, is distinct. For contracts with multiple performance obligations, we allocate the contract's transaction price to each performance obligation based on its relative stand-alone selling price.\nThe stand-alone selling price (\"SSP\") is determined based on observable price. In instances where the SSP is not directly observable, such as when the Company does not sell the product or service separately, INAP determines the SSP using information that may include market conditions and other observable inputs. The Company typically has more than one SSP for individual products and services due to the stratification of those products and services by customers and circumstances. In these instances, the Company may use information such as the size of the customer and geographic region in determining the SSP.\nThe most significant impact of the adoption of the new standard is the requirement for incremental costs to obtain a customer, such as commissions, which previously were expensed as incurred, to be deferred and amortized over the period of contract performance or a longer period if renewals are expected and the renewal commission is not commensurate with the initial commission.\nIn addition, installation revenues are recognized over the initial contract life rather than over the estimated customer life, as they are not significant to the total contract and therefore do not represent a material right.\nMost performance obligations, with the exception of certain sales of equipment or hardware, are satisfied over time as the customer consumes the benefits as we perform. For equipment and hardware sales, the performance obligation is satisfied when control transfers to the customer.\nIn evaluating the treatment of certain contracts, the Company exercised heightened judgment in deferring installation revenue as well as expense fulfillment and commission costs over the appropriate life. With the exception of the revenues noted above, revenue recognition remains materially consistent with historical practice.\nWe routinely review the collectability of our accounts receivable and payment status of our customers. If we determine that collection of revenue is uncertain, we do not recognize revenue until collection is reasonably assured. Additionally, we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments on accounts receivable. We base the allowance for doubtful accounts on our historical write-offs as a percentage of revenue. We assess the payment status of customers by reference to the terms under which we provide services or goods, with any payments not made on or before their due date considered past-due. Once we have exhausted all collection efforts, we write the uncollectible balance off against the allowance for doubtful accounts. We routinely perform credit checks for new and existing customers and require deposits or prepayments for customers that we perceive as being a credit risk. In addition, we record a reserve amount for potential credits to be issued under our service level agreements and other sales adjustments.\nGoodwill and Other Intangible and Long-lived Assets\nOur annual assessment of goodwill for impairment, performed each year on August 1 absent any impairment indicators or other changes that may cause more frequent analysis, includes comparing the fair value of each reporting unit to the carrying value, referred to as \"step one.\" We estimate fair value using a combination of discounted cash flow models and market approaches. If the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying value, goodwill is not impaired and no further testing is necessary. If the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, we record the amount of impairment to goodwill, if any.\nWe base the impairment analysis of goodwill on estimated fair values. Our assumptions, inputs and judgments used in performing the valuation analysis are inherently subjective and reflect estimates based on known facts and circumstances at the time we perform the valuation. These estimates and assumptions primarily include, but are not limited to, discount rates; terminal growth rates; projected revenues and costs; projected EBITDA for expected cash flows; market comparables and capital expenditures forecasts. The use of different assumptions, inputs and judgments, or changes in circumstances, could materially affect the results of the valuation. Due to the inherent uncertainty involved in making these estimates, actual results could differ from our estimates and could result in additional non-cash impairment charges in the future.\nOther intangible assets have finite lives and we record these assets at cost less accumulated amortization. We record amortization of acquired technologies using the greater of (a) the ratio of current revenues to total and anticipated future revenues for the applicable technology or (b) the straight-line method over the remaining estimated useful life. The intangible assets are being amortized over periods which reflect the pattern in which economic benefits of the assets are expected to be realized. We amortize the cost of the acquired technologies and noncompete agreements over their useful lives of 4 to 8 years and 8 to 15 years for trade names. Customer relationships are being amortized on an accelerated basis over their estimated useful life of 10 to 15 years. We assess other intangible assets and long-lived assets on a quarterly basis whenever any events have occurred or circumstances have changed that would indicate impairment could exist. Our assessment is based on estimated future cash flows directly associated with the asset or asset group. If we determine that the carrying value is not recoverable, we may record an impairment charge, reduce the estimated remaining useful life or both.\nProperty and Equipment\nWe carry property and equipment at original acquisition cost less accumulated depreciation and amortization. We calculate depreciation and amortization on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets. Estimated useful lives used for network equipment are generally five years; furniture, equipment and software are three to seven years; and leasehold improvements are the shorter of the lease term or their estimated useful lives. We capitalize additions and improvements that increase the value or extend the life of an asset. We expense maintenance and repairs as incurred. We charge gains or losses from disposals of property and equipment to operations.\nExit Activities and Restructuring\nWhen circumstances warrant, we may elect to exit certain business activities or change the manner in which we conduct ongoing operations. If we make such a change, we will estimate the costs to exit a business, location, service contract or restructure ongoing operations. The components of the estimates may include estimates and assumptions regarding the timing and costs of future events and activities that represent our best expectations based on known facts and circumstances at the time of estimation. If circumstances warrant, we will adjust our previous estimates to reflect what we then believe to be a more accurate representation of expected future costs. Because our estimates and assumptions regarding exit activities and restructuring charges include probabilities of future events, such as our ability to find a sublease tenant within a reasonable period of time or the rate at which a sublease tenant will pay for the available space, such estimates are inherently vulnerable to changes due to unforeseen circumstances that could materially and adversely affect our results of operations. We monitor market conditions at each period end reporting date and will continue to assess our key assumptions and estimates used in the calculation of our exit activities and restructuring accrual.\nIncome Taxes\nWe recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. We measure the tax benefits recognized in our accompanying consolidated financial statements from such a position based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon settlement. We recognize interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions as part of the provision for income taxes and we accrue such items beginning in the period that such interest and penalties would be applicable under relevant tax law until such time that we recognize the related tax benefits.\nWe maintain a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to their estimated realizable value. Although we consider the potential for future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance, if we determine we would be able to realize our deferred tax assets in the future in excess of our net recorded amount, an adjustment to reduce the valuation allowance would increase net income in the period we made such determination. We may recognize deferred tax assets in future periods if and when we estimate them to be realizable and supported by historical trends of profitability and expectations of future profits within each tax jurisdiction.\nBased on an analysis of our historic and projected future U.S. pre-tax income, we do not have sufficient positive evidence to expect a release of our valuation allowance against our U.S. deferred tax assets currently or within the next 12 months; therefore, we continue to maintain the full valuation allowance in the U.S.\nBased on an analysis of the past 12 quarters and projected future pre-tax income, we concluded that there is no longer sufficient positive evidence to support U.K.'s deferred tax assets position. Therefore, we established a full valuation allowance against U.K. deferred tax assets in 2015. U.K. continues to have a full valuation allowance against deferred tax assets in 2018.\nBased on an analysis of our sources of future taxable income and all positive and negative evidence, we concluded in 2018 that there was no longer sufficient positive evidence to support the realization of Germany's net deferred tax assets. Therefore, we established a full valuation allowance against Germany's net deferred tax assets in 2018.\nWe reached the same conclusion regarding our foreign jurisdictions, other than Canada and the Netherlands. Accordingly, we continue to maintain the full valuation allowance against of net deferred tax assets in all foreign jurisdictions, other than Canada and the Netherlands.\nStock-Based Compensation\nWe measure stock-based compensation cost at the grant date based on the calculated fair value of the award. We recognize the expense over the employee's requisite service period, generally the vesting period of the award. The fair value of restricted stock is the market value on the date of grant. The fair value of stock options is estimated at the grant date using the Black-Scholes option pricing model with weighted average assumptions for the activity under our stock plans. Option pricing model input assumptions, such as expected term, expected volatility and risk-free interest rate, impact the fair value estimate. Further, the forfeiture rate impacts the amount of aggregate compensation. These assumptions are subjective and generally require significant analysis and judgment to develop.\nThe expected term represents the weighted average period of time that we expect granted options to be outstanding, considering the vesting schedules and our historical exercise patterns. Because our options are not publicly traded, we assume volatility based on the historical volatility of our stock. The risk-free interest rate is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant for periods corresponding to the expected option term. We have also used historical data to estimate option exercises, employee termination and stock option forfeiture rates. Changes in any of these assumptions could materially impact our results of operations in the period the change is made.\nCapitalized Software Costs\nWe capitalize internal-use software development costs incurred during the application development stage. Amortization begins once the software is ready for its intended use and is computed based on the straight-line method over the economic life. Judgment is required in determining which software projects are capitalized and the resulting economic life.\nWe capitalize certain costs associated with software to be sold. Capitalized costs include all costs incurred to produce the software or the purchase price paid for a master copy of the software that will be sold. Internally incurred costs to develop software are expensed when incurred as research and development costs until technological feasibility is established.\nResults of Operations\nThe following table

In addition, direct costs of customer support include facilities costs associated with the NOCs, including costs related to servicing our data center customers.\nSales, General and Administrative\nSales, general and administrative costs consist primarily of costs related to sales and marketing, compensation and other expense for executive, finance, product development, human resources and administrative personnel, professional fees and other general corporate costs.\nSegment Information\nEffective January 1, 2018, as further described in Note 10 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements, we operate in two business segments: INAP US and INAP INTL. Segment results for each of the three years ended December 31, 2018 are summarized as follows (in thousands):\nTable 133: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Revenues:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>INAP US\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>248,184\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>215,770\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>229,902\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>INAP INTL\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>69,189\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>64,948\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>68,395\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net revenues\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>317,373\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>280,718\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>298,297\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Costs of sales and services, customer support and sales and marketing:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>INAP US\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>134,792\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>128,062\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>148,706\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>INAP INTL\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>45,124\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>37,829\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>41,900\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total costs of sales and services, customer support and sales and marketing\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>179,916\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>165,891\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>190,606\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Segment profit:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>INAP US\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>113,392\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>87,708\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>81,196\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>INAP INTL\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>24,065\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>27,119\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>26,495\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total segment profit\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>137,457\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>114,827\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>107,691\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Goodwill impairment\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>80,105\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Exit activities, restructuring and impairments\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5,406\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6,249\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7,236\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other operating expenses, including sales, general and administrative and depreciation and amortization expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>125,895\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>103,804\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>113,420\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Income (loss) from operations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6,156\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,774\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(93,070\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Non-operating expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>67,874\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>51,001\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>31,312\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Loss before income taxes and equity in earnings of equity-method investment\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(61,718\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(46,227\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(124,382\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nSegment profit is calculated as segment revenues less costs of sales and services, customer support and sales and marketing. We view costs of sales and services as generally less-controllable, external costs and we regularly monitor the margin of revenues in excess of these direct costs. We also view the costs of customer support to be an important component of costs of revenues, but believe that the costs of customer support are more within our control and, to some degree, discretionary in that we can adjust those costs by managing personnel needs. We also have excluded depreciation and amortization from segment profit because it is based on estimated useful lives of tangible and intangible assets. Further, we base depreciation and amortization on historical costs incurred to build out our deployed network and the historical costs of these assets may not be indicative of current or future capital expenditures.\nYears Ended December 31, 2018 and 2017\nINAP US\nRevenues for our INAP US segment increased 15.0%, to $248.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, compared to $215.8 million for the same period in 2017. The increase was primarily due to the acquisition of SingleHop and the initiation of organic growth contributed by the new salesforce offset by data center exits.\nCosts of our INAP US segment, exclusive of depreciation and amortization, decreased 2.9%, to $80.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, compared to $83.0 million for the same period in 2017. The decrease was primarily due to $10.8 million of lower costs related to data center exits, conversion of operating to capital leases, lower variable costs related to revenue decline, and on-going cost reduction efforts. Offsetting those decreases were $8.4 million of increases primarily due to the SingleHop and data center acquisitions.\nINAP INTL\nRevenues for our INAP INTL segment increased 6.5% to $69.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, compared to $64.9 million for the same period in 2017. The increase of $4.3 million is primarily due to the consolidation of INAP Japan and the SingleHop acquisition partially offset by a slight decline in small business revenue.\nCosts of our INAP INTL segment, exclusive of depreciation and amortization, increased 15.0%, to $26.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, compared to $23.2 million for the same period in 2017. The increase of $3.5 million was primarily due to the consolidation of INAP Japan and the SingleHop acquisition as well as the acquisition of new data center space.\nGeographic Information\nRevenues are allocated to countries based on location of services. Revenues, by country with revenues over 10% of total revenues, are as follows (in thousands):\nTable 134: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>United States\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>252,482\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>220,018\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Canada\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>38,133\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>38,750\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>26,758\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>21,950\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>317,373\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>280,718\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOther Operating Costs and Expenses\nCompensation. Total compensation and benefits, including stock-based compensation, was $65.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, compared to $58.0 million for the same period in 2017. The increase was primarily due to the addition of SingleHop employees resulting in $6.0 million increase in cash-based compensation and payroll taxes, $1.7 million increase in stock-based compensation, and $0.6 million increase in bonus accrual, offset by $1.3 million decrease in commissions.\nStock-based compensation, net of amount capitalized for internal software, increased to $4.7 million during the year ended December 31, 2018, from $3.0 million during the same period in 2017 primarily due to the addition of SingleHop employees. The following table summarizes stock-based compensation included in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss (in thousands):\nTable 135: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Customer support\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>165\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>167\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Sales, general and administrative\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,513\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,873\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>4,678\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,040\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nCosts of Customer Support. Costs of customer support increased to $32.5 million during the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to $25.8 million during the same period in 2017. The increase was due to $6.7 million of wages and payroll taxes primarily due to the addition of SingleHop employees.\nSales, General and Administrative. Sales, general and administrative costs increased to $75.4 million during the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to $62.7 million during the same period in 2017. The increase of $12.7 million was primarily due to the SingleHop acquisition consisting of higher compensation of $3.5 million, $2.5 million of increased acquisition costs, $1.9 million increase primarily due to channel partner commissions, $1.7 million increase in stock-based compensation, $0.9 million increase in facility expenses, $0.8 million decrease in internal software costs that were capitalized (resulting in increased compensation costs in \"Sales, general and administrative\" expenses), $0.6 million increase in bonus expense and $0.8 million increase in other miscellaneous expenses.\nDepreciation and Amortization. Depreciation and amortization increased to $90.7 million during the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to $75.0 million during the same period in 2017. The increase is primarily due to higher capital purchases and capital leases entered during the year ended December 31, 2018.\nGoodwill Impairment. There was no goodwill impairment during the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017.\nExit activities, Restructuring and Impairments. Exit activities, restructuring and impairments decreased to $5.4 million during the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to $6.2 million during the same period in 2017. The decrease is primarily due to higher restructuring expenses due to closures of data centers in the prior year.\nInterest Expense. Interest expense increased to $68.1 million during the year ended December 31, 2018 from $50.5 million during the same period in 2017. The increase is primarily due to entering into the new incremental $135.0 million term loan facility and new capital leases entered during the year ended December 31, 2018.\nProvision for Income Taxes. Provision for income taxes increased to $0.7 million during the year ended December 31, 2018 from $0.3 million during the same period in 2017. The increase was primarily due to the consolidation of INAP Japan in 2018 and an increase in our unrecognized tax benefits.\nYears Ended December 31, 2017 and 2016\nINAP US\nRevenues for our INAP US segment decreased 8.6%, to $215.8 million for the years ended December 31, 2017, compared to $229.9 million for the same period in 2016. The decrease was primarily due to lower network services revenue related to downward pricing pressures and a decrease in colocation and managed hosting revenue due to loss of revenue from data center exits.\nCosts of our INAP US segment, exclusive of depreciation and amortization, decreased 15.7%, to $83.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to $98.5 million for the same period in 2016. The decrease of $15.5 million was primarily due to lower expenses related to conversion of operating to capital leases, a data center exit, lower variable costs related to the decline in revenue, and on-going cost reduction efforts.\nINAP INTL\nRevenues for our INAP INTL segment decreased 5.0% to $64.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to $68.4 million for the same period in 2016. The decrease of $3.5 million was primarily due to colocation and cloud services revenue churn from a small number of large customers partially offset by the increase from the consolidation of INAP Japan.\nCosts of our INAP INTL segment, exclusive of depreciation and amortization, decreased 9.8%, to $23.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to $25.7 million for the same period in 2016. The decrease of $2.5 million was primarily due to lower variable costs related to the decline in revenue partially offset by the increase from the consolidation of INAP Japan.\nOther Operating Costs and Expenses\nCompensation. Total compensation and benefits, including stock-based compensation, was $58.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to $66.3 million for the same period in 2016. The change was primarily due to $8.2 million decrease in cash-based compensation and payroll taxes, $2.0 million decrease in stock-based compensation, $0.8 million decrease in sales commissions, $0.5 million decrease in insurance benefit costs, partially offset by $1.8 million increase in bonus accrual and $1.6 million decrease in software costs that were capitalized (resulting in increased compensation costs).\nStock-based compensation, net of amount capitalized, decreased to $3.0 million during the year ended December 31, 2017, from $5.0 million during the same period in 2016. The decrease is primarily due to lower stock-based compensation from prior year terminations. The following table summarizes stock-based compensation included in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss (in thousands):\nTable 136: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Costs of customer support\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>167\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,159\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Sales, general and administrative\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,873\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,838\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,040\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>4,997\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nCosts of Customer Support. Costs of customer support decreased to $25.8 million during the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to $32.2 million during the same period in 2016. The decrease was primarily due to $4.9 million of lower cash-based compensation from\nreduced headcount, $1.1 million decrease in facilities costs and $1.0 million decrease in stock-based compensation, offset by $1.0 million increase in bonus accrual.\nSales, General and Administrative. Sales, general and administrative costs decreased to $62.7 million during the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to $70.6 million during the same period in 2016. The decrease is primarily due to the following: $4.7 million decrease in organizational realignment costs, $3.3 million decrease in cash-based compensation from reduced headcount, $1.1 million decrease in office administration costs, $1.0 million decrease in stock-based compensation, $0.9 million decrease in sales commissions, $0.8 million decrease in tax costs, and $0.6 million decrease in insurance benefit costs, partially offset by $1.9 million increase in facilities costs, $1.6 million decrease in software costs that were capitalized (resulting in increased compensation costs in SG&A), $0.8 million increase in bonus accrual, $0.6 million in settlement costs and $0.4 million in acquisition costs.\nDepreciation and Amortization. Depreciation and amortization decreased slightly to $75.0 million during the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to $76.9 million during the same period in 2016. The decrease is primarily due to lower capital purchases and older assets becoming fully depreciated during 2017.\nGoodwill Impairment. There was no goodwill impairment during the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to an impairment charge of $80.1 million during the same period in 2016.\nExit activities, Restructuring and Impairments. Exit activities, restructuring and impairments decreased to $6.2 million during the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to $7.2 million during the same period in 2016. The decrease is primarily due a non-recurring software impairment charge during 2016.\nInterest Expense. Interest expense increased to $50.5 million during the year ended December 31, 2017 from $30.9 million during the same period in 2016. The increase is primarily due to additional expense related to the modification and extinguishment of debt issuance costs of the previous term loan plus costs related to the new term loan and additional interest expense related to new capital leases.\nProvision for Income Taxes. Provision for income taxes decreased to $0.3 million during the year ended December 31, 2017 from $0.5 million during the same period in 2016. The decrease was primarily due to the tax benefit related to our alternative minimum tax credit becoming refundable due to the newly enacted tax reform and offset by the positive operational improvement in some of our foreign operations.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nNew Credit Agreement\nOn April 6, 2017, we entered into a new Credit Agreement (the \"2017 Credit Agreement\"), which provides for a $300.0 million term loan facility (\"2017 term loan\") and a $25.0 million revolving credit facility (the \"2017 revolving credit facility\"). The proceeds of the 2017 term loan were used to refinance the Company's existing credit facility and to pay costs and expenses associated with the 2017 Credit Agreement.\nCertain portions of the refinancing transaction were considered an extinguishment of debt and certain portions were considered a modification. A total of $5.7 million was paid for debt issuance costs related to the 2017 Credit Agreement. Of the $5.7 million in costs paid, $1.9 million related to the exchange of debt and was expensed, $3.3 million related to 2017 term loan third party costs and will be amortized over the 2017 term loan and $0.4 million prepaid debt issuance costs related to the 2017 revolving credit facility and will be amortized over the term of the 2017 revolving credit facility. In addition, $4.8 million of debt discount and debt issuance costs related to the previous credit facility were expensed due to the extinguishment of that credit facility. The maturity date of the 2017 term loan is April 6, 2022 and the maturity date of the 2017 revolving credit facility is October 6, 2021. As of December 31, 2018, the balance and interest rate of the 2017 term loan were $415.6 million and 8.2%, respectively. The 2017 revolving credit facility had no balance outstanding at December 31, 2018.\nBorrowings under the 2017 Credit Agreement bear interest at a rate per annum equal to an applicable margin plus, at our option, a base rate or an adjusted LIBOR rate. The applicable margin for loans under the 2017 revolving credit facility is 6.0% for loans bearing interest calculated using the base rate (\"Base Rate Loans\") and 7.0% for loans bearing interest calculated using the adjusted LIBOR rate. The applicable margin for loans under the 2017 term loan is 4.75% for Base Rate Loans and 5.75% for adjusted LIBOR rate loans. The base rate is equal to the highest of (a) the adjusted U.S. Prime Lending Rate as published in the Wall Street Journal, (b) with respect to term loans issued on the closing date, 2.00%, (c) the federal funds effective rate from time to time, plus 0.50%, and (d) the adjusted LIBOR rate, as defined below, for a one-month interest period, plus 1.00%. The adjusted LIBOR rate is equal to the rate per annum (adjusted for statutory reserve requirements for Eurocurrency liabilities) at which Eurodollar deposits are offered in the interbank Eurodollar market\nfor the applicable interest period (one, two, three or six months), as quoted on Reuters screen LIBOR (or any successor page or service). The financing commitments of the lenders extending the 2017 revolving credit facility are subject to various conditions, as set forth in the 2017 Credit Agreement. As of December 31, 2018, the Company has been in compliance with all covenants.\nFirst Amendment\nOn June 28, 2017, the Company entered into an amendment to the 2017 Credit Agreement (\"First Amendment\"), by and among the Company, each of the lenders party thereto, and Jefferies Finance LLC, as Administrative Agent. The First Amendment clarified that for all purposes the Company's liabilities pursuant to any lease that was treated as rental and lease expense, and not as a capital lease obligation or indebtedness on the closing date of the 2017 Credit Agreement, would continue to be treated as a rental and lease expense, and not as a capital lease obligations or indebtedness, for all purposes of the 2017 Credit Agreement, notwithstanding any amendment of the lease that results in the treatment of such lease as a capital lease obligation or indebtedness for financial reporting purposes.\nThe table below sets forth information with respect to the current financial covenants as well as the calculation of our performance in relation to the covenant requirements at December 31, 2018.\nTable 137: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Covenants Requirements\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Ratios at December 31, 2018\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Maximum Total Net Leverage Ratio (the ratio of Consolidated Indebtedness to Consolidated EBITDA as defined in the Second Amendment to the 2017 Credit Agreement) should be equal to or less than:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5.9(1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Maximum Consolidated Interest Coverage Ratio (the ratio of Consolidated EBITDA to Consolidated Interest Expense as defined in the Second Amendment to the 2017 Credit Agreement) should be equal to or greater than:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.0(2)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n (1) The maximum total leverage ratio decreases to 5.9 to 1 as of March 31, 2019 - June 30, 2019, 5.5 to 1 as of September 30, 2019 - March 31, 2020, 5.25 to 1 as of June 30, 2020 - September 30, 2020, 4.75 to 1 as of December 31, 2020 - June 30, 2021 and 4.5 to 1 as of September 30, 2021 and thereafter. \n (2) The minimum consolidated interest coverage ratio increases to 2.00 to 1 as of March 31, 2019 - September 30, 2020, and 2.25 to 1 December 31, 2020 - September 30, 2021 and thereafter. \nSecond Amendment\nOn February 6, 2018, the Company, the Lenders party thereto and Jefferies Finance LLC, as Administrative Agent, entered into a Second Amendment to Credit Agreement (the \"Second Amendment\") that amended the 2017 Credit Agreement.\nThe Second Amendment, among other things, amends the 2017 Credit Agreement to (i) permit the Company to incur incremental term loans under the 2017 Credit Agreement of up to $135.0 million to finance the Company's acquisition of SingleHop and to pay related fees, costs and expenses, and (ii) revise the maximum total net leverage ratio and minimum consolidated interest coverage ratio covenants. The financial covenant amendments became effective upon the consummation of the SingleHop acquisition, while the other provisions of the Second Amendment became effective upon the execution and delivery of the Second Amendment. This transaction was considered a modification.\nA total of $1.0 million was paid for debt issuance costs related to the Second Amendment. Of the $1.0 million in costs paid, $0.2 million related to the payment of legal and professional fees which were expensed, $0.8 million related to term loan lender fees and will be amortized over the term of the 2017 Credit Agreement.\nThird Amendment\nOn February 28, 2018, INAP entered into the Incremental and Third Amendment to the Credit Agreement among the Company, the Lenders party thereto and Jefferies Finance LLC, as Administrative Agent (the \"Third Amendment\"). The Third Amendment provides for a funding of the new incremental term loan facility under the 2017 Credit Agreement of $135.0 million (the \"Incremental Term Loan\"). The Incremental Term Loan has terms and conditions identical to the existing loans under the 2017 Credit Agreement, as amended. Proceeds of the Incremental Term Loan were used to complete the acquisition of SingleHop and to pay fees, costs and expenses related to the acquisition, the Third Amendment and the Incremental Term Loan. This transaction was considered a modification.\nA total of $5.0 million was paid for debt issuance costs related to the Third Amendment. Of the $5.0 million in costs paid, $0.1 million related to the payment of legal and professional fees which were expensed, $4.9 million related to term loan lender fees and will be amortized over the term of the 2017 Credit Agreement.\nFourth Amendment\nOn April 9, 2018, the Company entered into the Fourth Amendment to 2017 Credit Agreement, among the Company, the Lenders party thereto and Jefferies Finance LLC, as Administrative Agent (the \"Fourth Amendment\"). The Fourth Amendment amends the 2017 Credit Agreement to lower the interest rate margins applicable to the outstanding term loans under the 2017 Credit Agreement by 1.25%. This transaction was considered a modification.\nA total of $1.7 million was paid for debt issuance costs related to the Fourth Amendment. Of the $1.7 million in costs paid, $0.1 million related to the payment of legal and professional fees which were expensed, $1.6 million related to term loan lender fees and will be amortized over the term of the 2017 Credit Agreement.\nFifth Amendment\nOn August 28, 2018, the Company entered into the Fifth Amendment to 2017 Credit Agreement, among the Company, the Lenders party thereto and Jefferies Finance LLC, as Administrative Agent (the \"Fifth Amendment\"). The Fifth Amendment amended the 2017 Credit Agreement by increasing the aggregate revolving commitment capacity by $10.0 million to $35.0 million.\nRefer to Note 9 in our accompanying consolidated financial statements for additional information about our credit agreement.\nEquity\nOn October 23, 2018, the Company closed a public offering of 4,210,527 shares of common stock at $9.50 per share to the public and received net proceeds of approximately $37.1 million (net of underwriting discounts and commissions, and other offering expenses).\nOn February 22, 2017, we entered into a securities purchase agreement (the \"Securities Purchase Agreement\") with certain purchasers (the \"Purchasers\"), pursuant to which we issued to the Purchasers an aggregate of 5,950,712 shares of our common stock at a price of $7.24 per share, for the aggregate purchase price of $43.1 million, which closed on February 27, 2017.\nOn November 16, 2017, the Company amended its certificate of incorporation to effect a 1-for-4 reverse stock split of the shares of the Company's common stock, par value $0.001 per share. This reverse stock split became effective as of the close of business on November 20, 2017. As a result of the reverse stock split, every four shares of issued and outstanding common stock were automatically combined into one issued and outstanding share of common stock, without any change in the par value per share. Any fractional shares that would otherwise have resulted from the reverse stock split were paid in cash in a proportionate amount based on the closing price of on the effective date of the reverse stock split. The reverse stock split reduced the number of shares of common stock outstanding from 83.4 million shares to approximately 20.9 million shares, subject to adjustment for the payment of cash in lieu of fractional shares. The number of authorized shares were reduced in the following manner: (i) Common Stock from 200 million shares to 50 million shares, and (ii) Preferred Stock from 20 million shares to 5 million shares. Accordingly, the authorized, issued and outstanding shares, stock options disclosures, net loss per share, and other per share disclosures for all periods presented have been retrospectively adjusted to reflect the impact of this reverse stock split.\nGeneral - Sources and Uses of Capital\nOn an ongoing basis, we require capital to fund our current operations, expand our IT infrastructure services, upgrade existing facilities or establish new facilities, products, services or capabilities and to fund customer support initiatives, as well as various advertising and marketing programs to facilitate sales. As of December 31, 2018, we had $30.7 million of borrowing capacity net of letters of credit of $4.3 million under our 2017 revolving credit facility. Together with our cash and cash equivalents, the Company's liquidity as of December 31, 2018 was $48.5 million. On February 22, 2019, we drew down $5.0 million on our 2017 revolving credit facility.\nAs of December 31, 2018, we had a deficit of $5.9 million in working capital, which represented an excess of current liabilities over current assets. We believe that cash flows from operations, together with our cash and cash equivalents and borrowing capacity under our 2017 revolving credit facility, will be sufficient to meet our cash requirements for the next 12 months and for the foreseeable future. If our cash requirements vary materially from our expectations or if we fail to generate sufficient cash flows from our operations or if we fail to implement our cost reduction strategies, we may require additional financing sooner than anticipated. We can offer no assurance that we will be able to obtain additional financing on commercially favorable terms, or at all, and provisions in our 2017 Credit Agreement limit our ability to incur additional indebtedness. Our anticipated uses of cash include capital expenditures in the range of $40.0 to $50.0 million in 2019, working capital needs and required payments on our credit agreement and other commitments.\nWe have a history of quarterly and annual period net losses. During the year ended December 31, 2018, we had a net loss attributable to INAP stockholders of $62.5 million. As of December 31, 2018, our accumulated deficit was $1.4 billion. We may not be able to achieve profitability on a quarterly basis, and our failure to do so may adversely affect our business, including our ability to raise additional funds.\nOur sources of capital include, but are not limited to, funds derived from selling our services and results of our operations, sales of assets, borrowings under our credit arrangement, the issuance of debt or equity securities or other possible recapitalization transactions. Our short term and long term liquidity depend primarily upon the funds derived from selling our services, working capital management (cash, accounts receivable, accounts payable and other liabilities), bank borrowings, reducing costs and bookings net of churn. In an effort to increase liquidity and generate cash, we may pursue sales of non-strategic assets, reduce our expenses, reduce capital expenditures, amend our credit facility, pursue sales of debt or equity securities or other recapitalization transactions, or seek other external sources of funds.\nCapital Leases. Our future minimum lease payments on all remaining capital lease obligations at December 31, 2018 were $271.5 million. We summarize our existing capital lease obligations in Note 9 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements.\nCommitments and Other Obligations. We have commitments and other obligations that are contractual in nature and will represent a use of cash in the future unless the agreements are modified. Service and purchase commitments primarily relate to IP, telecommunications and data center services. Our ability to improve cash provided by operations in the future would be negatively impacted if we do not grow our business at a rate that would allow us to offset the purchase and service commitments with corresponding revenue growth.\nThe following table summarizes our commitments and other obligations as of December 31, 2018 (in thousands):\nTable 140: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Payments Due by Period\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2020-2021\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2022-2023\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Thereafter\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Current Credit Agreement:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Term loan, including interest\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>543,937\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>39,946\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>78,903\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>425,088\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Capital lease obligations, including interest\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>800,602\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>34,719\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>68,795\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>66,515\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>630,573\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Exit activities and restructuring\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,601\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,526\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>75\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Asset retirement obligation\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,384\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,384\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating lease commitments\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>39,484\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7,980\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>15,232\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12,515\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,757\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Service and purchase commitments\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6,447\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,981\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,362\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>104\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,396,455\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>89,152\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>165,367\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>504,222\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>637,714\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nCash Flows\nOperating Activities\nYear Ended December 31, 2018. Net cash provided by operating activities during the year ended December 31, 2018 was $34.6 million. We generated cash from operations of $44.3 million, while changes in operating assets and liabilities used cash from operations of $9.7 million. We expect to use cash flows from operating activities to fund a portion of our capital expenditures and other requirements and to meet our other commitments and obligations, including outstanding debt.\nYear Ended December 31, 2017. Net cash provided by operating activities during the year ended December 31, 2017 was $41.7 million. We generated cash from operations of $45.9 million, while changes in operating assets and liabilities used cash from operations of $4.2 million.\nYear Ended December 31, 2016. Net cash provided by operating activities during the year ended December 31, 2016 was $48.2 million. We generated cash from operations of $47.1 million, while changes in operating assets and liabilities generated cash from operations of $1.1 million.\nInvesting Activities\nYear Ended December 31, 2018. Net cash used in investing activities during the year ended December 31, 2018 was $174.0 million, primarily due to capital expenditures and acquisition of SingleHop. These capital expenditures were related to the continued expansion and upgrade of our company-controlled data centers and network infrastructure.\nYear Ended December 31, 2017. Net cash used in investing activities during the year ended December 31, 2017 was $32.2 million, primarily due to capital expenditures. These capital expenditures were related to the continued expansion and upgrade of our company-controlled data centers and network infrastructure.\nYear Ended December 31, 2016. Net cash used in investing activities during the year ended December 31, 2016 was $45.7 million, primarily due to capital expenditures. These capital expenditures were related to the continued expansion and upgrade of our company-controlled data centers and network infrastructure.\nFinancing Activities\nYear Ended December 31, 2018. Net cash provided by financing activities during the year ended December 31, 2018 was $142.7 million, primarily due to $35.3 million of payments on our credit facility and capital lease obligations, partially offset by $148.5 million of proceeds from the 2017 Credit Agreement and approximately $37.1 million of net proceeds from the sale of common stock pursuant to a public offering.\nYear Ended December 31, 2017. Net cash used in financing activities during the year ended December 31, 2017 was $5.5 million, primarily due to $349.6 million of principal payments on the credit facilities and capital lease obligations, partially offset by $316.9 million of proceeds from the 2017 Credit Agreement and $40.2 million proceeds from the sale of common stock pursuant to the Securities Purchase Agreement.\nYear Ended December 31, 2016. Net cash used in financing activities during the year ended December 31, 2016 was $9.8 million, primarily due to $4.5 million of proceeds received from the revolving credit facility, partially offset by principal payments of $12.5 million on our credit agreement and capital lease obligations.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nAs of December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, we did not have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships, such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities, which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes. Other than our operating leases, we do not engage in off-balance sheet financial arrangements.", "item_7_text": "ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe following discussion should be read in conjunction with the accompanying consolidated financial statements and notes provided under Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\n2018 Highlights\n2018 was a transformative year for our Company. As part of our prior year turnaround plan, we accomplished several critical financial and operating performance objectives:\n \u2022 2018 Reported Revenue increase is a combination of organic and acquisition growth, offset by portfolio improvement initiatives and accelerated DC closures; \n \u2022 The INAP Sales team is totally rebuilt and active selling larger deals, with overall improved productivity; \n \u2022 Completed two tuck-in deals in 2018: SingleHop to upgrade Managed Services, and our BofA Data Center in Phoenix to add a new INAP Flagship; \n \u2022 Margin Expansion continued through best practices / cost rationalization / real estate portfolio management; and \n \u2022 Projects related to the two-year turnaround are completed, with incremental opportunity to always improve cost structure with targeted investments. \nOur GAAP net loss attributable to INAP shareholders was $62.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, compared to $45.3 million for the same period in 2017. Our adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (\"EBITDA\") margin, a non-GAAP performance measure, increased 220 basis points to 35.1% for the year ended December 31, 2018, compared to 32.9% for the same period in 2017. We calculate Adjusted EBITDA margin as Adjusted EBITDA, defined below in \"Non-GAAP Financial Measures,\" as a percentage of revenues. We will continue to focus on enhancing margin in 2019 through product mix shift, optimizing our product offerings and other efficiency initiatives.\nFactors Affecting Our Performance\nWe believe all successful IT companies need to compete well in three dimensions: market, product/technology and execution.\nMarket\nWe compete in a large addressable market that is expected to grow at a CAGR of 15% over the next five years and we believe that there is additional growth for the types of products and services we provide. In addition, the market remains fragmented and, given our competitively differentiated products and services, we believe we have an opportunity for growth among a number of different customers. Our ability to take advantage of this market depends, in large part, on effective positioning with our target customers who understand and value the performance capabilities of our offerings. We will continue to market our products and services to customers seeking solutions in our two segments.\nProduct\nAt a high level, there are two primary strategies to successfully compete in the IT infrastructure services market. The first strategy is to compete on scale and low pricing. The second strategy is to compete as a value-added solutions provider with a differentiated and integrated product utilizing proprietary technology. We are pursuing this second strategy. Our high-performance, reliable infrastructure services using proprietary solutions position us to compete with a performance-based value proposition. We continue to prudently invest in innovation through our commitment to research and development, acquisitions, talent acquisition, open source technology, key\ntechnological partnerships and patentable technology to enhance our differentiated high-performance value proposition, in the areas of cloud, hosting and patented IP.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nWe report our consolidated financial statements in accordance with GAAP. We present the non-GAAP performance measures of Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin, discussed above in \"2018 Highlights,\" to assist us in the evaluation of underlying performance trends in our business, which we believe will enhance investors' ability to analyze trends in our business, and the evaluation of our performance relative to other companies. We define Adjusted EBITDA as GAAP net loss plus depreciation and amortization, interest expense; provision for income taxes, other expense (income), (gain) loss on disposals of property and equipment, exit activities, restructuring and impairments, stock-based compensation, non-income tax contingency, strategic alternatives and related costs, organizational realignment costs, claim settlement and acquisition costs. We calculate Adjusted EBITDA margin as Adjusted EBITDA as a percentage of revenues.\nAs a non-GAAP financial measure, Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered in isolation of, or as a substitute for, net loss, income from operations or other GAAP measures as an indicator of operating performance. Our calculation of Adjusted EBITDA may differ from others in our industry and is not necessarily comparable with similar titles used by other companies.\nThe following table reconciles net loss attributable to INAP shareholders as presented in our consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss to Adjusted EBITDA (non-GAAP):\n\n (1) Primarily legal and other professional fees incurred in connection with the evaluation by our board of directors of strategic alternatives and related shareholder communications. We include these costs in \"Sales, general and administrative\" in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016. \n (2) Primarily professional fees, employee retention bonus, severance and executive search costs incurred related to our organizational realignment. We include these costs in \"Sales, general and administrative\" in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016. \n (3) On February 28, 2018, we acquired SingleHop LLC, which resulted in higher acquisition costs. \nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nThis discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements, which we have prepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expense and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates, including those summarized below. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances; the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ materially from these estimates.\nIn addition to our significant accounting policies summarized in Note 2 to our accompanying consolidated financial statements, we believe the following policies are the most sensitive to judgments and estimates in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements.\nRevenue Recognition\nWe generate revenues primarily from the sale of data center services, including colocation, hosting and cloud, and IP services. Our revenues typically consist of monthly recurring revenues from contracts with terms of one year or more and we typically recognize the monthly minimum as revenue each month. We recorded installation fees as deferred revenue and recognized the revenue ratably over the estimated customer life, which was approximately five years for 2017 and 2016 before the Company adopted Accounting Standards Update (\"ASU\") No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606) (\"ASC 606\") on January 1, 2018.\nRevenue is recognized to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. The Company enters into contracts that can include various combinations of products and services, which are generally capable of being distinct and accounted for as separate performance obligations.\nThe Company's contracts with customers often include performance obligations to transfer multiple products and services to a customer. Common performance obligations of the Company include delivery of services. Determining whether products and services are considered distinct performance obligations that should be accounted for separately versus together requires significant judgment by the Company.\nA performance obligation is a promise in a contract to transfer a distinct good or service to the customer, and is the unit of account in ASC 606. A contract's transaction price is allocated to each distinct performance obligation and recognized as revenue when, or as, the performance obligation is satisfied. Total transaction price is estimated for impact of variable consideration, such as INAP's service level arrangements, additional usage and late fees, discounts and promotions, and customer care credits. The majority of our contracts have multiple performance obligations, as the promise to transfer individual goods or services is separately identifiable from other promises in the contracts and, therefore, is distinct. For contracts with multiple performance obligations, we allocate the contract's transaction price to each performance obligation based on its relative stand-alone selling price.\nThe stand-alone selling price (\"SSP\") is determined based on observable price. In instances where the SSP is not directly observable, such as when the Company does not sell the product or service separately, INAP determines the SSP using information that may include market conditions and other observable inputs. The Company typically has more than one SSP for individual products and services due to the stratification of those products and services by customers and circumstances. In these instances, the Company may use information such as the size of the customer and geographic region in determining the SSP.\nThe most significant impact of the adoption of the new standard is the requirement for incremental costs to obtain a customer, such as commissions, which previously were expensed as incurred, to be deferred and amortized over the period of contract performance or a longer period if renewals are expected and the renewal commission is not commensurate with the initial commission.\nIn addition, installation revenues are recognized over the initial contract life rather than over the estimated customer life, as they are not significant to the total contract and therefore do not represent a material right.\nMost performance obligations, with the exception of certain sales of equipment or hardware, are satisfied over time as the customer consumes the benefits as we perform. For equipment and hardware sales, the performance obligation is satisfied when control transfers to the customer.\nIn evaluating the treatment of certain contracts, the Company exercised heightened judgment in deferring installation revenue as well as expense fulfillment and commission costs over the appropriate life. With the exception of the revenues noted above, revenue recognition remains materially consistent with historical practice.\nWe routinely review the collectability of our accounts receivable and payment status of our customers. If we determine that collection of revenue is uncertain, we do not recognize revenue until collection is reasonably assured. Additionally, we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments on accounts receivable. We base the allowance for doubtful accounts on our historical write-offs as a percentage of revenue. We assess the payment status of customers by reference to the terms under which we provide services or goods, with any payments not made on or before their due date considered past-due. Once we have exhausted all collection efforts, we write the uncollectible balance off against the allowance for doubtful accounts. We routinely perform credit checks for new and existing customers and require deposits or prepayments for customers that we perceive as being a credit risk. In addition, we record a reserve amount for potential credits to be issued under our service level agreements and other sales adjustments.\nGoodwill and Other Intangible and Long-lived Assets\nOur annual assessment of goodwill for impairment, performed each year on August 1 absent any impairment indicators or other changes that may cause more frequent analysis, includes comparing the fair value of each reporting unit to the carrying value, referred to as \"step one.\" We estimate fair value using a combination of discounted cash flow models and market approaches. If the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying value, goodwill is not impaired and no further testing is necessary. If the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, we record the amount of impairment to goodwill, if any.\nWe base the impairment analysis of goodwill on estimated fair values. Our assumptions, inputs and judgments used in performing the valuation analysis are inherently subjective and reflect estimates based on known facts and circumstances at the time we perform the valuation. These estimates and assumptions primarily include, but are not limited to, discount rates; terminal growth rates; projected revenues and costs; projected EBITDA for expected cash flows; market comparables and capital expenditures forecasts. The use of different assumptions, inputs and judgments, or changes in circumstances, could materially affect the results of the valuation. Due to the inherent uncertainty involved in making these estimates, actual results could differ from our estimates and could result in additional non-cash impairment charges in the future.\nOther intangible assets have finite lives and we record these assets at cost less accumulated amortization. We record amortization of acquired technologies using the greater of (a) the ratio of current revenues to total and anticipated future revenues for the applicable technology or (b) the straight-line method over the remaining estimated useful life. The intangible assets are being amortized over periods which reflect the pattern in which economic benefits of the assets are expected to be realized. We amortize the cost of the acquired technologies and noncompete agreements over their useful lives of 4 to 8 years and 8 to 15 years for trade names. Customer relationships are being amortized on an accelerated basis over their estimated useful life of 10 to 15 years. We assess other intangible assets and long-lived assets on a quarterly basis whenever any events have occurred or circumstances have changed that would indicate impairment could exist. Our assessment is based on estimated future cash flows directly associated with the asset or asset group. If we determine that the carrying value is not recoverable, we may record an impairment charge, reduce the estimated remaining useful life or both.\nProperty and Equipment\nWe carry property and equipment at original acquisition cost less accumulated depreciation and amortization. We calculate depreciation and amortization on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets. Estimated useful lives used for network equipment are generally five years; furniture, equipment and software are three to seven years; and leasehold improvements are the shorter of the lease term or their estimated useful lives. We capitalize additions and improvements that increase the value or extend the life of an asset. We expense maintenance and repairs as incurred. We charge gains or losses from disposals of property and equipment to operations.\nExit Activities and Restructuring\nWhen circumstances warrant, we may elect to exit certain business activities or change the manner in which we conduct ongoing operations. If we make such a change, we will estimate the costs to exit a business, location, service contract or restructure ongoing operations. The components of the estimates may include estimates and assumptions regarding the timing and costs of future events and activities that represent our best expectations based on known facts and circumstances at the time of estimation. If circumstances warrant, we will adjust our previous estimates to reflect what we then believe to be a more accurate representation of expected future costs. Because our estimates and assumptions regarding exit activities and restructuring charges include probabilities of future events, such as our ability to find a sublease tenant within a reasonable period of time or the rate at which a sublease tenant will pay for the available space, such estimates are inherently vulnerable to changes due to unforeseen circumstances that could materially and adversely affect our results of operations. We monitor market conditions at each period end reporting date and will continue to assess our key assumptions and estimates used in the calculation of our exit activities and restructuring accrual.\nIncome Taxes\nWe recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. We measure the tax benefits recognized in our accompanying consolidated financial statements from such a position based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon settlement. We recognize interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions as part of the provision for income taxes and we accrue such items beginning in the period that such interest and penalties would be applicable under relevant tax law until such time that we recognize the related tax benefits.\nWe maintain a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to their estimated realizable value. Although we consider the potential for future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance, if we determine we would be able to realize our deferred tax assets in the future in excess of our net recorded amount, an adjustment to reduce the valuation allowance would increase net income in the period we made such determination. We may recognize deferred tax assets in future periods if and when we estimate them to be realizable and supported by historical trends of profitability and expectations of future profits within each tax jurisdiction.\nBased on an analysis of our historic and projected future U.S. pre-tax income, we do not have sufficient positive evidence to expect a release of our valuation allowance against our U.S. deferred tax assets currently or within the next 12 months; therefore, we continue to maintain the full valuation allowance in the U.S.\nBased on an analysis of the past 12 quarters and projected future pre-tax income, we concluded that there is no longer sufficient positive evidence to support U.K.'s deferred tax assets position. Therefore, we established a full valuation allowance against U.K. deferred tax assets in 2015. U.K. continues to have a full valuation allowance against deferred tax assets in 2018.\nBased on an analysis of our sources of future taxable income and all positive and negative evidence, we concluded in 2018 that there was no longer sufficient positive evidence to support the realization of Germany's net deferred tax assets. Therefore, we established a full valuation allowance against Germany's net deferred tax assets in 2018.\nWe reached the same conclusion regarding our foreign jurisdictions, other than Canada and the Netherlands. Accordingly, we continue to maintain the full valuation allowance against of net deferred tax assets in all foreign jurisdictions, other than Canada and the Netherlands.\nStock-Based Compensation\nWe measure stock-based compensation cost at the grant date based on the calculated fair value of the award. We recognize the expense over the employee's requisite service period, generally the vesting period of the award. The fair value of restricted stock is the market value on the date of grant. The fair value of stock options is estimated at the grant date using the Black-Scholes option pricing model with weighted average assumptions for the activity under our stock plans. Option pricing model input assumptions, such as expected term, expected volatility and risk-free interest rate, impact the fair value estimate. Further, the forfeiture rate impacts the amount of aggregate compensation. These assumptions are subjective and generally require significant analysis and judgment to develop.\nThe expected term represents the weighted average period of time that we expect granted options to be outstanding, considering the vesting schedules and our historical exercise patterns. Because our options are not publicly traded, we assume volatility based on the historical volatility of our stock. The risk-free interest rate is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant for periods corresponding to the expected option term. We have also used historical data to estimate option exercises, employee termination and stock option forfeiture rates. Changes in any of these assumptions could materially impact our results of operations in the period the change is made.\nCapitalized Software Costs\nWe capitalize internal-use software development costs incurred during the application development stage. Amortization begins once the software is ready for its intended use and is computed based on the straight-line method over the economic life. Judgment is required in determining which software projects are capitalized and the resulting economic life.\nWe capitalize certain costs associated with software to be sold. Capitalized costs include all costs incurred to produce the software or the purchase price paid for a master copy of the software that will be sold. Internally incurred costs to develop software are expensed when incurred as research and development costs until technological feasibility is established.\nResults of Operations\nThe following table sets forth selected consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss data during the periods presented, including comparative information between the periods (dollars in thousands):\n\nRevenues\nWe generate revenues primarily from the sale of data center services, IP services and cloud and hosting services.\nCosts of Sales and Services\nCosts of sales and services are comprised primarily of:\n \u2022 costs for connecting to and accessing ISPs and competitive local exchange providers; \n \u2022 facility and occupancy costs, including power and utilities, for hosting and operating our equipment and hosting our customers' equipment; \n \u2022 costs incurred for providing additional third party services to our customers; and \n \u2022 royalties and costs of license fees for operating systems software. \nIf a network access point is not colocated with the respective ISP, we may incur additional local loop charges on a recurring basis. Connectivity costs vary depending on customer demands and pricing variables while \"POPs\" facility costs are generally fixed. Costs of network, sales and services do not include compensation, depreciation or amortization.\nCosts of Customer Support\nCosts of customer support consist primarily of compensation and other personnel costs for employees engaged in connecting customers to our network, installing customer equipment into POPs facilities and servicing customers through our NOCs. In addition, direct costs of customer support include facilities costs associated with the NOCs, including costs related to servicing our data center customers.\nSales, General and Administrative\nSales, general and administrative costs consist primarily of costs related to sales and marketing, compensation and other expense for executive, finance, product development, human resources and administrative personnel, professional fees and other general corporate costs.\nSegment Information\nEffective January 1, 2018, as further described in Note 10 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements, we operate in two business segments: INAP US and INAP INTL. Segment results for each of the three years ended December 31, 2018 are summarized as follows (in thousands):\n\nSegment profit is calculated as segment revenues less costs of sales and services, customer support and sales and marketing. We view costs of sales and services as generally less-controllable, external costs and we regularly monitor the margin of revenues in excess of these direct costs. We also view the costs of customer support to be an important component of costs of revenues, but believe that the costs of customer support are more within our control and, to some degree, discretionary in that we can adjust those costs by managing personnel needs. We also have excluded depreciation and amortization from segment profit because it is based on estimated useful lives of tangible and intangible assets. Further, we base depreciation and amortization on historical costs incurred to build out our deployed network and the historical costs of these assets may not be indicative of current or future capital expenditures.\nYears Ended December 31, 2018 and 2017\nINAP US\nRevenues for our INAP US segment increased 15.0%, to $248.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, compared to $215.8 million for the same period in 2017. The increase was primarily due to the acquisition of SingleHop and the initiation of organic growth contributed by the new salesforce offset by data center exits.\nCosts of our INAP US segment, exclusive of depreciation and amortization, decreased 2.9%, to $80.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, compared to $83.0 million for the same period in 2017. The decrease was primarily due to $10.8 million of lower costs related to data center exits, conversion of operating to capital leases, lower variable costs related to revenue decline, and on-going cost reduction efforts. Offsetting those decreases were $8.4 million of increases primarily due to the SingleHop and data center acquisitions.\nINAP INTL\nRevenues for our INAP INTL segment increased 6.5% to $69.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, compared to $64.9 million for the same period in 2017. The increase of $4.3 million is primarily due to the consolidation of INAP Japan and the SingleHop acquisition partially offset by a slight decline in small business revenue.\nCosts of our INAP INTL segment, exclusive of depreciation and amortization, increased 15.0%, to $26.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, compared to $23.2 million for the same period in 2017. The increase of $3.5 million was primarily due to the consolidation of INAP Japan and the SingleHop acquisition as well as the acquisition of new data center space.\nGeographic Information\nRevenues are allocated to countries based on location of services. Revenues, by country with revenues over 10% of total revenues, are as follows (in thousands):\n\nOther Operating Costs and Expenses\nCompensation. Total compensation and benefits, including stock-based compensation, was $65.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, compared to $58.0 million for the same period in 2017. The increase was primarily due to the addition of SingleHop employees resulting in $6.0 million increase in cash-based compensation and payroll taxes, $1.7 million increase in stock-based compensation, and $0.6 million increase in bonus accrual, offset by $1.3 million decrease in commissions.\nStock-based compensation, net of amount capitalized for internal software, increased to $4.7 million during the year ended December 31, 2018, from $3.0 million during the same period in 2017 primarily due to the addition of SingleHop employees. The following table summarizes stock-based compensation included in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss (in thousands):\n\nCosts of Customer Support. Costs of customer support increased to $32.5 million during the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to $25.8 million during the same period in 2017. The increase was due to $6.7 million of wages and payroll taxes primarily due to the addition of SingleHop employees.\nSales, General and Administrative. Sales, general and administrative costs increased to $75.4 million during the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to $62.7 million during the same period in 2017. The increase of $12.7 million was primarily due to the SingleHop acquisition consisting of higher compensation of $3.5 million, $2.5 million of increased acquisition costs, $1.9 million increase primarily due to channel partner commissions, $1.7 million increase in stock-based compensation, $0.9 million increase in facility expenses, $0.8 million decrease in internal software costs that were capitalized (resulting in increased compensation costs in \"Sales, general and administrative\" expenses), $0.6 million increase in bonus expense and $0.8 million increase in other miscellaneous expenses.\nDepreciation and Amortization. Depreciation and amortization increased to $90.7 million during the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to $75.0 million during the same period in 2017. The increase is primarily due to higher capital purchases and capital leases entered during the year ended December 31, 2018.\nGoodwill Impairment. There was no goodwill impairment during the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017.\nExit activities, Restructuring and Impairments. Exit activities, restructuring and impairments decreased to $5.4 million during the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to $6.2 million during the same period in 2017. The decrease is primarily due to higher restructuring expenses due to closures of data centers in the prior year.\nInterest Expense. Interest expense increased to $68.1 million during the year ended December 31, 2018 from $50.5 million during the same period in 2017. The increase is primarily due to entering into the new incremental $135.0 million term loan facility and new capital leases entered during the year ended December 31, 2018.\nProvision for Income Taxes. Provision for income taxes increased to $0.7 million during the year ended December 31, 2018 from $0.3 million during the same period in 2017. The increase was primarily due to the consolidation of INAP Japan in 2018 and an increase in our unrecognized tax benefits.\nYears Ended December 31, 2017 and 2016\nINAP US\nRevenues for our INAP US segment decreased 8.6%, to $215.8 million for the years ended December 31, 2017, compared to $229.9 million for the same period in 2016. The decrease was primarily due to lower network services revenue related to downward pricing pressures and a decrease in colocation and managed hosting revenue due to loss of revenue from data center exits.\nCosts of our INAP US segment, exclusive of depreciation and amortization, decreased 15.7%, to $83.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to $98.5 million for the same period in 2016. The decrease of $15.5 million was primarily due to lower expenses related to conversion of operating to capital leases, a data center exit, lower variable costs related to the decline in revenue, and on-going cost reduction efforts.\nINAP INTL\nRevenues for our INAP INTL segment decreased 5.0% to $64.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to $68.4 million for the same period in 2016. The decrease of $3.5 million was primarily due to colocation and cloud services revenue churn from a small number of large customers partially offset by the increase from the consolidation of INAP Japan.\nCosts of our INAP INTL segment, exclusive of depreciation and amortization, decreased 9.8%, to $23.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to $25.7 million for the same period in 2016. The decrease of $2.5 million was primarily due to lower variable costs related to the decline in revenue partially offset by the increase from the consolidation of INAP Japan.\nOther Operating Costs and Expenses\nCompensation. Total compensation and benefits, including stock-based compensation, was $58.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to $66.3 million for the same period in 2016. The change was primarily due to $8.2 million decrease in cash-based compensation and payroll taxes, $2.0 million decrease in stock-based compensation, $0.8 million decrease in sales commissions, $0.5 million decrease in insurance benefit costs, partially offset by $1.8 million increase in bonus accrual and $1.6 million decrease in software costs that were capitalized (resulting in increased compensation costs).\nStock-based compensation, net of amount capitalized, decreased to $3.0 million during the year ended December 31, 2017, from $5.0 million during the same period in 2016. The decrease is primarily due to lower stock-based compensation from prior year terminations. The following table summarizes stock-based compensation included in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss (in thousands):\n\nCosts of Customer Support. Costs of customer support decreased to $25.8 million during the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to $32.2 million during the same period in 2016. The decrease was primarily due to $4.9 million of lower cash-based compensation from\nreduced headcount, $1.1 million decrease in facilities costs and $1.0 million decrease in stock-based compensation, offset by $1.0 million increase in bonus accrual.\nSales, General and Administrative. Sales, general and administrative costs decreased to $62.7 million during the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to $70.6 million during the same period in 2016. The decrease is primarily due to the following: $4.7 million decrease in organizational realignment costs, $3.3 million decrease in cash-based compensation from reduced headcount, $1.1 million decrease in office administration costs, $1.0 million decrease in stock-based compensation, $0.9 million decrease in sales commissions, $0.8 million decrease in tax costs, and $0.6 million decrease in insurance benefit costs, partially offset by $1.9 million increase in facilities costs, $1.6 million decrease in software costs that were capitalized (resulting in increased compensation costs in SG&A), $0.8 million increase in bonus accrual, $0.6 million in settlement costs and $0.4 million in acquisition costs.\nDepreciation and Amortization. Depreciation and amortization decreased slightly to $75.0 million during the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to $76.9 million during the same period in 2016. The decrease is primarily due to lower capital purchases and older assets becoming fully depreciated during 2017.\nGoodwill Impairment. There was no goodwill impairment during the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to an impairment charge of $80.1 million during the same period in 2016.\nExit activities, Restructuring and Impairments. Exit activities, restructuring and impairments decreased to $6.2 million during the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to $7.2 million during the same period in 2016. The decrease is primarily due a non-recurring software impairment charge during 2016.\nInterest Expense. Interest expense increased to $50.5 million during the year ended December 31, 2017 from $30.9 million during the same period in 2016. The increase is primarily due to additional expense related to the modification and extinguishment of debt issuance costs of the previous term loan plus costs related to the new term loan and additional interest expense related to new capital leases.\nProvision for Income Taxes. Provision for income taxes decreased to $0.3 million during the year ended December 31, 2017 from $0.5 million during the same period in 2016. The decrease was primarily due to the tax benefit related to our alternative minimum tax credit becoming refundable due to the newly enacted tax reform and offset by the positive operational improvement in some of our foreign operations.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nNew Credit Agreement\nOn April 6, 2017, we entered into a new Credit Agreement (the \"2017 Credit Agreement\"), which provides for a $300.0 million term loan facility (\"2017 term loan\") and a $25.0 million revolving credit facility (the \"2017 revolving credit facility\"). The proceeds of the 2017 term loan were used to refinance the Company's existing credit facility and to pay costs and expenses associated with the 2017 Credit Agreement.\nCertain portions of the refinancing transaction were considered an extinguishment of debt and certain portions were considered a modification. A total of $5.7 million was paid for debt issuance costs related to the 2017 Credit Agreement. Of the $5.7 million in costs paid, $1.9 million related to the exchange of debt and was expensed, $3.3 million related to 2017 term loan third party costs and will be amortized over the 2017 term loan and $0.4 million prepaid debt issuance costs related to the 2017 revolving credit facility and will be amortized over the term of the 2017 revolving credit facility. In addition, $4.8 million of debt discount and debt issuance costs related to the previous credit facility were expensed due to the extinguishment of that credit facility. The maturity date of the 2017 term loan is April 6, 2022 and the maturity date of the 2017 revolving credit facility is October 6, 2021. As of December 31, 2018, the balance and interest rate of the 2017 term loan were $415.6 million and 8.2%, respectively. The 2017 revolving credit facility had no balance outstanding at December 31, 2018.\nBorrowings under the 2017 Credit Agreement bear interest at a rate per annum equal to an applicable margin plus, at our option, a base rate or an adjusted LIBOR rate. The applicable margin for loans under the 2017 revolving credit facility is 6.0% for loans bearing interest calculated using the base rate (\"Base Rate Loans\") and 7.0% for loans bearing interest calculated using the adjusted LIBOR rate. The applicable margin for loans under the 2017 term loan is 4.75% for Base Rate Loans and 5.75% for adjusted LIBOR rate loans. The base rate is equal to the highest of (a) the adjusted U.S. Prime Lending Rate as published in the Wall Street Journal, (b) with respect to term loans issued on the closing date, 2.00%, (c) the federal funds effective rate from time to time, plus 0.50%, and (d) the adjusted LIBOR rate, as defined below, for a one-month interest period, plus 1.00%. The adjusted LIBOR rate is equal to the rate per annum (adjusted for statutory reserve requirements for Eurocurrency liabilities) at which Eurodollar deposits are offered in the interbank Eurodollar market\nfor the applicable interest period (one, two, three or six months), as quoted on Reuters screen LIBOR (or any successor page or service). The financing commitments of the lenders extending the 2017 revolving credit facility are subject to various conditions, as set forth in the 2017 Credit Agreement. As of December 31, 2018, the Company has been in compliance with all covenants.\nFirst Amendment\nOn June 28, 2017, the Company entered into an amendment to the 2017 Credit Agreement (\"First Amendment\"), by and among the Company, each of the lenders party thereto, and Jefferies Finance LLC, as Administrative Agent. The First Amendment clarified that for all purposes the Company's liabilities pursuant to any lease that was treated as rental and lease expense, and not as a capital lease obligation or indebtedness on the closing date of the 2017 Credit Agreement, would continue to be treated as a rental and lease expense, and not as a capital lease obligations or indebtedness, for all purposes of the 2017 Credit Agreement, notwithstanding any amendment of the lease that results in the treatment of such lease as a capital lease obligation or indebtedness for financial reporting purposes.\nThe table below sets forth information with respect to the current financial covenants as well as the calculation of our performance in relation to the covenant requirements at December 31, 2018.\n\n (1) The maximum total leverage ratio decreases to 5.9 to 1 as of March 31, 2019 - June 30, 2019, 5.5 to 1 as of September 30, 2019 - March 31, 2020, 5.25 to 1 as of June 30, 2020 - September 30, 2020, 4.75 to 1 as of December 31, 2020 - June 30, 2021 and 4.5 to 1 as of September 30, 2021 and thereafter. \n (2) The minimum consolidated interest coverage ratio increases to 2.00 to 1 as of March 31, 2019 - September 30, 2020, and 2.25 to 1 December 31, 2020 - September 30, 2021 and thereafter. \nSecond Amendment\nOn February 6, 2018, the Company, the Lenders party thereto and Jefferies Finance LLC, as Administrative Agent, entered into a Second Amendment to Credit Agreement (the \"Second Amendment\") that amended the 2017 Credit Agreement.\nThe Second Amendment, among other things, amends the 2017 Credit Agreement to (i) permit the Company to incur incremental term loans under the 2017 Credit Agreement of up to $135.0 million to finance the Company's acquisition of SingleHop and to pay related fees, costs and expenses, and (ii) revise the maximum total net leverage ratio and minimum consolidated interest coverage ratio covenants. The financial covenant amendments became effective upon the consummation of the SingleHop acquisition, while the other provisions of the Second Amendment became effective upon the execution and delivery of the Second Amendment. This transaction was considered a modification.\nA total of $1.0 million was paid for debt issuance costs related to the Second Amendment. Of the $1.0 million in costs paid, $0.2 million related to the payment of legal and professional fees which were expensed, $0.8 million related to term loan lender fees and will be amortized over the term of the 2017 Credit Agreement.\nThird Amendment\nOn February 28, 2018, INAP entered into the Incremental and Third Amendment to the Credit Agreement among the Company, the Lenders party thereto and Jefferies Finance LLC, as Administrative Agent (the \"Third Amendment\"). The Third Amendment provides for a funding of the new incremental term loan facility under the 2017 Credit Agreement of $135.0 million (the \"Incremental Term Loan\"). The Incremental Term Loan has terms and conditions identical to the existing loans under the 2017 Credit Agreement, as amended. Proceeds of the Incremental Term Loan were used to complete the acquisition of SingleHop and to pay fees, costs and expenses related to the acquisition, the Third Amendment and the Incremental Term Loan. This transaction was considered a modification.\nA total of $5.0 million was paid for debt issuance costs related to the Third Amendment. Of the $5.0 million in costs paid, $0.1 million related to the payment of legal and professional fees which were expensed, $4.9 million related to term loan lender fees and will be amortized over the term of the 2017 Credit Agreement.\nFourth Amendment\nOn April 9, 2018, the Company entered into the Fourth Amendment to 2017 Credit Agreement, among the Company, the Lenders party thereto and Jefferies Finance LLC, as Administrative Agent (the \"Fourth Amendment\"). The Fourth Amendment amends the 2017 Credit Agreement to lower the interest rate margins applicable to the outstanding term loans under the 2017 Credit Agreement by 1.25%. This transaction was considered a modification.\nA total of $1.7 million was paid for debt issuance costs related to the Fourth Amendment. Of the $1.7 million in costs paid, $0.1 million related to the payment of legal and professional fees which were expensed, $1.6 million related to term loan lender fees and will be amortized over the term of the 2017 Credit Agreement.\nFifth Amendment\nOn August 28, 2018, the Company entered into the Fifth Amendment to 2017 Credit Agreement, among the Company, the Lenders party thereto and Jefferies Finance LLC, as Administrative Agent (the \"Fifth Amendment\"). The Fifth Amendment amended the 2017 Credit Agreement by increasing the aggregate revolving commitment capacity by $10.0 million to $35.0 million.\nRefer to Note 9 in our accompanying consolidated financial statements for additional information about our credit agreement.\nEquity\nOn October 23, 2018, the Company closed a public offering of 4,210,527 shares of common stock at $9.50 per share to the public and received net proceeds of approximately $37.1 million (net of underwriting discounts and commissions, and other offering expenses).\nOn February 22, 2017, we entered into a securities purchase agreement (the \"Securities Purchase Agreement\") with certain purchasers (the \"Purchasers\"), pursuant to which we issued to the Purchasers an aggregate of 5,950,712 shares of our common stock at a price of $7.24 per share, for the aggregate purchase price of $43.1 million, which closed on February 27, 2017.\nOn November 16, 2017, the Company amended its certificate of incorporation to effect a 1-for-4 reverse stock split of the shares of the Company's common stock, par value $0.001 per share. This reverse stock split became effective as of the close of business on November 20, 2017. As a result of the reverse stock split, every four shares of issued and outstanding common stock were automatically combined into one issued and outstanding share of common stock, without any change in the par value per share. Any fractional shares that would otherwise have resulted from the reverse stock split were paid in cash in a proportionate amount based on the closing price of on the effective date of the reverse stock split. The reverse stock split reduced the number of shares of common stock outstanding from 83.4 million shares to approximately 20.9 million shares, subject to adjustment for the payment of cash in lieu of fractional shares. The number of authorized shares were reduced in the following manner: (i) Common Stock from 200 million shares to 50 million shares, and (ii) Preferred Stock from 20 million shares to 5 million shares. Accordingly, the authorized, issued and outstanding shares, stock options disclosures, net loss per share, and other per share disclosures for all periods presented have been retrospectively adjusted to reflect the impact of this reverse stock split.\nGeneral - Sources and Uses of Capital\nOn an ongoing basis, we require capital to fund our current operations, expand our IT infrastructure services, upgrade existing facilities or establish new facilities, products, services or capabilities and to fund customer support initiatives, as well as various advertising and marketing programs to facilitate sales. As of December 31, 2018, we had $30.7 million of borrowing capacity net of letters of credit of $4.3 million under our 2017 revolving credit facility. Together with our cash and cash equivalents, the Company's liquidity as of December 31, 2018 was $48.5 million. On February 22, 2019, we drew down $5.0 million on our 2017 revolving credit facility.\nAs of December 31, 2018, we had a deficit of $5.9 million in working capital, which represented an excess of current liabilities over current assets. We believe that cash flows from operations, together with our cash and cash equivalents and borrowing capacity under our 2017 revolving credit facility, will be sufficient to meet our cash requirements for the next 12 months and for the foreseeable future. If our cash requirements vary materially from our expectations or if we fail to generate sufficient cash flows from our operations or if we fail to implement our cost reduction strategies, we may require additional financing sooner than anticipated. We can offer no assurance that we will be able to obtain additional financing on commercially favorable terms, or at all, and provisions in our 2017 Credit Agreement limit our ability to incur additional indebtedness. Our anticipated uses of cash include capital expenditures in the range of $40.0 to $50.0 million in 2019, working capital needs and required payments on our credit agreement and other commitments.\nWe have a history of quarterly and annual period net losses. During the year ended December 31, 2018, we had a net loss attributable to INAP stockholders of $62.5 million. As of December 31, 2018, our accumulated deficit was $1.4 billion. We may not be able to achieve profitability on a quarterly basis, and our failure to do so may adversely affect our business, including our ability to raise additional funds.\nOur sources of capital include, but are not limited to, funds derived from selling our services and results of our operations, sales of assets, borrowings under our credit arrangement, the issuance of debt or equity securities or other possible recapitalization transactions. Our short term and long term liquidity depend primarily upon the funds derived from selling our services, working capital management (cash, accounts receivable, accounts payable and other liabilities), bank borrowings, reducing costs and bookings net of churn. In an effort to increase liquidity and generate cash, we may pursue sales of non-strategic assets, reduce our expenses, reduce capital expenditures, amend our credit facility, pursue sales of debt or equity securities or other recapitalization transactions, or seek other external sources of funds.\nCapital Leases. Our future minimum lease payments on all remaining capital lease obligations at December 31, 2018 were $271.5 million. We summarize our existing capital lease obligations in Note 9 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements.\nCommitments and Other Obligations. We have commitments and other obligations that are contractual in nature and will represent a use of cash in the future unless the agreements are modified. Service and purchase commitments primarily relate to IP, telecommunications and data center services. Our ability to improve cash provided by operations in the future would be negatively impacted if we do not grow our business at a rate that would allow us to offset the purchase and service commitments with corresponding revenue growth.\nThe following table summarizes our commitments and other obligations as of December 31, 2018 (in thousands):\n\nCash Flows\nOperating Activities\nYear Ended December 31, 2018. Net cash provided by operating activities during the year ended December 31, 2018 was $34.6 million. We generated cash from operations of $44.3 million, while changes in operating assets and liabilities used cash from operations of $9.7 million. We expect to use cash flows from operating activities to fund a portion of our capital expenditures and other requirements and to meet our other commitments and obligations, including outstanding debt.\nYear Ended December 31, 2017. Net cash provided by operating activities during the year ended December 31, 2017 was $41.7 million. We generated cash from operations of $45.9 million, while changes in operating assets and liabilities used cash from operations of $4.2 million.\nYear Ended December 31, 2016. Net cash provided by operating activities during the year ended December 31, 2016 was $48.2 million. We generated cash from operations of $47.1 million, while changes in operating assets and liabilities generated cash from operations of $1.1 million.\nInvesting Activities\nYear Ended December 31, 2018. Net cash used in investing activities during the year ended December 31, 2018 was $174.0 million, primarily due to capital expenditures and acquisition of SingleHop. These capital expenditures were related to the continued expansion and upgrade of our company-controlled data centers and network infrastructure.\nYear Ended December 31, 2017. Net cash used in investing activities during the year ended December 31, 2017 was $32.2 million, primarily due to capital expenditures. These capital expenditures were related to the continued expansion and upgrade of our company-controlled data centers and network infrastructure.\nYear Ended December 31, 2016. Net cash used in investing activities during the year ended December 31, 2016 was $45.7 million, primarily due to capital expenditures. These capital expenditures were related to the continued expansion and upgrade of our company-controlled data centers and network infrastructure.\nFinancing Activities\nYear Ended December 31, 2018. Net cash provided by financing activities during the year ended December 31, 2018 was $142.7 million, primarily due to $35.3 million of payments on our credit facility and capital lease obligations, partially offset by $148.5 million of proceeds from the 2017 Credit Agreement and approximately $37.1 million of net proceeds from the sale of common stock pursuant to a public offering.\nYear Ended December 31, 2017. Net cash used in financing activities during the year ended December 31, 2017 was $5.5 million, primarily due to $349.6 million of principal payments on the credit facilities and capital lease obligations, partially offset by $316.9 million of proceeds from the 2017 Credit Agreement and $40.2 million proceeds from the sale of common stock pursuant to the Securities Purchase Agreement.\nYear Ended December 31, 2016. Net cash used in financing activities during the year ended December 31, 2016 was $9.8 million, primarily due to $4.5 million of proceeds received from the revolving credit facility, partially offset by principal payments of $12.5 million on our credit agreement and capital lease obligations.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nAs of December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, we did not have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships, such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities, which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes. Other than our operating leases, we do not engage in off-balance sheet financial arrangements.", "item_7_tables": "Table 124: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>

"summary": " Here are the key points from the MD&A report:\n\n- INAP's revenues increased 13.1% to $317.4 million in 2018 compared to 2017, due to acquisitions and organic growth initiatives. Net loss was $62.5 million in 2018 compared to $45.3 million in 2017. \n\n- INAP operates in two segments: INAP US and INAP INTL. INAP US revenues were $248.2 million in 2018, up 15% from 2017. INAP INTL revenues were $69.2 million, up 6.5%.\n\n- Operating expenses increased 12.8% to $311.2 million in 2018, primarily due to the SingleHop acquisition. Depreciation and amortization was $90.7 million in 2018 versus $75.0 million in 2017.\n\n- Interest expense increased to $68.1 million in 2018 from $50.5 million in 2017, due to new debt issuances. Net cash from operations was $34.6 million in 2018.\n\n- In 2018, INAP amended its credit agreement several times, including increasing the revolving credit facility capacity to $35 million. INAP also raised $37.1 million in a common stock offering. \n\n- As of December 31, 2018, INAP had $48.5 million in liquidity. INAP expects 2019 capital expenditures of $40-50 million. The company has committed to future minimum lease payments of $271.5 million on capital leases.\n\nIn summary, INAP grew revenues double-digits after acquisitions but continues to operate at a net loss. The company is highly leveraged but has taken steps to increase liquidity and amend debt agreements. Cost cutting initiatives are underway as INAP focuses on margin improvement."}
