MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nIntroduction\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis should be read in conjunction with ITEM 8. CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA. This discussion contains forward-looking statements and involves numerous risks and uncertainties, including, but not limited to, those described in ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS.\u201d Actual results may differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statements.\nOverview\nSixth Street Specialty Lending, Inc. (formerly known as TPG Specialty Lending, Inc.) is a Delaware corporation formed on July 21, 2010. Effective June 15, 2020, we changed our name from TPG Specialty Lending, Inc. to Sixth Street Specialty Lending, Inc. The Adviser is our external manager. We have four wholly owned subsidiaries, TC Lending, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company, which holds a California finance lender and broker license, Sixth Street SL SPV, LLC (formerly known as TPG SL SPV, LLC), a Delaware limited liability company, in which we hold assets that were previously used to support our asset-backed credit facility, Sixth Street SL Holding, LLC (formerly known as TSL MR, LLC), a Delaware limited liability company, in which we hold certain investments, and Sixth Street Specialty Lending Sub, LLC, a Cayman Islands limited liability company, in which we plan to hold certain investments.\nWe have elected to be regulated as a BDC under the 1940 Act and as a RIC under the Code. We made our BDC election on April 15, 2011. As a result, we are required to comply with various statutory and regulatory requirements, such as:\nTable 280: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> the requirement to invest at least 70% of our assets in qualifying assets\u201d;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 281: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> source of income limitations;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 282: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> asset diversification requirements; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 283: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> the requirement to distribute (or be treated as distributing) in each taxable year at least 90% of our investment company taxable income and tax-exempt interest for that taxable year.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOur shares are currently listed on the NYSE under the symbol TSLX.\u201d\nOur Investment Framework\nWe are a specialty finance company focused on lending to middle-market companies. Since we began our investment activities in July 2011, through December 31, 2020, we have originated more than $15.8 billion aggregate principal amount of investments and retained approximately $7.2 billion aggregate principal amount of these investments on our balance sheet prior to any subsequent exits and repayments. We seek to generate current income primarily in U.S.-domiciled middle-market companies through direct originations of senior secured loans and, to a lesser extent, originations of mezzanine and unsecured loans and investments in corporate bonds and equity securities.\nBy middle-market companies,\u201d we mean companies that have annual EBITDA, which we believe is a useful proxy for cash flow, of $10 million to $250 million, although we may invest in larger or smaller companies on occasion. As of December 31, 2020, our core portfolio companies, which exclude certain investments that fall outside of our typical borrower profile and represent 87.1% of our total investments based on fair value, had weighted average annual revenue of $116.6 million and weighted average annual EBITDA of $40.9 million.\nWe invest in first-lien debt, second-lien debt, mezzanine and unsecured debt and equity and other investments. Our first-lien debt may include stand-alone first-lien loans; last out\u201d first-lien loans, which are loans that have a secondary priority behind super-senior first out\u201d first-lien loans; unitranche\u201d loans, which are loans that combine features of first-lien, second-lien and mezzanine debt,\ngenerally in a first-lien position; and secured corporate bonds with similar features to these categories of first-lien loans. Our second-lien debt may include secured loans, and, to a lesser extent, secured corporate bonds, with a secondary priority behind first-lien debt.\nThe debt in which we invest typically is not rated by any rating agency, but if these instruments were rated, they would likely receive a rating of below investment grade (that is, below BBB- or Baa3 as defined by Standard & Poor's and Moody's Investors Services, respectively), which is often referred to as junk.\u201d\nThe companies in which we invest use our capital to support organic growth, acquisitions, market or product expansion and recapitalizations (including restructurings). As of December 31, 2020, the largest single investment based on fair value represented 3.7% of our total investment portfolio.\nAs of December 31, 2020, the average investment size in each of our portfolio companies was approximately $32.8 million based on fair value.\nThrough our Adviser, we consider potential investments utilizing a four-tiered investment framework and against our existing portfolio as a whole:\nBusiness and sector selection. We focus on companies with enterprise value between $50 million and $1 billion. When reviewing potential investments, we seek to invest in businesses with high marginal cash flow, recurring revenue streams and where we believe credit quality will improve over time. We look for portfolio companies that we think have a sustainable competitive advantage in growing industries or distressed situations. We also seek companies where our investment will have a low loan-to-value ratio.\nWe currently do not limit our focus to any specific industry and we may invest in larger or smaller companies on occasion. We classify the industries of our portfolio companies by end-market (such as healthcare, and business services) and not by the products or services (such as software) directed to those end-markets.\nAs of December 31, 2020, the largest industry represented 22.2% of our total investment portfolio based on fair value.\nInvestment Structuring. We focus on investing at the top of the capital structure and protecting that position. As of December 31, 2020, approximately 95.8% of our portfolio was invested in secured debt, including 95.6% in first-lien debt investments. We carefully perform diligence and structure investments to include strong investor covenants. As a result, we structure investments with a view to creating opportunities for early intervention in the event of non-performance or stress. In addition, we seek to retain effective voting control in investments over the loans or particular class of securities in which we invest through maintaining affirmative voting positions or negotiating consent rights that allow us to retain a blocking position. We also aim for our loans to mature on a medium term, between two to six years after origination. For the year ended December 31, 2020, the weighted average term on new investment commitments in new portfolio companies was 4.6 years.\nDeal Dynamics. We focus on, among other deal dynamics, direct origination of investments, where we identify and lead the investment transaction. A substantial majority of our portfolio investments are sourced through our direct or proprietary relationships.\nRisk Mitigation. We seek to mitigate non-credit-related risk on our returns in several ways, including call protection provisions to protect future interest income. As of December 31, 2020, we had call protection on 82.0% of our debt investments based on fair value, with weighted average call prices of 107.0% for the first year, 104.3% for the second year and 101.4% for the third year, in each case from the date of the initial investment. As of December 31, 2020, 99.1% of our debt investments based on fair value bore interest at floating rates (when including investment specific hedges), with 99.2% of these subject to interest rate floors, which we believe helps act as a portfolio-wide hedge against inflation.\nRelationship with our Adviser and Sixth Street\nOur Adviser is a Delaware limited liability company. Our Adviser acts as our investment adviser and administrator and is a registered investment adviser with the SEC under the Advisers Act. Our Adviser sources and manages our portfolio through a dedicated team of investment professionals predominately focused on us. Our Investment Team is led by our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and our Adviser's Co-Chief Investment Officer Joshua Easterly and our Adviser's Co-Chief Investment Officer Alan Waxman, both of whom have substantial experience in credit origination, underwriting and asset management. Our investment decisions are made by our Investment Review Committee, which includes senior personnel of our Adviser and Sixth Street Partners, LLC, or Sixth Street.\u201d\nSixth Street is a global investment business with approximately $50 billion of assets under management. Sixth Street's core platforms include Sixth Street Specialty Lending, Sixth Street Specialty Lending Europe, which is aimed at European middle-market\nloan originations, Sixth Street TAO, which has the flexibility to invest across all of Sixth Street's private credit market investments, Sixth Street Opportunities, which focuses on actively managed opportunistic investments across the credit cycle, Sixth Street Credit Market Strategies, which is the firm's public-side\u201d credit investment platform focused on investment opportunities in broadly syndicated leveraged loan markets, Sixth Street Growth, which provides financing solutions to growing companies, Sixth Street Fundamental Strategies, which primarily invests in secondary credit, and Sixth Street Agriculture, which invests in niche agricultural opportunities. Sixth Street has a long-term oriented, highly flexible capital base that allows it to invest across industries, geographies, capital structures and asset classes. Sixth Street has extensive experience with highly complex, global public and private investments executed through primary originations, secondary market purchases and restructurings, and has a team of over 320 investment and operating professionals. As of December 31, 2020, thirty two (32) of these personnel are dedicated to our business, including twenty four (24) investment professionals.\nOur Adviser consults with Sixth Street in connection with a substantial number of our investments. The Sixth Street platform provides us with a breadth of large and scalable investment resources. We believe we benefit from Sixth Street's market expertise, insights into industry, sector and macroeconomic trends and intensive due diligence capabilities, which help us discern market conditions that vary across industries and credit cycles, identify favorable investment opportunities and manage our portfolio of investments. Sixth Street and its affiliates will refer all middle-market loan origination activities for companies domiciled in the United States to us and conduct those activities through us. The Adviser will determine whether it would be permissible, advisable or otherwise appropriate for us to pursue a particular investment opportunity allocated to us.\nOn December 16, 2014, we were granted an exemptive order from the SEC that allows us to co-invest, subject to certain conditions and to the extent the size of an investment opportunity exceeds the amount our Adviser has independently determined is appropriate to invest, with certain of our affiliates (including affiliates of Sixth Street) in middle-market loan origination activities for companies domiciled in the United States and certain follow-on\u201d investments in companies in which we have already co-invested pursuant to the order and remain invested. On January 16, 2020, we filed a further application for co-investment exemptive relief with the SEC to better align our existing co-investment relief with more recent SEC exemptive orders. There can be no assurance when or if the SEC will grant a further order in response to our application. Until such time a new order is granted, we will continue to operate under the terms of our current exemptive order.\nWe believe our ability to co-invest with Sixth Street affiliates is particularly useful where we identify larger capital commitments than otherwise would be appropriate for us. We expect that with the ability to co-invest with Sixth Street affiliates we will continue to be able to provide one-stop\u201d financing to a potential portfolio company in these circumstances, which may allow us to capture opportunities where we alone could not commit the full amount of required capital or would have to spend additional time to locate unaffiliated co-investors.\nUnder the terms of the Investment Advisory Agreement and Administration Agreement, the Adviser's services are not exclusive, and the Adviser is free to furnish similar or other services to others, so long as its services to us are not impaired. Under the terms of the Investment Advisory Agreement, we will pay the Adviser the base management fee, or the Management Fee, and may also pay certain incentive fees, or the Incentive Fees.\nUnder the terms of the Administration Agreement, the Adviser also provides administrative services to us. These services include providing office space, equipment and office services, maintaining financial records, preparing reports to stockholders and reports filed with the SEC, and managing the payment of expenses and the oversight of the performance of administrative and professional services rendered by others. Certain of these services are reimbursable to the Adviser under the terms of the Administration Agreement.\nKey Components of Our Results of Operations\nInvestments\nWe focus primarily on the direct origination of loans to middle-market companies domiciled in the United States.\nOur level of investment activity (both the number of investments and the size of each investment) can and does vary substantially from period to period depending on many factors, including the amount of debt and equity capital generally available to middle-market companies, the level of merger and acquisition activity for such companies, the general economic environment and the competitive environment for the types of investments we make.\nIn addition, as part of our risk strategy on investments, we may reduce certain levels of investments through partial sales or syndication to additional investors.\nRevenues\nWe generate revenues primarily in the form of interest income from the investments we hold. In addition, we may generate income from dividends on direct equity investments, capital gains on the sale of investments and various loan origination and other fees. Our debt investments typically have a term of two to six years, and, as of December 31, 2020, 99.1% of these investments based on fair value bore interest at a floating rate (when including investment specific hedges), with 99.2% of these subject to interest rate floors. Interest on debt investments is generally payable quarterly or semiannually. Some of our investments provide for deferred interest payments or PIK interest. For the year ended December 31, 2020, 3.2% of our total investment income was comprised of PIK interest.\nChanges in our net investment income are primarily driven by the spread between the payments we receive from our investments in our portfolio companies against our cost of funding, rather than by changes in interest rates. Our investment portfolio primarily consists of floating rate loans, and our credit facilities, 2022 Convertible Notes, 2023 Notes and 2024 Notes, after taking into account the effect of the interest rate swaps we have entered into in connection with these securities, all bear interest at floating rates. Macro trends in base interest rates like LIBOR or other alternate reference rates may affect our net investment income over the long term. However, because we generally originate loans to a small number of portfolio companies each quarter, and those investments also vary in size, our results in any given period-including the interest rate on investments that were sold or repaid in a period compared to the interest rate of new investments made during that period-often are idiosyncratic, and reflect the characteristics of the particular portfolio companies that we invested in or exited during the period and not necessarily any trends in our business.\nIn addition to interest income, our net investment income is also driven by prepayment and other fees, which also can vary significantly from quarter to quarter. The level of prepayment fees is generally correlated to the movement in credit spreads and risk premiums, but also will vary based on corporate events that may take place at an individual portfolio company in a given period-e.g., merger and acquisition activity, initial public offerings and restructurings. As noted above, generally a small but varied number of portfolio companies may make prepayments in any quarter, meaning that changes in the amount of prepayment fees received can vary significantly between periods and can vary without regard to underlying credit trends.\nLoan origination fees, original issue discount and market discount or premium are capitalized, and we accrete or amortize such amounts as interest income using the effective interest method for term instruments and the straight-line method for revolving or delayed draw instruments. Repayments of our debt investments can reduce interest income from period to period. We record prepayment premiums on loans as interest income when earned. We also may generate revenue in the form of commitment, amendment, structuring, syndication or due diligence fees, fees for providing managerial assistance and consulting fees. The frequency or volume of these items of revenue may fluctuate significantly.\nDividend income on common equity investments is recorded on the record date for private portfolio companies or on the ex-dividend date for publicly traded portfolio companies.\nOur portfolio activity also reflects the proceeds of sales of investments. We recognize realized gains or losses on investments based on the difference between the net proceeds from the disposition and the amortized cost basis of the investment without regard to unrealized gains or losses previously recognized. We record current period changes in fair value of investments that are measured at fair value as a component of the net change in unrealized gains (losses) on investments in the consolidated statements of operations.\nExpenses\nOur primary operating expenses include the payment of fees to our Adviser under the Investment Advisory Agreement, expenses reimbursable under the Administration Agreement and other operating costs described below. Additionally, we pay interest expense on our outstanding debt. We bear all other costs and expenses of our operations, administration and transactions, including those relating to:\nTable 284: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> calculating individual asset values and our net asset value (including the cost and expenses of any independent valuation firms);\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 285: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> expenses, including travel expenses, incurred by the Adviser, or members of our Investment Team, or payable to third parties, in respect of due diligence on prospective portfolio companies and, if necessary, in respect of enforcing our rights with respect to investments in existing portfolio companies;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 286: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> the costs of any public offerings of our common stock and other securities, including registration and listing fees;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 287: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> the Management Fee and any Incentive Fee;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 288: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> certain costs and expenses relating to distributions paid on our shares;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 289: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> administration fees payable under our Administration Agreement;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 290: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 291: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> costs of preparing financial statements and maintaining books and records and filing reports or other documents with the SEC (or other regulatory bodies) and other reporting and compliance costs, and the compensation of professionals responsible for the preparation of the foregoing, including the allocable portion of the compensation of our Chief Financial Officer, Chief Compliance Officer and other professionals who spend time on those related activities (based on the percentage of time those individuals devote, on an estimated basis, to our business and affairs);\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 292: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> debt service and other costs of borrowings or other financing arrangements;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 293: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> the Adviser's allocable share of costs incurred in providing significant managerial assistance to those portfolio companies that request it;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 294: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> amounts payable to third parties relating to, or associated with, making or holding investments;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 295: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> transfer agent and custodial fees;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 296: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> costs of hedging;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 297: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> commissions and other compensation payable to brokers or dealers;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 298: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> taxes;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 299: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> Independent Director fees and expenses;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 300: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> the costs of any reports, proxy statements or other notices to our stockholders (including printing and mailing costs), the costs of any stockholders' meetings and the compensation of investor relations personnel responsible for the preparation of the foregoing and related matters;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 301: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> our fidelity bond;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 302: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> directors and officers/errors and omissions liability insurance, and any other insurance premiums;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 303: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> indemnification payments;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 304: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> direct costs and expenses of administration, including audit, accounting, consulting and legal costs; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 305: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> all other expenses reasonably incurred by us in connection with making investments and administering our business.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe expect that during periods of asset growth, our general and administrative expenses will be relatively stable or will decline as a percentage of total assets, and will increase as a percentage of total assets during periods of asset declines.\nLeverage\nWhile as a BDC the amount of leverage that we are permitted to use is limited in significant respects, we use leverage to increase our ability to make investments. The amount of leverage we use in any period depends on a variety of factors, including cash available for investing, the cost of financing and general economic and market conditions, however, under the 1940 Act, our total borrowings are limited so that our asset coverage ratio cannot fall below 150% immediately after any borrowing, as defined in the 1940 Act. In any period, our interest expense will depend largely on the extent of our borrowing and we expect interest expense will increase as we increase leverage over time within the limits of the 1940 Act. In addition, we may dedicate assets as collateral to financing facilities from time to time.\nOn October 8, 2018, our stockholders approved the application of the minimum asset coverage ratio of 150% to us, as set forth in Section 61(a)(2) of the 1940 Act, as amended by the SBCAA. As a result and subject to certain additional disclosure requirements, as of October 9, 2018, our minimum asset coverage ratio was reduced from 200% to 150%. In other words, pursuant to Section 61(a) of the 1940 Act, as amended by the SBCAA, we are permitted to potentially increase our maximum debt-to-equity ratio from an effective level of one-to-one to two-to-one.\nMarket Trends\nWe believe trends in the middle-market lending environment, including the limited availability of capital, strong demand for debt capital and specialized lending requirements, are likely to continue to create favorable opportunities for us to invest at attractive risk-adjusted rates.\nThe limited number of dedicated providers of capital to middle-market companies, combined with increases in required capital levels for regulated financial institutions, reduces the capacity of traditional lenders to serve middle-market companies. We believe that the limited availability of capital creates a significant opportunity for us to directly originate investments. We also believe that the large amount of uninvested capital held by private equity firms will continue to drive deal activity, which may in turn create additional demand for debt capital.\nThe limited number of dedicated providers is further exacerbated by the specialized due diligence and underwriting capabilities, as well as extensive ongoing monitoring, required for middle-market lending. We believe middle-market lending is generally more labor-intensive than lending to larger companies due to smaller investment sizes and the lack of publicly available information on these companies.\nAn imbalance between the supply of, and demand for, middle-market debt capital creates attractive pricing dynamics for investors such as BDCs. The negotiated nature of middle-market financings also generally provides for more favorable terms to the lenders, including stronger covenant and reporting packages, better call protection and lender-protective change of control provisions. We believe that BDCs have flexibility to develop loans that reflect each borrower's distinct situation, provide long-term relationships and a potential source for future capital, which renders BDCs, including us, attractive lenders.\nIn late 2019 and early 2020, the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 and related respiratory disease COVID-19 emerged in China and spread rapidly across the world, including to the United States. This outbreak has led to, and for an unknown and potentially significant period of time will continue to lead to, disruptions in local, regional, national and global markets and economies affected thereby. To date, cross border commercial activity and market sentiment have been negatively impacted by the outbreak and government and other measures seeking to contain its spread. The federal government and the Federal Reserve, as well as foreign governments and central banks, have implemented significant fiscal and monetary policies in response to these disruptions, and additional government and regulatory responses may be possible. It is currently impossible to determine the scope of this or any future outbreak, how long any such outbreak and market disruption, volatility or uncertainty may last, the effect any governmental actions and changes in base interest rates will have or the full potential impact on us, our industry and our portfolio companies.\nPortfolio and Investment Activity\nAs of December 31, 2020, our portfolio based on fair value consisted of 95.6% first-lien debt investments, 0.2% second-lien debt investments, 0.5% mezzanine investments and 3.7% equity and other investments. As of December 31, 2019, our portfolio based on fair value consisted of 96.5% first-lien debt investments, 0.6% second-lien debt investments, 0.1% mezzanine investments, and 2.8% equity and other investments.\nAs of December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, our weighted average total yield of debt and income producing securities at fair value (which includes interest income and amortization of fees and discounts) was 10.0% and 10.5%, respectively, and our weighted average total yield of debt and income-producing securities at amortized cost (which includes interest income and amortization of fees and discounts) was 10.2% and 10.7%, respectively.\nAs of December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, we had investments in 70 and 63 portfolio companies, respectively, with an aggregate fair value of $2,298.9 million and $2,245.9 million, respectively.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2020, the principal amount of new investments funded was $939.0 million in 31 new portfolio companies and 27 existing portfolio companies. For this period, we had $941.3 million aggregate principal amount in exits and repayments.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2019, the principal amount of new investments funded was $1,087.6 million in 32 new portfolio companies and 14 existing portfolio companies. For this period, we had $575.2 million aggregate principal amount in exits and repayments.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2018, the principal amount of new investments funded was $816.9 million in 19 new portfolio companies and 14 existing portfolio companies. For this period, we had $790.3 million aggregate principal amount in exits and repayments.\nOur investment activity for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018 is presented below (information

For investments where there have been material defaults, including bankruptcy filings, failures to achieve financial performance requirements or failure to maintain liquidity or loan-to-value requirements, the Adviser often will take immediate action to protect its position.

Other income increased from $11.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 to $13.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, primarily due to higher amendment fees earned during 2019.\nExpenses\nOperating expenses for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018 were as follows:\nTable 329: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> For the Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> ($ in millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Interest\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 39.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 49.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 42.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Management fees (net of waivers)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 32.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 30.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 28.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Incentive fees related to pre-incentive fee net investment\nincome (net of waivers)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 31.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 27.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 30.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Incentive fees related to realized/unrealized capital gains\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Professional fees\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 6.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 6.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 7.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Directors fees\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 0.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 0.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 0.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other general and administrative\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 5.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 5.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 5.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net Expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 117.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 119.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 114.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nInterest\nInterest expense, including other debt financing expenses, decreased from $49.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 to $39.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. This decrease was primarily due to a decrease in the average interest rate on our debt outstanding due to a decrease in LIBOR and a change in the mix of our debt financing sources for the year ended December 31, 2020 which was partially offset by an increase in the average debt outstanding from $913.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 to $1,001.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. The average interest rate on our debt outstanding decreased from 4.4% for the year ended December 31, 2019 to 3.0% for the year ended December 31, 2020 due to a change in the mix of our debt financing sources and a change in LIBOR rates. For the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2020, weighted average one-month LIBOR for the year was 2.2% and 0.5%, respectively.\nInterest expense, including other debt financing expenses, increased from $42.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 to $49.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. This increase was primarily due to an increase in the average debt outstanding for the year ended December 31, 2018 from $874.3 million to $913.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 and an increase in our average interest rate on debt outstanding due to a change in the mix of our debt financing sources. The average interest rate on our debt outstanding increased from 4.1% for the year ended December 31, 2018 to 4.4% for the year ended December 31, 2019 due to a\nchange in the mix of our debt financing sources and a change in LIBOR. For the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2019, weighted average one-month LIBOR for the year was 2.0% and 2.2%, respectively.\nManagement Fees\nManagement Fees increased from $30.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 to $32.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 due to a small increase in average total assets for the year ended December 31, 2020. The Adviser did not waive any Management Fees for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2020.\nManagement Fees (gross of waivers) increased from $28.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 to $30.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 due to average total assets increasing from $1.9 billion for the year ended December 31, 2018 to $2.1 billion for the year ended December 31, 2019. Management Fees waived were less than $0.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 consisting solely of Management Fees attributable to our ownership of TCAP shares. The Adviser did not waive any Management Fees for the year ended December 31, 2019.\nAny waived Management Fees are not subject to recoupment by the Adviser.\nIncentive Fees\nIncentive Fees related to pre-Incentive Fee net investment income increased from $27.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 to $31.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. This increase resulted primarily from an increase in accelerated amortization of upfront fees and prepayment fees received during the year ended December 31, 2020 and the related increase in net investment income. There were no Incentive Fees related to pre-incentive Fee net investment income waived for the years ended December 31, 2019 or 2020. There were no Incentive Fees related to net capital gains and losses for the year ended December 31, 2019 due to cumulative realized and unrealized losses on our investments and $1.4 million of Incentive Fees were accrued for the year ended December 31, 2020 related to cumulative unrealized capital gains in excess of cumulative net realized capital gains less cumulative unrealized losses and capital gains incentive fees paid inception to date.\nIncentive Fees (gross of waivers) related to pre-Incentive Fee net investment income decreased from $30.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 to $27.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. This decrease resulted primarily from a decrease in interest from investments received during the year ended December 31, 2019 and the related decrease in net investment income. For the year ended December 31, 2018, Incentive Fees related to pre-Incentive Fee net investment income of less than $0.1 million were waived, consisting solely of Incentive Fees attributable to our ownership of the TCAP Shares. There were no Incentive Fees related to pre-incentive Fee net investment income waived for the year ended December 31, 2019. There were no Incentive Fees related to net capital gains for the year ended December 31, 2018 and the year ended December 31, 2019 due to cumulative realized and unrealized losses on our investments.\nAny waived Incentive Fees are not subject to recoupment by the Adviser.\nProfessional Fees and Other General and Administrative Expenses\nProfessional fees increased from $6.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 to $6.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 due to higher legal fees, independent third-party valuation firm and sub-agent administration costs due to a larger portfolio. Other general and administrative fees decreased from $5.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 to $5.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2020.\nProfessional fees decreased from $7.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 to $6.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 due to recognition of remaining non-recurring expenses associated with the initial shelf registration statement in 2018 that were previously recorded as deferred financing cost. Other general and administrative fees increased from $5.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 to $5.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2019.\nIncome Taxes, Including Excise Taxes\nWe have elected to be treated as a RIC under Subchapter M of the Code, and we intend to operate in a manner so as to continue to qualify for the tax treatment applicable to RICs. To qualify as a RIC, we must, among other things, distribute to our stockholders in each taxable year generally at least 90% of our investment company taxable income, as defined by the Code, and net tax-exempt income for that taxable year. To maintain our RIC status, we, among other things, have made and intend to continue to make the requisite distributions to our stockholders, which generally relieve us from corporate-level U.S. federal income taxes.\nDepending on the level of taxable income earned in a tax year, we can be expected to carry forward taxable income (including net capital gains, if any) in excess of current year dividend distributions from the current tax year into the next tax year and pay a nondeductible 4% U.S. federal excise tax on such taxable income, as required. To the extent that we determine that our estimated current year annual taxable income will be in excess of estimated current year dividend distributions from such income, we accrue excise tax on estimated excess taxable income.\nFor the calendar years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018 we recorded a net expense of $5.8 million, $3.8 million and $3.4 million, respectively, for U.S. federal excise tax and other taxes.\nNet Realized and Unrealized Gains and Losses\nThe following table summarizes our net realized and unrealized gains (losses) for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018:\nTable 330: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> For the Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> ($ in millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net realized gains (losses) on investments\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (3.1\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (11.4\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net realized gains on extinguishment of debt\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 0.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net realized gains (losses) on foreign currency transactions\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (0.0\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 0.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 0.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net realized losses on foreign currency investments\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (1.1\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (0.4\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (2.2\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net realized gains on foreign currency borrowings\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 0.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net realized gains (losses) on interest rate swaps\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (0.1\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 0.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net Realized Gains (Losses)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (2.6\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 2.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (10.7\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Change in unrealized gains on investments\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 74.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 45.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 44.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Change in unrealized losses on investments\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (42.4\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (27.3\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (62.8\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net Change in Unrealized Gains (Losses) on Investments\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 32.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 18.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (17.9\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Unrealized gains (losses) on foreign currency\nborrowings\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (5.1\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (3.2\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 5.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Unrealized gains (losses) on foreign\ncurrency cash and forward contracts\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (0.0\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 0.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (0.0\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Unrealized gains (losses) on interest rate swaps\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 6.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 9.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (1.7\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net Change in Unrealized Gains (Losses) on Foreign\nCurrency Transactions and Interest Rate Swaps\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 6.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 3.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net Change in Unrealized Gains (Losses)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 33.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 24.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (14.2\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nFor the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018, we had net realized losses on investments of $3.1 million, net realized gains on investments of $1.9 million and net realized losses on investments of $11.4 million, respectively. For the year ended December 31, 2020, we had net realized gains of $0.7 million on extinguishment of debt, as a result of our repurchases of our debt securities. For the year ended December 31, 2020, we had net realized losses of less than $0.1 million and for the years ended December 31 2019, and 2018, we had net realized gains of $0.1 million and $0.2 million, respectively, on foreign currency transactions, primarily as a result of translating foreign currency related to our non-USD denominated investments. For the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, we had net realized losses on foreign currency investments of $1.1 million, $0.4 million and $2.2 million, respectively. For the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018 we had net realized gains on foreign currency borrowings of $1.0 million, $0.4 million and $2.7 million, respectively. The net realized gains on foreign currency borrowings were a result of payments on our revolving credit facility. For the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 we had net realized losses of $0.1 million and net realized gains less than $0.1 million, respectively, on interest rate swaps.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2020 we had $74.4 million in unrealized gains on 53 portfolio company investments, which was offset by $42.4 million in unrealized losses on 29 portfolio company investments. Unrealized gains for the year ended December 31, 2020 resulted from an increase in fair value, primarily due to positive valuation adjustments, the positive impact on valuations from the existence of LIBOR floors, and unwind of prior period unrealized losses. Unrealized losses for the year ended December 31, 2020 resulted from the reversal of prior period unrealized gains due to realizations and negative credit-related adjustments.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2019 we had $45.6 million in unrealized gains on 53 portfolio company investments, which was offset by $27.3 million in unrealized losses on 23 portfolio company investments. Unrealized gains for the year ended December 31, 2019 resulted from an increase in fair value, primarily due to positive valuation adjustments and changes in credit spreads. Unrealized losses for the year ended December 31, 2019 resulted from the unwind of prior period unrealized gains due to realizations and negative credit-related adjustments.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2018 we had $44.9 million in unrealized gains on 17 portfolio company investments, which was offset by $62.8 million in unrealized losses on 50 portfolio company investments. Unrealized gains for the year ended December 31, 2018 resulted from an increase in fair value, primarily due to reversal of prior period unrealized losses and positive valuation adjustments. Unrealized losses for the year ended December 31, 2018 resulted from the unwind of prior period unrealized gains on realized investments, widening credit spreads, and in some instances negative credit-related adjustments.\nFor the years ended December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019 we had unrealized losses on foreign currency borrowings of $5.1 million and $3.2 million, respectively, primarily as a result of fluctuations in the AUD, CAD, and EUR exchange rates. For the year ended December 31, 2018, we had unrealized gains on foreign currency borrowings of $5.4 million, primarily as a result of fluctuations in the AUD, CAD, and EUR exchange rates. For the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018, we had unrealized losses on foreign currency cash and forward contracts of less than $0.1 million, unrealized gains on foreign currency cash and forward contracts of less than $0.1 million, and unrealized losses on foreign currency cash and forward contracts of less than $0.1 million, primarily as a result of settling our foreign currency forward contracts. For the year ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 we had unrealized gains on interest rate swaps of $6.8 million and $9.2 million, respectively and for the year ended December 31, 2018, we had unrealized losses on interest rate swaps of $1.7 million, due to fluctuations in interest rates.\nRealized Gross Internal Rate of Return\nSince we began investing in 2011 through December 31, 2020, weighted by capital invested, our exited investments have generated an average realized gross internal rate of return to us of 19.2% (based on total capital invested of $4.9 billion and total proceeds from these exited investments of $6.2 billion). Ninety-one percent of these exited investments resulted in a realized gross internal rate of return to us of 10% or greater.\nGross IRR, with respect to an investment, is calculated based on the dates that we invested capital and dates we received distributions, regardless of when we made distributions to our stockholders. Initial investments are assumed to occur at time zero, and all cash flows are deemed to occur on the fifteenth of each month in which they occur.\nGross IRR reflects historical results relating to our past performance and is not necessarily indicative of our future results. In addition, gross IRR does not reflect the effect of Management Fees, expenses, Incentive Fees or taxes borne, or to be borne, by us or our stockholders, and would be lower if it did.\nAverage gross IRR is the average of the gross IRR for each of our exited investments (each calculated as described above), weighted by the total capital invested for each of those investments.\nAverage gross IRR on our exited investments reflects only invested and realized cash amounts as described above, and does not reflect any unrealized gains or losses in our portfolio.\nInternal rate of return, or IRR, is a measure of our discounted cash flows (inflows and outflows). Specifically, IRR is the discount rate at which the net present value of all cash flows is equal to zero. That is, IRR is the discount rate at which the present value of total capital invested in each of our investments is equal to the present value of all realized returns from that investment. Our IRR calculations are unaudited.\nCapital invested, with respect to an investment, represents the aggregate cost basis allocable to the realized or unrealized portion of the investment, net of any upfront fees paid at closing for the term loan portion of the investment. Capital invested also includes realized losses on hedging activity, with respect to an investment, which represents any inception-to-date realized losses on foreign currency forward contracts allocable to the investment, if any.\nRealized returns, with respect to an investment, represents the total cash received with respect to each investment, including all amortization payments, interest, dividends, prepayment fees, upfront fees, administrative fees, agent fees, amendment fees, accrued interest, and other fees and proceeds. Realized returns also include realized gains on hedging activity, with respect to an investment, which represents any inception-to-date realized gains on foreign currency forward contracts allocable to the investment, if any.\nInterest Rate and Foreign Currency Hedging\nWe use interest rate swaps to hedge our fixed rate debt and certain fixed rate investments. We have designated certain interest rate swaps to be in a hedge accounting relationship. See Note 2 for additional disclosure regarding our accounting for derivative instruments designated in a hedge accounting relationship. See Note 5 for additional disclosure regarding these derivative instruments and the interest payments paid and received. See Note 7 for additional disclosure regarding the carrying value of our debt. Our current approach to hedging the foreign currency exposure in our non-U.S. dollar denominated investments is primarily to borrow the par amount in local currency under our Revolving Credit Facility to fund these investments. For the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, we had $5.1 million and $3.2 million of unrealized losses, respectively, and for the year ended December 31, 2018 we had $5.4 million of unrealized gains on the translation of our non-U.S. dollar denominated debt into U.S. dollars; such amounts approximate the corresponding unrealized gains and losses on the translation of our non-U.S. dollar denominated investments into U.S. dollars for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018. See Note 2 for additional disclosure regarding our accounting for foreign currency. See Note 7 for additional disclosure regarding the amounts of outstanding debt denominated in each foreign currency at December 31, 2020. See our consolidated schedule of investments for additional disclosure regarding the foreign currency amounts (in both par and fair value) of our non-U.S. dollar denominated investments.\nFinancial Condition, Liquidity and Capital Resources\nOur liquidity and capital resources are derived primarily from proceeds from equity issuances, advances from our credit facilities, and cash flows from operations. The primary uses of our cash and cash equivalents are:\nTable 331: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> investments in portfolio companies and other investments and to comply with certain portfolio diversification requirements;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 332: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> the cost of operations (including paying our Adviser);\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 333: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> debt service, repayment, and other financing costs; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 334: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> cash dividends to the holders of our shares.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe intend to continue to generate cash primarily from cash flows from operations, future borrowings and future offerings of securities. We may from time to time enter into additional debt facilities, increase the size of existing facilities or issue debt securities. Any such incurrence or issuance would be subject to prevailing market conditions, our liquidity requirements, contractual and regulatory restrictions and other factors. In accordance with the 1940 Act, with certain limited exceptions, we are only allowed to incur borrowings, issue debt securities or issue preferred stock if immediately after the borrowing or issuance our ratio of total assets (less total liabilities other than indebtedness) to total indebtedness plus preferred stock, is at least 150%. For more information, see Key Components of Our Results of Operations -Leverage\u201d above. As of December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, our asset coverage ratio was 204.5%, 200.4%, and 270.5%, respectively. We carefully consider our unfunded commitments for the purpose of planning our capital resources and ongoing liquidity including our financial leverage. Further, we maintain sufficient borrowing capacity within the 150% asset coverage limitation under the 1940 Act and the asset coverage limitation under our credit facilities to cover any outstanding unfunded commitments we are required to fund.\nCash and cash equivalents as of December 31, 2020, taken together with cash available under our credit facilities, is expected to be sufficient for our investing activities and to conduct our operations in the near term. As of December 31, 2020, we had approximately $862.7 million of availability on our Revolving Credit Facility, subject to asset coverage limitations.\nAs of December 31, 2020, we had $13.3 million in cash and cash equivalents, including $10.8 million of restricted cash. During the year ended December 31, 2020, we provided $145.1 million in cash from operating activities as a result of repayments and proceeds from investments of $1,048.0 million and an increase in net assets resulting from operations of $178.1 million, which was partially offset by funding portfolio investments of $1,038.9 million, and other operating activity of $42.1 million. Lastly, cash used in financing activities was $145.9 million during the period, consisting of paydowns on our Revolving Credit Facility of $1,090.7 million, dividends paid of $130.4 million, repurchases of debt of $31.8 million, repurchases of common stock of $2.9 million, and deferred financing costs of $4.3 million, which was partially offset by borrowings of $1,114.2 million.\nAs of December 31, 2019, we had $14.1 million in cash and cash equivalents, including $9.3 million of restricted cash. During the year ended December 31, 2019, we provided $378.0 million in cash for operating activities, primarily as a result of purchases and originations of investments of $1,118.1 million and other operating activity of $36.5 million partially offset by repayments on investments of $622.0 million and an increase in net assets resulting from operations of $154.6 million. Lastly, cash provided in financing activities was $381.6 million during the period, primarily due to borrowings of $1,742.6 million (including the issuance of $300.0 million principal amount of our 2024 Notes), which were partially offset by paydowns on our Revolving Credit Facility of $1,255.2 million, dividends paid of $98.1 million, and deferred financing costs of $7.7 million.\nAs of December 31, 2020, we had $10.8 million of restricted cash pledged as collateral under our interest rate swap agreements, compared to $9.3 million as of December 31, 2019.\nEquity\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, we issued 1,366,582 and 1,111,774 shares of our common stock, respectively, to investors who have not opted out of our dividend reinvestment plan for proceeds of $22.3 million and $21.1 million, respectively. On January 15, 2021, we issued 211,904 shares of our common stock through our dividend reinvestment plan for proceeds of $4.2 million, which is not reflected in the number of shares issued for the year ended December 31, 2020 in this section or the consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2020.\nOn August 4, 2015, our Board authorized us to acquire up to $50 million in aggregate of our common stock from time to time over an initial six month period, and has continued to authorize the refreshment of the $50 million amount authorized under and extension of the stock repurchase program prior to its expiration since that time, most recently as of November 4, 2020. The amount and timing of stock repurchases under the program may vary depending on market conditions, and no assurance can be given that any particular amount of common stock will be repurchased.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2020, we repurchased 206,964 shares at a weighted average price per share of $14.17 inclusive of commissions, for a total cost of $2.9 million.

terms of our debt arrangements. We intend to continue to utilize our credit facilities to fund investments and for other general corporate purposes.\nRevolving Credit Facility\nOn August 23, 2012, we entered into a senior secured revolving credit agreement with Truist Bank (as a successor by merger to SunTrust Bank), as administrative agent, and J.P. Morgan Chase Bank, N.A., as syndication agent, and certain other lenders (as amended and restated, the Revolving Credit Facility\u201d).\nAs of December 31, 2020, aggregate commitments under the facility were $1.335 billion. Pursuant to an amendment to the Revolving Credit Facility dated as of February 5, 2021 (the Tenth Amendment\u201d), the aggregate commitments under the facility were increased to $1.485 billion. The facility includes an uncommitted accordion feature that allows us, under certain circumstances, to increase the size of the facility to up to $2.0 billion.\nPursuant to the Tenth Amendment, with respect to $1.390 billion in commitments, the revolving period, during which period we, subject to certain conditions, may make borrowings under the facility, was extended from January 31, 2024 to February 4, 2025 and the stated maturity date was extended from January 31, 2025 to February 4, 2026. For the remaining $95.0 million of commitments, the revolving period ends January 31, 2024 and the stated maturity is January 31, 2025.\nWe may borrow amounts in U.S. dollars or certain other permitted currencies. As of December 31, 2020, we had outstanding debt denominated in Australian dollars (AUD) of 51.6 million, Canadian dollars (CAD) of 74.8 million, and Euro (EUR) of 8.4 million on our Revolving Credit Facility, included in the Outstanding Principal amount in the table above.\nThe Revolving Credit Facility also provides for the issuance of letters of credit up to an aggregate amount of $75 million. As of December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, we had no outstanding letters of credit issued through the Revolving Credit Facility. The amount available for borrowing under the Revolving Credit Facility is reduced by any letters of credit issued through the Revolving Credit Facility.\nAmounts drawn under the Revolving Credit Facility, including amounts drawn in respect of letters of credit, bear interest at either LIBOR plus a margin of either 1.75% or 1.875%, or the base rate plus a margin of either 0.75% or 0.875%, in each case, based on the total amount of the borrowing base relative to the sum of the total commitments (or, if greater, the total exposure) under the Revolving Credit Facility plus certain other designated secured debt. We may elect either the LIBOR or base rate at the time of drawdown, and loans may be converted from one rate to another at any time, subject to certain conditions. We also pay a fee of 0.375% on undrawn amounts and, in respect of each undrawn letter of credit, a fee and interest rate equal to the then applicable margin while the letter of credit is outstanding.\nThe Revolving Credit Facility is guaranteed by Sixth Street SL SPV, LLC, TC Lending, LLC and Sixth Street SL Holding, LLC. The Revolving Credit Facility is secured by a perfected first-priority security interest in substantially all the portfolio investments held by us and each guarantor. Proceeds from borrowings may be used for general corporate purposes, including the funding of portfolio investments.\nThe Revolving Credit Facility includes customary events of default, as well as customary covenants, including restrictions on certain distributions and financial covenants. The financial covenants require:\nTable 343: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> an asset coverage ratio of no less than 1.5 to 1 on the last day of any fiscal quarter;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 344: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> a liquidity test under which we must not maintain cash and liquid investments of less than 10% of the covered debt amount for more than 30 consecutive business days under circumstances where our adjusted covered debt balance is greater than 90% of our adjusted borrowing base under the facility;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 345: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> stockholders' equity of at least $500 million plus 25% of the net proceeds of the sale of equity interests after January 31, 2020;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 346: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> a minimum asset coverage ratio of no less than 2 to 1 with respect to (i) the consolidated assets of the Company and the subsidiary guarantors (including certain limitations on the contribution of equity in financing subsidiaries) to (ii) the secured debt of the Company and its subsidiary guarantors plus unsecured senior securities of the Company and its subsidiary guarantors that mature within 90 days of the date of determination (the Obligor Asset Coverage Ratio\u201d); and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 347: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> minimum consolidated assets of the Company and the subsidiary guarantors (including certain limitations on the contribution of equity in financing subsidiaries), less total secured debt of the Company and the subsidiary guarantors, of at least $350 million at the last day of any fiscal quarter.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe Revolving Credit Facility also contains certain additional concentration limits in connection with the calculation of the borrowing base, based on the Obligor Asset Coverage Ratio.\nNet proceeds received from our common stock issuance in March 2018 and net proceeds received from the issuance of the 2022 Convertible Notes, 2023 Notes and 2024 Notes were used to pay down borrowings on the Revolving Credit Facility.\n2019 Convertible Notes\nIn June 2014, we issued in a private offering $115 million aggregate principal amount convertible notes due December 2019 (the 2019 Convertible Notes\u201d). The 2019 Convertible Notes were issued in a private placement only to qualified institutional buyers pursuant to Rule 144A under the Securities Act. The 2019 Convertible Notes were unsecured and bore interest at a rate of 4.50% per year, payable semiannually. The 2019 Convertible Notes matured on December 15, 2019 and were fully repaid in cash. The swap transaction associated with the issuance of the 2019 Convertible Notes also matured on December 15, 2019.\n2022 Convertible Notes\nIn February 2017, we issued in a private offering $115 million aggregate principal amount convertible notes due August 2022 (the 2022 Convertible Notes\u201d and, together with the 2019 Convertible Notes, the Convertible Notes\u201d). The 2022 Convertible Notes were issued in a private placement only to qualified institutional buyers pursuant to Rule 144A under the Securities Act. The 2022 Convertible Notes are unsecured, and bear interest at a rate of 4.50% per year, payable semiannually. The 2022 Convertible Notes will mature on August 1, 2022. In certain circumstances, the 2022 Convertible Notes will be convertible into cash, shares of our common stock or a combination of cash and shares of our common stock, at our election, at an initial conversion rate of 46.8516 shares of common stock per $1,000 principal amount of 2022 Convertible Notes, which is equivalent to an initial conversion price of approximately $21.34 per share of our common stock, subject to customary anti-dilution adjustments. As of December 31, 2020, the estimated adjusted conversion price was approximately $19.80 per share of common stock. The sale of the 2022 Convertible Notes generated net proceeds of approximately $111.2 million. We used the net proceeds of the offering to pay down debt under the Revolving Credit Facility. In connection with the offering of 2022 Convertible Notes, we have entered into an interest rate swap to continue to align the interest rates of our liabilities with our investment portfolio, which consists of predominately floating rate loans. As a result of the swaps, our effective interest rate on the original issuance of 2022 Convertible Notes is three-month LIBOR plus 2.37%.\nIn June 2018, we issued an additional $57.5 million aggregate principal amount of 2022 Convertible Notes. The additional 2022 Convertible Notes were issued with identical terms, and are fungible with and are part of a single series with the previously outstanding $115 million aggregate principal amount of our 2022 Convertible Notes issued in February 2017. In connection with the reopening of the 2022 Convertible Notes, we entered into interest rate swaps to continue to align the interest rates of its liabilities with its investment portfolio, which consists of predominantly floating rate loans. As a result of the additional swaps, our effective interest rate on the additional 2022 Convertible Notes is approximately three-month LIBOR plus 1.60%. See Note 5 for further information related to our interest rate swaps.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2020, we repurchased on the open market and extinguished $29.7 million in aggregate principal amount of the 2022 Convertible Notes for $29.5 million. These repurchases resulted in a gain on extinguishment of debt of less than $0.7 million. This gain is included in the extinguishment of debt in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations. In connection with the repurchases of the 2022 Convertible Notes, we entered into floating-to-fixed interest rate swaps with an aggregate notional amount equal to the amount of 2022 Convertible Notes repurchased, which has the effect of reducing the notional exposure of the fixed-to-floating interest rate swaps, which were entered into in connection with the issuance of the 2022 Convertible Notes, to match the current principal amount of the 2022 Convertible Notes outstanding. As a result of the swaps, our effective interest rate on the outstanding 2022 Convertible Notes is three-month LIBOR plus 2.11% (on a weighted-average basis).\nHolders may convert their 2022 Convertible Notes at their option at any time prior to February 1, 2022 only under the following circumstances: (1) during any calendar quarter commencing after the calendar quarter ending on June 30, 2017 (and only during such calendar quarter), if the last reported sale price of the common stock for at least 20 trading days (whether or not consecutive) during a period of 30 consecutive trading days ending on the last trading day of the immediately preceding calendar quarter is greater than or equal to 130% of the conversion price on each applicable trading day; (2) during the five business day period after any five consecutive trading day period (the measurement period\u201d) in which the trading price (as defined in the indenture governing the 2022 Convertible Notes) per $1,000 principal amount of notes for each trading day of the measurement period was less than 98% of the product of the last reported sale price of our common stock and the conversion rate on each such trading day; or (3) upon the occurrence of specified corporate events. On or after February 1, 2022 until the close of business on the scheduled trading day immediately preceding the maturity date, holders may convert their notes at any time, regardless of the occurrence or nonoccurrence of any of the foregoing circumstances.\nThe 2022 Convertible Notes are our unsecured obligations and rank senior in right of payment to our future indebtedness that is expressly subordinated in right of payment to the 2022 Convertible Notes; equal in right of payment to our existing and future indebtedness that is not so subordinated; effectively junior in right of payment to any of our secured indebtedness (including unsecured indebtedness that we later secure) to the extent of the value of the assets securing such indebtedness; and structurally junior to all existing and future indebtedness (including trade payables) incurred by our subsidiaries, financing vehicles or similar facilities.\nAs of December 31, 2020, the principal amount of the 2022 Convertible Notes was exceeded by the value of the underlying shares multiplied by the per share closing price of our common stock. However, the conditions required for conversion prior to maturity had not been satisfied. As of December 31, 2019, the principal amount of the 2022 Convertible Notes was exceeded by the value of the underlying shares multiplied by the per share closing price of our common stock. However, the conditions required for conversion prior to maturity had not been satisfied.\nThe indenture governing the 2022 Convertible Notes contains certain covenants, including covenants requiring us to comply with the applicable asset coverage ratio requirement under the 1940 Act and to provide financial information to the holders of the 2022 Convertible Notes under certain circumstances. These covenants are subject to important limitations and exceptions that are described in the indenture governing the 2022 Convertible Notes. As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, we were in compliance with the terms of the indenture governing the 2022 Convertible Notes.\nThe 2022 Convertible Notes are accounted for in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification ( ASC\u201d) Topic 470-20. Upon conversion of any of the 2022 Convertible Notes, we intend to pay the outstanding principal amount in cash and, to the extent that the conversion value exceeds the principal amount, we have the option to pay in cash or shares of our common stock (or a combination of cash and shares) in respect of the excess amount, subject to the requirements of the indenture governing the 2022 Convertible Notes. We have determined that the embedded conversion options in the 2022 Convertible Notes are not required to be separately accounted for as a derivative under U.S. GAAP. In accounting for the 2022 Convertible Notes, we estimated at the time of issuance separate debt and equity components of the 2022 Convertible Notes. An original issue discount equal to the equity components of the 2022 Convertible Notes was recorded in additional paid-in capital\u201d in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet. Additionally, the issuance costs associated with the 2022 Convertible Notes were allocated to the debt and equity components in proportion to the allocation of the proceeds and accounted for as deferred financing costs and equity issuance costs, respectively.\n2023 Notes\nIn January 2018, we issued $150.0 million aggregate principal amount of unsecured notes that mature on January 22, 2023 (the 2023 Notes\u201d). The principal amount of the 2023 Notes is payable at maturity. The 2023 Notes bear interest at a rate of 4.50% per year, payable semi-annually commencing on July 22, 2018, and may be redeemed in whole or in part at our option at any time at par plus a make whole\u201d premium. Total proceeds from the issuance of the 2023 Notes, net of underwriting discounts and offering costs, were $146.9 million. We used the net proceeds of the 2023 Notes to repay outstanding indebtedness under the Revolving Credit Facility.\nIn connection with the 2023 Notes offering, we entered into an interest rate swap to continue to align the interest rates of our liabilities with our investment portfolio, which consists of predominately floating rate loans. As a result of the swap, our effective interest rate on the 2023 Notes is three-month LIBOR plus 1.99%.\n2024 Notes\nIn November 2019, we issued $300.0 million aggregate principal amount of unsecured notes that mature on November 1, 2024 (the 2024 Notes\u201d). The principal amount of the 2024 Notes is payable at maturity. The 2024 Notes bear interest at a rate of 3.875% per year, payable semi-annually commencing on May 1, 2020, and may be redeemed in whole or in part at our option at any time at par plus a make whole\u201d premium. Total proceeds from the issuance of the 2024 Notes, net of underwriting discounts, offering costs and original issue discount were $292.9 million. We used the net proceeds of the 2024 Notes to repay outstanding indebtedness under the Revolving Credit Facility.\nOn February 5, 2020, we issued an additional $50.0 million aggregate principal amount of unsecured notes that mature on November 1, 2024. The additional 2024 Notes are a further issuance of, fungible with, rank equally in right of payment with and have the same terms (other than the issue date and the public offering price) as the initial issuance of 2024 Notes. Total proceeds from the issuance of the additional 2024 Notes, net of underwriting discounts, offering costs and original issue premium were $50.1 million. We used the net proceeds of the 2024 Notes to repay outstanding indebtedness under the Revolving Credit Facility.\nIn connection with the 2024 Notes offering and reopening of the 2024 Notes, we entered into interest rate swaps to continue to align the interest rates of our liabilities with our investment portfolio, which consists of predominately floating rate loans. As a result of the swaps, our effective interest rate on the 2024 Notes is three-month LIBOR plus 2.28% (on a weighted average basis).\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2020, we repurchased on the open market and extinguished $2.5 million in aggregate principal amount of the 2024 Notes for $2.4 million. These repurchases resulted in a gain on extinguishment of debt of less than $0.1 million. This gain is included in the extinguishment of debt in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations. In connection with the repurchase of the 2024 Notes, we entered into a floating-to-fixed interest rate swap with a notional amount equal to the amount of 2024 Notes repurchased, which has the effect of reducing the notional exposure of the fixed-to-floating interest rate swaps, which were entered into in connection with the issuance of the 2024 Notes, to match the current principal amount of the 2024 Notes outstanding. As a result of the swap, our effective interest rate on the outstanding 2024 Notes is three-month LIBOR plus 2.28% (on a weighted average basis).\n2026 Notes\nOn February 3, 2021, we issued $300.0 million aggregate principal amount of unsecured notes that mature on August 1, 2026 (the 2026 Notes\u201d). The principal amount of the 2026 Notes is payable at maturity. The 2026 Notes bear interest at a rate of 2.50% per year, payable semi-annually commencing on August 1, 2021, and may be redeemed in whole or in part at our option at any time at par plus a make whole\u201d premium.

We used the net proceeds of the 2026 Notes to repay outstanding indebtedness under the Revolving Credit Facility.\nIn connection with the issuance of the 2026 Notes, we entered into an interest rate swap to continue to align the interest rates of our liabilities with our investment portfolio, which consists of predominantly floating rate loans. As a result of the swap, our effective interest rate on the 2026 Notes is three-month LIBOR plus 1.91%.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nPortfolio Company Commitments\nFrom time to time, we may enter into commitments to fund investments. We incorporate these commitments into our assessment of our liquidity position. Our senior secured revolving loan commitments are generally available on a borrower's demand and may remain outstanding until the maturity date of the applicable loan. Our senior secured term loan commitments are generally available on a borrower's demand and, once drawn, generally have the same remaining term as the associated loan agreement. Undrawn senior secured term loan commitments generally have a shorter availability period than the term of the associated loan agreement. As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, we had the following commitments to fund investments in current portfolio companies:\nTable 348: <table> <tr> <td> ($ in millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> December 31, 2020\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> December 31, 2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Alpha Midco, Inc. -

As of December 31, 2020, management is not aware of any material pending or threatened litigation that would require accounting recognition or financial statement disclosure.\nWe have certain contracts under which we have material future commitments. Under the Investment Advisory Agreement, our Adviser provides us with investment advisory and management services. For these services, we pay the Management Fee and the Incentive Fee.\nUnder the Administration Agreement, our Adviser furnishes us with office facilities and equipment, provides us clerical, bookkeeping and record keeping services at such facilities and provides us with other administrative services necessary to conduct our day-to-day operations. We reimburse our Adviser for the allocable portion (subject to the review and approval of our Board) of expenses incurred by it in performing its obligations under the Administration Agreement, the fees and expenses associated with performing compliance functions and our allocable portion of the compensation of our Chief Compliance Officer, Chief Financial Officer and other professionals who spend time on those related activities (based on a percentage of time those individuals devote, on an estimated basis, to our business and affairs). Our Adviser also offers on our behalf significant managerial assistance to those portfolio companies to which we are required to offer to provide such assistance.\nContractual Obligations\nA summary of our contractual payment obligations as of December 31, 2020 is as follows:\nTable 351: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Payments Due by Period\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Less than\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> ($ in millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1 year\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1-3 years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3-5 years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> After 5 years\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Revolving Credit Facility\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 472.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 472.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> 2022 Convertible Notes\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 142.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 142.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> 2023 Notes\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 150.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 150.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> 2024 Notes\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 347.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 347.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total Contractual Obligations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,112.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 292.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 819.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nIn addition to the contractual payment obligations in the tables above, we also have commitments to fund investments and to pledge assets as collateral under the terms of our derivatives agreements.\nDistributions\nWe have elected and qualified to be treated for U.S. federal income tax purposes as a RIC under subchapter M of the Code. To maintain our RIC status, we must distribute (or be treated as distributing) in each taxable year dividends for tax purposes equal to at least 90 percent of the sum of our:\nTable 352: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> investment company taxable income (which is generally our ordinary income plus the excess of realized net short-term capital gains over realized net long-term capital losses), determined without regard to the deduction for dividends paid, for such taxable year; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 353: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> net tax-exempt interest income (which is the excess of our gross tax exempt interest income over certain disallowed deductions) for such taxable year.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nAs a RIC, we (but not our stockholders) generally will not be subject to U.S. federal income tax on investment company taxable income and net capital gains that we distribute to our stockholders.\nWe intend to distribute annually all or substantially all of such income. To the extent that we retain our net capital gains or any investment company taxable income, we generally will be subject to corporate-level U.S. federal income tax. We may choose to retain our net capital gains or any investment company taxable income, and pay the U.S. federal excise tax described below.\nAmounts not distributed on a timely basis in accordance with a calendar year distribution requirement are subject to a nondeductible 4% U.S. federal excise tax payable by us. To avoid this tax, we must distribute (or be treated as distributing) during each calendar year an amount at least equal to the sum of:\nTable 354: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> 98% of our net ordinary income excluding certain ordinary gains or losses for that calendar year;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 355: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> 98.2% of our capital gain net income, adjusted for certain ordinary gains and losses, recognized for the twelve-month period ending on October 31 of that calendar year; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 356: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> 100% of any income or gains recognized, but not distributed, in preceding years.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nWhile we intend to distribute any income and capital gains in the manner necessary to minimize imposition of the 4% U.S. federal excise tax, sufficient amounts of our taxable income and capital gains may not be distributed to avoid entirely the imposition of this tax. In that event, we will be liable for this tax only on the amount by which we do not meet the foregoing distribution requirement.\nWe intend to pay quarterly dividends to our stockholders out of assets legally available for distribution. All dividends will be paid at the discretion of our Board and will depend on our earnings, financial condition, maintenance of our RIC status, compliance with applicable BDC regulations and such other factors as our Board may deem relevant from time to time.\nTo the extent our current taxable earnings for a year fall below the total amount of our distributions for that year, a portion of those distributions may be deemed a return of capital to our stockholders for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Thus, the source of a distribution to our stockholders may be the original capital invested by the stockholder rather than our income or gains. Stockholders should read any written disclosure carefully and should not assume that the source of any distribution is our ordinary income or gains.\nWe have adopted an opt out\u201d dividend reinvestment plan for our common stockholders. As a result, if we declare a cash dividend or other distribution, each stockholder that has not opted out\u201d of our dividend reinvestment plan will have their dividends or distributions automatically reinvested in additional shares of our common stock rather than receiving cash dividends. Stockholders who receive distributions in the form of shares of common stock will be subject to the same U.S. federal, state and local tax consequences as if they received cash distributions.\nRelated-Party Transactions\nWe have entered into a number of business relationships with affiliated or related parties, including the following:\nTable 357: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> the Investment Advisory Agreement;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 358: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> the Administration Agreement; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 359: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> an ongoing agreement with an affiliate of TPG governing, inter alia, the parties' respective ownership of and rights to use the Sixth Street\u201d and TPG\u201d trademarks and certain variations thereof.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nCritical Accounting Policies\nThe preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, and expenses. Changes in the economic environment, financial markets, and any other parameters used in determining such estimates could cause actual results to differ. Our critical accounting policies, including those relating to the valuation of our investment portfolio, are described below. The critical accounting policies should be read in connection with our risk factors as disclosed in ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS.\u201d\nInvestments at Fair Value\nLoan originations are recorded on the date of the binding commitment, which is generally the funding date. Investment transactions purchased through the secondary markets are recorded on the trade date. Realized gains or losses are measured by the difference between the net proceeds received (excluding prepayment fees, if any) and the amortized cost basis of the investment without regard to unrealized gains or losses previously recognized, and include investments charged off during the period, net of recoveries. The net\nchange in unrealized gains or losses primarily reflects the change in investment values and also includes the reversal of previously recorded unrealized gains or losses with respect to investments realized during the period.\nInvestments for which market quotations are readily available are typically valued at those market quotations. To validate market quotations, we utilize a number of factors to determine if the quotations are representative of fair value, including the source and number of the quotations. Debt and equity securities that are not publicly traded or whose market prices are not readily available, as is the case for substantially all of our investments, are valued at fair value as determined in good faith by our Board, based on, among other things, the input of the Adviser, our Audit Committee and independent third-party valuation firms engaged at the direction of the Board.\nAs part of the valuation process, the Board takes into account relevant factors in determining the fair value of our investments, including and in combination of:\nTable 360: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> the estimated enterprise value of a portfolio company (that is, the total value of the portfolio company's net debt and equity);\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 361: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> the nature and realizable value of any collateral;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 362: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> the portfolio company's ability to make payments based on its earnings and cash flow;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 363: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> the markets in which the portfolio company does business;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 364: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> a comparison of the portfolio company's securities to any similar publicly traded securities; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 365: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> overall changes in the interest rate environment and the credit markets that may affect the price at which similar investments may be made in the future.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nWhen an external event, such as a purchase transaction, public offering or subsequent equity sale occurs, the Board considers whether the pricing indicated by the external event corroborates our valuation.\nThe Board undertakes a multi-step valuation process, which includes, among other procedures, the following:\nTable 366: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> The valuation process begins with each investment being initially valued by the investment professionals responsible for the portfolio investment in conjunction with the portfolio management team.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 367: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> The Adviser's management reviews the preliminary valuations with the investment professionals. Agreed-upon valuation recommendations are presented to the Audit Committee.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 368: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> The Audit Committee reviews the valuations presented and recommends values for each investment to the Board.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 369: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> The Board reviews the recommended valuations and determines the fair value of each investment; valuations that are not based on readily available market quotations are valued in good faith based on, among other things, the input of the Adviser, Audit Committee and, where applicable, other third parties, including independent third party valuation firms engaged at the direction of the Board.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe conduct this valuation process on a quarterly basis.\nThe Board has engaged independent third-party valuation firms to perform certain limited procedures that the Board has identified and requested them to perform in connection with the valuation process. At December 31, 2020, the independent third-party valuation firms performed their procedures over substantially all of our investments. Upon completion of such limited procedures, the third-party valuation firms determined that the fair value, as determined by the Board, of those investments subjected to their limited procedures, appeared reasonable.\nWe apply Financial Accounting Standards Board Accounting Standards Codification Topic 820, Fair Value Measurement ( ASC Topic 820\u201d), as amended, which establishes a framework for measuring fair value in accordance with U.S. GAAP and required disclosures of fair value measurements. ASC Topic 820 determines fair value to be the price that would be received for an investment in a current sale, which assumes an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. Market participants are defined as buyers and sellers in the principal or most advantageous market (which may be a hypothetical market) that are independent, knowledgeable, and willing and able to transact. In accordance with ASC Topic 820, we consider our principal market to be the market that has the greatest volume and level of activity. ASC Topic 820 specifies a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes and ranks the level of observability of inputs used in determination of fair value. In accordance with ASC Topic 820, these levels are summarized below:\nTable 370: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> Level 1-Valuations based on quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that we have the ability to access.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 371: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 372: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> Level 2-Valuations based on quoted prices in markets that are not active or for which all significant inputs are observable, either directly or indirectly.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 373: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> Level 3-Valuations based on inputs that are unobservable and significant to the overall fair value measurement.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTransfers between levels, if any, are recognized at the beginning of the quarter in which the transfers occur. In addition to using the above inputs in investment valuations, we apply the valuation policy approved by our Board that is consistent with ASC Topic 820. Consistent with the valuation policy, we evaluate the source of inputs, including any markets in which our investments are trading (or any markets in which securities with similar attributes are trading), in determining fair value. When a security is valued based on prices provided by reputable dealers or pricing services (that is, broker quotes), we subject those prices to various additional criteria in making the determination as to whether a particular investment would qualify for treatment as a Level 2 or Level 3 investment. For example, we review pricing and methodologies provided by dealers or pricing services in order to determine if observable market information is being used, versus unobservable inputs. Some additional factors considered include the number of prices obtained, as well as an assessment as to their quality, such as the depth of the relevant market relative to the size of the Company's position.\nOur accounting policy on the fair value of our investments is critical because the determination of fair value involves subjective judgments and estimates. Accordingly, the notes to our consolidated financial statements express the uncertainty with respect to the possible effect of these valuations, and any change in these valuations, on the consolidated financial statements.\nSee Note 6 to our consolidated financial statements included in this Form 10-K for more information on the fair value of our investments.\nInterest and Dividend Income Recognition\nInterest income is recorded on an accrual basis and includes the amortization of discounts and premiums. Discounts and premiums to par value on securities purchased or originated are amortized into interest income over the contractual life of the respective security using the effective interest method. The amortized cost of investments represents the original cost adjusted for the amortization of discounts and premiums, if any.\nUnless providing services in connection with an investment, such as syndication, structuring or diligence, all or a portion of any loan fees received by us will be deferred and amortized over the investment's life using the effective interest method.\nLoans are generally placed on non-accrual status when principal or interest payments are past due 30 days or more or when management has reasonable doubt that the borrower will pay principal or interest in full. Accrued and unpaid interest is generally reversed when a loan is placed on non-accrual status. Interest payments received on non-accrual loans may be recognized as income or applied to principal depending upon management's judgment regarding collectability. Non-accrual loans are restored to accrual status when past due principal and interest has been paid and, in management's judgment, the borrower is likely to make principal and interest payments in the future. Management may determine to not place a loan on non-accrual status if, notwithstanding any failure to pay, the loan has sufficient collateral value and is in the process of collection.\nDividend income on preferred equity securities is recorded on an accrual basis to the extent that such amounts are payable by the portfolio company and are expected to be collected. Dividend income on common equity securities is recorded on the record date for private portfolio companies or on the ex-dividend date for publicly traded portfolio companies.\nOur accounting policy on interest and dividend income recognition is critical because it involves the primary source of our revenue and accordingly is significant to the financial results as disclosed in our consolidated financial statements.\nU.S. Federal Income Taxes\nWe have elected to be treated as a BDC under the 1940 Act. We also have elected to be treated as a RIC under the Code. So long as we maintain our status as a RIC, we will generally not pay corporate-level U.S. federal income or excise taxes on any ordinary income or capital gains that we distribute at least annually to our stockholders as dividends. As a result, any tax liability related to income earned and distributed by us represents obligations of our stockholders and will not be reflected in our consolidated financial statements.\nWe evaluate tax positions taken or expected to be taken in the course of preparing our financial statements to determine whether the tax positions are more-likely-than-not\u201d to be sustained by the applicable tax authority. Tax positions not deemed to meet the more-likely-than-not\u201d threshold are reversed and recorded as a tax benefit or expense in the current year. All penalties and interest associated with income taxes are included in income tax expense. Conclusions regarding tax positions are subject to review and may be adjusted at a later date based on factors including, but not limited to, on-going analyses of tax laws, regulations and interpretations thereof. As of December 31, 2020, the Company did not have any uncertain tax positions that met the recognition or measurement\ncriteria, nor did the Company have any unrecognized tax benefits. Our 2019, 2018 and 2017 tax year returns remain subject to examination by the relevant federal, state, and local tax authorities.\nOur accounting policy on income taxes is critical because if we are unable to maintain our status as a RIC, we would be required to record a provision for corporate-level U.S. federal income taxes which may be significant to our financial results.", "item_7_truncated": "ITEM 7.

This discussion contains forward-looking statements and involves numerous risks and uncertainties, including, but not limited to, those described in ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS.\u201d Actual results may differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statements.\nOverview\nSixth Street Specialty Lending, Inc. (formerly known as TPG Specialty Lending, Inc.) is a Delaware corporation formed on July 21, 2010. Effective June 15, 2020, we changed our name from TPG Specialty Lending, Inc. to Sixth Street Specialty Lending, Inc. The Adviser is our external manager. We have four wholly owned subsidiaries, TC Lending, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company, which holds a California finance lender and broker license, Sixth Street SL SPV, LLC (formerly known as TPG SL SPV, LLC), a Delaware limited liability company, in which we hold assets that were previously used to support our asset-backed credit facility, Sixth Street SL Holding, LLC (formerly known as TSL MR, LLC), a Delaware limited liability company, in which we hold certain investments, and Sixth Street Specialty Lending Sub, LLC, a Cayman Islands limited liability company, in which we plan to hold certain investments.\nWe have elected to be regulated as a BDC under the 1940 Act and as a RIC under the Code. We made our BDC election on April 15, 2011. As a result, we are required to comply with various statutory and regulatory requirements, such as:\n \u2022 the requirement to invest at least 70% of our assets in qualifying assets\u201d; \n \u2022 source of income limitations; \n \u2022 asset diversification requirements; and \n \u2022 the requirement to distribute (or be treated as distributing) in each taxable year at least 90% of our investment company taxable income and tax-exempt interest for that taxable year. \nOur shares are currently listed on the NYSE under the symbol TSLX.\u201d\nOur Investment Framework\nWe are a specialty finance company focused on lending to middle-market companies. Since we began our investment activities in July 2011, through December 31, 2020, we have originated more than $15.8 billion aggregate principal amount of investments and retained approximately $7.2 billion aggregate principal amount of these investments on our balance sheet prior to any subsequent exits and repayments. We seek to generate current income primarily in U.S.-domiciled middle-market companies through direct originations of senior secured loans and, to a lesser extent, originations of mezzanine and unsecured loans and investments in corporate bonds and equity securities.\nBy middle-market companies,\u201d we mean companies that have annual EBITDA, which we believe is a useful proxy for cash flow, of $10 million to $250 million, although we may invest in larger or smaller companies on occasion. As of December 31, 2020, our core portfolio companies, which exclude certain investments that fall outside of our typical borrower profile and represent 87.1% of our total investments based on fair value, had weighted average annual revenue of $116.6 million and weighted average annual EBITDA of $40.9 million.\nWe invest in first-lien debt, second-lien debt, mezzanine and unsecured debt and equity and other investments. Our first-lien debt may include stand-alone first-lien loans; last out\u201d first-lien loans, which are loans that have a secondary priority behind super-senior first out\u201d first-lien loans; unitranche\u201d loans, which are loans that combine features of first-lien, second-lien and mezzanine debt,\ngenerally in a first-lien position; and secured corporate bonds with similar features to these categories of first-lien loans. Our second-lien debt may include secured loans, and, to a lesser extent, secured corporate bonds, with a secondary priority behind first-lien debt.\nThe debt in which we invest typically is not rated by any rating agency, but if these instruments were rated, they would likely receive a rating of below investment grade (that is, below BBB- or Baa3 as defined by Standard & Poor's and Moody's Investors Services, respectively), which is often referred to as junk.\u201d\nThe companies in which we invest use our capital to support organic growth, acquisitions, market or product expansion and recapitalizations (including restructurings). As of December 31, 2020, the largest single investment based on fair value represented 3.7% of our total investment portfolio.\nAs of December 31, 2020, the average investment size in each of our portfolio companies was approximately $32.8 million based on fair value.\nThrough our Adviser, we consider potential investments utilizing a four-tiered investment framework and against our existing portfolio as a whole:\nBusiness and sector selection. We focus on companies with enterprise value between $50 million and $1 billion. When reviewing potential investments, we seek to invest in businesses with high marginal cash flow, recurring revenue streams and where we believe credit quality will improve over time. We look for portfolio companies that we think have a sustainable competitive advantage in growing industries or distressed situations. We also seek companies where our investment will have a low loan-to-value ratio.\nWe currently do not limit our focus to any specific industry and we may invest in larger or smaller companies on occasion. We classify the industries of our portfolio companies by end-market (such as healthcare, and business services) and not by the products or services (such as software) directed to those end-markets.\nAs of December 31, 2020, the largest industry represented 22.2% of our total investment portfolio based on fair value.\nInvestment Structuring. We focus on investing at the top of the capital structure and protecting that position. As of December 31, 2020, approximately 95.8% of our portfolio was invested in secured debt, including 95.6% in first-lien debt investments. We carefully perform diligence and structure investments to include strong investor covenants. As a result, we structure investments with a view to creating opportunities for early intervention in the event of non-performance or stress. In addition, we seek to retain effective voting control in investments over the loans or particular class of securities in which we invest through maintaining affirmative voting positions or negotiating consent rights that allow us to retain a blocking position. We also aim for our loans to mature on a medium term, between two to six years after origination. For the year ended December 31, 2020, the weighted average term on new investment commitments in new portfolio companies was 4.6 years.\nDeal Dynamics. We focus on, among other deal dynamics, direct origination of investments, where we identify and lead the investment transaction. A substantial majority of our portfolio investments are sourced through our direct or proprietary relationships.\nRisk Mitigation. We seek to mitigate non-credit-related risk on our returns in several ways, including call protection provisions to protect future interest income. As of December 31, 2020, we had call protection on 82.0% of our debt investments based on fair value, with weighted average call prices of 107.0% for the first year, 104.3% for the second year and 101.4% for the third year, in each case from the date of the initial investment. As of December 31, 2020, 99.1% of our debt investments based on fair value bore interest at floating rates (when including investment specific hedges), with 99.2% of these subject to interest rate floors, which we believe helps act as a portfolio-wide hedge against inflation.\nRelationship with our Adviser and Sixth Street\nOur Adviser is a Delaware limited liability company. Our Adviser acts as our investment adviser and administrator and is a registered investment adviser with the SEC under the Advisers Act. Our Adviser sources and manages our portfolio through a dedicated team of investment professionals predominately focused on us. Our Investment Team is led by our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and our Adviser's Co-Chief Investment Officer Joshua Easterly and our Adviser's Co-Chief Investment Officer Alan Waxman, both of whom have substantial experience in credit origination, underwriting and asset management. Our investment decisions are made by our Investment Review Committee, which includes senior personnel of our Adviser and Sixth Street Partners, LLC, or Sixth Street.\u201d\nSixth Street is a global investment business with approximately $50 billion of assets under management. Sixth Street's core platforms include Sixth Street Specialty Lending, Sixth Street Specialty Lending Europe, which is aimed at European middle-market\nloan originations, Sixth Street TAO, which has the flexibility to invest across all of Sixth Street's private credit market investments, Sixth Street Opportunities, which focuses on actively managed opportunistic investments across the credit cycle, Sixth Street Credit Market Strategies, which is the firm's public-side\u201d credit investment platform focused on investment opportunities in broadly syndicated leveraged loan markets, Sixth Street Growth, which provides financing solutions to growing companies, Sixth Street Fundamental Strategies, which primarily invests in secondary credit, and Sixth Street Agriculture, which invests in niche agricultural opportunities. Sixth Street has a long-term oriented, highly flexible capital base that allows it to invest across industries, geographies, capital structures and asset classes. Sixth Street has extensive experience with highly complex, global public and private investments executed through primary originations, secondary market purchases and restructurings, and has a team of over 320 investment and operating professionals. As of December 31, 2020, thirty two (32) of these personnel are dedicated to our business, including twenty four (24) investment professionals.\nOur Adviser consults with Sixth Street in connection with a substantial number of our investments. The Sixth Street platform provides us with a breadth of large and scalable investment resources. We believe we benefit from Sixth Street's market expertise, insights into industry, sector and macroeconomic trends and intensive due diligence capabilities, which help us discern market conditions that vary across industries and credit cycles, identify favorable investment opportunities and manage our portfolio of investments. Sixth Street and its affiliates will refer all middle-market loan origination activities for companies domiciled in the United States to us and conduct those activities through us. The Adviser will determine whether it would be permissible, advisable or otherwise appropriate for us to pursue a particular investment opportunity allocated to us.\nOn December 16, 2014, we were granted an exemptive order from the SEC that allows us to co-invest, subject to certain conditions and to the extent the size of an investment opportunity exceeds the amount our Adviser has independently determined is appropriate to invest, with certain of our affiliates (including affiliates of Sixth Street) in middle-market loan origination activities for companies domiciled in the United States and certain follow-on\u201d investments in companies in which we have already co-invested pursuant to the order and remain invested. On January 16, 2020, we filed a further application for co-investment exemptive relief with the SEC to better align our existing co-investment relief with more recent SEC exemptive orders. There can be no assurance when or if the SEC will grant a further order in response to our application. Until such time a new order is granted, we will continue to operate under the terms of our current exemptive order.\nWe believe our ability to co-invest with Sixth Street affiliates is particularly useful where we identify larger capital commitments than otherwise would be appropriate for us. We expect that with the ability to co-invest with Sixth Street affiliates we will continue to be able to provide one-stop\u201d financing to a potential portfolio company in these circumstances, which may allow us to capture opportunities where we alone could not commit the full amount of required capital or would have to spend additional time to locate unaffiliated co-investors.\nUnder the terms of the Investment Advisory Agreement and Administration Agreement, the Adviser's services are not exclusive, and the Adviser is free to furnish similar or other services to others, so long as its services to us are not impaired. Under the terms of the Investment Advisory Agreement, we will pay the Adviser the base management fee, or the Management Fee, and may also pay certain incentive fees, or the Incentive Fees.\nUnder the terms of the Administration Agreement, the Adviser also provides administrative services to us. These services include providing office space, equipment and office services, maintaining financial records, preparing reports to stockholders and reports filed with the SEC, and managing the payment of expenses and the oversight of the performance of administrative and professional services rendered by others. Certain of these services are reimbursable to the Adviser under the terms of the Administration Agreement.\nKey Components of Our Results of Operations\nInvestments\nWe focus primarily on the direct origination of loans to middle-market companies domiciled in the United States.\nOur level of investment activity (both the number of investments and the size of each investment) can and does vary substantially from period to period depending on many factors, including the amount of debt and equity capital generally available to middle-market companies, the level of merger and acquisition activity for such companies, the general economic environment and the competitive environment for the types of investments we make.\nIn addition, as part of our risk strategy on investments, we may reduce certain levels of investments through partial sales or syndication to additional investors.\nRevenues\nWe generate revenues primarily in the form of interest income from the investments we hold. In addition, we may generate income from dividends on direct equity investments, capital gains on the sale of investments and various loan origination and other fees. Our debt investments typically have a term of two to six years, and, as of December 31, 2020, 99.1% of these investments based on fair value bore interest at a floating rate (when including investment specific hedges), with 99.2% of these subject to interest rate floors. Interest on debt investments is generally payable quarterly or semiannually. Some of our investments provide for deferred interest payments or PIK interest. For the year ended December 31, 2020, 3.2% of our total investment income was comprised of PIK interest.\nChanges in our net investment income are primarily driven by the spread between the payments we receive from our investments in our portfolio companies against our cost of funding, rather than by changes in interest rates. Our investment portfolio primarily consists of floating rate loans, and our credit facilities, 2022 Convertible Notes, 2023 Notes and 2024 Notes, after taking into account the effect of the interest rate swaps we have entered into in connection with these securities, all bear interest at floating rates. Macro trends in base interest rates like LIBOR or other alternate reference rates may affect our net investment income over the long term. However, because we generally originate loans to a small number of portfolio companies each quarter, and those investments also vary in size, our results in any given period-including the interest rate on investments that were sold or repaid in a period compared to the interest rate of new investments made during that period-often are idiosyncratic, and reflect the characteristics of the particular portfolio companies that we invested in or exited during the period and not necessarily any trends in our business.\nIn addition to interest income, our net investment income is also driven by prepayment and other fees, which also can vary significantly from quarter to quarter. The level of prepayment fees is generally correlated to the movement in credit spreads and risk premiums, but also will vary based on corporate events that may take place at an individual portfolio company in a given period-e.g., merger and acquisition activity, initial public offerings and restructurings. As noted above, generally a small but varied number of portfolio companies may make prepayments in any quarter, meaning that changes in the amount of prepayment fees received can vary significantly between periods and can vary without regard to underlying credit trends.\nLoan origination fees, original issue discount and market discount or premium are capitalized, and we accrete or amortize such amounts as interest income using the effective interest method for term instruments and the straight-line method for revolving or delayed draw instruments. Repayments of our debt investments can reduce interest income from period to period. We record prepayment premiums on loans as interest income when earned. We also may generate revenue in the form of commitment, amendment, structuring, syndication or due diligence fees, fees for providing managerial assistance and consulting fees. The frequency or volume of these items of revenue may fluctuate significantly.\nDividend income on common equity investments is recorded on the record date for private portfolio companies or on the ex-dividend date for publicly traded portfolio companies.\nOur portfolio activity also reflects the proceeds of sales of investments. We recognize realized gains or losses on investments based on the difference between the net proceeds from the disposition and the amortized cost basis of the investment without regard to unrealized gains or losses previously recognized. We record current period changes in fair value of investments that are measured at fair value as a component of the net change in unrealized gains (losses) on investments in the consolidated statements of operations.\nExpenses\nOur primary operating expenses include the payment of fees to our Adviser under the Investment Advisory Agreement, expenses reimbursable under the Administration Agreement and other operating costs described below. Additionally, we pay interest expense on our outstanding debt. We bear all other costs and expenses of our operations, administration and transactions, including those relating to:\n \u2022 calculating individual asset values and our net asset value (including the cost and expenses of any independent valuation firms); \n \u2022 expenses, including travel expenses, incurred by the Adviser, or members of our Investment Team, or payable to third parties, in respect of due diligence on prospective portfolio companies and, if necessary, in respect of enforcing our rights with respect to investments in existing portfolio companies; \n \u2022 the costs of any public offerings of our common stock and other securities, including registration and listing fees; \n \u2022 the Management Fee and any Incentive Fee; \n \u2022 certain costs and expenses relating to distributions paid on our shares; \n \u2022 administration fees payable under our Administration Agreement; \n \n \u2022 costs of preparing financial statements and maintaining books and records and filing reports or other documents with the SEC (or other regulatory bodies) and other reporting and compliance costs, and the compensation of professionals responsible for the preparation of the foregoing, including the allocable portion of the compensation of our Chief Financial Officer, Chief Compliance Officer and other professionals who spend time on those related activities (based on the percentage of time those individuals devote, on an estimated basis, to our business and affairs); \n \u2022 debt service and other costs of borrowings or other financing arrangements; \n \u2022 the Adviser's allocable share of costs incurred in providing significant managerial assistance to those portfolio companies that request it; \n \u2022 amounts payable to third parties relating to, or associated with, making or holding investments; \n \u2022 transfer agent and custodial fees; \n \u2022 costs of hedging; \n \u2022 commissions and other compensation payable to brokers or dealers; \n \u2022 taxes; \n \u2022 Independent Director fees and expenses; \n \u2022 the costs of any reports, proxy statements or other notices to our stockholders (including printing and mailing costs), the costs of any stockholders' meetings and the compensation of investor relations personnel responsible for the preparation of the foregoing and related matters; \n \u2022 our fidelity bond; \n \u2022 directors and officers/errors and omissions liability insurance, and any other insurance premiums; \n \u2022 indemnification payments; \n \u2022 direct costs and expenses of administration, including audit, accounting, consulting and legal costs; and \n \u2022 all other expenses reasonably incurred by us in connection with making investments and administering our business. \nWe expect that during periods of asset growth, our general and administrative expenses will be relatively stable or will decline as a percentage of total assets, and will increase as a percentage of total assets during periods of asset declines.\nLeverage\nWhile as a BDC the amount of leverage that we are permitted to use is limited in significant respects, we use leverage to increase our ability to make investments. The amount of leverage we use in any period depends on a variety of factors, including cash available for investing, the cost of financing and general economic and market conditions, however, under the 1940 Act, our total borrowings are limited so that our asset coverage ratio cannot fall below 150% immediately after any borrowing, as defined in the 1940 Act. In any period, our interest expense will depend largely on the extent of our borrowing and we expect interest expense will increase as we increase leverage over time within the limits of the 1940 Act. In addition, we may dedicate assets as collateral to financing facilities from time to time.\nOn October 8, 2018, our stockholders approved the application of the minimum asset coverage ratio of 150% to us, as set forth in Section 61(a)(2) of the 1940 Act, as amended by the SBCAA. As a result and subject to certain additional disclosure requirements, as of October 9, 2018, our minimum asset coverage ratio was reduced from 200% to 150%. In other words, pursuant to Section 61(a) of the 1940 Act, as amended by the SBCAA, we are permitted to potentially increase our maximum debt-to-equity ratio from an effective level of one-to-one to two-to-one.\nMarket Trends\nWe believe trends in the middle-market lending environment, including the limited availability of capital, strong demand for debt capital and specialized lending requirements, are likely to continue to create favorable opportunities for us to invest at attractive risk-adjusted rates.\nThe limited number of dedicated providers of capital to middle-market companies, combined with increases in required capital levels for regulated financial institutions, reduces the capacity of traditional lenders to serve middle-market companies. We believe that the limited availability of capital creates a significant opportunity for us to directly originate investments. We also believe that the large amount of uninvested capital held by private equity firms will continue to drive deal activity, which may in turn create additional demand for debt capital.\nThe limited number of dedicated providers is further exacerbated by the specialized due diligence and underwriting capabilities, as well as extensive ongoing monitoring, required for middle-market lending. We believe middle-market lending is generally more labor-intensive than lending to larger companies due to smaller investment sizes and the lack of publicly available information on these companies.\nAn imbalance between the supply of, and demand for, middle-market debt capital creates attractive pricing dynamics for investors such as BDCs. The negotiated nature of middle-market financings also generally provides for more favorable terms to the lenders, including stronger covenant and reporting packages, better call protection and lender-protective change of control provisions. We believe that BDCs have flexibility to develop loans that reflect each borrower's distinct situation, provide long-term relationships and a potential source for future capital, which renders BDCs, including us, attractive lenders.\nIn late 2019 and early 2020, the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 and related respiratory disease COVID-19 emerged in China and spread rapidly across the world, including to the United States. This outbreak has led to, and for an unknown and potentially significant period of time will continue to lead to, disruptions in local, regional, national and global markets and economies affected thereby. To date, cross border commercial activity and market sentiment have been negatively impacted by the outbreak and government and other measures seeking to contain its spread. The federal government and the Federal Reserve, as well as foreign governments and central banks, have implemented significant fiscal and monetary policies in response to these disruptions, and additional government and regulatory responses may be possible. It is currently impossible to determine the scope of this or any future outbreak, how long any such outbreak and market disruption, volatility or uncertainty may last, the effect any governmental actions and changes in base interest rates will have or the full potential impact on us, our industry and our portfolio companies.\nPortfolio and Investment Activity\nAs of December 31, 2020, our portfolio based on fair value consisted of 95.6% first-lien debt investments, 0.2% second-lien debt investments, 0.5% mezzanine investments and 3.7% equity and other investments. As of December 31, 2019, our portfolio based on fair value consisted of 96.5% first-lien debt investments, 0.6% second-lien debt investments, 0.1% mezzanine investments, and 2.8% equity and other investments.\nAs of December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, our weighted average total yield of debt and income producing securities at fair value (which includes interest income and amortization of fees and discounts) was 10.0% and 10.5%, respectively, and our weighted average total yield of debt and income-producing securities at amortized cost (which includes interest income and amortization of fees and discounts) was 10.2% and 10.7%, respectively.\nAs of December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, we had investments in 70 and 63 portfolio companies, respectively, with an aggregate fair value of $2,298.9 million and $2,245.9 million, respectively.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2020, the principal amount of new investments funded was $939.0 million in 31 new portfolio companies and 27 existing portfolio companies. For this period, we had $941.3 million aggregate principal amount in exits and repayments.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2019, the principal amount of new investments funded was $1,087.6 million in 32 new portfolio companies and 14 existing portfolio companies. For this period, we had $575.2 million aggregate principal amount in exits and repayments.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2018, the principal amount of new investments funded was $816.9 million in 19 new portfolio companies and 14 existing portfolio companies. For this period, we had $790.3 million aggregate principal amount in exits and repayments.\nOur investment activity for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018 is presented below (information presented herein is at par value unless otherwise indicated).\nTable 306: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> For the Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> ($ in

due 30 days or more or when management has reasonable doubt that the borrower will pay principal or interest in full. Accrued and unpaid interest is generally reversed when a loan is placed on non-accrual status. Non-accrual loans are restored to accrual status when past due principal and interest has been paid and, in management's judgment, the borrower is likely to make principal and interest payments in the future. Management may determine to not place a loan on non-accrual status if, notwithstanding any failure to pay, the loan has sufficient collateral value and is in the process of collection.

The Adviser monitors the financial trends of each portfolio company to determine if it is meeting its business plans and to assess the appropriate course of action for each company. The Adviser has a number of methods of evaluating and monitoring the performance of our investments, which may include the following:\n \u2022 assessment of success of the portfolio company in adhering to its business plan and compliance with covenants; \n \u2022 periodic and regular contact with portfolio company management and, if appropriate, the financial or strategic sponsor, to discuss financial position, requirements and accomplishments; \n \u2022 comparisons to other companies in the industry; \n \u2022 attendance at, and participation in, board meetings; and \n \u2022 review of monthly and quarterly financial statements and financial projections for portfolio companies. \nAs part of the monitoring process, the Adviser regularly assesses the risk profile of each of our investments and, on a quarterly basis, grades each investment on a risk scale of 1 to 5. Risk assessment is not standardized in our industry and our risk assessment may not be comparable to ones used by our competitors. Our assessment is based on the following categories:\n \u2022 An investment is rated 1 if, in the opinion of the Adviser, it is performing as agreed and there are no concerns about the portfolio company's performance or ability to meet covenant requirements. For these investments, the Adviser generally prepares monthly reports on investment performance and intensive quarterly asset reviews. \n \u2022 An investment is rated 2 if it is performing as agreed, but, in the opinion of the Adviser, there may be concerns about the company's operating performance or trends in the industry. For these investments, in addition to monthly reports and quarterly asset reviews, the Adviser also researches any areas of concern with the objective of early intervention with the portfolio company. \n \u2022 An investment will be assigned a rating of 3 if it is paying its obligations to us as agreed but a material covenant violation is expected. For these investments, in addition to monthly reports and quarterly asset reviews, the Adviser also adds the investment to its watch list\u201d and researches any areas of concern with the objective of early intervention with the portfolio company. \n \u2022 An investment will be assigned a rating of 4 if a material covenant has been violated, but the company is making its scheduled payments on its obligations to us. For these investments, the Adviser generally prepares a bi-monthly asset review email and generally has monthly meetings with the portfolio company's senior management. For investments where there have been material defaults, including bankruptcy filings, failures to achieve financial performance requirements or failure to maintain liquidity or loan-to-value requirements, the Adviser often will take immediate action to protect its position. These remedies may include negotiating for additional collateral, modifying investment terms or structure, or payment of amendment and waiver fees. \n \u2022 A rating of 5 indicates an investment is in default on its interest and/or principal payments. For these investments, our Adviser reviews the investments on a bi-monthly basis and, where possible, pursues workouts that achieve an early resolution to avoid further deterioration of our investment. The Adviser retains legal counsel and takes actions to preserve our rights, which may include working with the portfolio company to have the default cured, to have the investment restructured or to have the investment repaid through a consensual workout. \nThe following table shows the distribution of our investments on the 1 to 5 investment performance rating scale at fair value as of December 31, 2020 and 2019. Investment performance ratings are accurate only as of those dates and may change due to subsequent developments relating to a portfolio company's business or financial condition, market conditions or

For the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2019, weighted average one-month LIBOR for the year was 2.0% and 2.2%, respectively.\nManagement Fees\nManagement Fees increased from $30.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 to $32.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 due to a small increase in average total assets for the year ended December 31, 2020. The Adviser did not waive any Management Fees for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2020.\nManagement Fees (gross of waivers) increased from $28.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 to $30.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 due to average total assets increasing from $1.9 billion for the year ended December 31, 2018 to $2.1 billion for the year ended December 31, 2019. Management Fees waived were less than $0.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 consisting solely of Management Fees attributable to our ownership of TCAP shares. The Adviser did not waive any Management Fees for the year ended December 31, 2019.\nAny waived Management Fees are not subject to recoupment by the Adviser.\nIncentive Fees\nIncentive Fees related to pre-Incentive Fee net investment income increased from $27.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 to $31.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. This increase resulted primarily from an increase in accelerated amortization of upfront fees and prepayment fees received during the year ended December 31, 2020 and the related increase in net investment income. There were no Incentive Fees related to pre-incentive Fee net investment income waived for the years ended December 31, 2019 or 2020. There were no Incentive Fees related to net capital gains and losses for the year ended December 31, 2019 due to cumulative realized and unrealized losses on our investments and $1.4 million of Incentive Fees were accrued for the year ended December 31, 2020 related to cumulative unrealized capital gains in excess of cumulative net realized capital gains less cumulative unrealized losses and capital gains incentive fees paid inception to date.\nIncentive Fees (gross of waivers) related to pre-Incentive Fee net investment income decreased from $30.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 to $27.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. This decrease resulted primarily from a decrease in interest from investments received during the year ended December 31, 2019 and the related decrease in net investment income. For the year ended December 31, 2018, Incentive Fees related to pre-Incentive Fee net investment income of less than $0.1 million were waived, consisting solely of Incentive Fees attributable to our ownership of the TCAP Shares. There were no Incentive Fees related to pre-incentive Fee net investment income waived for the year ended December 31, 2019. There were no Incentive Fees related to net capital gains for the year ended December 31, 2018 and the year ended December 31, 2019 due to cumulative realized and unrealized losses on our investments.\nAny waived Incentive Fees are not subject to recoupment by the Adviser.\nProfessional Fees and Other General and Administrative Expenses\nProfessional fees increased from $6.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 to $6.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 due to higher legal fees, independent third-party valuation firm and sub-agent administration costs due to a larger portfolio. Other general and administrative fees decreased from $5.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 to $5.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2020.\nProfessional fees decreased from $7.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 to $6.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 due to recognition of remaining non-recurring expenses associated with the initial shelf registration statement in 2018 that were previously recorded as deferred financing cost. Other general and administrative fees increased from $5.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 to $5.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2019.\nIncome Taxes, Including Excise Taxes\nWe have elected to be treated as a RIC under Subchapter M of the Code, and we intend to operate in a manner so as to continue to qualify for the tax treatment applicable to RICs. To qualify as a RIC, we must, among other things, distribute to our stockholders in each taxable year generally at least 90% of our investment company taxable income, as defined by the Code, and net tax-exempt income for that taxable year. To maintain our RIC status, we, among other things, have made and intend to continue to make the requisite distributions to our stockholders, which generally relieve us from corporate-level U.S. federal income taxes.\nDepending on the level of taxable income earned in a tax year, we can be expected to carry forward taxable income (including net capital gains, if any) in excess of current year dividend distributions from the current tax year into the next tax year and pay a nondeductible 4% U.S. federal excise tax on such taxable income, as required. To the extent that we determine that our estimated current year annual taxable income will be in excess of estimated current year dividend distributions from such income, we accrue excise tax on estimated excess taxable income.\nFor the calendar years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018 we recorded a net expense of $5.8 million, $3.8 million and $3.4 million, respectively, for U.S. federal excise tax and other taxes.\nNet Realized and Unrealized Gains and Losses\nThe following table summarizes our net realized and unrealized gains (losses) for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018:\nTable 330: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> For the Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> ($ in millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net realized gains (losses) on investments\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (3.1\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (11.4\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net realized gains on extinguishment of debt\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 0.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net realized gains (losses) on foreign currency transactions\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (0.0\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 0.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 0.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net realized losses on foreign currency investments\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (1.1\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (0.4\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (2.2\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net realized gains on foreign currency borrowings\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 0.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net realized gains (losses) on interest rate swaps\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (0.1\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 0.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net Realized Gains (Losses)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (2.6\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 2.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (10.7\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Change in unrealized gains on investments\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 74.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 45.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 44.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Change in unrealized losses on investments\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (42.4\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (27.3\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (62.8\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net Change in Unrealized Gains (Losses) on Investments\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 32.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 18.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (17.9\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Unrealized gains (losses) on foreign currency\nborrowings\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (5.1\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (3.2\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 5.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Unrealized gains (losses) on foreign\ncurrency cash and forward contracts\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (0.0\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 0.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (0.0\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Unrealized gains (losses) on interest rate swaps\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 6.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 9.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (1.7\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net Change in Unrealized Gains (Losses) on Foreign\nCurrency Transactions and Interest Rate Swaps\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 6.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 3.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net Change in Unrealized Gains (Losses)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 33.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 24.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (14.2\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nFor the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018, we had net realized losses on investments of $3.1 million, net realized gains on investments of $1.9 million and net realized losses on investments of $11.4 million, respectively. For the year ended December 31, 2020, we had net realized gains of $0.7 million on extinguishment of debt, as a result of our repurchases of our debt securities. For the year ended December 31, 2020, we had net realized losses of less than $0.1 million and for the years ended December 31 2019, and 2018, we had net realized gains of $0.1 million and $0.2 million, respectively, on foreign currency transactions, primarily as a result of translating foreign currency related to our non-USD denominated investments. For the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, we had net realized losses on foreign currency investments of $1.1 million, $0.4 million and $2.2 million, respectively. For the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018 we had net realized gains on foreign currency borrowings of $1.0 million, $0.4 million and $2.7 million, respectively. The net realized gains on foreign currency borrowings were a result of payments on our revolving credit facility. For the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 we had net realized losses of $0.1 million and net realized gains less than $0.1 million, respectively, on interest rate swaps.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2020 we had $74.4 million in unrealized gains on 53 portfolio company investments, which was offset by $42.4 million in unrealized losses on 29 portfolio company investments. Unrealized gains for the year ended December 31, 2020 resulted from an increase in fair value, primarily due to positive valuation adjustments, the positive impact on valuations from the existence of LIBOR floors, and unwind of prior period unrealized losses. Unrealized losses for the year ended December 31, 2020 resulted from the reversal of prior period unrealized gains due to realizations and negative credit-related adjustments.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2019 we had $45.6 million in unrealized gains on 53 portfolio company investments, which was offset by $27.3 million in unrealized losses on 23 portfolio company investments. Unrealized gains for the year ended December 31, 2019 resulted from an increase in fair value, primarily due to positive valuation adjustments and changes in credit spreads. Unrealized losses for the year ended December 31, 2019 resulted from the unwind of prior period unrealized gains due to realizations and negative credit-related adjustments.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2018 we had $44.9 million in unrealized gains on 17 portfolio company investments, which was offset by $62.8 million in unrealized losses on 50 portfolio company investments. Unrealized gains for the year ended December 31, 2018 resulted from an increase in fair value, primarily due to reversal of prior period unrealized losses and positive valuation adjustments. Unrealized losses for the year ended December 31, 2018 resulted from the unwind of prior period unrealized gains on realized investments, widening credit spreads, and in some instances negative credit-related adjustments.\nFor the years ended December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019 we had unrealized losses on foreign currency borrowings of $5.1 million and $3.2 million, respectively, primarily as a result of fluctuations in the AUD, CAD, and EUR exchange rates. For the year ended December 31, 2018, we had unrealized gains on foreign currency borrowings of $5.4 million, primarily as a result of fluctuations in the AUD, CAD, and EUR exchange rates. For the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018, we had unrealized losses on foreign currency cash and forward contracts of less than $0.1 million, unrealized gains on foreign currency cash and forward contracts of less than $0.1 million, and unrealized losses on foreign currency cash and forward contracts of less than $0.1 million, primarily as a result of settling our foreign currency forward contracts. For the year ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 we had unrealized gains on interest rate swaps of $6.8 million and $9.2 million, respectively and for the year ended December 31, 2018, we had unrealized losses on interest rate swaps of $1.7 million, due to fluctuations in interest rates.\nRealized Gross Internal Rate of Return\nSince we began investing in 2011 through December 31, 2020, weighted by capital invested, our exited investments have generated an average realized gross internal rate of return to us of 19.2% (based on total capital invested of $4.9 billion and total proceeds from these exited investments of $6.2 billion). Ninety-one percent of these exited investments resulted in a realized gross internal rate of return to us of 10% or greater.\nGross IRR, with respect to an investment, is calculated based on the dates that we invested capital and dates we received distributions, regardless of when we made distributions to our stockholders. Initial investments are assumed to occur at time zero, and all cash flows are deemed to occur on the fifteenth of each month in which they occur.\nGross IRR reflects historical results relating to our past performance and is not necessarily indicative of our future results. In addition, gross IRR does not reflect the effect of Management Fees, expenses, Incentive Fees or taxes borne, or to be borne, by us or our stockholders, and would be lower if it did.\nAverage gross IRR is the average of the gross IRR for each of our exited investments (each calculated as described above), weighted by the total capital invested for each of those investments.\nAverage gross IRR on our exited investments reflects only invested and realized cash amounts as described above, and does not reflect any unrealized gains or losses in our portfolio.\nInternal rate of return, or IRR, is a measure of our discounted cash flows (inflows and outflows). Specifically, IRR is the discount rate at which the net present value of all cash flows is equal to zero. That is, IRR is the discount rate at which the present value of total capital invested in each of our investments is equal to the present value of all realized returns from that investment. Our IRR calculations are unaudited.\nCapital invested, with respect to an investment, represents the aggregate cost basis allocable to the realized or unrealized portion of the investment, net of any upfront fees paid at closing for the term loan portion of the investment. Capital invested also includes realized losses on hedging activity, with respect to an investment, which represents any inception-to-date realized losses on foreign currency forward contracts allocable to the investment, if any.\nRealized returns, with respect to an investment, represents the total cash received with respect to each investment, including all amortization payments, interest, dividends, prepayment fees, upfront fees, administrative fees, agent fees, amendment fees, accrued interest, and other fees and proceeds. Realized returns also include realized gains on hedging activity, with respect to an investment, which represents any inception-to-date realized gains on foreign currency forward contracts allocable to the investment, if any.\nInterest Rate and Foreign Currency Hedging\nWe use interest rate swaps to hedge our fixed rate debt and certain fixed rate investments. We have designated certain interest rate swaps to be in a hedge accounting relationship. See Note 2 for additional disclosure regarding our accounting for derivative instruments designated in a hedge accounting relationship. See Note 5 for additional disclosure regarding these derivative instruments and the interest payments paid and received. See Note 7 for additional disclosure regarding the carrying value of our debt. Our current approach to hedging the foreign currency exposure in our non-U.S. dollar denominated investments is primarily to borrow the par amount in local currency under our Revolving Credit Facility to fund these investments. For the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, we had $5.1 million and $3.2 million of unrealized losses, respectively, and for the year ended December 31, 2018 we had $5.4 million of unrealized gains on the translation of our non-U.S. dollar denominated debt into U.S. dollars; such amounts approximate the corresponding unrealized gains and losses on the translation of our non-U.S. dollar denominated investments into U.S. dollars for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018. See Note 2 for additional disclosure regarding our accounting for foreign currency. See Note 7 for additional disclosure regarding the amounts of outstanding debt denominated in each foreign currency at December 31, 2020. See our consolidated schedule of investments for additional disclosure regarding the foreign currency amounts (in both par and fair value) of our non-U.S. dollar denominated investments.\nFinancial Condition, Liquidity and Capital Resources\nOur liquidity and capital resources are derived primarily from proceeds from equity issuances, advances from our credit facilities, and cash flows from operations. The primary uses of our cash and cash equivalents are:\n \u2022 investments in portfolio companies and other investments and to comply with certain portfolio diversification requirements; \n \u2022 the cost of operations (including paying our Adviser); \n \u2022 debt service, repayment, and other financing costs; and \n \u2022 cash dividends to the holders of our shares. \nWe intend to continue to generate cash primarily from cash flows from operations, future borrowings and future offerings of securities. We may from time to time enter into additional debt facilities, increase the size of existing facilities or issue debt securities. Any such incurrence or issuance would be subject to prevailing market conditions, our liquidity requirements, contractual and regulatory restrictions and other factors. In accordance with the 1940 Act, with certain limited exceptions, we are only allowed to incur borrowings, issue debt securities or issue preferred stock if immediately after the borrowing or issuance our ratio of total assets (less total liabilities other than indebtedness) to total indebtedness plus preferred stock, is at least 150%. For more information, see Key Components of Our Results of Operations -Leverage\u201d above. As of December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, our asset coverage ratio was 204.5%, 200.4%, and 270.5%, respectively. We carefully consider our unfunded commitments for the purpose of planning our capital resources and ongoing liquidity including our financial leverage. Further, we maintain sufficient borrowing capacity within the 150% asset coverage limitation under the 1940 Act and the asset coverage limitation under our credit facilities to cover any outstanding unfunded commitments we are required to fund.\nCash and cash equivalents as of December 31, 2020, taken together with cash available under our credit facilities, is expected to be sufficient for our investing activities and to conduct our operations in the near term. As of December 31, 2020, we had approximately $862.7 million of availability on our Revolving Credit Facility, subject to asset coverage limitations.\nAs of December 31, 2020, we had $13.3 million in cash and cash equivalents, including $10.8 million of restricted cash. During the year ended December 31, 2020, we provided $145.1 million in cash from operating activities as a result of repayments and proceeds from investments of $1,048.0 million and an increase in net assets resulting from operations of $178.1 million, which was partially offset by funding portfolio investments of $1,038.9 million, and other operating activity of $42.1 million. Lastly, cash used in financing activities was $145.9 million during the period, consisting of paydowns on our Revolving Credit Facility of $1,090.7 million, dividends paid of $130.4 million, repurchases of debt of $31.8 million, repurchases of common stock of $2.9 million, and deferred financing costs of $4.3 million, which was partially offset by borrowings of $1,114.2 million.\nAs of December 31, 2019, we had $14.1 million in cash and cash equivalents, including $9.3 million of restricted cash. During the year ended December 31, 2019, we provided $378.0 million in cash for operating activities, primarily as a result of purchases and originations of investments of $1,118.1 million and other operating activity of $36.5 million partially offset by repayments on investments of $622.0 million and an increase in net assets resulting from operations of $154.6 million. Lastly, cash provided in financing activities was $381.6 million during the period, primarily due to borrowings of $1,742.6 million (including the issuance of $300.0 million principal amount of our 2024 Notes), which were partially offset by paydowns on our Revolving Credit Facility of $1,255.2 million, dividends paid of $98.1 million, and deferred financing costs of $7.7 million.\nAs of December 31, 2020, we had $10.8 million of restricted cash pledged as collateral under our interest rate swap agreements, compared to $9.3 million as of December 31, 2019.\nEquity\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, we issued 1,366,582 and 1,111,774 shares of our common stock, respectively, to investors who have not opted out of our dividend reinvestment plan for proceeds of $22.3 million and $21.1 million, respectively. On January 15, 2021, we issued 211,904 shares of our common stock through our dividend reinvestment plan for proceeds of $4.2 million, which is not reflected in the number of shares issued for the year ended December 31, 2020 in this section or the consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2020.\nOn August 4, 2015, our Board authorized us to acquire up to $50 million in aggregate of our common stock from time to time over an initial six month period, and has continued to authorize the refreshment of the $50 million amount authorized under and extension of the stock repurchase program prior to its expiration since that time, most recently as of November 4, 2020. The amount and timing of stock repurchases under the program may vary depending on market conditions, and no assurance can be given that any particular amount of common stock will be repurchased.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2020, we repurchased 206,964 shares at a weighted average price per share of $14.17 inclusive of commissions, for a total cost of $2.9 million. For the year ended December 31, 2019 no shares were repurchased.\nDebt\nDebt obligations consisted of the following as of December 31, 2020 and 2019:\nTable 335: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td>

Facility and asset coverage requirements. \n (2) The carrying values of the Revolving Credit Facility, 2022 Convertible Notes, 2023 Notes, and 2024 Notes are presented net of deferred financing costs and original issue discounts of $10.0 million, $3.1 million, $2.0 million and $6.9 million, respectively. \n (3) The carrying value of the 2024 Notes is presented inclusive of an incremental ($1.8) million, which represents an adjustment in the carrying value of the 2024 Notes resulting from a hedge accounting relationship. \nAs of December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, we were in compliance with the terms of our debt arrangements. We intend to continue to utilize our credit facilities to fund investments and for other general corporate purposes.\nRevolving Credit Facility\nOn August 23, 2012, we entered into a senior secured revolving credit agreement with Truist Bank (as a successor by merger to SunTrust Bank), as administrative agent, and J.P. Morgan Chase Bank, N.A., as syndication agent, and certain other lenders (as amended and restated, the Revolving Credit Facility\u201d).\nAs of December 31, 2020, aggregate commitments under the facility were $1.335 billion. Pursuant to an amendment to the Revolving Credit Facility dated as of February 5, 2021 (the Tenth Amendment\u201d), the aggregate commitments under the facility were increased to $1.485 billion. The facility includes an uncommitted accordion feature that allows us, under certain circumstances, to increase the size of the facility to up to $2.0 billion.\nPursuant to the Tenth Amendment, with respect to $1.390 billion in commitments, the revolving period, during which period we, subject to certain conditions, may make borrowings under the facility, was extended from January 31, 2024 to February 4, 2025 and the stated maturity date was extended from January 31, 2025 to February 4, 2026. For the remaining $95.0 million of commitments, the revolving period ends January 31, 2024 and the stated maturity is January 31, 2025.\nWe may borrow amounts in U.S. dollars or certain other permitted currencies. As of December 31, 2020, we had outstanding debt denominated in Australian dollars (AUD) of 51.6 million, Canadian dollars (CAD) of 74.8 million, and Euro (EUR) of 8.4 million on our Revolving Credit Facility, included in the Outstanding Principal amount in the table above.\nThe Revolving Credit Facility also provides for the issuance of letters of credit up to an aggregate amount of $75 million. As of December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, we had no outstanding letters of credit issued through the Revolving Credit Facility. The amount available for borrowing under the Revolving Credit Facility is reduced by any letters of credit issued through the Revolving Credit Facility.\nAmounts drawn under the Revolving Credit Facility, including amounts drawn in respect of letters of credit, bear interest at either LIBOR plus a margin of either 1.75% or 1.875%, or the base rate plus a margin of either 0.75% or 0.875%, in each case, based on the total amount of the borrowing base relative to the sum of the total commitments (or, if greater, the total exposure) under the Revolving Credit Facility plus certain other designated secured debt. We may elect either the LIBOR or base rate at the time of drawdown, and loans may be converted from one rate to another at any time, subject to certain conditions. We also pay a fee of 0.375% on undrawn amounts and, in respect of each undrawn letter of credit, a fee and interest rate equal to the then applicable margin while the letter of credit is outstanding.\nThe Revolving Credit Facility is guaranteed by Sixth Street SL SPV, LLC, TC Lending, LLC and Sixth Street SL Holding, LLC. The Revolving Credit Facility is secured by a perfected first-priority security interest in substantially all the portfolio investments held by us and each guarantor. Proceeds from borrowings may be used for general corporate purposes, including the funding of portfolio investments.\nThe Revolving Credit Facility includes customary events of default, as well as customary covenants, including restrictions on certain distributions and financial covenants. The financial covenants require:\n \u2022 an asset coverage ratio of no less than 1.5 to 1 on the last day of any fiscal quarter; \n \u2022 a liquidity test under which we must not maintain cash and liquid investments of less than 10% of the covered debt amount for more than 30 consecutive business days under circumstances where our adjusted covered debt balance is greater than 90% of our adjusted borrowing base under the facility; \n \u2022 stockholders' equity of at least $500 million plus 25% of the net proceeds of the sale of equity interests after January 31, 2020; \n \u2022 a minimum asset coverage ratio of no less than 2 to 1 with respect to (i) the consolidated assets of the Company and the subsidiary guarantors (including certain limitations on the contribution of equity in financing subsidiaries) to (ii) the secured debt of the Company and its subsidiary guarantors plus unsecured senior securities of the Company and its subsidiary guarantors that mature within 90 days of the date of determination (the Obligor Asset Coverage Ratio\u201d); and \n \u2022 minimum consolidated assets of the Company and the subsidiary guarantors (including certain limitations on the contribution of equity in financing subsidiaries), less total secured debt of the Company and the subsidiary guarantors, of at least $350 million at the last day of any fiscal quarter. \nThe Revolving Credit Facility also contains certain additional concentration limits in connection with the calculation of the borrowing base, based on the Obligor Asset Coverage Ratio.\nNet proceeds received from our common stock issuance in March 2018 and net proceeds received from the issuance of the 2022 Convertible Notes, 2023 Notes and 2024 Notes were used to pay down borrowings on the Revolving Credit Facility.\n2019 Convertible Notes\nIn June 2014, we issued in a private offering $115 million aggregate principal amount convertible notes due December 2019 (the 2019 Convertible Notes\u201d). The 2019 Convertible Notes were issued in a private placement only to qualified institutional buyers pursuant to Rule 144A under the Securities Act. The 2019 Convertible Notes were unsecured and bore interest at a rate of 4.50% per year, payable semiannually. The 2019 Convertible Notes matured on December 15, 2019 and were fully repaid in cash. The swap transaction associated with the issuance of the 2019 Convertible Notes also matured on December 15, 2019.\n2022 Convertible Notes\nIn February 2017, we issued in a private offering $115 million aggregate principal amount convertible notes due August 2022 (the 2022 Convertible Notes\u201d and, together with the 2019 Convertible Notes, the Convertible Notes\u201d). The 2022 Convertible Notes were issued in a private placement only to qualified institutional buyers pursuant to Rule 144A under the Securities Act. The 2022 Convertible Notes are unsecured, and bear interest at a rate of 4.50% per year, payable semiannually. The 2022 Convertible Notes will mature on August 1, 2022. In certain circumstances, the 2022 Convertible Notes will be convertible into cash, shares of our common stock or a combination of cash and shares of our common stock, at our election, at an initial conversion rate of 46.8516 shares of common stock per $1,000 principal amount of 2022 Convertible Notes, which is equivalent to an initial conversion price of approximately $21.34 per share of our common stock, subject to customary anti-dilution adjustments. As of December 31, 2020, the estimated adjusted conversion price was approximately $19.80 per share of common stock. The sale of the 2022 Convertible Notes generated net proceeds of approximately $111.2 million. We used the net proceeds of the offering to pay down debt under the Revolving Credit Facility. In connection with the offering of 2022 Convertible Notes, we have entered into an interest rate swap to continue to align the interest rates of our liabilities with our investment portfolio, which consists of predominately floating rate loans. As a result of the swaps, our effective interest rate on the original issuance of 2022 Convertible Notes is three-month LIBOR plus 2.37%.\nIn June 2018, we issued an additional $57.5 million aggregate principal amount of 2022 Convertible Notes. The additional 2022 Convertible Notes were issued with identical terms, and are fungible with and are part of a single series with the previously outstanding $115 million aggregate principal amount of our 2022 Convertible Notes issued in February 2017. In connection with the reopening of the 2022 Convertible Notes, we entered into interest rate swaps to continue to align the interest rates of its liabilities with its investment portfolio, which consists of predominantly floating rate loans. As a result of the additional swaps, our effective interest rate on the additional 2022 Convertible Notes is approximately three-month LIBOR plus 1.60%. See Note 5 for further information related to our interest rate swaps.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2020, we repurchased on the open market and extinguished $29.7 million in aggregate principal amount of the 2022 Convertible Notes for $29.5 million. These repurchases resulted in a gain on extinguishment of debt of less than $0.7 million. This gain is included in the extinguishment of debt in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations. In connection with the repurchases of the 2022 Convertible Notes, we entered into floating-to-fixed interest rate swaps with an aggregate notional amount equal to the amount of 2022 Convertible Notes repurchased, which has the effect of reducing the notional exposure of the fixed-to-floating interest rate swaps, which were entered into in connection with the issuance of the 2022 Convertible Notes, to match the current principal amount of the 2022 Convertible Notes outstanding. As a result of the swaps, our effective interest rate on the outstanding 2022 Convertible Notes is three-month LIBOR plus 2.11% (on a weighted-average basis).\nHolders may convert their 2022 Convertible Notes at their option at any time prior to February 1, 2022 only under the following circumstances: (1) during any calendar quarter commencing after the calendar quarter ending on June 30, 2017 (and only during such calendar quarter), if the last reported sale price of the common stock for at least 20 trading days (whether or not consecutive) during a period of 30 consecutive trading days ending on the last trading day of the immediately preceding calendar quarter is greater than or equal to 130% of the conversion price on each applicable trading day; (2) during the five business day period after any five consecutive trading day period (the measurement period\u201d) in which the trading price (as defined in the indenture governing the 2022 Convertible Notes) per $1,000 principal amount of notes for each trading day of the measurement period was less than 98% of the product of the last reported sale price of our common stock and the conversion rate on each such trading day; or (3) upon the occurrence of specified corporate events. On or after February 1, 2022 until the close of business on the scheduled trading day immediately preceding the maturity date, holders may convert their notes at any time, regardless of the occurrence or nonoccurrence of any of the foregoing circumstances.\nThe 2022 Convertible Notes are our unsecured obligations and rank senior in right of payment to our future indebtedness that is expressly subordinated in right of payment to the 2022 Convertible Notes; equal in right of payment to our existing and future indebtedness that is not so subordinated; effectively junior in right of payment to any of our secured indebtedness (including unsecured indebtedness that we later secure) to the extent of the value of the assets securing such indebtedness; and structurally junior to all existing and future indebtedness (including trade payables) incurred by our subsidiaries, financing vehicles or similar facilities.\nAs of December 31, 2020, the principal amount of the 2022 Convertible Notes was exceeded by the value of the underlying shares multiplied by the per share closing price of our common stock. However, the conditions required for conversion prior to maturity had not been satisfied. As of December 31, 2019, the principal amount of the 2022 Convertible Notes was exceeded by the value of the underlying shares multiplied by the per share closing price of our common stock. However, the conditions required for conversion prior to maturity had not been satisfied.\nThe indenture governing the 2022 Convertible Notes contains certain covenants, including covenants requiring us to comply with the applicable asset coverage ratio requirement under the 1940 Act and to provide financial information to the holders of the 2022 Convertible Notes under certain circumstances. These covenants are subject to important limitations and exceptions that are described in the indenture governing the 2022 Convertible Notes. As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, we were in compliance with the terms of the indenture governing the 2022 Convertible Notes.\nThe 2022 Convertible Notes are accounted for in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification ( ASC\u201d) Topic 470-20. Upon conversion of any of the 2022 Convertible Notes, we intend to pay the outstanding principal amount in cash and, to the extent that the conversion value exceeds the principal amount, we have the option to pay in cash or shares of our common stock (or a combination of cash and shares) in respect of the excess amount, subject to the requirements of the indenture governing the 2022 Convertible Notes. We have determined that the embedded conversion options in the 2022 Convertible Notes are not required to be separately accounted for as a derivative under U.S. GAAP. In accounting for the 2022 Convertible Notes, we estimated at the time of issuance separate debt and equity components of the 2022 Convertible Notes. An original issue discount equal to the equity components of the 2022 Convertible Notes was recorded in additional paid-in capital\u201d in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet. Additionally, the issuance costs associated with the 2022 Convertible Notes were allocated to the debt and equity components in proportion to the allocation of the proceeds and accounted for as deferred financing costs and equity issuance costs, respectively.\n2023 Notes\nIn January 2018, we issued $150.0 million aggregate principal amount of unsecured notes that mature on January 22, 2023 (the 2023 Notes\u201d). The principal amount of the 2023 Notes is payable at maturity. The 2023 Notes bear interest at a rate of 4.50% per year, payable semi-annually commencing on July 22, 2018, and may be redeemed in whole or in part at our option at any time at par plus a make whole\u201d premium. Total proceeds from the issuance of the 2023 Notes, net of underwriting discounts and offering costs, were $146.9 million. We used the net proceeds of the 2023 Notes to repay outstanding indebtedness under the Revolving Credit Facility.\nIn connection with the 2023 Notes offering, we entered into an interest rate swap to continue to align the interest rates of our liabilities with our investment portfolio, which consists of predominately floating rate loans. As a result of the swap, our effective interest rate on the 2023 Notes is three-month LIBOR plus 1.99%.\n2024 Notes\nIn November 2019, we issued $300.0 million aggregate principal amount of unsecured notes that mature on November 1, 2024 (the 2024 Notes\u201d). The principal amount of the 2024 Notes is payable at maturity. The 2024 Notes bear interest at a rate of 3.875% per year, payable semi-annually commencing on May 1, 2020, and may be redeemed in whole or in part at our option at any time at par plus a make whole\u201d premium. Total proceeds from the issuance of the 2024 Notes, net of underwriting discounts, offering costs and original issue discount were $292.9 million. We used the net proceeds of the 2024 Notes to repay outstanding indebtedness under the Revolving Credit Facility.\nOn February 5, 2020, we issued an additional $50.0 million aggregate principal amount of unsecured notes that mature on November 1, 2024. The additional 2024 Notes are a further issuance of, fungible with, rank equally in right of payment with and have the same terms (other than the issue date and the public offering price) as the initial issuance of 2024 Notes. Total proceeds from the issuance of the additional 2024 Notes, net of underwriting discounts, offering costs and original issue premium were $50.1 million. We used the net proceeds of the 2024 Notes to repay outstanding indebtedness under the Revolving Credit Facility.\nIn connection with the 2024 Notes offering and reopening of the 2024 Notes, we entered into interest rate swaps to continue to align the interest rates of our liabilities with our investment portfolio, which consists of predominately floating rate loans. As a result of the swaps, our effective interest rate on the 2024 Notes is three-month LIBOR plus 2.28% (on a weighted average basis).\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2020, we repurchased on the open market and extinguished $2.5 million in aggregate principal amount of the 2024 Notes for $2.4 million. These repurchases resulted in a gain on extinguishment of debt of less than $0.1 million. This gain is included in the extinguishment of debt in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations. In connection with the repurchase of the 2024 Notes, we entered into a floating-to-fixed interest rate swap with a notional amount equal to the amount of 2024 Notes repurchased, which has the effect of reducing the notional exposure of the fixed-to-floating interest rate swaps, which were entered into in connection with the issuance of the 2024 Notes, to match the current principal amount of the 2024 Notes outstanding. As a result of the swap, our effective interest rate on the outstanding 2024 Notes is three-month LIBOR plus 2.28% (on a weighted average basis).\n2026 Notes\nOn February 3, 2021, we issued $300.0 million aggregate principal amount of unsecured notes that mature on August 1, 2026 (the 2026 Notes\u201d).

As a result of the swap, our effective interest rate on the 2026 Notes is three-month LIBOR plus 1.91%.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nPortfolio Company Commitments\nFrom time to time, we may enter into commitments to fund investments. We incorporate these commitments into our assessment of our liquidity position. Our senior secured revolving loan commitments are generally available on a borrower's demand and may remain outstanding until the maturity date of the applicable loan. Our senior secured term loan commitments are generally available on a borrower's demand and, once drawn, generally have the same remaining term as the associated loan agreement. Undrawn senior secured term loan commitments generally have a shorter availability period than the term of the associated loan agreement. As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, we had the following commitments to fund investments in current portfolio companies:\nTable 348: <table> <tr> <td> ($ in millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> December 31, 2020\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> December 31, 2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Alpha Midco, Inc. -

Commitments may be subject to limitations on borrowings set forth in the agreements between us and the applicable portfolio company. As a result, portfolio companies may not be eligible to borrow the full commitment amount on such date. \nOther Commitments and Contingencies\nAs of December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, we did not have any unfunded commitments to fund investments to new borrowers that were not current portfolio companies as of such date.\nFrom time to time, we may become a party to certain legal proceedings incidental to the normal course of our business. As of December 31, 2020, management is not aware of any material pending or threatened litigation that would require accounting recognition or financial statement disclosure.\nWe have certain contracts under which we have material future commitments. Under the Investment Advisory Agreement, our Adviser provides us with investment advisory and management services. For these services, we pay the Management Fee and the Incentive Fee.\nUnder the Administration Agreement, our Adviser furnishes us with office facilities and equipment, provides us clerical, bookkeeping and record keeping services at such facilities and provides us with other administrative services necessary to conduct our day-to-day operations. We reimburse our Adviser for the allocable portion (subject to the review and approval of our Board) of expenses incurred by it in performing its obligations under the Administration Agreement, the fees and expenses associated with performing compliance functions and our allocable portion of the compensation of our Chief Compliance Officer, Chief Financial Officer and other professionals who spend time on those related activities (based on a percentage of time those individuals devote, on an estimated basis, to our business and affairs). Our Adviser also offers on our behalf significant managerial assistance to those portfolio companies to which we are required to offer to provide such assistance.\nContractual Obligations\nA summary of our contractual payment obligations as of December 31, 2020 is as follows:\nTable 351: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Payments Due by Period\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Less than\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> ($ in millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1 year\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1-3 years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3-5 years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> After 5 years\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Revolving Credit Facility\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 472.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 472.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> 2022 Convertible Notes\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 142.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 142.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> 2023 Notes\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 150.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 150.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> 2024 Notes\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 347.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 347.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total Contractual Obligations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,112.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 292.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 819.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nIn addition to the contractual payment obligations in the tables above, we also have commitments to fund investments and to pledge assets as collateral under the terms of our derivatives agreements.\nDistributions\nWe have elected and qualified to be treated for U.S. federal income tax purposes as a RIC under subchapter M of the Code. To maintain our RIC status, we must distribute (or be treated as distributing) in each taxable year dividends for tax purposes equal to at least 90 percent of the sum of our:\n \u2022 investment company taxable income (which is generally our ordinary income plus the excess of realized net short-term capital gains over realized net long-term capital losses), determined without regard to the deduction for dividends paid, for such taxable year; and \n \u2022 net tax-exempt interest income (which is the excess of our gross tax exempt interest income over certain disallowed deductions) for such taxable year. \nAs a RIC, we (but not our stockholders) generally will not be subject to U.S. federal income tax on investment company taxable income and net capital gains that we distribute to our stockholders.\nWe intend to distribute annually all or substantially all of such income. To the extent that we retain our net capital gains or any investment company taxable income, we generally will be subject to corporate-level U.S. federal income tax. We may choose to retain our net capital gains or any investment company taxable income, and pay the U.S. federal excise tax described below.\nAmounts not distributed on a timely basis in accordance with a calendar year distribution requirement are subject to a nondeductible 4% U.S. federal excise tax payable by us. To avoid this tax, we must distribute (or be treated as distributing) during each calendar year an amount at least equal to the sum of:\n \u2022 98% of our net ordinary income excluding certain ordinary gains or losses for that calendar year; \n \u2022 98.2% of our capital gain net income, adjusted for certain ordinary gains and losses, recognized for the twelve-month period ending on October 31 of that calendar year; and \n \u2022 100% of any income or gains recognized, but not distributed, in preceding years. \nWhile we intend to distribute any income and capital gains in the manner necessary to minimize imposition of the 4% U.S. federal excise tax, sufficient amounts of our taxable income and capital gains may not be distributed to avoid entirely the imposition of this tax. In that event, we will be liable for this tax only on the amount by which we do not meet the foregoing distribution requirement.\nWe intend to pay quarterly dividends to our stockholders out of assets legally available for distribution. All dividends will be paid at the discretion of our Board and will depend on our earnings, financial condition, maintenance of our RIC status, compliance with applicable BDC regulations and such other factors as our Board may deem relevant from time to time.\nTo the extent our current taxable earnings for a year fall below the total amount of our distributions for that year, a portion of those distributions may be deemed a return of capital to our stockholders for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Thus, the source of a distribution to our stockholders may be the original capital invested by the stockholder rather than our income or gains. Stockholders should read any written disclosure carefully and should not assume that the source of any distribution is our ordinary income or gains.\nWe have adopted an opt out\u201d dividend reinvestment plan for our common stockholders. As a result, if we declare a cash dividend or other distribution, each stockholder that has not opted out\u201d of our dividend reinvestment plan will have their dividends or distributions automatically reinvested in additional shares of our common stock rather than receiving cash dividends. Stockholders who receive distributions in the form of shares of common stock will be subject to the same U.S. federal, state and local tax consequences as if they received cash distributions.\nRelated-Party Transactions\nWe have entered into a number of business relationships with affiliated or related parties, including the following:\n \u2022 the Investment Advisory Agreement; \n \u2022 the Administration Agreement; and \n \u2022 an ongoing agreement with an affiliate of TPG governing, inter alia, the parties' respective ownership of and rights to use the Sixth Street\u201d and TPG\u201d trademarks and certain variations thereof. \nCritical Accounting Policies\nThe preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, and expenses. Changes in the economic environment, financial markets, and any other parameters used in determining such estimates could cause actual results to differ. Our critical accounting policies, including those relating to the valuation of our investment portfolio, are described below. The critical accounting policies should be read in connection with our risk factors as disclosed in ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS.\u201d\nInvestments at Fair Value\nLoan originations are recorded on the date of the binding commitment, which is generally the funding date. Investment transactions purchased through the secondary markets are recorded on the trade date. Realized gains or losses are measured by the difference between the net proceeds received (excluding prepayment fees, if any) and the amortized cost basis of the investment without regard to unrealized gains or losses previously recognized, and include investments charged off during the period, net of recoveries. The net\nchange in unrealized gains or losses primarily reflects the change in investment values and also includes the reversal of previously recorded unrealized gains or losses with respect to investments realized during the period.\nInvestments for which market quotations are readily available are typically valued at those market quotations. To validate market quotations, we utilize a number of factors to determine if the quotations are representative of fair value, including the source and number of the quotations. Debt and equity securities that are not publicly traded or whose market prices are not readily available, as is the case for substantially all of our investments, are valued at fair value as determined in good faith by our Board, based on, among other things, the input of the Adviser, our Audit Committee and independent third-party valuation firms engaged at the direction of the Board.\nAs part of the valuation process, the Board takes into account relevant factors in determining the fair value of our investments, including and in combination of:\n \u2022 the estimated enterprise value of a portfolio company (that is, the total value of the portfolio company's net debt and equity); \n \u2022 the nature and realizable value of any collateral; \n \u2022 the portfolio company's ability to make payments based on its earnings and cash flow; \n \u2022 the markets in which the portfolio company does business; \n \u2022 a comparison of the portfolio company's securities to any similar publicly traded securities; and \n \u2022 overall changes in the interest rate environment and the credit markets that may affect the price at which similar investments may be made in the future. \nWhen an external event, such as a purchase transaction, public offering or subsequent equity sale occurs, the Board considers whether the pricing indicated by the external event corroborates our valuation.\nThe Board undertakes a multi-step valuation process, which includes, among other procedures, the following:\n \u2022 The valuation process begins with each investment being initially valued by the investment professionals responsible for the portfolio investment in conjunction with the portfolio management team. \n \u2022 The Adviser's management reviews the preliminary valuations with the investment professionals. Agreed-upon valuation recommendations are presented to the Audit Committee. \n \u2022 The Audit Committee reviews the valuations presented and recommends values for each investment to the Board. \n \u2022 The Board reviews the recommended valuations and determines the fair value of each investment; valuations that are not based on readily available market quotations are valued in good faith based on, among other things, the input of the Adviser, Audit Committee and, where applicable, other third parties, including independent third party valuation firms engaged at the direction of the Board. \nWe conduct this valuation process on a quarterly basis.\nThe Board has engaged independent third-party valuation firms to perform certain limited procedures that the Board has identified and requested them to perform in connection with the valuation process. At December 31, 2020, the independent third-party valuation firms performed their procedures over substantially all of our investments. Upon completion of such limited procedures, the third-party valuation firms determined that the fair value, as determined by the Board, of those investments subjected to their limited procedures, appeared reasonable.\nWe apply Financial Accounting Standards Board Accounting Standards Codification Topic 820, Fair Value Measurement ( ASC Topic 820\u201d), as amended, which establishes a framework for measuring fair value in accordance with U.S. GAAP and required disclosures of fair value measurements. ASC Topic 820 determines fair value to be the price that would be received for an investment in a current sale, which assumes an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. Market participants are defined as buyers and sellers in the principal or most advantageous market (which may be a hypothetical market) that are independent, knowledgeable, and willing and able to transact. In accordance with ASC Topic 820, we consider our principal market to be the market that has the greatest volume and level of activity. ASC Topic 820 specifies a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes and ranks the level of observability of inputs used in determination of fair value. In accordance with ASC Topic 820, these levels are summarized below:\n \u2022 Level 1-Valuations based on quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that we have the ability to access. \n \n \u2022 Level 2-Valuations based on quoted prices in markets that are not active or for which all significant inputs are observable, either directly or indirectly. \n \u2022 Level 3-Valuations based on inputs that are unobservable and significant to the overall fair value measurement. \nTransfers between levels, if any, are recognized at the beginning of the quarter in which the transfers occur. In addition to using the above inputs in investment valuations, we apply the valuation policy approved by our Board that is consistent with ASC Topic 820. Consistent with the valuation policy, we evaluate the source of inputs, including any markets in which our investments are trading (or any markets in which securities with similar attributes are trading), in determining fair value. When a security is valued based on prices provided by reputable dealers or pricing services (that is, broker quotes), we subject those prices to various additional criteria in making the determination as to whether a particular investment would qualify for treatment as a Level 2 or Level 3 investment. For example, we review pricing and methodologies provided by dealers or pricing services in order to determine if observable market information is being used, versus unobservable inputs. Some additional factors considered include the number of prices obtained, as well as an assessment as to their quality, such as the depth of the relevant market relative to the size of the Company's position.\nOur accounting policy on the fair value of our investments is critical because the determination of fair value involves subjective judgments and estimates. Accordingly, the notes to our consolidated financial statements express the uncertainty with respect to the possible effect of these valuations, and any change in these valuations, on the consolidated financial statements.\nSee Note 6 to our consolidated financial statements included in this Form 10-K for more information on the fair value of our investments.\nInterest and Dividend Income Recognition\nInterest income is recorded on an accrual basis and includes the amortization of discounts and premiums. Discounts and premiums to par value on securities purchased or originated are amortized into interest income over the contractual life of the respective security using the effective interest method. The amortized cost of investments represents the original cost adjusted for the amortization of discounts and premiums, if any.\nUnless providing services in connection with an investment, such as syndication, structuring or diligence, all or a portion of any loan fees received by us will be deferred and amortized over the investment's life using the effective interest method.\nLoans are generally placed on non-accrual status when principal or interest payments are past due 30 days or more or when management has reasonable doubt that the borrower will pay principal or interest in full. Accrued and unpaid interest is generally reversed when a loan is placed on non-accrual status. Interest payments received on non-accrual loans may be recognized as income or applied to principal depending upon management's judgment regarding collectability. Non-accrual loans are restored to accrual status when past due principal and interest has been paid and, in management's judgment, the borrower is likely to make principal and interest payments in the future. Management may determine to not place a loan on non-accrual status if, notwithstanding any failure to pay, the loan has sufficient collateral value and is in the process of collection.\nDividend income on preferred equity securities is recorded on an accrual basis to the extent that such amounts are payable by the portfolio company and are expected to be collected. Dividend income on common equity securities is recorded on the record date for private portfolio companies or on the ex-dividend date for publicly traded portfolio companies.\nOur accounting policy on interest and dividend income recognition is critical because it involves the primary source of our revenue and accordingly is significant to the financial results as disclosed in our consolidated financial statements.\nU.S. Federal Income Taxes\nWe have elected to be treated as a BDC under the 1940 Act. We also have elected to be treated as a RIC under the Code. So long as we maintain our status as a RIC, we will generally not pay corporate-level U.S. federal income or excise taxes on any ordinary income or capital gains that we distribute at least annually to our stockholders as dividends. As a result, any tax liability related to income earned and distributed by us represents obligations of our stockholders and will not be reflected in our consolidated financial statements.\nWe evaluate tax positions taken or expected to be taken in the course of preparing our financial statements to determine whether the tax positions are more-likely-than-not\u201d to be sustained by the applicable tax authority. Tax positions not deemed to meet the more-likely-than-not\u201d threshold are reversed and recorded as a tax benefit or expense in the current year. All penalties and interest associated with income taxes are included in income tax expense. Conclusions regarding tax positions are subject to review and may be adjusted at a later date based on factors including, but not limited to, on-going analyses of tax laws, regulations and interpretations thereof. As of December 31, 2020, the Company did not have any uncertain tax positions that met the recognition or measurement\ncriteria, nor did the Company have any unrecognized tax benefits. Our 2019, 2018 and 2017 tax year returns remain subject to examination by the relevant federal, state, and local tax authorities.\nOur accounting policy on income taxes is critical because if we are unable to maintain our status as a RIC, we would be required to record a provision for corporate-level U.S. federal income taxes which may be significant to our financial results.", "item_7_text": "ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nIntroduction\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis should be read in conjunction with ITEM 8. CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA. This discussion contains forward-looking statements and involves numerous risks and uncertainties, including, but not limited to, those described in ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS.\u201d Actual results may differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statements.\nOverview\nSixth Street Specialty Lending, Inc. (formerly known as TPG Specialty Lending, Inc.) is a Delaware corporation formed on July 21, 2010. Effective June 15, 2020, we changed our name from TPG Specialty Lending, Inc. to Sixth Street Specialty Lending, Inc. The Adviser is our external manager. We have four wholly owned subsidiaries, TC Lending, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company, which holds a California finance lender and broker license, Sixth Street SL SPV, LLC (formerly known as TPG SL SPV, LLC), a Delaware limited liability company, in which we hold assets that were previously used to support our asset-backed credit facility, Sixth Street SL Holding, LLC (formerly known as TSL MR, LLC), a Delaware limited liability company, in which we hold certain investments, and Sixth Street Specialty Lending Sub, LLC, a Cayman Islands limited liability company, in which we plan to hold certain investments.\nWe have elected to be regulated as a BDC under the 1940 Act and as a RIC under the Code. We made our BDC election on April 15, 2011. As a result, we are required to comply with various statutory and regulatory requirements, such as:\n \u2022 the requirement to invest at least 70% of our assets in qualifying assets\u201d; \n \u2022 source of income limitations; \n \u2022 asset diversification requirements; and \n \u2022 the requirement to distribute (or be treated as distributing) in each taxable year at least 90% of our investment company taxable income and tax-exempt interest for that taxable year. \nOur shares are currently listed on the NYSE under the symbol TSLX.\u201d\nOur Investment Framework\nWe are a specialty finance company focused on lending to middle-market companies. Since we began our investment activities in July 2011, through December 31, 2020, we have originated more than $15.8 billion aggregate principal amount of investments and retained approximately $7.2 billion aggregate principal amount of these investments on our balance sheet prior to any subsequent exits and repayments. We seek to generate current income primarily in U.S.-domiciled middle-market companies through direct originations of senior secured loans and, to a lesser extent, originations of mezzanine and unsecured loans and investments in corporate bonds and equity securities.\nBy middle-market companies,\u201d we mean companies that have annual EBITDA, which we believe is a useful proxy for cash flow, of $10 million to $250 million, although we may invest in larger or smaller companies on occasion. As of December 31, 2020, our core portfolio companies, which exclude certain investments that fall outside of our typical borrower profile and represent 87.1% of our total investments based on fair value, had weighted average annual revenue of $116.6 million and weighted average annual EBITDA of $40.9 million.\nWe invest in first-lien debt, second-lien debt, mezzanine and unsecured debt and equity and other investments. Our first-lien debt may include stand-alone first-lien loans; last out\u201d first-lien loans, which are loans that have a secondary priority behind super-senior first out\u201d first-lien loans; unitranche\u201d loans, which are loans that combine features of first-lien, second-lien and mezzanine debt,\ngenerally in a first-lien position; and secured corporate bonds with similar features to these categories of first-lien loans. Our second-lien debt may include secured loans, and, to a lesser extent, secured corporate bonds, with a secondary priority behind first-lien debt.\nThe debt in which we invest typically is not rated by any rating agency, but if these instruments were rated, they would likely receive a rating of below investment grade (that is, below BBB- or Baa3 as defined by Standard & Poor's and Moody's Investors Services, respectively), which is often referred to as junk.\u201d\nThe companies in which we invest use our capital to support organic growth, acquisitions, market or product expansion and recapitalizations (including restructurings). As of December 31, 2020, the largest single investment based on fair value represented 3.7% of our total investment portfolio.\nAs of December 31, 2020, the average investment size in each of our portfolio companies was approximately $32.8 million based on fair value.\nThrough our Adviser, we consider potential investments utilizing a four-tiered investment framework and against our existing portfolio as a whole:\nBusiness and sector selection. We focus on companies with enterprise value between $50 million and $1 billion. When reviewing potential investments, we seek to invest in businesses with high marginal cash flow, recurring revenue streams and where we believe credit quality will improve over time. We look for portfolio companies that we think have a sustainable competitive advantage in growing industries or distressed situations. We also seek companies where our investment will have a low loan-to-value ratio.\nWe currently do not limit our focus to any specific industry and we may invest in larger or smaller companies on occasion. We classify the industries of our portfolio companies by end-market (such as healthcare, and business services) and not by the products or services (such as software) directed to those end-markets.\nAs of December 31, 2020, the largest industry represented 22.2% of our total investment portfolio based on fair value.\nInvestment Structuring. We focus on investing at the top of the capital structure and protecting that position. As of December 31, 2020, approximately 95.8% of our portfolio was invested in secured debt, including 95.6% in first-lien debt investments. We carefully perform diligence and structure investments to include strong investor covenants. As a result, we structure investments with a view to creating opportunities for early intervention in the event of non-performance or stress. In addition, we seek to retain effective voting control in investments over the loans or particular class of securities in which we invest through maintaining affirmative voting positions or negotiating consent rights that allow us to retain a blocking position. We also aim for our loans to mature on a medium term, between two to six years after origination. For the year ended December 31, 2020, the weighted average term on new investment commitments in new portfolio companies was 4.6 years.\nDeal Dynamics. We focus on, among other deal dynamics, direct origination of investments, where we identify and lead the investment transaction. A substantial majority of our portfolio investments are sourced through our direct or proprietary relationships.\nRisk Mitigation. We seek to mitigate non-credit-related risk on our returns in several ways, including call protection provisions to protect future interest income. As of December 31, 2020, we had call protection on 82.0% of our debt investments based on fair value, with weighted average call prices of 107.0% for the first year, 104.3% for the second year and 101.4% for the third year, in each case from the date of the initial investment. As of December 31, 2020, 99.1% of our debt investments based on fair value bore interest at floating rates (when including investment specific hedges), with 99.2% of these subject to interest rate floors, which we believe helps act as a portfolio-wide hedge against inflation.\nRelationship with our Adviser and Sixth Street\nOur Adviser is a Delaware limited liability company. Our Adviser acts as our investment adviser and administrator and is a registered investment adviser with the SEC under the Advisers Act. Our Adviser sources and manages our portfolio through a dedicated team of investment professionals predominately focused on us. Our Investment Team is led by our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and our Adviser's Co-Chief Investment Officer Joshua Easterly and our Adviser's Co-Chief Investment Officer Alan Waxman, both of whom have substantial experience in credit origination, underwriting and asset management. Our investment decisions are made by our Investment Review Committee, which includes senior personnel of our Adviser and Sixth Street Partners, LLC, or Sixth Street.\u201d\nSixth Street is a global investment business with approximately $50 billion of assets under management. Sixth Street's core platforms include Sixth Street Specialty Lending, Sixth Street Specialty Lending Europe, which is aimed at European middle-market\nloan originations, Sixth Street TAO, which has the flexibility to invest across all of Sixth Street's private credit market investments, Sixth Street Opportunities, which focuses on actively managed opportunistic investments across the credit cycle, Sixth Street Credit Market Strategies, which is the firm's public-side\u201d credit investment platform focused on investment opportunities in broadly syndicated leveraged loan markets, Sixth Street Growth, which provides financing solutions to growing companies, Sixth Street Fundamental Strategies, which primarily invests in secondary credit, and Sixth Street Agriculture, which invests in niche agricultural opportunities. Sixth Street has a long-term oriented, highly flexible capital base that allows it to invest across industries, geographies, capital structures and asset classes. Sixth Street has extensive experience with highly complex, global public and private investments executed through primary originations, secondary market purchases and restructurings, and has a team of over 320 investment and operating professionals. As of December 31, 2020, thirty two (32) of these personnel are dedicated to our business, including twenty four (24) investment professionals.\nOur Adviser consults with Sixth Street in connection with a substantial number of our investments. The Sixth Street platform provides us with a breadth of large and scalable investment resources. We believe we benefit from Sixth Street's market expertise, insights into industry, sector and macroeconomic trends and intensive due diligence capabilities, which help us discern market conditions that vary across industries and credit cycles, identify favorable investment opportunities and manage our portfolio of investments. Sixth Street and its affiliates will refer all middle-market loan origination activities for companies domiciled in the United States to us and conduct those activities through us. The Adviser will determine whether it would be permissible, advisable or otherwise appropriate for us to pursue a particular investment opportunity allocated to us.\nOn December 16, 2014, we were granted an exemptive order from the SEC that allows us to co-invest, subject to certain conditions and to the extent the size of an investment opportunity exceeds the amount our Adviser has independently determined is appropriate to invest, with certain of our affiliates (including affiliates of Sixth Street) in middle-market loan origination activities for companies domiciled in the United States and certain follow-on\u201d investments in companies in which we have already co-invested pursuant to the order and remain invested. On January 16, 2020, we filed a further application for co-investment exemptive relief with the SEC to better align our existing co-investment relief with more recent SEC exemptive orders. There can be no assurance when or if the SEC will grant a further order in response to our application. Until such time a new order is granted, we will continue to operate under the terms of our current exemptive order.\nWe believe our ability to co-invest with Sixth Street affiliates is particularly useful where we identify larger capital commitments than otherwise would be appropriate for us. We expect that with the ability to co-invest with Sixth Street affiliates we will continue to be able to provide one-stop\u201d financing to a potential portfolio company in these circumstances, which may allow us to capture opportunities where we alone could not commit the full amount of required capital or would have to spend additional time to locate unaffiliated co-investors.\nUnder the terms of the Investment Advisory Agreement and Administration Agreement, the Adviser's services are not exclusive, and the Adviser is free to furnish similar or other services to others, so long as its services to us are not impaired. Under the terms of the Investment Advisory Agreement, we will pay the Adviser the base management fee, or the Management Fee, and may also pay certain incentive fees, or the Incentive Fees.\nUnder the terms of the Administration Agreement, the Adviser also provides administrative services to us. These services include providing office space, equipment and office services, maintaining financial records, preparing reports to stockholders and reports filed with the SEC, and managing the payment of expenses and the oversight of the performance of administrative and professional services rendered by others. Certain of these services are reimbursable to the Adviser under the terms of the Administration Agreement.\nKey Components of Our Results of Operations\nInvestments\nWe focus primarily on the direct origination of loans to middle-market companies domiciled in the United States.\nOur level of investment activity (both the number of investments and the size of each investment) can and does vary substantially from period to period depending on many factors, including the amount of debt and equity capital generally available to middle-market companies, the level of merger and acquisition activity for such companies, the general economic environment and the competitive environment for the types of investments we make.\nIn addition, as part of our risk strategy on investments, we may reduce certain levels of investments through partial sales or syndication to additional investors.\nRevenues\nWe generate revenues primarily in the form of interest income from the investments we hold. In addition, we may generate income from dividends on direct equity investments, capital gains on the sale of investments and various loan origination and other fees. Our debt investments typically have a term of two to six years, and, as of December 31, 2020, 99.1% of these investments based on fair value bore interest at a floating rate (when including investment specific hedges), with 99.2% of these subject to interest rate floors. Interest on debt investments is generally payable quarterly or semiannually. Some of our investments provide for deferred interest payments or PIK interest. For the year ended December 31, 2020, 3.2% of our total investment income was comprised of PIK interest.\nChanges in our net investment income are primarily driven by the spread between the payments we receive from our investments in our portfolio companies against our cost of funding, rather than by changes in interest rates. Our investment portfolio primarily consists of floating rate loans, and our credit facilities, 2022 Convertible Notes, 2023 Notes and 2024 Notes, after taking into account the effect of the interest rate swaps we have entered into in connection with these securities, all bear interest at floating rates. Macro trends in base interest rates like LIBOR or other alternate reference rates may affect our net investment income over the long term. However, because we generally originate loans to a small number of portfolio companies each quarter, and those investments also vary in size, our results in any given period-including the interest rate on investments that were sold or repaid in a period compared to the interest rate of new investments made during that period-often are idiosyncratic, and reflect the characteristics of the particular portfolio companies that we invested in or exited during the period and not necessarily any trends in our business.\nIn addition to interest income, our net investment income is also driven by prepayment and other fees, which also can vary significantly from quarter to quarter. The level of prepayment fees is generally correlated to the movement in credit spreads and risk premiums, but also will vary based on corporate events that may take place at an individual portfolio company in a given period-e.g., merger and acquisition activity, initial public offerings and restructurings. As noted above, generally a small but varied number of portfolio companies may make prepayments in any quarter, meaning that changes in the amount of prepayment fees received can vary significantly between periods and can vary without regard to underlying credit trends.\nLoan origination fees, original issue discount and market discount or premium are capitalized, and we accrete or amortize such amounts as interest income using the effective interest method for term instruments and the straight-line method for revolving or delayed draw instruments. Repayments of our debt investments can reduce interest income from period to period. We record prepayment premiums on loans as interest income when earned. We also may generate revenue in the form of commitment, amendment, structuring, syndication or due diligence fees, fees for providing managerial assistance and consulting fees. The frequency or volume of these items of revenue may fluctuate significantly.\nDividend income on common equity investments is recorded on the record date for private portfolio companies or on the ex-dividend date for publicly traded portfolio companies.\nOur portfolio activity also reflects the proceeds of sales of investments. We recognize realized gains or losses on investments based on the difference between the net proceeds from the disposition and the amortized cost basis of the investment without regard to unrealized gains or losses previously recognized. We record current period changes in fair value of investments that are measured at fair value as a component of the net change in unrealized gains (losses) on investments in the consolidated statements of operations.\nExpenses\nOur primary operating expenses include the payment of fees to our Adviser under the Investment Advisory Agreement, expenses reimbursable under the Administration Agreement and other operating costs described below. Additionally, we pay interest expense on our outstanding debt. We bear all other costs and expenses of our operations, administration and transactions, including those relating to:\n \u2022 calculating individual asset values and our net asset value (including the cost and expenses of any independent valuation firms); \n \u2022 expenses, including travel expenses, incurred by the Adviser, or members of our Investment Team, or payable to third parties, in respect of due diligence on prospective portfolio companies and, if necessary, in respect of enforcing our rights with respect to investments in existing portfolio companies; \n \u2022 the costs of any public offerings of our common stock and other securities, including registration and listing fees; \n \u2022 the Management Fee and any Incentive Fee; \n \u2022 certain costs and expenses relating to distributions paid on our shares; \n \u2022 administration fees payable under our Administration Agreement; \n \n \u2022 costs of preparing financial statements and maintaining books and records and filing reports or other documents with the SEC (or other regulatory bodies) and other reporting and compliance costs, and the compensation of professionals responsible for the preparation of the foregoing, including the allocable portion of the compensation of our Chief Financial Officer, Chief Compliance Officer and other professionals who spend time on those related activities (based on the percentage of time those individuals devote, on an estimated basis, to our business and affairs); \n \u2022 debt service and other costs of borrowings or other financing arrangements; \n \u2022 the Adviser's allocable share of costs incurred in providing significant managerial assistance to those portfolio companies that request it; \n \u2022 amounts payable to third parties relating to, or associated with, making or holding investments; \n \u2022 transfer agent and custodial fees; \n \u2022 costs of hedging; \n \u2022 commissions and other compensation payable to brokers or dealers; \n \u2022 taxes; \n \u2022 Independent Director fees and expenses; \n \u2022 the costs of any reports, proxy statements or other notices to our stockholders (including printing and mailing costs), the costs of any stockholders' meetings and the compensation of investor relations personnel responsible for the preparation of the foregoing and related matters; \n \u2022 our fidelity bond; \n \u2022 directors and officers/errors and omissions liability insurance, and any other insurance premiums; \n \u2022 indemnification payments; \n \u2022 direct costs and expenses of administration, including audit, accounting, consulting and legal costs; and \n \u2022 all other expenses reasonably incurred by us in connection with making investments and administering our business. \nWe expect that during periods of asset growth, our general and administrative expenses will be relatively stable or will decline as a percentage of total assets, and will increase as a percentage of total assets during periods of asset declines.\nLeverage\nWhile as a BDC the amount of leverage that we are permitted to use is limited in significant respects, we use leverage to increase our ability to make investments. The amount of leverage we use in any period depends on a variety of factors, including cash available for investing, the cost of financing and general economic and market conditions, however, under the 1940 Act, our total borrowings are limited so that our asset coverage ratio cannot fall below 150% immediately after any borrowing, as defined in the 1940 Act. In any period, our interest expense will depend largely on the extent of our borrowing and we expect interest expense will increase as we increase leverage over time within the limits of the 1940 Act. In addition, we may dedicate assets as collateral to financing facilities from time to time.\nOn October 8, 2018, our stockholders approved the application of the minimum asset coverage ratio of 150% to us, as set forth in Section 61(a)(2) of the 1940 Act, as amended by the SBCAA. As a result and subject to certain additional disclosure requirements, as of October 9, 2018, our minimum asset coverage ratio was reduced from 200% to 150%. In other words, pursuant to Section 61(a) of the 1940 Act, as amended by the SBCAA, we are permitted to potentially increase our maximum debt-to-equity ratio from an effective level of one-to-one to two-to-one.\nMarket Trends\nWe believe trends in the middle-market lending environment, including the limited availability of capital, strong demand for debt capital and specialized lending requirements, are likely to continue to create favorable opportunities for us to invest at attractive risk-adjusted rates.\nThe limited number of dedicated providers of capital to middle-market companies, combined with increases in required capital levels for regulated financial institutions, reduces the capacity of traditional lenders to serve middle-market companies. We believe that the limited availability of capital creates a significant opportunity for us to directly originate investments. We also believe that the large amount of uninvested capital held by private equity firms will continue to drive deal activity, which may in turn create additional demand for debt capital.\nThe limited number of dedicated providers is further exacerbated by the specialized due diligence and underwriting capabilities, as well as extensive ongoing monitoring, required for middle-market lending. We believe middle-market lending is generally more labor-intensive than lending to larger companies due to smaller investment sizes and the lack of publicly available information on these companies.\nAn imbalance between the supply of, and demand for, middle-market debt capital creates attractive pricing dynamics for investors such as BDCs. The negotiated nature of middle-market financings also generally provides for more favorable terms to the lenders, including stronger covenant and reporting packages, better call protection and lender-protective change of control provisions. We believe that BDCs have flexibility to develop loans that reflect each borrower's distinct situation, provide long-term relationships and a potential source for future capital, which renders BDCs, including us, attractive lenders.\nIn late 2019 and early 2020, the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 and related respiratory disease COVID-19 emerged in China and spread rapidly across the world, including to the United States. This outbreak has led to, and for an unknown and potentially significant period of time will continue to lead to, disruptions in local, regional, national and global markets and economies affected thereby. To date, cross border commercial activity and market sentiment have been negatively impacted by the outbreak and government and other measures seeking to contain its spread. The federal government and the Federal Reserve, as well as foreign governments and central banks, have implemented significant fiscal and monetary policies in response to these disruptions, and additional government and regulatory responses may be possible. It is currently impossible to determine the scope of this or any future outbreak, how long any such outbreak and market disruption, volatility or uncertainty may last, the effect any governmental actions and changes in base interest rates will have or the full potential impact on us, our industry and our portfolio companies.\nPortfolio and Investment Activity\nAs of December 31, 2020, our portfolio based on fair value consisted of 95.6% first-lien debt investments, 0.2% second-lien debt investments, 0.5% mezzanine investments and 3.7% equity and other investments. As of December 31, 2019, our portfolio based on fair value consisted of 96.5% first-lien debt investments, 0.6% second-lien debt investments, 0.1% mezzanine investments, and 2.8% equity and other investments.\nAs of December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, our weighted average total yield of debt and income producing securities at fair value (which includes interest income and amortization of fees and discounts) was 10.0% and 10.5%, respectively, and our weighted average total yield of debt and income-producing securities at amortized cost (which includes interest income and amortization of fees and discounts) was 10.2% and 10.7%, respectively.\nAs of December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, we had investments in 70 and 63 portfolio companies, respectively, with an aggregate fair value of $2,298.9 million and $2,245.9 million, respectively.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2020, the principal amount of new investments funded was $939.0 million in 31 new portfolio companies and 27 existing portfolio companies. For this period, we had $941.3 million aggregate principal amount in exits and repayments.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2019, the principal amount of new investments funded was $1,087.6 million in 32 new portfolio companies and 14 existing portfolio companies. For this period, we had $575.2 million aggregate principal amount in exits and repayments.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2018, the principal amount of new investments funded was $816.9 million in 19 new portfolio companies and 14 existing portfolio companies. For this period, we had $790.3 million aggregate principal amount in exits and repayments.\nOur investment activity for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018 is presented below (information presented herein is at par value unless otherwise indicated).\n\n (1) Includes one fixed rate investment for the year ended December 31, 2020 and two fixed rate investments for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 for which we entered into interest rate swap agreements to swap to floating rates. \nAs of December 31, 2020 and 2019, our investments consisted of the following:\n\nThe following tables show the fair value and amortized cost of our performing and non-accrual investments as of December 31, 2020 and 2019:\n\n\n (1) Loans are generally placed on non-accrual status when principal or interest payments are past due 30 days or more or when management has reasonable doubt that the borrower will pay principal or interest in full. Accrued and unpaid interest is generally reversed when a loan is placed on non-accrual status. Non-accrual loans are restored to accrual status when past due principal and interest has been paid and, in management's judgment, the borrower is likely to make principal and interest payments in the future. Management may determine to not place a loan on non-accrual status if, notwithstanding any failure to pay, the loan has sufficient collateral value and is in the process of collection. See -Critical Accounting Policies - Interest and Dividend Income Recognition.\u201d \nThe weighted average yields and interest rates of our performing debt investments at fair value as of December 31, 2020 and 2019 were as follows:\n\n (1) Weighted average total portfolio yield at fair value was 9.5% at December 31, 2020 and 10.3% at December 31, 2019. \n (2) Includes fixed rate investments for which we entered into interest rate swap agreements to swap to floating rates. \nThe Adviser monitors our portfolio companies on an ongoing basis. The Adviser monitors the financial trends of each portfolio company to determine if it is meeting its business plans and to assess the appropriate course of action for each company. The Adviser has a number of methods of evaluating and monitoring the performance of our investments, which may include the following:\n \u2022 assessment of success of the portfolio company in adhering to its business plan and compliance with covenants; \n \u2022 periodic and regular contact with portfolio company management and, if appropriate, the financial or strategic sponsor, to discuss financial position, requirements and accomplishments; \n \u2022 comparisons to other companies in the industry; \n \u2022 attendance at, and participation in, board meetings; and \n \u2022 review of monthly and quarterly financial statements and financial projections for portfolio companies. \nAs part of the monitoring process, the Adviser regularly assesses the risk profile of each of our investments and, on a quarterly basis, grades each investment on a risk scale of 1 to 5. Risk assessment is not standardized in our industry and our risk assessment may not be comparable to ones used by our competitors. Our assessment is based on the following categories:\n \u2022 An investment is rated 1 if, in the opinion of the Adviser, it is performing as agreed and there are no concerns about the portfolio company's performance or ability to meet covenant requirements. For these investments, the Adviser generally prepares monthly reports on investment performance and intensive quarterly asset reviews. \n \u2022 An investment is rated 2 if it is performing as agreed, but, in the opinion of the Adviser, there may be concerns about the company's operating performance or trends in the industry. For these investments, in addition to monthly reports and quarterly asset reviews, the Adviser also researches any areas of concern with the objective of early intervention with the portfolio company. \n \u2022 An investment will be assigned a rating of 3 if it is paying its obligations to us as agreed but a material covenant violation is expected. For these investments, in addition to monthly reports and quarterly asset reviews, the Adviser also adds the investment to its watch list\u201d and researches any areas of concern with the objective of early intervention with the portfolio company. \n \u2022 An investment will be assigned a rating of 4 if a material covenant has been violated, but the company is making its scheduled payments on its obligations to us. For these investments, the Adviser generally prepares a bi-monthly asset review email and generally has monthly meetings with the portfolio company's senior management. For investments where there have been material defaults, including bankruptcy filings, failures to achieve financial performance requirements or failure to maintain liquidity or loan-to-value requirements, the Adviser often will take immediate action to protect its position. These remedies may include negotiating for additional collateral, modifying investment terms or structure, or payment of amendment and waiver fees. \n \u2022 A rating of 5 indicates an investment is in default on its interest and/or principal payments. For these investments, our Adviser reviews the investments on a bi-monthly basis and, where possible, pursues workouts that achieve an early resolution to avoid further deterioration of our investment. The Adviser retains legal counsel and takes actions to preserve our rights, which may include working with the portfolio company to have the default cured, to have the investment restructured or to have the investment repaid through a consensual workout. \nThe following table shows the distribution of our investments on the 1 to 5 investment performance rating scale at fair value as of December 31, 2020 and 2019. Investment performance ratings are accurate only as of those dates and may change due to subsequent developments relating to a portfolio company's business or financial condition, market conditions or developments, and other factors.\n\nResults of Operations\nOperating results for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018 were as follows:\n\n (1) Includes foreign exchange hedging activity. \nInvestment Income\n\nInterest from investments, which includes amortization of upfront fees and prepayment fees, increased from $237.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 to $245.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, primarily due to an increase in accelerated amortization of upfront fees and prepayment fees due to increased paydowns which was partially offset by a decrease in the average\nLIBOR rate for the year ended December 31, 2020. Accelerated amortization of upfront fees, from unscheduled paydowns, increased from $6.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 to $14.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, and prepayment fees increased from $12.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 to $21.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. The accelerated amortization and prepayment fees primarily resulted from full paydowns on 13 portfolio investments, partial paydowns on five portfolio investments, and prepayment fees on 11 portfolio investments during the year ended December 31, 2019, and full paydowns on 17 portfolio investments, partial paydowns on ten portfolio investments, partial realizations on four portfolio investments and prepayment fees on 18 portfolio investments during the year ended December 31, 2020. Dividend income increased from $0.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 to $1.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 due to increased investment in dividend yielding securities in 2020. Other income increased from $13.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 to $22.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, primarily due to higher agency, syndication and miscellaneous fees earned during 2020.\nInterest from investments, which includes amortization of upfront fees and prepayment fees, decreased from $249.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 to $237.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, primarily due to a decrease in accelerated amortization of upfront fees and prepayment fees due to fewer paydowns which was partially offset by an increase in the average portfolio size for the year ended December 31, 2019. Accelerated amortization of upfront fees, primarily from unscheduled paydowns, decreased from $13.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 to $6.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, and prepayment fees decreased from $25.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 to $12.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The accelerated amortization and prepayment fees primarily resulted from full paydowns on 16 portfolio investments, partial paydowns on three portfolio investments, partial realizations on two portfolio investments and prepayment fees on 15 portfolio investments during the year ended December 31, 2018, and full paydowns on 13 portfolio investments, partial paydowns on five portfolio investments, and prepayment fees on 11 portfolio investments during the year ended December 31, 2019. Dividend income increased from $0.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 to $0.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 due to increased investment in dividend yielding securities in 2019. Other income increased from $11.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 to $13.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, primarily due to higher amendment fees earned during 2019.\nExpenses\nOperating expenses for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018 were as follows:\n\nInterest\nInterest expense, including other debt financing expenses, decreased from $49.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 to $39.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. This decrease was primarily due to a decrease in the average interest rate on our debt outstanding due to a decrease in LIBOR and a change in the mix of our debt financing sources for the year ended December 31, 2020 which was partially offset by an increase in the average debt outstanding from $913.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 to $1,001.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. The average interest rate on our debt outstanding decreased from 4.4% for the year ended December 31, 2019 to 3.0% for the year ended December 31, 2020 due to a change in the mix of our debt financing sources and a change in LIBOR rates. For the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2020, weighted average one-month LIBOR for the year was 2.2% and 0.5%, respectively.\nInterest expense, including other debt financing expenses, increased from $42.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 to $49.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. This increase was primarily due to an increase in the average debt outstanding for the year ended December 31, 2018 from $874.3 million to $913.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 and an increase in our average interest rate on debt outstanding due to a change in the mix of our debt financing sources. The average interest rate on our debt outstanding increased from 4.1% for the year ended December 31, 2018 to 4.4% for the year ended December 31, 2019 due to a\nchange in the mix of our debt financing sources and a change in LIBOR. For the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2019, weighted average one-month LIBOR for the year was 2.0% and 2.2%, respectively.\nManagement Fees\nManagement Fees increased from $30.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 to $32.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 due to a small increase in average total assets for the year ended December 31, 2020. The Adviser did not waive any Management Fees for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2020.\nManagement Fees (gross of waivers) increased from $28.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 to $30.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 due to average total assets increasing from $1.9 billion for the year ended December 31, 2018 to $2.1 billion for the year ended December 31, 2019. Management Fees waived were less than $0.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 consisting solely of Management Fees attributable to our ownership of TCAP shares. The Adviser did not waive any Management Fees for the year ended December 31, 2019.\nAny waived Management Fees are not subject to recoupment by the Adviser.\nIncentive Fees\nIncentive Fees related to pre-Incentive Fee net investment income increased from $27.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 to $31.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. This increase resulted primarily from an increase in accelerated amortization of upfront fees and prepayment fees received during the year ended December 31, 2020 and the related increase in net investment income. There were no Incentive Fees related to pre-incentive Fee net investment income waived for the years ended December 31, 2019 or 2020. There were no Incentive Fees related to net capital gains and losses for the year ended December 31, 2019 due to cumulative realized and unrealized losses on our investments and $1.4 million of Incentive Fees were accrued for the year ended December 31, 2020 related to cumulative unrealized capital gains in excess of cumulative net realized capital gains less cumulative unrealized losses and capital gains incentive fees paid inception to date.\nIncentive Fees (gross of waivers) related to pre-Incentive Fee net investment income decreased from $30.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 to $27.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. This decrease resulted primarily from a decrease in interest from investments received during the year ended December 31, 2019 and the related decrease in net investment income. For the year ended December 31, 2018, Incentive Fees related to pre-Incentive Fee net investment income of less than $0.1 million were waived, consisting solely of Incentive Fees attributable to our ownership of the TCAP Shares. There were no Incentive Fees related to pre-incentive Fee net investment income waived for the year ended December 31, 2019. There were no Incentive Fees related to net capital gains for the year ended December 31, 2018 and the year ended December 31, 2019 due to cumulative realized and unrealized losses on our investments.\nAny waived Incentive Fees are not subject to recoupment by the Adviser.\nProfessional Fees and Other General and Administrative Expenses\nProfessional fees increased from $6.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 to $6.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 due to higher legal fees, independent third-party valuation firm and sub-agent administration costs due to a larger portfolio. Other general and administrative fees decreased from $5.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 to $5.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2020.\nProfessional fees decreased from $7.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 to $6.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 due to recognition of remaining non-recurring expenses associated with the initial shelf registration statement in 2018 that were previously recorded as deferred financing cost. Other general and administrative fees increased from $5.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 to $5.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2019.\nIncome Taxes, Including Excise Taxes\nWe have elected to be treated as a RIC under Subchapter M of the Code, and we intend to operate in a manner so as to continue to qualify for the tax treatment applicable to RICs. To qualify as a RIC, we must, among other things, distribute to our stockholders in each taxable year generally at least 90% of our investment company taxable income, as defined by the Code, and net tax-exempt income for that taxable year. To maintain our RIC status, we, among other things, have made and intend to continue to make the requisite distributions to our stockholders, which generally relieve us from corporate-level U.S. federal income taxes.\nDepending on the level of taxable income earned in a tax year, we can be expected to carry forward taxable income (including net capital gains, if any) in excess of current year dividend distributions from the current tax year into the next tax year and pay a nondeductible 4% U.S. federal excise tax on such taxable income, as required. To the extent that we determine that our estimated current year annual taxable income will be in excess of estimated current year dividend distributions from such income, we accrue excise tax on estimated excess taxable income.\nFor the calendar years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018 we recorded a net expense of $5.8 million, $3.8 million and $3.4 million, respectively, for U.S. federal excise tax and other taxes.\nNet Realized and Unrealized Gains and Losses\nThe following table summarizes our net realized and unrealized gains (losses) for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018:\n\nFor the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018, we had net realized losses on investments of $3.1 million, net realized gains on investments of $1.9 million and net realized losses on investments of $11.4 million, respectively. For the year ended December 31, 2020, we had net realized gains of $0.7 million on extinguishment of debt, as a result of our repurchases of our debt securities. For the year ended December 31, 2020, we had net realized losses of less than $0.1 million and for the years ended December 31 2019, and 2018, we had net realized gains of $0.1 million and $0.2 million, respectively, on foreign currency transactions, primarily as a result of translating foreign currency related to our non-USD denominated investments. For the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, we had net realized losses on foreign currency investments of $1.1 million, $0.4 million and $2.2 million, respectively. For the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018 we had net realized gains on foreign currency borrowings of $1.0 million, $0.4 million and $2.7 million, respectively. The net realized gains on foreign currency borrowings were a result of payments on our revolving credit facility. For the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 we had net realized losses of $0.1 million and net realized gains less than $0.1 million, respectively, on interest rate swaps.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2020 we had $74.4 million in unrealized gains on 53 portfolio company investments, which was offset by $42.4 million in unrealized losses on 29 portfolio company investments. Unrealized gains for the year ended December 31, 2020 resulted from an increase in fair value, primarily due to positive valuation adjustments, the positive impact on valuations from the existence of LIBOR floors, and unwind of prior period unrealized losses. Unrealized losses for the year ended December 31, 2020 resulted from the reversal of prior period unrealized gains due to realizations and negative credit-related adjustments.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2019 we had $45.6 million in unrealized gains on 53 portfolio company investments, which was offset by $27.3 million in unrealized losses on 23 portfolio company investments. Unrealized gains for the year ended December 31, 2019 resulted from an increase in fair value, primarily due to positive valuation adjustments and changes in credit spreads. Unrealized losses for the year ended December 31, 2019 resulted from the unwind of prior period unrealized gains due to realizations and negative credit-related adjustments.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2018 we had $44.9 million in unrealized gains on 17 portfolio company investments, which was offset by $62.8 million in unrealized losses on 50 portfolio company investments. Unrealized gains for the year ended December 31, 2018 resulted from an increase in fair value, primarily due to reversal of prior period unrealized losses and positive valuation adjustments. Unrealized losses for the year ended December 31, 2018 resulted from the unwind of prior period unrealized gains on realized investments, widening credit spreads, and in some instances negative credit-related adjustments.\nFor the years ended December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019 we had unrealized losses on foreign currency borrowings of $5.1 million and $3.2 million, respectively, primarily as a result of fluctuations in the AUD, CAD, and EUR exchange rates. For the year ended December 31, 2018, we had unrealized gains on foreign currency borrowings of $5.4 million, primarily as a result of fluctuations in the AUD, CAD, and EUR exchange rates. For the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018, we had unrealized losses on foreign currency cash and forward contracts of less than $0.1 million, unrealized gains on foreign currency cash and forward contracts of less than $0.1 million, and unrealized losses on foreign currency cash and forward contracts of less than $0.1 million, primarily as a result of settling our foreign currency forward contracts. For the year ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 we had unrealized gains on interest rate swaps of $6.8 million and $9.2 million, respectively and for the year ended December 31, 2018, we had unrealized losses on interest rate swaps of $1.7 million, due to fluctuations in interest rates.\nRealized Gross Internal Rate of Return\nSince we began investing in 2011 through December 31, 2020, weighted by capital invested, our exited investments have generated an average realized gross internal rate of return to us of 19.2% (based on total capital invested of $4.9 billion and total proceeds from these exited investments of $6.2 billion). Ninety-one percent of these exited investments resulted in a realized gross internal rate of return to us of 10% or greater.\nGross IRR, with respect to an investment, is calculated based on the dates that we invested capital and dates we received distributions, regardless of when we made distributions to our stockholders. Initial investments are assumed to occur at time zero, and all cash flows are deemed to occur on the fifteenth of each month in which they occur.\nGross IRR reflects historical results relating to our past performance and is not necessarily indicative of our future results. In addition, gross IRR does not reflect the effect of Management Fees, expenses, Incentive Fees or taxes borne, or to be borne, by us or our stockholders, and would be lower if it did.\nAverage gross IRR is the average of the gross IRR for each of our exited investments (each calculated as described above), weighted by the total capital invested for each of those investments.\nAverage gross IRR on our exited investments reflects only invested and realized cash amounts as described above, and does not reflect any unrealized gains or losses in our portfolio.\nInternal rate of return, or IRR, is a measure of our discounted cash flows (inflows and outflows). Specifically, IRR is the discount rate at which the net present value of all cash flows is equal to zero. That is, IRR is the discount rate at which the present value of total capital invested in each of our investments is equal to the present value of all realized returns from that investment. Our IRR calculations are unaudited.\nCapital invested, with respect to an investment, represents the aggregate cost basis allocable to the realized or unrealized portion of the investment, net of any upfront fees paid at closing for the term loan portion of the investment. Capital invested also includes realized losses on hedging activity, with respect to an investment, which represents any inception-to-date realized losses on foreign currency forward contracts allocable to the investment, if any.\nRealized returns, with respect to an investment, represents the total cash received with respect to each investment, including all amortization payments, interest, dividends, prepayment fees, upfront fees, administrative fees, agent fees, amendment fees, accrued interest, and other fees and proceeds. Realized returns also include realized gains on hedging activity, with respect to an investment, which represents any inception-to-date realized gains on foreign currency forward contracts allocable to the investment, if any.\nInterest Rate and Foreign Currency Hedging\nWe use interest rate swaps to hedge our fixed rate debt and certain fixed rate investments. We have designated certain interest rate swaps to be in a hedge accounting relationship. See Note 2 for additional disclosure regarding our accounting for derivative instruments designated in a hedge accounting relationship. See Note 5 for additional disclosure regarding these derivative instruments and the interest payments paid and received. See Note 7 for additional disclosure regarding the carrying value of our debt. Our current approach to hedging the foreign currency exposure in our non-U.S. dollar denominated investments is primarily to borrow the par amount in local currency under our Revolving Credit Facility to fund these investments. For the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, we had $5.1 million and $3.2 million of unrealized losses, respectively, and for the year ended December 31, 2018 we had $5.4 million of unrealized gains on the translation of our non-U.S. dollar denominated debt into U.S. dollars; such amounts approximate the corresponding unrealized gains and losses on the translation of our non-U.S. dollar denominated investments into U.S. dollars for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018. See Note 2 for additional disclosure regarding our accounting for foreign currency. See Note 7 for additional disclosure regarding the amounts of outstanding debt denominated in each foreign currency at December 31, 2020. See our consolidated schedule of investments for additional disclosure regarding the foreign currency amounts (in both par and fair value) of our non-U.S. dollar denominated investments.\nFinancial Condition, Liquidity and Capital Resources\nOur liquidity and capital resources are derived primarily from proceeds from equity issuances, advances from our credit facilities, and cash flows from operations. The primary uses of our cash and cash equivalents are:\n \u2022 investments in portfolio companies and other investments and to comply with certain portfolio diversification requirements; \n \u2022 the cost of operations (including paying our Adviser); \n \u2022 debt service, repayment, and other financing costs; and \n \u2022 cash dividends to the holders of our shares. \nWe intend to continue to generate cash primarily from cash flows from operations, future borrowings and future offerings of securities. We may from time to time enter into additional debt facilities, increase the size of existing facilities or issue debt securities. Any such incurrence or issuance would be subject to prevailing market conditions, our liquidity requirements, contractual and regulatory restrictions and other factors. In accordance with the 1940 Act, with certain limited exceptions, we are only allowed to incur borrowings, issue debt securities or issue preferred stock if immediately after the borrowing or issuance our ratio of total assets (less total liabilities other than indebtedness) to total indebtedness plus preferred stock, is at least 150%. For more information, see Key Components of Our Results of Operations -Leverage\u201d above. As of December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, our asset coverage ratio was 204.5%, 200.4%, and 270.5%, respectively. We carefully consider our unfunded commitments for the purpose of planning our capital resources and ongoing liquidity including our financial leverage. Further, we maintain sufficient borrowing capacity within the 150% asset coverage limitation under the 1940 Act and the asset coverage limitation under our credit facilities to cover any outstanding unfunded commitments we are required to fund.\nCash and cash equivalents as of December 31, 2020, taken together with cash available under our credit facilities, is expected to be sufficient for our investing activities and to conduct our operations in the near term. As of December 31, 2020, we had approximately $862.7 million of availability on our Revolving Credit Facility, subject to asset coverage limitations.\nAs of December 31, 2020, we had $13.3 million in cash and cash equivalents, including $10.8 million of restricted cash. During the year ended December 31, 2020, we provided $145.1 million in cash from operating activities as a result of repayments and proceeds from investments of $1,048.0 million and an increase in net assets resulting from operations of $178.1 million, which was partially offset by funding portfolio investments of $1,038.9 million, and other operating activity of $42.1 million. Lastly, cash used in financing activities was $145.9 million during the period, consisting of paydowns on our Revolving Credit Facility of $1,090.7 million, dividends paid of $130.4 million, repurchases of debt of $31.8 million, repurchases of common stock of $2.9 million, and deferred financing costs of $4.3 million, which was partially offset by borrowings of $1,114.2 million.\nAs of December 31, 2019, we had $14.1 million in cash and cash equivalents, including $9.3 million of restricted cash. During the year ended December 31, 2019, we provided $378.0 million in cash for operating activities, primarily as a result of purchases and originations of investments of $1,118.1 million and other operating activity of $36.5 million partially offset by repayments on investments of $622.0 million and an increase in net assets resulting from operations of $154.6 million. Lastly, cash provided in financing activities was $381.6 million during the period, primarily due to borrowings of $1,742.6 million (including the issuance of $300.0 million principal amount of our 2024 Notes), which were partially offset by paydowns on our Revolving Credit Facility of $1,255.2 million, dividends paid of $98.1 million, and deferred financing costs of $7.7 million.\nAs of December 31, 2020, we had $10.8 million of restricted cash pledged as collateral under our interest rate swap agreements, compared to $9.3 million as of December 31, 2019.\nEquity\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, we issued 1,366,582 and 1,111,774 shares of our common stock, respectively, to investors who have not opted out of our dividend reinvestment plan for proceeds of $22.3 million and $21.1 million, respectively. On January 15, 2021, we issued 211,904 shares of our common stock through our dividend reinvestment plan for proceeds of $4.2 million, which is not reflected in the number of shares issued for the year ended December 31, 2020 in this section or the consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2020.\nOn August 4, 2015, our Board authorized us to acquire up to $50 million in aggregate of our common stock from time to time over an initial six month period, and has continued to authorize the refreshment of the $50 million amount authorized under and extension of the stock repurchase program prior to its expiration since that time, most recently as of November 4, 2020. The amount and timing of stock repurchases under the program may vary depending on market conditions, and no assurance can be given that any particular amount of common stock will be repurchased.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2020, we repurchased 206,964 shares at a weighted average price per share of $14.17 inclusive of commissions, for a total cost of $2.9 million. For the year ended December 31, 2019 no shares were repurchased.\nDebt\nDebt obligations consisted of the following as of December 31, 2020 and 2019:\n\n (1) The amount available may be subject to limitations related to the borrowing base under the Revolving Credit Facility and asset coverage requirements. \n (2) The carrying values of the Revolving Credit Facility, 2022 Convertible Notes, 2023 Notes, and 2024 Notes are presented net of deferred financing costs and original issue discounts of $10.8 million, $1.5 million, $1.3 million and $5.3 million, respectively. \n (3) The carrying value of the 2024 Notes is presented inclusive of an incremental $16.8 million, which represents an adjustment in the carrying value of the 2024 Notes resulting from a hedge accounting relationship. \n\n (1) The amount available may be subject to limitations related to the borrowing base under the Revolving Credit Facility and asset coverage requirements. \n (2) The carrying values of the Revolving Credit Facility, 2022 Convertible Notes, 2023 Notes, and 2024 Notes are presented net of deferred financing costs and original issue discounts of $10.0 million, $3.1 million, $2.0 million and $6.9 million, respectively. \n (3) The carrying value of the 2024 Notes is presented inclusive of an incremental ($1.8) million, which represents an adjustment in the carrying value of the 2024 Notes resulting from a hedge accounting relationship. \nAs of December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, we were in compliance with the terms of our debt arrangements. We intend to continue to utilize our credit facilities to fund investments and for other general corporate purposes.\nRevolving Credit Facility\nOn August 23, 2012, we entered into a senior secured revolving credit agreement with Truist Bank (as a successor by merger to SunTrust Bank), as administrative agent, and J.P. Morgan Chase Bank, N.A., as syndication agent, and certain other lenders (as amended and restated, the Revolving Credit Facility\u201d).\nAs of December 31, 2020, aggregate commitments under the facility were $1.335 billion. Pursuant to an amendment to the Revolving Credit Facility dated as of February 5, 2021 (the Tenth Amendment\u201d), the aggregate commitments under the facility were increased to $1.485 billion. The facility includes an uncommitted accordion feature that allows us, under certain circumstances, to increase the size of the facility to up to $2.0 billion.\nPursuant to the Tenth Amendment, with respect to $1.390 billion in commitments, the revolving period, during which period we, subject to certain conditions, may make borrowings under the facility, was extended from January 31, 2024 to February 4, 2025 and the stated maturity date was extended from January 31, 2025 to February 4, 2026. For the remaining $95.0 million of commitments, the revolving period ends January 31, 2024 and the stated maturity is January 31, 2025.\nWe may borrow amounts in U.S. dollars or certain other permitted currencies. As of December 31, 2020, we had outstanding debt denominated in Australian dollars (AUD) of 51.6 million, Canadian dollars (CAD) of 74.8 million, and Euro (EUR) of 8.4 million on our Revolving Credit Facility, included in the Outstanding Principal amount in the table above.\nThe Revolving Credit Facility also provides for the issuance of letters of credit up to an aggregate amount of $75 million. As of December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, we had no outstanding letters of credit issued through the Revolving Credit Facility. The amount available for borrowing under the Revolving Credit Facility is reduced by any letters of credit issued through the Revolving Credit Facility.\nAmounts drawn under the Revolving Credit Facility, including amounts drawn in respect of letters of credit, bear interest at either LIBOR plus a margin of either 1.75% or 1.875%, or the base rate plus a margin of either 0.75% or 0.875%, in each case, based on the total amount of the borrowing base relative to the sum of the total commitments (or, if greater, the total exposure) under the Revolving Credit Facility plus certain other designated secured debt. We may elect either the LIBOR or base rate at the time of drawdown, and loans may be converted from one rate to another at any time, subject to certain conditions. We also pay a fee of 0.375% on undrawn amounts and, in respect of each undrawn letter of credit, a fee and interest rate equal to the then applicable margin while the letter of credit is outstanding.\nThe Revolving Credit Facility is guaranteed by Sixth Street SL SPV, LLC, TC Lending, LLC and Sixth Street SL Holding, LLC. The Revolving Credit Facility is secured by a perfected first-priority security interest in substantially all the portfolio investments held by us and each guarantor. Proceeds from borrowings may be used for general corporate purposes, including the funding of portfolio investments.\nThe Revolving Credit Facility includes customary events of default, as well as customary covenants, including restrictions on certain distributions and financial covenants. The financial covenants require:\n \u2022 an asset coverage ratio of no less than 1.5 to 1 on the last day of any fiscal quarter; \n \u2022 a liquidity test under which we must not maintain cash and liquid investments of less than 10% of the covered debt amount for more than 30 consecutive business days under circumstances where our adjusted covered debt balance is greater than 90% of our adjusted borrowing base under the facility; \n \u2022 stockholders' equity of at least $500 million plus 25% of the net proceeds of the sale of equity interests after January 31, 2020; \n \u2022 a minimum asset coverage ratio of no less than 2 to 1 with respect to (i) the consolidated assets of the Company and the subsidiary guarantors (including certain limitations on the contribution of equity in financing subsidiaries) to (ii) the secured debt of the Company and its subsidiary guarantors plus unsecured senior securities of the Company and its subsidiary guarantors that mature within 90 days of the date of determination (the Obligor Asset Coverage Ratio\u201d); and \n \u2022 minimum consolidated assets of the Company and the subsidiary guarantors (including certain limitations on the contribution of equity in financing subsidiaries), less total secured debt of the Company and the subsidiary guarantors, of at least $350 million at the last day of any fiscal quarter. \nThe Revolving Credit Facility also contains certain additional concentration limits in connection with the calculation of the borrowing base, based on the Obligor Asset Coverage Ratio.\nNet proceeds received from our common stock issuance in March 2018 and net proceeds received from the issuance of the 2022 Convertible Notes, 2023 Notes and 2024 Notes were used to pay down borrowings on the Revolving Credit Facility.\n2019 Convertible Notes\nIn June 2014, we issued in a private offering $115 million aggregate principal amount convertible notes due December 2019 (the 2019 Convertible Notes\u201d). The 2019 Convertible Notes were issued in a private placement only to qualified institutional buyers pursuant to Rule 144A under the Securities Act. The 2019 Convertible Notes were unsecured and bore interest at a rate of 4.50% per year, payable semiannually. The 2019 Convertible Notes matured on December 15, 2019 and were fully repaid in cash. The swap transaction associated with the issuance of the 2019 Convertible Notes also matured on December 15, 2019.\n2022 Convertible Notes\nIn February 2017, we issued in a private offering $115 million aggregate principal amount convertible notes due August 2022 (the 2022 Convertible Notes\u201d and, together with the 2019 Convertible Notes, the Convertible Notes\u201d). The 2022 Convertible Notes were issued in a private placement only to qualified institutional buyers pursuant to Rule 144A under the Securities Act. The 2022 Convertible Notes are unsecured, and bear interest at a rate of 4.50% per year, payable semiannually. The 2022 Convertible Notes will mature on August 1, 2022. In certain circumstances, the 2022 Convertible Notes will be convertible into cash, shares of our common stock or a combination of cash and shares of our common stock, at our election, at an initial conversion rate of 46.8516 shares of common stock per $1,000 principal amount of 2022 Convertible Notes, which is equivalent to an initial conversion price of approximately $21.34 per share of our common stock, subject to customary anti-dilution adjustments. As of December 31, 2020, the estimated adjusted conversion price was approximately $19.80 per share of common stock. The sale of the 2022 Convertible Notes generated net proceeds of approximately $111.2 million. We used the net proceeds of the offering to pay down debt under the Revolving Credit Facility. In connection with the offering of 2022 Convertible Notes, we have entered into an interest rate swap to continue to align the interest rates of our liabilities with our investment portfolio, which consists of predominately floating rate loans. As a result of the swaps, our effective interest rate on the original issuance of 2022 Convertible Notes is three-month LIBOR plus 2.37%.\nIn June 2018, we issued an additional $57.5 million aggregate principal amount of 2022 Convertible Notes. The additional 2022 Convertible Notes were issued with identical terms, and are fungible with and are part of a single series with the previously outstanding $115 million aggregate principal amount of our 2022 Convertible Notes issued in February 2017. In connection with the reopening of the 2022 Convertible Notes, we entered into interest rate swaps to continue to align the interest rates of its liabilities with its investment portfolio, which consists of predominantly floating rate loans. As a result of the additional swaps, our effective interest rate on the additional 2022 Convertible Notes is approximately three-month LIBOR plus 1.60%. See Note 5 for further information related to our interest rate swaps.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2020, we repurchased on the open market and extinguished $29.7 million in aggregate principal amount of the 2022 Convertible Notes for $29.5 million. These repurchases resulted in a gain on extinguishment of debt of less than $0.7 million. This gain is included in the extinguishment of debt in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations. In connection with the repurchases of the 2022 Convertible Notes, we entered into floating-to-fixed interest rate swaps with an aggregate notional amount equal to the amount of 2022 Convertible Notes repurchased, which has the effect of reducing the notional exposure of the fixed-to-floating interest rate swaps, which were entered into in connection with the issuance of the 2022 Convertible Notes, to match the current principal amount of the 2022 Convertible Notes outstanding. As a result of the swaps, our effective interest rate on the outstanding 2022 Convertible Notes is three-month LIBOR plus 2.11% (on a weighted-average basis).\nHolders may convert their 2022 Convertible Notes at their option at any time prior to February 1, 2022 only under the following circumstances: (1) during any calendar quarter commencing after the calendar quarter ending on June 30, 2017 (and only during such calendar quarter), if the last reported sale price of the common stock for at least 20 trading days (whether or not consecutive) during a period of 30 consecutive trading days ending on the last trading day of the immediately preceding calendar quarter is greater than or equal to 130% of the conversion price on each applicable trading day; (2) during the five business day period after any five consecutive trading day period (the measurement period\u201d) in which the trading price (as defined in the indenture governing the 2022 Convertible Notes) per $1,000 principal amount of notes for each trading day of the measurement period was less than 98% of the product of the last reported sale price of our common stock and the conversion rate on each such trading day; or (3) upon the occurrence of specified corporate events. On or after February 1, 2022 until the close of business on the scheduled trading day immediately preceding the maturity date, holders may convert their notes at any time, regardless of the occurrence or nonoccurrence of any of the foregoing circumstances.\nThe 2022 Convertible Notes are our unsecured obligations and rank senior in right of payment to our future indebtedness that is expressly subordinated in right of payment to the 2022 Convertible Notes; equal in right of payment to our existing and future indebtedness that is not so subordinated; effectively junior in right of payment to any of our secured indebtedness (including unsecured indebtedness that we later secure) to the extent of the value of the assets securing such indebtedness; and structurally junior to all existing and future indebtedness (including trade payables) incurred by our subsidiaries, financing vehicles or similar facilities.\nAs of December 31, 2020, the principal amount of the 2022 Convertible Notes was exceeded by the value of the underlying shares multiplied by the per share closing price of our common stock. However, the conditions required for conversion prior to maturity had not been satisfied. As of December 31, 2019, the principal amount of the 2022 Convertible Notes was exceeded by the value of the underlying shares multiplied by the per share closing price of our common stock. However, the conditions required for conversion prior to maturity had not been satisfied.\nThe indenture governing the 2022 Convertible Notes contains certain covenants, including covenants requiring us to comply with the applicable asset coverage ratio requirement under the 1940 Act and to provide financial information to the holders of the 2022 Convertible Notes under certain circumstances. These covenants are subject to important limitations and exceptions that are described in the indenture governing the 2022 Convertible Notes. As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, we were in compliance with the terms of the indenture governing the 2022 Convertible Notes.\nThe 2022 Convertible Notes are accounted for in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification ( ASC\u201d) Topic 470-20. Upon conversion of any of the 2022 Convertible Notes, we intend to pay the outstanding principal amount in cash and, to the extent that the conversion value exceeds the principal amount, we have the option to pay in cash or shares of our common stock (or a combination of cash and shares) in respect of the excess amount, subject to the requirements of the indenture governing the 2022 Convertible Notes. We have determined that the embedded conversion options in the 2022 Convertible Notes are not required to be separately accounted for as a derivative under U.S. GAAP. In accounting for the 2022 Convertible Notes, we estimated at the time of issuance separate debt and equity components of the 2022 Convertible Notes. An original issue discount equal to the equity components of the 2022 Convertible Notes was recorded in additional paid-in capital\u201d in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet. Additionally, the issuance costs associated with the 2022 Convertible Notes were allocated to the debt and equity components in proportion to the allocation of the proceeds and accounted for as deferred financing costs and equity issuance costs, respectively.\n2023 Notes\nIn January 2018, we issued $150.0 million aggregate principal amount of unsecured notes that mature on January 22, 2023 (the 2023 Notes\u201d). The principal amount of the 2023 Notes is payable at maturity. The 2023 Notes bear interest at a rate of 4.50% per year, payable semi-annually commencing on July 22, 2018, and may be redeemed in whole or in part at our option at any time at par plus a make whole\u201d premium. Total proceeds from the issuance of the 2023 Notes, net of underwriting discounts and offering costs, were $146.9 million. We used the net proceeds of the 2023 Notes to repay outstanding indebtedness under the Revolving Credit Facility.\nIn connection with the 2023 Notes offering, we entered into an interest rate swap to continue to align the interest rates of our liabilities with our investment portfolio, which consists of predominately floating rate loans. As a result of the swap, our effective interest rate on the 2023 Notes is three-month LIBOR plus 1.99%.\n2024 Notes\nIn November 2019, we issued $300.0 million aggregate principal amount of unsecured notes that mature on November 1, 2024 (the 2024 Notes\u201d). The principal amount of the 2024 Notes is payable at maturity. The 2024 Notes bear interest at a rate of 3.875% per year, payable semi-annually commencing on May 1, 2020, and may be redeemed in whole or in part at our option at any time at par plus a make whole\u201d premium. Total proceeds from the issuance of the 2024 Notes, net of underwriting discounts, offering costs and original issue discount were $292.9 million. We used the net proceeds of the 2024 Notes to repay outstanding indebtedness under the Revolving Credit Facility.\nOn February 5, 2020, we issued an additional $50.0 million aggregate principal amount of unsecured notes that mature on November 1, 2024. The additional 2024 Notes are a further issuance of, fungible with, rank equally in right of payment with and have the same terms (other than the issue date and the public offering price) as the initial issuance of 2024 Notes. Total proceeds from the issuance of the additional 2024 Notes, net of underwriting discounts, offering costs and original issue premium were $50.1 million. We used the net proceeds of the 2024 Notes to repay outstanding indebtedness under the Revolving Credit Facility.\nIn connection with the 2024 Notes offering and reopening of the 2024 Notes, we entered into interest rate swaps to continue to align the interest rates of our liabilities with our investment portfolio, which consists of predominately floating rate loans. As a result of the swaps, our effective interest rate on the 2024 Notes is three-month LIBOR plus 2.28% (on a weighted average basis).\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2020, we repurchased on the open market and extinguished $2.5 million in aggregate principal amount of the 2024 Notes for $2.4 million. These repurchases resulted in a gain on extinguishment of debt of less than $0.1 million. This gain is included in the extinguishment of debt in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations. In connection with the repurchase of the 2024 Notes, we entered into a floating-to-fixed interest rate swap with a notional amount equal to the amount of 2024 Notes repurchased, which has the effect of reducing the notional exposure of the fixed-to-floating interest rate swaps, which were entered into in connection with the issuance of the 2024 Notes, to match the current principal amount of the 2024 Notes outstanding. As a result of the swap, our effective interest rate on the outstanding 2024 Notes is three-month LIBOR plus 2.28% (on a weighted average basis).\n2026 Notes\nOn February 3, 2021, we issued $300.0 million aggregate principal amount of unsecured notes that mature on August 1, 2026 (the 2026 Notes\u201d). The principal amount of the 2026 Notes is payable at maturity. The 2026 Notes bear interest at a rate of 2.50% per year, payable semi-annually commencing on August 1, 2021, and may be redeemed in whole or in part at our option at any time at par plus a make whole\u201d premium. Total proceeds from the issuance of the 2026 Notes, net of underwriting discounts and estimated offering costs, were $294.1 million. We used the net proceeds of the 2026 Notes to repay outstanding indebtedness under the Revolving Credit Facility.\nIn connection with the issuance of the 2026 Notes, we entered into an interest rate swap to continue to align the interest rates of our liabilities with our investment portfolio, which consists of predominantly floating rate loans. As a result of the swap, our effective interest rate on the 2026 Notes is three-month LIBOR plus 1.91%.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nPortfolio Company Commitments\nFrom time to time, we may enter into commitments to fund investments. We incorporate these commitments into our assessment of our liquidity position. Our senior secured revolving loan commitments are generally available on a borrower's demand and may remain outstanding until the maturity date of the applicable loan. Our senior secured term loan commitments are generally available on a borrower's demand and, once drawn, generally have the same remaining term as the associated loan agreement. Undrawn senior secured term loan commitments generally have a shorter availability period than the term of the associated loan agreement. As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, we had the following commitments to fund investments in current portfolio companies:\n\n\n (1) Represents the full amount of our commitments to fund investments on such date. Commitments may be subject to limitations on borrowings set forth in the agreements between us and the applicable portfolio company. As a result, portfolio companies may not be eligible to borrow the full commitment amount on such date. \nOther Commitments and Contingencies\nAs of December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, we did not have any unfunded commitments to fund investments to new borrowers that were not current portfolio companies as of such date.\nFrom time to time, we may become a party to certain legal proceedings incidental to the normal course of our business. As of December 31, 2020, management is not aware of any material pending or threatened litigation that would require accounting recognition or financial statement disclosure.\nWe have certain contracts under which we have material future commitments. Under the Investment Advisory Agreement, our Adviser provides us with investment advisory and management services. For these services, we pay the Management Fee and the Incentive Fee.\nUnder the Administration Agreement, our Adviser furnishes us with office facilities and equipment, provides us clerical, bookkeeping and record keeping services at such facilities and provides us with other administrative services necessary to conduct our day-to-day operations. We reimburse our Adviser for the allocable portion (subject to the review and approval of our Board) of expenses incurred by it in performing its obligations under the Administration Agreement, the fees and expenses associated with performing compliance functions and our allocable portion of the compensation of our Chief Compliance Officer, Chief Financial Officer and other professionals who spend time on those related activities (based on a percentage of time those individuals devote, on an estimated basis, to our business and affairs). Our Adviser also offers on our behalf significant managerial assistance to those portfolio companies to which we are required to offer to provide such assistance.\nContractual Obligations\nA summary of our contractual payment obligations as of December 31, 2020 is as follows:\n\nIn addition to the contractual payment obligations in the tables above, we also have commitments to fund investments and to pledge assets as collateral under the terms of our derivatives agreements.\nDistributions\nWe have elected and qualified to be treated for U.S. federal income tax purposes as a RIC under subchapter M of the Code. To maintain our RIC status, we must distribute (or be treated as distributing) in each taxable year dividends for tax purposes equal to at least 90 percent of the sum of our:\n \u2022 investment company taxable income (which is generally our ordinary income plus the excess of realized net short-term capital gains over realized net long-term capital losses), determined without regard to the deduction for dividends paid, for such taxable year; and \n \u2022 net tax-exempt interest income (which is the excess of our gross tax exempt interest income over certain disallowed deductions) for such taxable year. \nAs a RIC, we (but not our stockholders) generally will not be subject to U.S. federal income tax on investment company taxable income and net capital gains that we distribute to our stockholders.\nWe intend to distribute annually all or substantially all of such income. To the extent that we retain our net capital gains or any investment company taxable income, we generally will be subject to corporate-level U.S. federal income tax. We may choose to retain our net capital gains or any investment company taxable income, and pay the U.S. federal excise tax described below.\nAmounts not distributed on a timely basis in accordance with a calendar year distribution requirement are subject to a nondeductible 4% U.S. federal excise tax payable by us. To avoid this tax, we must distribute (or be treated as distributing) during each calendar year an amount at least equal to the sum of:\n \u2022 98% of our net ordinary income excluding certain ordinary gains or losses for that calendar year; \n \u2022 98.2% of our capital gain net income, adjusted for certain ordinary gains and losses, recognized for the twelve-month period ending on October 31 of that calendar year; and \n \u2022 100% of any income or gains recognized, but not distributed, in preceding years. \nWhile we intend to distribute any income and capital gains in the manner necessary to minimize imposition of the 4% U.S. federal excise tax, sufficient amounts of our taxable income and capital gains may not be distributed to avoid entirely the imposition of this tax. In that event, we will be liable for this tax only on the amount by which we do not meet the foregoing distribution requirement.\nWe intend to pay quarterly dividends to our stockholders out of assets legally available for distribution. All dividends will be paid at the discretion of our Board and will depend on our earnings, financial condition, maintenance of our RIC status, compliance with applicable BDC regulations and such other factors as our Board may deem relevant from time to time.\nTo the extent our current taxable earnings for a year fall below the total amount of our distributions for that year, a portion of those distributions may be deemed a return of capital to our stockholders for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Thus, the source of a distribution to our stockholders may be the original capital invested by the stockholder rather than our income or gains. Stockholders should read any written disclosure carefully and should not assume that the source of any distribution is our ordinary income or gains.\nWe have adopted an opt out\u201d dividend reinvestment plan for our common stockholders. As a result, if we declare a cash dividend or other distribution, each stockholder that has not opted out\u201d of our dividend reinvestment plan will have their dividends or distributions automatically reinvested in additional shares of our common stock rather than receiving cash dividends. Stockholders who receive distributions in the form of shares of common stock will be subject to the same U.S. federal, state and local tax consequences as if they received cash distributions.\nRelated-Party Transactions\nWe have entered into a number of business relationships with affiliated or related parties, including the following:\n \u2022 the Investment Advisory Agreement; \n \u2022 the Administration Agreement; and \n \u2022 an ongoing agreement with an affiliate of TPG governing, inter alia, the parties' respective ownership of and rights to use the Sixth Street\u201d and TPG\u201d trademarks and certain variations thereof. \nCritical Accounting Policies\nThe preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, and expenses. Changes in the economic environment, financial markets, and any other parameters used in determining such estimates could cause actual results to differ. Our critical accounting policies, including those relating to the valuation of our investment portfolio, are described below. The critical accounting policies should be read in connection with our risk factors as disclosed in ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS.\u201d\nInvestments at Fair Value\nLoan originations are recorded on the date of the binding commitment, which is generally the funding date. Investment transactions purchased through the secondary markets are recorded on the trade date. Realized gains or losses are measured by the difference between the net proceeds received (excluding prepayment fees, if any) and the amortized cost basis of the investment without regard to unrealized gains or losses previously recognized, and include investments charged off during the period, net of recoveries. The net\nchange in unrealized gains or losses primarily reflects the change in investment values and also includes the reversal of previously recorded unrealized gains or losses with respect to investments realized during the period.\nInvestments for which market quotations are readily available are typically valued at those market quotations. To validate market quotations, we utilize a number of factors to determine if the quotations are representative of fair value, including the source and number of the quotations. Debt and equity securities that are not publicly traded or whose market prices are not readily available, as is the case for substantially all of our investments, are valued at fair value as determined in good faith by our Board, based on, among other things, the input of the Adviser, our Audit Committee and independent third-party valuation firms engaged at the direction of the Board.\nAs part of the valuation process, the Board takes into account relevant factors in determining the fair value of our investments, including and in combination of:\n \u2022 the estimated enterprise value of a portfolio company (that is, the total value of the portfolio company's net debt and equity); \n \u2022 the nature and realizable value of any collateral; \n \u2022 the portfolio company's ability to make payments based on its earnings and cash flow; \n \u2022 the markets in which the portfolio company does business; \n \u2022 a comparison of the portfolio company's securities to any similar publicly traded securities; and \n \u2022 overall changes in the interest rate environment and the credit markets that may affect the price at which similar investments may be made in the future. \nWhen an external event, such as a purchase transaction, public offering or subsequent equity sale occurs, the Board considers whether the pricing indicated by the external event corroborates our valuation.\nThe Board undertakes a multi-step valuation process, which includes, among other procedures, the following:\n \u2022 The valuation process begins with each investment being initially valued by the investment professionals responsible for the portfolio investment in conjunction with the portfolio management team. \n \u2022 The Adviser's management reviews the preliminary valuations with the investment professionals. Agreed-upon valuation recommendations are presented to the Audit Committee. \n \u2022 The Audit Committee reviews the valuations presented and recommends values for each investment to the Board. \n \u2022 The Board reviews the recommended valuations and determines the fair value of each investment; valuations that are not based on readily available market quotations are valued in good faith based on, among other things, the input of the Adviser, Audit Committee and, where applicable, other third parties, including independent third party valuation firms engaged at the direction of the Board. \nWe conduct this valuation process on a quarterly basis.\nThe Board has engaged independent third-party valuation firms to perform certain limited procedures that the Board has identified and requested them to perform in connection with the valuation process. At December 31, 2020, the independent third-party valuation firms performed their procedures over substantially all of our investments. Upon completion of such limited procedures, the third-party valuation firms determined that the fair value, as determined by the Board, of those investments subjected to their limited procedures, appeared reasonable.\nWe apply Financial Accounting Standards Board Accounting Standards Codification Topic 820, Fair Value Measurement ( ASC Topic 820\u201d), as amended, which establishes a framework for measuring fair value in accordance with U.S. GAAP and required disclosures of fair value measurements. ASC Topic 820 determines fair value to be the price that would be received for an investment in a current sale, which assumes an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. Market participants are defined as buyers and sellers in the principal or most advantageous market (which may be a hypothetical market) that are independent, knowledgeable, and willing and able to transact. In accordance with ASC Topic 820, we consider our principal market to be the market that has the greatest volume and level of activity. ASC Topic 820 specifies a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes and ranks the level of observability of inputs used in determination of fair value. In accordance with ASC Topic 820, these levels are summarized below:\n \u2022 Level 1-Valuations based on quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that we have the ability to access. \n \n \u2022 Level 2-Valuations based on quoted prices in markets that are not active or for which all significant inputs are observable, either directly or indirectly. \n \u2022 Level 3-Valuations based on inputs that are unobservable and significant to the overall fair value measurement. \nTransfers between levels, if any, are recognized at the beginning of the quarter in which the transfers occur. In addition to using the above inputs in investment valuations, we apply the valuation policy approved by our Board that is consistent with ASC Topic 820. Consistent with the valuation policy, we evaluate the source of inputs, including any markets in which our investments are trading (or any markets in which securities with similar attributes are trading), in determining fair value. When a security is valued based on prices provided by reputable dealers or pricing services (that is, broker quotes), we subject those prices to various additional criteria in making the determination as to whether a particular investment would qualify for treatment as a Level 2 or Level 3 investment. For example, we review pricing and methodologies provided by dealers or pricing services in order to determine if observable market information is being used, versus unobservable inputs. Some additional factors considered include the number of prices obtained, as well as an assessment as to their quality, such as the depth of the relevant market relative to the size of the Company's position.\nOur accounting policy on the fair value of our investments is critical because the determination of fair value involves subjective judgments and estimates. Accordingly, the notes to our consolidated financial statements express the uncertainty with respect to the possible effect of these valuations, and any change in these valuations, on the consolidated financial statements.\nSee Note 6 to our consolidated financial statements included in this Form 10-K for more information on the fair value of our investments.\nInterest and Dividend Income Recognition\nInterest income is recorded on an accrual basis and includes the amortization of discounts and premiums. Discounts and premiums to par value on securities purchased or originated are amortized into interest income over the contractual life of the respective security using the effective interest method. The amortized cost of investments represents the original cost adjusted for the amortization of discounts and premiums, if any.\nUnless providing services in connection with an investment, such as syndication, structuring or diligence, all or a portion of any loan fees received by us will be deferred and amortized over the investment's life using the effective interest method.\nLoans are generally placed on non-accrual status when principal or interest payments are past due 30 days or more or when management has reasonable doubt that the borrower will pay principal or interest in full. Accrued and unpaid interest is generally reversed when a loan is placed on non-accrual status. Interest payments received on non-accrual loans may be recognized as income or applied to principal depending upon management's judgment regarding collectability. Non-accrual loans are restored to accrual status when past due principal and interest has been paid and, in management's judgment, the borrower is likely to make principal and interest payments in the future. Management may determine to not place a loan on non-accrual status if, notwithstanding any failure to pay, the loan has sufficient collateral value and is in the process of collection.\nDividend income on preferred equity securities is recorded on an accrual basis to the extent that such amounts are payable by the portfolio company and are expected to be collected. Dividend income on common equity securities is recorded on the record date for private portfolio companies or on the ex-dividend date for publicly traded portfolio companies.\nOur accounting policy on interest and dividend income recognition is critical because it involves the primary source of our revenue and accordingly is significant to the financial results as disclosed in our consolidated financial statements.\nU.S. Federal Income Taxes\nWe have elected to be treated as a BDC under the 1940 Act. We also have elected to be treated as a RIC under the Code. So long as we maintain our status as a RIC, we will generally not pay corporate-level U.S. federal income or excise taxes on any ordinary income or capital gains that we distribute at least annually to our stockholders as dividends. As a result, any tax liability related to income earned and distributed by us represents obligations of our stockholders and will not be reflected in our consolidated financial statements.\nWe evaluate tax positions taken or expected to be taken in the course of preparing our financial statements to determine whether the tax positions are more-likely-than-not\u201d to be sustained by the applicable tax authority. Tax positions not deemed to meet the more-likely-than-not\u201d threshold are reversed and recorded as a tax benefit or expense in the current year. All penalties and interest associated with income taxes are included in income tax expense. Conclusions regarding tax positions are subject to review and may be adjusted at a later date based on factors including, but not limited to, on-going analyses of tax laws, regulations and interpretations thereof. As of December 31, 2020, the Company did not have any uncertain tax positions that met the recognition or measurement\ncriteria, nor did the Company have any unrecognized tax benefits. Our 2019, 2018 and 2017 tax year returns remain subject to examination by the relevant federal, state, and local tax authorities.\nOur accounting policy on income taxes is critical because if we are unable to maintain our status as a RIC, we would be required to record a provision for corporate-level U.S. federal income taxes which may be significant to our financial results.", "item_7_tables":
