Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nThe following discussion contains management's discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations and should be read together with the historical consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto included in Part II, Item 8 Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\u201d This discussion contains forward-looking statements that reflect our plans, estimates and beliefs and involve numerous risks and uncertainties, including but not limited to those described in the Risk Factors\u201d section of this Annual Report. Actual results may differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statements. You should carefully read Special Note About Forward-Looking Statements\u201d and Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors.\u201d\nOverview and Recent Developments\nWe are a biopharmaceutical company dedicated to becoming a leader in the discovery, development and commercialization of next generation drugs for the treatment of cancer. Our mission is to improve the lives of cancer patients by creating more effective, safer and tolerable treatments. We have assembled a strong and experienced leadership team and have established operations across the pharmaceutical value chain to execute our goal of becoming a global leader in bringing innovative cancer treatments to the market and improving health outcomes.\nWe are organized around three operating segments: (1) our Oncology Innovation Platform, dedicated to the research and development of our proprietary drugs; (2) our Commercial Platform, focused on the sales and marketing of our specialty drugs and the market development of our proprietary drugs; and (3) our Global Supply Chain Platform, dedicated to providing a stable and efficient supply of active pharmaceutical ingredients ( API\u201d) for our clinical and commercial efforts. Our current clinical pipeline in the Oncology Innovation Platform is derived from the following core technologies: (1) Cell Therapy, (2) Orascovery, based on a P-glycoprotein ( P-gp\u201d) pump inhibitor, and (3) Src Kinase Inhibition.\nOncology Innovation Platform Developments\nThrough our acquisition of Kuur Therapeutics, Inc. (formerly known as Cell Medica, Kuur\u201d) in 2021, we acquired rights to intellectual property to further the development of autologous and allogeneic, or off-the-shelf\u201d, natural killer T ( NKT\u201d) cell immunotherapies for the treatment of solid and hematological malignancies. We are advancing the following product candidates: KUR-501, KUR-502, and KUR-503.\nKUR-501 is an autologous product in which NKT cells are engineered with a chimeric antigen receptor ( CAR\u201d) targeting GD2 ( GINAKIT\u201d cells). GD2 is expressed on almost all neuroblastoma tumors and certain other malignancies. KUR-501 is currently being evaluated in a phase 1 clinical trial (GINAKIT2) treating children with relapsed-refractory ( R/R\u201d) high risk neuroblastoma. In May 2021, we presented an interim data update from the first eleven evaluable patients at the American Society of Gene & Cell Therapy ( ASGCT\u201d). During this initial evaluation, the safety profile of KUR-501 was manageable, and there was no dose limiting toxicity ( DLT\u201d). No patients experienced grade 2 or higher toxicities related to KUR-501. There were no grades 3-5 cytokine release syndrome ( CRS\u201d) and no evidence of immune effector cell-associated neurotoxicity syndrome ( ICANS\u201d) in any of the patients. Grades 3-4 adverse events ( AEs\u201d), reported regardless of relationship to KUR-501, have included anemia, leukopenia, lymphopenia, neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, abdominal distension, acute gastroenteritis, liver enzyme increase, vomiting, bone pain, headache, neck pain, fever, urinary tract infection, altered mental status, and hypoxia. As this clinical development program is still in the early stages, we do not yet have meaningful statistics on safety, including AEs, to report. Observed responses included one complete response ( CR\u201d) and one partial response ( PR\u201d). Four additional patients have exhibited stable disease ( SD\u201d). We also observed long-term persistence of NKT cells expressing CAR. Importantly, we observed NKT cell localization to the tumor site.\nKUR-502 is an allogeneic ( off-the-shelf\u201d) product in which NKT cells are engineered with a CAR targeting CD19. KUR-502 is currently being evaluated in a phase 1 clinical trial (ANCHOR) treating adults with R/R CD19 positive malignancies, including B cell lymphoma, acute lymphoblastic leukemia ( ALL\u201d), and chronic lymphocytic leukemia ( CLL\u201d). In December 2021, we presented an interim data update on the first five evaluable patients at the American Society of Hematology ( ASH\u201d) annual meeting. Tumor biopsies showed presence of NKT cells expressing CARs in the disease sites, indicating that the KUR-502 cells are able to traffic to the tumor. The safety profile was manageable with no DLT. There was one case of grade 1 CRS, no ICANS, and no graft versus host disease ( GvHD\u201d) attributable to KUR-502. Grades 3-4 AEs, reported regardless of relationship to KUR-502, have included lymphopenia, leukopenia, neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, liver enzyme elevation, bilirubin elevation, anemia, diarrhea, hypoalbuminemia, and myositis. As this clinical development program is still in the early stages, we do not yet have meaningful statistics on safety, including AEs, to report. Of the first five evaluable patients, the overall response rate was 80%, and the complete response rate was 60%.\nKUR-503 is an allogeneic ( off-the-shelf\u201d) product in which NKT cells are engineered with a CAR targeting glypican-3 ( GPC3\u201d). GPC3 is a molecule that is highly expressed on most hepatocellular carcinomas ( HCC\u201d) but not normal liver or other non-neoplastic tissue. KUR-503 is currently in preclinical development, and we are planning to submit an IND by the first half of 2023.\nPursuant to the terms of the Merger Agreement, we paid $70.0 million upfront to Kuur shareholders and its former employees and directors, comprised primarily of shares of our common stock. Additionally, Kuur shareholders and its former employees and\ndirectors are eligible to receive up to $115.0 million of milestone payments, which may be paid, at the Company's sole discretion, in either cash or additional common stock of the Company, or a combination of both. The Company identified the Merger as a business combination pursuant to ASC 805 and used the acquisition method of accounting to account for the transaction. The purchase price, after adjusted for closing conditions, consisted of 14,228,066 shares of the Company's common stock issued at $3.71 per share with a fair value of $52.8 million, plus the fair value of the future milestone payments amounting to $19.8 million, recorded as contingent consideration. For additional information, please see Part II, Item 8, Note 3-Business Combination.\u201d\nWe continue to advance TCR affinity-enhancing specific T-cell ( TAEST\u201d) therapy with our drug candidate, TCRT-ESO-A2. TCRT-ESO-A2 is an autologous T cell receptor ( TCR\u201d)-T cell therapy targeting solid tumors that are NY-ESO-1 positive in HLA-A*02:01 positive patients. A phase 1 clinical trial treating adults with advanced solid tumors expressing NY-ESO-1 is currently open enrolling.\nOn February 26, 2021, we received a Complete Response Letter (\"CRL\") from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration ( FDA\u201d) regarding our New Drug Application ( NDA\u201d) for oral paclitaxel and encequidar ( Oral Paclitaxel\u201d) for the treatment of metastatic breast cancer ( mBC\u201d). Following the CRL, we held two Type A meetings with the FDA to discuss the deficiencies raised in the CRL, review a proposed design for a new clinical trial intended to address the deficiencies raised in the CRL, and discuss the potential regulatory path forward for Oral Paclitaxel in mBC in the U.S. In October 2021, after careful consideration of the FDA feedback, we determined to redeploy our resources to focus on other ongoing studies of Oral Paclitaxel and our Cell Therapy platform. On November 29, 2021, we announced the U.K. Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency ( MHRA\u201d) validation of the Marketing Authorization Application ( MAA\u201d) for Oral Paclitaxel, for review. The Phase 3 study of Oral Paclitaxel in mBC (KX-ORAX-001) served as the basis of the MAA.\nWe are continuing to evaluate Oral Paclitaxel in combination with check point inhibitors. The development of our other Orascovery product candidates, including oral irinotecan and encequidar ( Oral Irinotecan\u201d), oral docetaxel and encequidar ( Oral Docetaxel\u201d), oral topotecan and encequidar ( Oral Topotecan\u201d), and oral eribulin and encequidar ( Oral Eribulin\u201d) has been suspended at this time.\nOn February 18, 2021, our partner Almirall (Almirall, S.A., BME: ALM) launched Klisyri\u00ae (tirbanibulin ointment) for actinic keratosis (AK) in the US. On September 27, 2021, we announced Almirall launched Klisyri in Germany and the UK, as part of a phased European launch, after receiving approval from the European Commission in July 2021 and the UK MHRA in August 2021, for Klisyri indicated for the topical treatment of AK of the face or scalp in adults. The launch of Klisyri in the U.S. resulted in a milestone payment of $20.0 million pursuant to our 2017 out-license agreement with Almirall, recognized as revenue in the first quarter of 2021, and the launch in Europe resulted in a milestone payment of $5.0 million, recognized as revenue in the third quarter of 2021.\nOn February 15, 2021, we entered into the Second Amendment to the 2011 license agreement with PharmaEssentia Corp. ( PharmaEssentia\u201d) for tirbanibulin ointment. The Second Amendment expands the territory to include Japan and South Korea and includes a license to use the intellectual property for additional dermatology indications and skin cancer in the existing territories. On July 26, 2021, we announced that we entered into licensing agreements and strategic partnerships with Seqirus Pty Ltd ( Seqirus\u201d), a subsidiary of CSL Limited, and AVIR Pharma Inc. ( AVIR\u201d) for tirbanibulin. Under the terms of the agreements, Seqirus will have an exclusive license to commercialize tirbanibulin in Australia and New Zealand, and AVIR will have an exclusive license to commercialize tirbanibulin in Canada.\nWith respect to Arginine Deprivation therapy, the enrollment of the Phase 1 trial of PT01 for the treatment of patients with advanced malignancies has been suspended, and no further studies are planned at this time.\nCommercial and Global Supply Chain Platform Developments\nWe suspended production activities at our Taihao API facility in Chongqing, China, in May 2019, based on concerns raised by the Department of Emergency Management of Chongqing ( DEMC\u201d) related to the location of our plant. We subsequently resumed producing API at the Taihao API facility primarily for our ongoing clinical studies and commercial launches of proprietary drugs in accordance with local regulatory guidance, while we started building out Sintaho, a new API facility in Chongqing. In July 2021, we received verbal notice from the DEMC that we will be required to terminate the production activities at its Taihao API facility. We are continuing to engage in dialogue with the DEMC. While we are able to continue producing certain API at the Taihao API facility in limited quantities and a certain extent of our operations are now being conducted at Sintaho, we are in the process of moving the remainder of the operations and production activities to Sintaho and exploring other sources of API, in the event we are unable to reach an agreement with the DEMC for the continued production activities of the Taihao API facility.\nOn October 1, 2021, we entered into a lease agreement with Fort Schuyler Management Corporation ( FSMC\u201d), a not-for-profit corporation affiliated with the State of New York, to lease the 409,000 square feet, newly constructed cGMP ISO Class 5 high potency pharmaceutical manufacturing facility located in Dunkirk, NY. This rights to lease this facility were transferred to ImmunityBio in February 2022. For additional information, please see Part II, Item 8, Note 21-Subsequent Events.\u201d\nCOVID-19 related measures\nSince early 2020, after monitoring developments related to the spread of COVID-19, we have undertaken a number of measures in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, with a goal to prioritize the health and safety of our employees and ensure continuity in our business. These measures included implementing a work-from-home policy at various times and other efforts in accordance with recommendations by local authorities for certain of our personnel across the globe as well as imposing restrictions on travel and in-person meetings to protect the health and safety of our workforce while we continue to advance our clinical programs and operations. We have continued to add additional safety procedures and tools in all our locations. We adhere to all state and federal requirements as the same may be in force from time to time.\nWe have been deemed an essential business\u201d by New York State and, as a result, we have experienced minimal disruptions at our New York-based operations in Clarence and Buffalo. Despite these efforts, we may from time to time experience additional disruptions related to the COVID-19 pandemic resulting from employees falling ill with COVID-19. We have supplied our employees with appropriate face coverings and other necessary personal protective equipment and have taken other measures to reduce the risk of the spread of COVID-19 at our work sites. We are actively monitoring our operations and supply chain across the globe and are making adjustments to respond to logistical challenges that arise due to the COVID-19 pandemic where appropriate, particularly due to the emergence and spread of the COVID-19 Omicron variant, which has impacted our operations and supply chain during 2021 as discussed further below. We have continued to produce some medicines that are used to treat COVID-19 as part of our commitment to contribute to the COVID-19 relief effort.\nWith respect to our clinical development program, for our earlier stage product candidates, we have experienced and expect to continue to experience slowed enrollment for our clinical trials as well as suspensions in our clinical trials as healthcare resources are diverted to address the COVID-19 pandemic. We remain committed to advancing our pipeline while ensuring the safety of all participants as well as the integrity of the data. We will continue to monitor developments with respect to the COVID-19 pandemic as well as industry and regulatory best practices for continuing clinical development programs during the pandemic, including, if and where appropriate, the use of virtual communications, interviews, and visits as well as self-administration and remote monitoring techniques to address health and safety concerns while minimizing disruptions and delays to our clinical development timelines.\nWe also put in place a number of measures intended to adjust or allocate resources towards prioritizing key business operations such as clinical and regulatory activities, and to delay or defray compensation costs in order to preserve our cash on hand and liquidity during a volatile period in the U.S. and global capital markets.\nWhile the disruptions to our business caused by the pandemic are currently expected to be temporary, there is still uncertainty regarding the pandemic's overall duration and the severity of any future outbreaks. For example, the surge of COVID-19 cases in the first half of 2021 in India, a country where we source products and maintain partnerships that are key to our specialty drug business, including API, presented business and supply chain disruption risks for us. We could face similar risks in other regions, or a resurgence in India, to the extent the virus is not able to be contained, there is widespread sickness and disruptions on. The scope and impact of any such measures is not yet known and will depend on a number of factors, including but not limited to the ultimate spread and severity of the outbreaks and the scope, duration and impact of containment measures on individuals and businesses. If our partners experience significant or extended disruptions to their business due to COVID-19, it could result in supply shortages and harm our specialty drug business, as well as our overall financial condition.\nGoing Concern Considerations\nWe have three operating segments: our Oncology Innovation Platform, Global Supply Chain Platform and Commercial Platform. Since inception, we have devoted a substantial amount of our resources to research and development of our lead product candidates under our Orascovery and Src Kinase Inhibition technology platforms, as well as under the Cell Therapy platform and Arginine Deprivation Therapy technology, while building up our commercial infrastructure. We have incurred significant net losses since inception.\nWe have incurred operating losses since inception and, as a result, as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, we had an accumulated deficit of $913.4 million and $713.6 million, respectively. We expect to incur significant expenses and operating losses for the foreseeable future. We project insufficient liquidity to fund our operations through the next twelve months beyond the date of this report. This condition raises substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. See Part II, Item 8. Note 1-Company and Nature of Business for further information regarding our ability to continue as a going concern.\nAs a result of the significant decrease in our market capitalization since we last performed a goodwill impairment test in the fourth quarter of 2020, we evaluated the impact on each of our reporting units to assess whether there was an impairment triggering event. The Company identified impairment triggering events during the first quarter of 2021 and, consistent with our annual policy, performed a test as of our annual goodwill impairment evaluation date, October 1, 2021, subsequently updating that analysis to December 31, 2021 using new information that became available regarding conditions that existed as of December 31, 2021. We compared the fair value of our Global Supply Chain Platform and Oncology Innovation Platform reporting units to carrying value. Based on the results from the test on March 31, 2021, the fair value of each of our reporting units exceeded their carrying value, and\nthe goodwill was not impaired. Based on the results from the test during the fourth quarter of 2021, the carrying value of the Global Supply Chain Platform and Oncology Innovation Platform reporting units exceeded their fair value, and therefore, goodwill was determined to be fully impaired. Accordingly, the Company recorded goodwill impairment of $67.7 million during the year ended December 31, 2021, of which, $26.6 million was related to the Global Supply Chain Platform reporting unit and $41.1 million was related to the Oncology Innovation Platform reporting unit (see Part II, Item 8. Note 8-Intangible Assets, Net). Estimating the fair value of goodwill requires the use of estimates and significant judgments that are based on a number of factors. These estimates and judgments may not be within our control and accordingly it is reasonably possible that the judgments and estimates could change in future periods.\nHowever, a lack of sustained recovery or further deterioration in market conditions related to the general economy and the industries in which we operate, a sustained trend of weaker than anticipated financial performance, further decline in our share price for a sustained period of time, or an increase in the market-based weighted average cost of capital, among other factors, could significantly impact the impairment analysis and may result in future impairment charges that, if incurred, could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe have funded our operations to date primarily from the issuance and sale of our common stock through public offerings, senior secured loans, private placements, and to a lesser extent, from convertible bond financing, revenue, and grant funding. As of December 31, 2021, we had cash and cash equivalents of $35.2 million, restricted cash of $16.5 million, and short-term investments of $10.2 million.\nOn August 20, 2021, we entered into a sales agreement (the Sales Agreement\u201d) with SVB Leerink LLC, in connection with the offer and sale of up to $100,000,000 of shares of our common stock, par value $0.001 per share ( ATM Shares\u201d). The ATM Shares to be offered and sold under the Sales Agreement will be issued and sold pursuant to a registration statement on Form S-3 (File No. 333-258185) that became effective on August 12, 2021. During the year ended December 31, 2021, we sold 762,825 shares of our common stock for an average price of $1.49 per share under the Sales Agreement.\nOutlook\nOur company's mission is to become a leader in bringing innovative cancer treatments to the market and to improve patient health outcomes. Historically, we had focused development of our Orascovery platform which is based on a technology that converts IV chemotherapy to oral chemotherapy. We conducted a large phase 3 clinical trial in metastatic breast cancer comparing Oral Paclitaxel to IV paclitaxel, which was the basis of our NDA submission. Unfortunately, in February 2021, we received a CRL from the FDA which asked for an additional clinical study to support approval. After careful evaluation and prioritization of our R&D pipeline, we have decided to focus our R&D resources on our innovative cell therapy platform, which is based on NKT cells. NKT cells have unique biology that has potential advantages over current T cell and NK cell based technologies. We believe these advantages include the following:\n(1)There is still a major unmet need in hematological and solid tumors in that even in those indications where autologous CAR-T cells have been previously approved, up to 60% of patients receiving CAR-T therapy do not achieve long term durable responses.\n(2)Cellular therapies have generally not been effective in the treatment of solid tumors. NKT cells are an ideal platform for treatment of solid tumors because NKT cells home to tumors, and we have data demonstrating that CAR-NKT cells are superior in tumor homing compared to CAR-T cells.\n(3)Our allogeneic ( off-the-shelf\u201d) CAR-NKT cell therapy products may be produced at larger scale than autologous products, potentially at lower cost.\n(4)Our allogeneic CAR-NKT cells are manufactured starting with the lymphocytes of healthy donors. Use of healthy donors, rather than patients (who are the source of autologous cell therapy starting materials), results in a more robust and consistent product, because patient lymphocytes are usually dysfunctional due to previous cancer therapy.\nNKT cells demonstrate anti-tumor activity, even without a CAR. This is because NKT cells can kill immune suppressive cells in the local tumor microenvironment. Thus, when we add a CAR to NKT cells they are now equipped with two different anti-tumor mechanisms, which may lead to more potent anti-tumor activity and reduce the potential for relapse.\nAdvancing KUR-501 CAR-NKT Targeting GD2 - KUR-501 is an autologous product in which NKT cells are engineered with a CAR targeting GD2 and is currently being evaluated in a phase 1 clinical trial (GINAKIT2) treating children with R/R high risk neuroblastoma. Neuroblastoma is a rare pediatric cancer and patients with R/R high risk neuroblastoma have very poor outcomes. Therefore, we believe there is a significant unmet need for better treatment options. Interim data presented at the American Society of Gene and Cell Therapy (ASGCT) 2021 Annual Meeting for the first eleven evaluable patients, showed long-term persistence of CAR-NKT cells and CAR-NKT cell localization at the tumor site. Responses were observed in two patients, including one CR, one PR, and four patients achieved SD. The safety profile of KUR-501 was manageable and the product is being administered in the outpatient\nsetting. GINATKIT2 will continue enrolling patients at higher dose level cohorts with a goal to identify an optimal dose that we may take into a pivotal study.\nAdvancing KUR-502 CAR-NKT Targeting CD19 - Early data, as presented at the ASH annual meeting in December of 2021, indicated that, of the first five evaluable patients, there was a promising overall response rate of 80% with a complete response rate of 60%. KUR-502 is an allogeneic, off-the-shelf\u201d product in which NKT cells are engineered with a CAR targeting CD19. Today, autologous CAR-T cell treatments are available to patients, but the patient-to-patient variability and long manufacturing lead times limit patient care options. As an allogeneic off-the-shelf\u201d product, KUR-502 leverages economies of scale and has the potential to significantly increase patient access to innovative CAR-NKT treatments. Our aim is to expand the phase 1 (ANCHOR) clinical trial treating adults with R/R CD19 positive malignancies currently being conducted at BCM to a phase 1 multicenter clinical trial (ANCHOR2).\nFocusing on Specific Programs of Oral Paclitaxel - For Oral Paclitaxel, while our MAA submission is currently under review by the U.K. MHRA, we have focused our efforts on our ongoing combination clinical trials with checkpoint inhibitors where we believe there is an opportunity. Oral Paclitaxel is currently being evaluated in combination with pembrolizumab in NSCLC; and dostarlimab +/- carboplatin in neoadjuvant breast cancer, as part of I-SPY 2.\nLicensing and Partnership Opportunities - We continue to increase the global reach of tirbanibulin 1% ointment by maintaining strong global partnerships with existing partners such as Almirall, Seqirus, and AVIR and by evaluating other strategic territories to launch the product. Our team will continue to work closely with our partners to explore additional treatment regimens and indications for tirbanibulin 1% ointment. We will pursue strategic licensing and partnership opportunities for our small molecule programs and target opportunities that will create potential value for stockholders and support our business strategy and mission.\nAs we pursue these strategic priorities, we expect to incur significant expenses and increasing operating losses for the foreseeable future. We anticipate that our expenses will increase as we seek to:\n\u2022Advance the preclinical and clinical research program and development activities of our Cell Therapy technology platform;\n\u2022Continue our preclinical and clinical research program and development activities related to our Mission;\n\u2022Seek to identify additional research programs and product candidates within existing Cell Therapy platform; and\n\u2022Maintain, expand, and protect our IP portfolio.\nResults of Operations\nExcept where otherwise noted, the following discussion compares fiscal years 2021 and 2020 results. For a discussion on the comparison between fiscal year 2020 and fiscal year 2019 results, see the Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2020, as filed with the SEC and incorporated by reference herein.\nSince inception, we have devoted a substantial amount of our resources to research and development of our lead product candidates under our Orascovery, Src Kinase inhibition, Cell Therapy and arginine deprivation therapy technologies, to sales and general administrative costs associated with our operations, and to the development of our specialty drug operations in our Commercial Platform and 503B operations. We have incurred significant net losses since inception. Our net losses were $202.0 million, $148.4 million, and $125.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019, respectively. As of December 31, 2021 and 2020, we had an accumulated deficit of approximately $913.4 million and $713.6 million, respectively.\nWe have funded our operations to date primarily from the issuance and sale of our common stock through public offerings, private placements, debt and convertible bonds, and to a lesser extent, through revenue generated from our Global Supply Chain Platform. Our operating activities from continuing operations used $138.3 million, $127.8 million and $97.0 million of cash during the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019, respectively. As of December 31, 2021, we had cash and cash equivalents of $35.2 million, restricted cash of $16.5 million, and short-term investments of $10.2 million.\nKey Components of Results of Operations\nRevenue\nWe derive our consolidated revenue primarily from (i) the sales of generic injectable products by our Commercial Platform; (ii) licensing and collaboration projects conducted by our Oncology Innovation Platform, which generates revenue in the form of upfront payments, milestone payments, and payments received for providing research and development services for our collaboration projects and for other third parties; (iii) the sales of 503B and API products by our Global Supply Chain Platform; and (iv) grant awards from government agencies and universities for our continuing research and development efforts.\nThe following table sets forth the components of our consolidated revenue and the amount as a percentage of total revenue for the periods indicated.\nTable 6: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Year ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2021\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2020\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2019\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Product sales, net\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>92,264\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>77%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>105,274\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>73%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>80,535\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>80%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>License and other revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>27,917\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>23%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>39,117\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>27%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>20,694\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>20%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>120,181\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>144,391\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>101,229\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nCost of Sales\nAlong with sourcing from third-party manufacturers, we manufacture clinical products in our U.S. current Good Manufacturing Practices ( cGMP\u201d) facility in New York. Cost of sales primarily includes the cost of finished products, raw materials, labor costs, manufacturing overhead expenses and reserves for expected scrap, as well as transportation costs. Cost of sales also includes depreciation expense for production equipment, changes to our excess and obsolete inventory reserves, certain direct costs such as shipping costs, net of costs charged to customers, and sublicense fees related to in-license agreements.\nResearch and Development Expenses\nResearch and development ( R&D\u201d) expenses primarily consist of the costs associated with in-licensing of product candidates, milestone payments, conducting preclinical studies and clinical trials, activities related to regulatory filings and other R&D activities. The following table sets forth the components of our R&D expenses and the amount as a percentage of total R&D expenses for the periods indicated.\nTable 7: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2021\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2020\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2019\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Wages, benefits, and related costs\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>22,136\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>28%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>22,809\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>30%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>19,569\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>23%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Clinical trial costs\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>22,953\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>29%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>36,245\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>48%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>45,839\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>54%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Preclinical research costs\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11,443\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>14%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8,411\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8,418\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Drug licensing costs\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8,559\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,437\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8,071\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Other research and development\ncosts\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>15,106\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>19%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6,002\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,496\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Total research and development\ncosts\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>80,197\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>75,904\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>84,393\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOur current R&D activities mainly relate to the clinical development of our Oncology Innovation Platform.\nWe expense R&D costs as incurred. We record costs for certain development activities, such as clinical trials, based on an evaluation of the progress to completion of specific tasks using data such as patient enrollment or clinical site activations. We do not allocate employee-related costs, depreciation, rental and other indirect costs to specific R&D programs because these costs are deployed across multiple product programs under R&D. For 2021, other research and development costs include the cost of manufacturing Oral Paclitaxel in advance of the potential product launch in 2021. These costs are not expected to continue.\nWe cannot determine with certainty the duration, costs and timing of the current or future preclinical or clinical studies of our drug candidates. The duration, costs, and timing of clinical studies and development of our drug candidates will depend on a variety of factors, including:\n\u2022The scope, rate of progress, and costs of our ongoing, as well as any additional, clinical studies and other R&D activities;\n\u2022Future clinical study results;\n\u2022Uncertainties in clinical study enrollment rates;\n\u2022Significant and changing government regulation; and\n\u2022The timing and receipt of any regulatory approvals.\nA change in the outcome of any of these variables with respect to the development of a drug candidate, including delays caused by the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, could mean a significant change in the costs and timing associated with the development of that drug candidate.\nR&D activities are central to our business model. We expect our R&D expenses to decrease overall, as the development of most non-Cell Therapy technologies has been suspended. R&D expenses related to our Cell Therapy platform are expected to increase as we prepare for additional clinical and preclinical studies for our Cell Therapy programs. There are numerous factors associated with the successful commercialization of any of our drug candidates, including future trial design and various regulatory requirements, many of which cannot be determined with accuracy at this time based on our stage of development. Additionally, future commercial, regulatory and public health, including the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, factors beyond our control will likely impact our clinical development programs and plans.\nSelling, General and Administrative Expenses\nSelling, general and administrative, ( SG&A\u201d), expenses primarily consist of compensation, including salary, employee benefits and stock-based compensation expenses for sales and marketing personnel, and for administrative personnel that support our general operations such as executive management, legal counsel, financial accounting, information technology, and human resources personnel. SG&A expenses also include professional fees for legal, patent, consulting, auditing and tax services, as well as other direct and allocated expenses for rent and maintenance of facilities, insurance and other supplies used in the selling, marketing, general and administrative activities. SG&A expenses also include costs associated with our commercialization efforts for our proprietary drugs, such as market research, brand strategy and development work on market access, scientific publication, product distribution, and patient support.\nWe anticipate that our SG&A costs associated with the commercialization of the Orascovery platform and the development of the facility in Dunkirk, NY will decrease in future periods. We expect that certain costs, including share compensation costs, insurance costs, and other administrative costs, will decrease as a result of the sale of our interest in the pharmaceutical manufacturing facility located in Dunkirk, NY. Meanwhile, we anticipate that cost related to legal, compliance, accounting and investor and public relations expenses associated with being a public company will remain consistent.\nInterest Expense and Interest Income\nInterest expense consists primarily of interest on our long-term loans and the amortization of our debt discount. Interest income consists primarily of interest generated from our cash and short-term investments in U.S. Treasury securities, U.S. agency securities, high rated commercial papers and corporate bonds.\nLoss on Extinguishment of Debt\nThe loss on extinguishment of debt is the result of refinancing the senior secured loan agreement with Perceptive Advisors LLC and its affiliates ( Perceptive\u201d) with the Senior Credit Agreement with Oaktree, as well as the subsequent assignment of a portion of the Senior Credit Agreement to Sagard. The refinancing of the senior secured loan agreement with Perceptive resulted in an exit fee and the recognition of the unamortized debt discount as a loss on extinguishment of debt in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss. The assignment of a portion of the Senior Credit Agreement to Sagard qualified as a partial debt extinguishment and resulted in a proportional loss from the existing unamortized debt discount, inclusive of unamortized deferred financing fees.\nResults of Operations\nYear Ended December 31, 2021 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2020\nThe following table sets forth a summary of our consolidated results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, together with the changes in those items in dollars and as a percentage. This information should be read together with our consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this report. Our operating results in any period are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for any future period.\nTable 8: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>

million, a decrease of $13.0 million, or 12%, as compared to $105.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. This decrease was primarily attributable to a decrease in APD product sales of $22.6 million. The prior year had an increase in demand for COVID-19 related drugs and for FDA shortage products, including some significant non-recurring orders. In addition, in the first half of 2021, we experienced significant COVID-related challenges in our Indian supply chain and to a lesser extent in China. As a result, we did not receive some inventory from our partners located in these countries for a certain period of time. This decrease in APD product sales was partially offset by an increase in 503B sales of $7.8 million as the result of the increase in demand for certain drugs used to treat patients hospitalized with COVID-19. Contract manufacturing sale and API product sales experienced increases of $1.4 million and $0.4 million, respectively.\nLicense fees and other revenue decreased to $27.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, from $39.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, a decrease of $11.2 million, or 29%. During the year ended December 31, 2021, we recorded $20.0 million and $5.0 million of license revenue pursuant to our license agreement with Almirall upon the launch of Klisyri in the U.S. in February 2021 and in Europe in September 2021, respectively, and $0.5 million related to the upfront fee pursuant to the Second Amendment to the PharmaEssentia Agreement, for the license of Tirbanibulin in Japan and South Korea. During the year ended December 31, 2020, we recognized $37.7 million in license revenue, net of $2.3 million VAT pursuant to the Xiangxue License to develop and commercialize Oral Paclitaxel, Oral Irinotecan, and tirbanibulin ointment in People's Republic of China ( PRC\u201d or China\u201d), Hong Kong, and Macau, and $1.0 million in license revenue pursuant to the license agreement we entered into with PharmaEssentia to develop and commercialize Oral Paclitaxel, Oral Irinotecan, and Oral Docetaxel in Taiwan, Singapore, and Vietnam.\nCost of Sales\nCost of sales totaled $82.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, a decrease of $12.9 million, or 14%, as compared to $95.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. The decrease in our cost of APD product sales was in-line with the decrease in APD product revenue and was partially offset by increases in cost of sales related to the increases in 503B, Contract Manufacturing, and API product sales. In the year ended December 31, 2020, we incurred sublicense fees of $5.8 million on our license revenue, which did not occur in 2021.\nResearch and Development Expenses\nR&D expenses totaled $80.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, an increase of $4.3 million, or 6%, as compared to $75.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. This was primarily due to an increase in costs related to Oral Paclitaxel, drug licensing costs, cell therapy costs, and compensation, and included the following:\n\u2022$9.5 million increase in Oral Paclitaxel product development, API, and medical affairs costs associated with the potential product launch in 2021;\n\u2022$6.2 million increase in drug licensing costs, due to license payments for specialty pharmaceutical products, a license milestone payment related to Arginine deprivation therapy, and the repurchase of Orascovery rights from Xiangxue; and\n\u2022$4.4 million increase in cell therapy development costs.\nThe increase in these R&D expenses was partially offset by a decrease of $8.8 million in costs of clinical operations after completion of the Phase 3 studies for tirbanibulin ointment and Oral Paclitaxel, a decrease of $4.4 million in regulatory costs in connection with our NDA preparations, a decrease of $1.4 million in preclinical operations, a decrease of $0.7 million in research and development related compensation and a decrease of $0.5 million in costs of other product development.\nSelling, General and Administrative Expenses\nSelling, general, and administrative expenses totaled $72.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, a decrease of $20.3 million, or 22%, as compared to $92.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. This was primarily due to a $24.8 million decrease of costs for preparing to commercialize Oral Paclitaxel as significant pre-launch activities occurred in 2020 and slowed upon receipt of the Complete Response Letter in February 2021. In addition, we did not record a provision for credit losses in 2021, compared to provision for credit losses of $8.9 million from 2020. Compensation related costs decreased by $0.2 million in 2021 compared to 2020. These decreases were partially offset by a $4.2 million increase from the change in fair value of contingent consideration, a $5.9 million increase in operating costs including insurance costs, IT costs, other professional fees, and the costs to operate our manufacturing facility in Chongqing, China, and a $3.5 million increase in professional fees and other expenses related to the acquisition of Kuur.\nImpairments\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2021, we recognized goodwill impairment expense of $67.7 million and impairment of other intangible assets of $1.7 million. Of the total goodwill impairment, $26.6 million was related to the Global Supply Chain Platform reporting unit, representing a full impairment of the goodwill allocated to that reporting unit, and $41.1 million was related to the Oncology Innovation Platform reporting unit, representing a full impairment of the goodwill allocated to that reporting unit. Goodwill impairment is the excess of a reporting unit's carrying amount over its fair value. The decrease in our estimation of the reporting units' fair value was related to the Company's decision to no longer pursue regulatory approval for Oral Paclitaxel monotherapy for the treatment of mBC in the U.S. and the delays in the launch of products in our newly constructed manufacturing facilities. No such impairment was recorded during the year ended December 31, 2020.\nInterest Income and Interest Expense\nInterest income consisted of interest earned on our short-term investments and decreased by $0.6 million, or 74%, from 2020 to 2021 due a decrease in our short-term investment holdings during the year and a decrease in market rates for commercial paper, corporate bonds, and U.S. Treasury securities. Interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2021 totaled $20.7 million, an increase of $9.5 million, or 85%, as compared to $11.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, primarily due to increased borrowings. Interest expense in 2021 consisted of interest on borrowings under the Senior Credit Agreement with Oaktree while interest expense in 2020 included interest on borrowings under the credit agreement with Perceptive we entered into in June 2018, and the Senior Credit Agreement with Oaktree we entered into in June 2020 to repay in full the outstanding loan and fees under the credit agreement with Perceptive.\nLoss on Extinguishment of Debt\nWe recognized a $7.2 million loss on the extinguishment of debt related to the termination of the senior secured loan agreement with Perceptive and a $3.0 million loss on the partial extinguishment of debt related to the assignment of a portion of the senior secured loan from Oaktree's co-investors to Sagard during the year ended December 31, 2020. We did not incur loss on the extinguishment of debt during the year ended December 31, 2021.\nIncome Tax Expense\nFor the year ended December 31, 2021, income tax benefit amounted to $10.6 million, compared to income tax expense of $4.1 million for 2020. The income tax benefit in the current year is primarily the result of taxable temporary difference due to the deferred\ntax liability recognized for the indefinite lived intangible assets acquired in connection with the acquisition of Kuur's in-process research and development ( IPR&D\u201d). This taxable temporary difference is considered a source of taxable income to support the realization of deferred tax assets from the acquirer which resulted in a reversal of our valuation allowance. The income tax expense in the prior year was primarily attributable to foreign income tax withholdings on our revenue earned under our out-license arrangements.\nLoss from discontinued operations\nLoss from discontinued operations is comprised of operating results of the activities related to the build out of our manufacturing facility in Dunkirk, NY. This facility was sold in the first quarter of 2022. The increase in loss from discontinued operations was due to an increase in headcount and general costs necessary to prepare the Dunkirk facility for manufacturing operations. This increase was partially offset by income from a government grant in 2021, which consisted of a reimbursement of operating expenses received from New York State related to the preparation of the facility. Distributions by New York State under this arrangement in prior years were made for direct construction costs that were capital in nature and were not made to offset our operating expenses incurred in relation to such construction.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nCapital Resources\nSince our inception, we have incurred net losses and negative cash flows from our operations. Our cash requirement was primarily cash used for our R&D programs, SG&A costs associated with our operations, the development of our specialty drug operations in our Commercial Platform and 503B operations, and the investment we made in our pre-launch activities in anticipation of commercializing our proprietary drugs. We incurred net losses of $202.0 million, $148.4 million and $125.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019, respectively. As of December 31, 2021, we had an accumulated deficit of $913.4 million. Our operating activities from continuing operations used $138.3 million, $127.8 million and $97.0 million of cash during the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019, respectively. We intend to continue to advance our various clinical and pre-clinical programs which could lead to increased cash outflow of R&D costs. While we expect our R&D expenses to decrease overall, as the development of most non-Cell Therapy technologies has been suspended, R&D expenses related to our Cell Therapy platform are expected to increase as we prepare for additional clinical and preclinical studies for our Cell Therapy programs. We can provide no assurance that the funding requirements to diversify the product portfolio for specialty drug products in the Commercial Platform and 503B operations will decline in the future. Our principal sources of liquidity as of December 31, 2021 were cash and cash equivalents totaling $35.2 million, restricted cash of $16.5 million, held in a controlled bank account in connection with the Senior Credit Agreement with Oaktree, and short-term investments totaling $10.2 million, which are generally high-quality investment grade corporate debt securities.\nOur obligations under the Senior Credit Agreement are guaranteed by us and certain of our existing domestic subsidiaries and subsequently acquired or organized subsidiaries subject to certain exceptions. Our obligations under the Senior Credit Agreement and the related guarantees thereunder are secured, subject to customary permitted liens and other agreed upon exceptions, by (i) a pledge of all of the equity interests of our direct subsidiaries, and (ii) a perfected security interest in all of our tangible and intangible assets.\nThe Senior Credit Agreement contains customary representations and warranties and customary affirmative and negative covenants, including, among other things, restrictions on indebtedness, liens, investments, mergers, dispositions, prepayment of other indebtedness, and dividends and other distributions, subject to certain exceptions, including specific exceptions with respect to product commercialization and development activities. In addition, the Senior Credit Agreement contains certain financial covenants, including, among other things, maintenance of minimum liquidity and a minimum revenue test, measured quarterly until the last day of the second consecutive fiscal quarter where the consolidated leverage ratio does not exceed 4.5 to 1, provided that thereafter we cannot allow our consolidated leverage ratio to exceed 4.5 to 1, measured quarterly. Failure of the Company to comply with the financial covenants will result in an event of default, subject to certain cure rights of the Company. At December 31, 2021, we were in compliance with all applicable covenants.\nDebt and Equity Financings\nATM Financing\nOn August 20, 2021, we entered into a sales agreement with SVB Leerink LLC, in connection with the offer and sale of up to $100,000,000 of shares of our common stock, par value $0.001 per share, in an at-the-market offering (the ATM Offering\u201d). During the year ended December 31, 2021, we sold 762,825 shares of our common stock for an average price of $1.49 per share under the Sales Agreement.\nPublic Offering of Stock\nIn September 2020, we completed an underwritten public offering of 10,000,000 shares of our common stock. We granted the underwriters a 30-day option to purchase up to an additional 1,500,000 shares of common stock, which was exercised in full in\nSeptember 2020. All shares were offered at a price of $11.00 per share. Net proceeds were $118.7 million, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and offering expenses of $7.9 million.\nOaktree Senior Credit Agreement\nOn June 19, 2020 (the Closing Date\u201d), we entered into the Senior Credit Agreement to borrow up to $225.0 million in five tranches with a maturity date of June 19, 2026, bearing interest at a fixed annual rate of 11.0%, payable quarterly. We are required to make quarterly interest-only payments until June 19, 2022, after which we are required to make quarterly amortizing payments, with the remaining balance of the principal plus accrued and unpaid interest due at maturity. Since September 17, 2020, we have been required to pay a commitment fee on any undrawn commitments equal to 0.6% per annum, payable on each subsequent funding date and the commitment termination date. We are also required to pay an exit fee at maturity equal to 2.0% of the aggregate principal amount of the loans funded under the Senior Credit Agreement.\nThe first tranche of $100.0 million was drawn prior to June 30, 2020, with $54.1 million of the proceeds used in part to repay in full the outstanding loan and fees under the credit agreement with Perceptive and an additional $11.0 million of the upfront loan proceeds held by us as restricted cash in a debt service reserve account, and $6.4 million in fees and expenses incurred in connection with the financing, leaving $28.5 million in available proceeds from the first tranche. The second tranche of $25.0 million was drawn prior to September 30, 2020 and the third tranche of $25.0 million was drawn prior to December 31, 2020. Our ability to draw Tranches C and E of the Senior Credit Agreement was associated with the marketing approval and future sales of Oral Paclitaxel. These tranches were reduced to zero in connection with the amendment described below and are not available for future borrowing.\nWe are required to make mandatory prepayments of the senior secured loans with net cash proceeds from certain asset sales or insurance proceeds or condemnation awards, in each case, subject to certain exceptions and reinvestment rights. In connection with the sale of the Dunkirk Facility in February 2022, we entered into an amendment to the Senior Credit Agreement (the January Credit Agreement Amendment\u201d) whereby we were required to repay $25.0 million, or 62.5% of the proceeds from the sale, of the outstanding principal of the loan. In addition, on the date of closing the Dunkirk Transaction, we were required to pay (i) accrued and unpaid interest and (ii) a 7.0% fee, allocated as a 2.0% Exit Fee and a 5.0% Prepayment Fee (each as defined in the Senior Credit Agreement), on the principal amount being repaid. We were required to pay Oaktree an amendment fee of $0.3 million and certain related expenses. Further, the January Credit Agreement Amendment requires us to make an additional prepayment of $12.5 million in principal plus the costs and fees described above by June 14, 2022, within 120 days of the closing of the Dunkirk Transaction.\nWe may voluntarily prepay the Senior Credit Agreement at any time subject to a prepayment premium which up until June 19, 2022 is equal to the amount of interest that would have been paid up to, but not including, June 19, 2022 (excluding interest amounts already paid), plus 3.0% of the principal amount of the senior secured loans being repaid. Thereafter, the prepayment premium equals 3.0% of the principal amount of the senior secured loans being repaid and is reduced over time until June 19, 2024, after which no prepayment premium is required.\nOur obligations under the Senior Credit Agreement are guaranteed by us and certain of our existing domestic subsidiaries and subsequently acquired or organized subsidiaries subject to certain exceptions. Our obligations under the Senior Credit Agreement and the related guarantees thereunder are secured, subject to customary permitted liens and other agreed upon exceptions, by (i) a pledge of all of the equity interests of our direct subsidiaries, and (ii) a perfected security interest in all of our tangible and intangible assets.\nThe Senior Credit Agreement contains customary representations and warranties and customary affirmative and negative covenants, including, among other things, restrictions on indebtedness, liens, investments, mergers, dispositions, prepayment of other indebtedness, and dividends and other distributions, subject to certain exceptions, including specific exceptions with respect to product commercialization and development activities. In addition, the Senior Credit Agreement contains certain financial covenants, including, among other things, maintenance of minimum liquidity and a minimum revenue test, measured quarterly until the last day of the second consecutive fiscal quarter where the consolidated leverage ratio does not exceed 4.5 to 1, provided that thereafter we cannot allow our consolidated leverage ratio to exceed 4.5 to 1, measured quarterly. Failure of the Company to comply with the financial covenants will result in an event of default, subject to certain cure rights of the Company. At December 31, 2021, we were in compliance with all applicable covenants.\nThe Senior Credit Agreement contains events of default which are customary for financings of this type, in certain circumstances subject to customary cure periods. Following an event of default and any cure period, if applicable, Oaktree will have the right upon notice to terminate any undrawn commitments and may accelerate all amounts outstanding under the Senior Credit Agreement, in addition to other remedies available to it as a secured creditor of the Company.\nIn connection with our entry into the Senior Credit Agreement, we granted warrants to Oaktree to purchase up to an aggregate of 908,393 shares of our common stock at a purchase price of $12.63 per share. Under the January Credit Agreement Amendment, the warrants were amended to change the exercise price to be paid per share upon exercise of the warrants. The January Credit Agreement Amendment provides that the exercise price for 50% of the shares underlying the warrants will be $1.10 per share. The exercise price for the remaining 50% of the warrants was not changed by the January Credit Agreement Amendment.\nOutlook\nWe have borrowed and, in the future, may borrow additional capital from institutional and commercial banking sources to fund future growth. We may borrow additional funds on terms that may include restrictive covenants, including covenants that further restrict the operation of our business, liens on assets, high effective interest rates, financial performance covenants and repayment provisions that reduce cash resources and limit future access to capital markets. In addition, we expect to continue to opportunistically seek access to the equity capital markets to support our development efforts and operations. To the extent that we raise additional capital by issuing equity securities, our stockholders may experience substantial dilution. To the extent that we raise additional funds through collaboration or partnering arrangements or by monetizing non-core assets, we may be required to relinquish some of our rights to our technologies or rights to market and sell our products in certain geographies, grant licenses on terms that are not favorable to us, or issue equity that may be substantially dilutive to our stockholders.\nAs of December 31, 2021, we had cash and cash equivalents of $35.2 million, restricted cash of $16.5 million, and short-term investments of $10.2 million. We are implementing cost savings programs and plan to monetize non-core assets and raise capital in order to extend our cash runway in 2022. If we are unable to raise additional capital or monetize assets, we believe that the existing cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash, and short-term investments will not be sufficient to fund current operating plans through one year after the date that these audited consolidated financial statements are issued. We have concluded that this raises substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. See Part II, Item 8. Note 1-Company and Nature of Business for further information regarding our ability to continue as a going concern. We have based these estimates on assumptions that may prove to be wrong, and we could spend the available financial resources much faster than expected and need to raise additional funds sooner than anticipated. Although we plan to raise additional funds though the sale of non-core assets and selling equity securities, these plans are subject to market conditions which are outside of our control, and therefore cannot be deemed to be probable. There can be no assurance that additional financing, if available, can be obtained on terms acceptable to us. If we are unable to obtain such additional financing, we would need to reevaluate our future operating plans.\nWe anticipate that our expenses will cover the following activities as we:\n\u2022Advance the preclinical and clinical research program and development activities of our Cell Therapy technology platform;\n\u2022Continue our preclinical and clinical research program and development activities related to our Mission;\n\u2022Seek to identify additional research programs and product candidates within existing Cell Therapy platform; and\n\u2022Maintain, expand and protect our intellectual property ( IP\u201d) portfolio.\nWe have made certain changes to our budgeted expenses in light of the CRL for Oral Paclitaxel we received in February 2021 and the Type A meetings with the FDA, including curtailing commercialization expenses and investing in additional products for our specialty drug product business. However, our expenses could increase as we continue to fund clinical and preclinical development of our research programs by advancing our Cell Therapy programs, certain candidates in our pipeline, our specialty drug products, working capital and other general corporate purposes. Capital expenditure at the Sintaho facility may continue to grow and be significant as we build out the plant to manufacture Tirbanibulin APIs. We have based our estimates on assumptions that might prove to be wrong and we might use our available capital resources sooner than we currently expect. Because of the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with the development and commercialization of our drug candidates, we are unable to accurately estimate the amounts of increased capital outlays and operating expenditures necessary to complete the development and commercialization of our drug candidates.\nOur future capital requirements will depend on many factors, some or all of which may be impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, including:\n\u2022Our ability to generate revenue and profits from our Commercial Platform or otherwise;\n\u2022The costs, timing and outcome of regulatory reviews and approvals\u037e\n\u2022Progress of our drug candidates to progress through clinical development successfully\u037e\n\u2022The initiation, progress, timing, costs and results of nonclinical studies and clinical trials for our other programs and potential drug candidates\u037e\n\u2022The costs of construction and fit-out of planned drug manufacture at our API manufacturing facility;\n\u2022The number and characteristics of the drug candidates we pursue\u037e\n\u2022The costs of preparing, filing and prosecuting patent applications, maintaining and enforcing our IP rights and defending IP related claims\u037e\n\u2022The extent to which we acquire or in-license other products and technologies\u037e and\n\u2022Our ability to maintain and establish collaboration arrangements on favorable terms, if at all.\nUntil we can generate substantial product revenue, we expect to finance our cash needs through a combination of equity offerings, debt financings, collaborations, strategic alliances, licensing arrangements, and government grants. To the extent that we raise additional capital through the sale of equity or convertible debt securities, the ownership interest of our existing stockholders will be diluted, and the terms of these securities may include liquidation or other preferences that adversely affect rights of holders of common stock. Debt financing, if available, may involve agreements that include covenants limiting or restricting our ability to take specific actions, such as incurring additional debt, making capital expenditures or declaring dividends and might require the issuance of warrants, which could potentially dilute the ownership interest of holders of common stock. If we raise additional funds through collaborations, strategic alliances or licensing arrangements with third parties, we might have to relinquish valuable rights to our technologies, future revenue streams or research programs or to grant licenses on terms that might not be favorable to us. If we are unable to raise additional funds through equity or debt financings when needed, we might be required to delay, limit, reduce, or terminate our product development or future commercialization efforts or grant rights to develop and market products or drug candidates that we would otherwise prefer to develop and market ourselves.\nWe believe that the existing cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash, and short-term investments will not be sufficient to fund current operating plans through one year after the date that these audited consolidated financial statements are issued. Our estimates are based on relevant conditions that are known and reasonably knowable at the date of these consolidated financial statements being available for issuance and are subject to change due to changes in business, industry or macroeconomic conditions. Further, we do not expect to have access to additional capital under the Senior Credit Agreement. We have based these estimates on assumptions that may prove to be wrong, and we could spend the available financial resources much faster than expected and need to raise additional funds sooner than anticipated. To the extent that we raise additional capital by issuing equity securities, our stockholders may experience substantial dilution. To the extent that we raise additional funds through collaboration or partnering arrangements, we may be required to relinquish some of our rights to our technologies or rights to market and sell our products in certain geographies, grant licenses on terms that are not favorable to us, or issue equity that may be substantially dilutive to our stockholders.\nCash Flows\nThe following table provides information regarding our cash flows from continuing and discontinued operations for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019:\nTable 9: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Year ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2021\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2020\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Net cash used in operating activities from continuing operations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(138,271\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(127,758\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(96,981\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Net cash provided by (used in) investing activities from continuing operations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>119,927\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(114,338\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11,357\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Net cash provided by financing activities from continuing operations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,640\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>209,519\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>167,452\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Net cash used in discontinued operations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(19,229\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(8,211\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(4,337\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Net effect of foreign exchange rate changes\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>548\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(799\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>389\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Net (decrease) increase in cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(34,385\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(41,587\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>77,880\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nNet Cash Used in Operating Activities\nThe use of cash in all periods presented resulted primarily from our net losses adjusted for non-cash charges and changes in components of working capital. The primary use of our cash in all periods presented was to fund our R&D, regulatory and other clinical trial costs, drug licensing costs, inventory purchases, pre-launch commercialization activities, build-out of our manufacturing facilities, and other expenditures related to sales, marketing and administration. Our prepaid expenses and other current assets, accounts payable and accrued expense balances in all periods presented were affected by the timing of vendor invoicing and payments.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2021, operating activities from continuing operations used $138.3 million of cash, which resulted principally from our net loss from continuing operations of $194.3 million, adjusted for non-cash charges of $90.7 million, non-cash income benefit of $10.8 million related to the reversal of our valuation allowance on our deferred tax assets to offset the deferred tax liability assumed in connection with the acquisition of Kuur's IPR&D, and cash used by our operating assets and liabilities of $23.8 million. Our net non-cash charges during the year ended December 31, 2021 consisted of $69.4 million of impairment of goodwill and intangible assets, $9.2 million of stock-based compensation expense, $4.7 million depreciation and amortization expense, $4.2 million change in fair value of contingent consideration, $2.9 million amortization of debt discount, and $0.6 million write-off of deferred debt issuance costs related to the Revenue Interest Financing. Our operating assets increased $2.7 million for accounts receivable mainly related to the timing of revenues, decreased $4.1 million in prepaid expenses and other assets, and increased $5.9 million for inventory of all drug products. Our operating liabilities decreased by $19.2 million mainly due to a decrease in accrued wages and benefits, accrued construction costs for the Dunkirk, NY facility, accrued costs for potential product launch, accrued selling fees and rebates, and accrued interest, partially offset by an increase in deferred revenue. Net cash used in operating activities from discontinued operations in 2021 was $4.1 million, primarily related to the operating expenses incurred by the activities at the Dunkirk facility.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2020, operating activities from continuing operations used $127.8 million of cash, which resulted principally from our net loss from continuing operations of $144.4 million, adjusted for non-cash charges of $37.2 million. Cash used by our operating assets and liabilities was $20.5 million primarily due to increases in accounts receivable and a decrease in accrued expenses. Our net non-cash charges during the year ended December 31, 2020 primarily consisted of $10.9 million of stock-based compensation, $10.3 million of loss on extinguishment of debt, $9.5 million provision for expected credit losses, $4.5 million of depreciation and amortization, and $1.8 million of amortization of debt discount. Net cash used in operating activities from discontinued operations in 2020 was $3.5 million, related to the operations at the Dunkirk facility.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2019, operating activities from continuing operations used $97.0 million of cash, which resulted principally from our net loss of $125.0 million, adjusted for non-cash charges of $15.4 million. Cash provided by our operating assets and liabilities was $12.6 million primarily due to increases in accounts payable and accrued expenses. Our net non-cash charges during the year ended December 31, 2019 primarily consisted of $3.8 million in depreciation and amortization expense, $9.9 million in stock-based compensation expense, and $1.0 million in amortization of debt discount. Net cash used in operating activities from discontinued operations in 2019 was $0.5 million, related to the operations at the Dunkirk facility.\nNet Cash (Used in) Provided by Investing Activities\nIn 2021, cash provided by investing activities of continuing operations of $119.9 million was primarily attributable to $128.9 million in the sale and maturity of short-term investments, net of purchases, $8.4 million in purchasing property and equipment for continuing operations, primarily, our Sintaho facility, and $2.1 million in payments for licenses, partially offset by cash received from the acquisition of Kuur of $1.4 million. Net cash used in investing activities of discontinued operations in 2021 was $14.9 million, related to purchasing property and equipment at the Dunkirk facility.\nIn 2020, cash used in investing activities of continuing operations of $114.3 million was primarily attributable to $105.5 million in purchases of short-term investments, net of sales and maturities, $8.6 million in purchasing property and equipment for continuing operations $0.2 million in payment for licenses. Net cash used in investing activities of discontinued operations in 2020 was $4.6 million, related to purchasing property and equipment at the Dunkirk facility.\nIn 2019, cash provided by investing activities of continuing operations of $11.4 million was primarily attributable to $24.4 million in sale and maturity of short-term investments, net of purchases, and $0.9 million provided by the acquisition of CIDAL, offset by $9.7 million in purchasing property and equipment for continuing operations, and $4.2 million in payment for licenses. Net cash used in investing activities of discontinued operations in 2019 was $3.9 million, related to purchasing property and equipment at the Dunkirk facility.\nNet Cash Provided by Financing Activities\nIn 2021, cash provided by financing activities of continuing operations was $2.6 million, which primarily consisted of the proceeds from the exercise of stock options of $1.6 million, proceeds from the sale of shares in the ATM Offering of $1.3 million in December, and proceeds from the issuance of debt of $0.8 million, partially offset by the repayment of long-term debt and finance lease obligations of $1.0 million. Net cash used in financing activities of discontinued operations in 2021 was $0.2 million, related to the repayment of finance lease obligations.\nIn 2020, cash provided by financing activities of continuing operations was $209.5 million, which primarily consisted of $127.0 million from the sale of common stock and $143.0 million from the draw downs of debt from our Senior Credit Agreement with Oaktree and $2.1 million to fund our new API plant in China, $7.0 million from the issuance of warrants to Oaktree and Sagard, and $1.7 million from the exercise of stock options, partially offset by $54.3 million repayment of the Perceptive loan and other long-term debt, and $7.9 million and $9.4 million issuance costs related to sale of our common stock in our underwritten follow-on public offering and the issuance of the new Oaktree debt and warrants to Oaktree and Sagard, respectively. Net cash used in financing activities of discontinued operations in 2020 was $0.1 million, related to the repayment of finance lease obligations.\nIn 2019, cash provided by financing activities of continuing operations was $167.5 million, which primarily consisted of net proceeds of $161.1 million from the issuance of our common stock mostly from private placements, net of offering expenses of approximately $1.1 million, and $6.5 million from the issuance of debt to fund our new API plant in China, offset by $1.0 million repayment of debt and finance lease obligations.\nIndebtedness\nWe had $157.7 million and $157.8 million of debt as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. As of December 31, 2021 and 2020, this primarily consisted of the Senior Credit Agreement entered into with Oaktree during 2020, and a credit agreement with Chongqing Maliu Riverside Development and Investment Co., LTD, and finance and operating lease obligations.\nIn 2020, we entered into a Senior Credit Agreement with Oaktree to borrow up to $225.0 million in five tranches with a maturity date of June 19, 2026, bearing interest at a fixed annual rate of 11.0%, payable quarterly. We have drawn three tranches amounting to $150.0 million; the remaining two tranches totaling $75.0 million were reduced to zero in connection with the January Credit Agreement Amendment in February 2022. We are required to make quarterly interest-only payments until June 19, 2022, after which we are also required to make quarterly amortizing payments, with the remaining balance of the principal plus accrued and unpaid interest due at maturity. Since September 17, 2020, we have been required to pay a commitment fee on any undrawn commitments equal to 0.6% per annum, payable on each subsequent funding date and the commitment termination date. We are also required to pay an exit fee at maturity equal to 2.0% of the aggregate principal amount of the loans funded under the Senior Credit Agreement. Upon closing of the Dunkirk Transaction in February 2022, we repaid $25.0 million of the outstanding principal, plus any unpaid and accrued interest, plus the 2.0% exit fee and the 5.0% prepayment fee pursuant to the January Credit Agreement Amendment.\nIn 2019, we entered into a credit agreement which amended the existing partnership agreement with Chongqing Maliu Riverside Development and Investment Co., LTD ( CQ\u201d), for a Renminbi \u00a550.0 million (USD $7.2 million at December 31, 2019) line of credit to be used for the construction of the new API plant in China. We are required to repay the principal amount with accrued interest within three years after the plant receives the cGMP certification, with 20% of the total loan with accrued interest is due within the first twelve months following receiving the certification, 30% of the total loan with accrued interest due within twenty-four months, and the remaining balance with accrued interest due within thirty-six months. Interest accrues at the three-year loan interest rate by the People's Bank of China for the same period on the date of the deposit of the full loan amount, which is expected to approximate 4.75% annually. If we fail to obtain the cGMP certification within three years upon the completion and acceptance of the plant, we shall return all renovation costs with the accrued interest to CQ, in a single transaction within the first ten business days of the next day. If we fail to obtain the cGMP certification within three years of the acceptance of the plant, we are required to return all renovation costs with accrued interest to CQ within ten business days. As of December 31, 2021, the balance due to CQ was $7.8 million.\nCapital Expenditures\nOur liquidity position and capital requirements are subject to a number of factors. For example, our cash inflow and outflow may be impacted by the following:\n\u2022Our ability to generate revenue;\n\u2022Our ability to improve margins on our commercial products;\n\u2022Fluctuations in working capital; and\n\u2022Our ability to raise additional funds.\nOur primary short-term capital needs, which are subject to change, include expenditures related to:\n\u2022Continuous support of the development and research of our proprietary drug products;\n\u2022Build out of our new API plant in China and improvements in our existing manufacturing capacity and efficiency;\n\u2022New research and product development efforts; and\n\u2022Support of our commercialization efforts related to our current and future products.\nAlthough we believe the foregoing items reflect our most likely uses of cash in the short term, we cannot predict with certainty all of our short-term cash uses or the timing or amounts of cash used. If cash generated from operations is insufficient to satisfy our working capital and capital expenditure requirements, we may be required to sell additional equity or debt securities or obtain credit financing. This capital may not be available on satisfactory terms, if at all. Furthermore, any additional equity financing may be dilutive to our stockholders, and debt financing, if available, may include restrictive covenants.\nContractual Obligations\nA summary of our contractual obligations as of December 31, 2021 is as follows:\nTable 10: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Payments Due by Period\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Less than 1\nyear\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1 to 3 years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3 to 5 years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>More than\n5 years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Amounts\nCommitted\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Operating leases\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,020\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>4,218\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,819\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>132\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>9,189\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Long-term debt\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>47,507\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>25,811\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>89,377\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>162,695\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Finance lease obligations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>159\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>207\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>366\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>License fees\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>916\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>400\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,316\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>51,602\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>30,636\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>91,196\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>132\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>173,566\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOur operating and finance leases are principally for facilities and equipment. We currently lease office space in the U.S. and foreign countries to support our operations as a global organization. The operating leases in the above table include our several locations with the amounts committed by each location: (1) the rental of our global headquarters in the Conventus Center for Collaborative Medicine in Buffalo, NY; (2) the rental of our research and development facility in the IC Development Centre in Hong Kong; (3) the rental of the Commercial Platform headquarters in Chicago, IL; (4) the rental of our clinical research headquarters in Cranford, NJ; (5) the rental of our clinical data management center in Taipei, Taiwan; (6) the rental of our contract research organization throughout Latin America; (7) the rental of our Global Supply Chain distribution office in Houston, TX; (8) the rental of our Global Supply Chain API manufacturing facility in Chongqing, China; and (9) the rental of other facilities and equipment located mainly in Buffalo, NY. These locations represent $4.6 million, $0.1 million, $1.6 million, $0.2 million, $0.2 million, $0.1 million, $0.2 million, $0.4 million, and $1.7 million, respectively, of the total amounts committed. In addition to the minimum rental commitments on our operating leases we may also be required to pay amounts for taxes, insurance, maintenance and other operating expenses.\nThe long-term debt includes our senior secured loan and the credit agreement with CQ. The finance lease obligations represent three leases of equipment in our 503B manufacturing facility outside of Buffalo, NY. The license fees in the above table represent the amount committed and accrued under in-license agreements for specialty drug products by the Commercial platform.\nIn addition, we have certain obligations under licensing arrangements with third parties contingent upon achieving various development, regulatory, and commercial milestones. Pursuant to our purchase agreement of Kuur Therapeutics, we may be required to make payments worth up to $115.0 million, payable in cash of shares of our common stock, upon the occurrence of certain development and regulatory milestones related to our NKT cell therapy. Pursuant to our license agreement with Polytom, we may be required to make payments worth up to $44.0 million of our common stock or cash upon the occurrence of certain regulatory milestones related to a pegylated genetically modified human arginase, and make royalty payments representing a percentage of net sales of the licensed products. Pursuant to our license agreement with Avalon HepaPOC, we may be required to make payments worth up to $4.8 million of our common stock or cash upon the occurrence of certain regulatory and sales milestones related to the meter and strips for conduct of liver function tests in humans taking our oncology drugs and make royalty payments representing a percentage of aggregate net sales of the licensed product. Pursuant to the license agreement with XLifeSc, our 55% owned joint venture Axis Therapeutics Limited, we may be required to make cash payments worth up to $108.0 million upon the occurrence of certain regulatory milestones related to XLifeSc's proprietary TCR-T technology, and make royalty payments representing a percentage of aggregate net income generated by sales of licensed products. Pursuant to our license agreements with Hanmi, we may be required to make equity payments of $24.0 million upon regulatory approval of a product within the Orasovery platform and make tiered royalty payments based on net sales of any product using the licensed intellectual property. These amounts are not included in the table above.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Significant Judgments and Estimates\nOur discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of our financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the periods. We evaluate our estimates and judgments on an ongoing basis, including but not limited to, estimating the useful lives of long-lived assets, assessing the impairment of long-lived assets, stock-based compensation expenses, and the realizability of deferred income tax assets. We base our estimates on historical experience, known trends and events, contractual milestones and other various factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Changes in the accounting estimates are likely to occur from period to period. Actual results could be significantly different from these estimates. We believe that the accounting policies discussed below are critical to understanding our historical and future performance, as these policies relate to the more significant areas involving management's judgment and estimates.\nRevenue Recognition\n1.Oncology Innovation Platform\nThe Company out-licenses certain of its IP to other pharmaceutical companies in specific territories that allow the customer to use, develop, commercialize, or otherwise exploit the licensed IP. In accordance with ASC 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers ( Topic 606\u201d), the Company analyzes the contracts to identify its performance obligations within the contract. Most of the Company's out-license arrangements contain multiple performance obligations and variable pricing. After the performance obligations are identified, the Company determines the transaction price, which generally includes upfront fees, milestone payments related to the achievement of developmental, regulatory, or commercial goals, and royalty payments on net sales of licensed products. The Company considers whether the transaction price is fixed or variable, and whether such consideration is subject to return. Variable consideration is only included in the transaction price to the extent that it is probable that a significant reversal in the amount of cumulative revenue recognized will not occur when the uncertainty associated with the variable consideration is subsequently resolved. If any portion of the transaction price is constrained, it is excluded from the transaction price until the constraint no longer exists. The Company then allocates the transaction price to the performance obligation to which the consideration is related. Where a portion of the transaction price is received and allocated to continuing performance obligations under the terms of the arrangement, it is recorded as deferred revenue and recognized as revenue when (or as) the underlying performance obligation is satisfied.\nThe Company's contracts may contain one or multiple promises, including the license of IP and development services. The licensed IP related to the Company's approved and late-stage drug candidates is capable of being distinct from the other performance obligations identified in the contract and is distinct within the context of the contract, as upon transfer of the IP, the customer is able to use and benefit from it, and the customer could obtain the development services from other parties. The Company also considers the economic and regulatory characteristics of the licensed IP and other promises in the contract to determine if it is a distinct performance obligation. The Company considers if the IP is modified or enhanced by other performance obligations through the life of the agreement and whether the customer is contractually or practically required to use updated IP. The IP licensed by the Company has been determined to be functional IP. The IP is not modified during the license period and therefore, the Company recognizes revenues from any portion of the transaction price allocated to the licensed IP when the license is transferred to the customer and they can benefit from the right to use the IP. The Company recognized $0.5 million in license revenue from an out-license arrangement for the year ended December 31, 2021, and $37.7 million in license revenue, net of $2.3 million value added tax ( VAT\u201d), and $1.0 million in license revenue from two of the Company's out-license arrangements for the year ended December 31, 2020. The Company recognized revenue allocated to the licensed IP performance obligation upon transfer of the license of $0.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. During the year ended December 31, 2021, the Company received $2.0 million in upfront fees for a license of TRC-T technology, which was deemed not to be distinct, as the IP is in an early stage and is dependent on development activities to be performed by the Company, and $0.7 million for licenses of Klisyri in territories in which it is not yet approved and further development activities are required to be performed by the Company. Therefore these licenses of IP and the development services were considered a bundled performance obligation. As of December 31, 2021, this bundle of performance obligations was not satisfied and the corresponding $2.7 million was recorded as deferred revenue on the Company's consolidated balance sheet.\nOther performance obligations included in most of the Company's out-licensing agreements include performing development services to reach clinical and regulatory milestone events. The Company satisfies these performance obligations at a point-in-time, because the customer does not simultaneously receive and consume the benefits as the development occurs, the development does not create or enhance an asset controlled by the customer, and the development does not create an asset with no alternative use. The Company considers milestone payments to be variable consideration measured using the most likely amount method, as the entitlement to the consideration is contingent on the occurrence or nonoccurrence of future events. The Company allocates each variable milestone payment to the associated milestone performance obligation, as the variable payment relates directly to the Company's efforts to satisfy the performance obligation and such allocation depicts the amount of consideration to which the\nCompany expects to be entitled for satisfying the corresponding performance obligation. The Company re-evaluates the probability of achievement of such performance obligations and any related constraint and adjusts its estimate of the transaction price as appropriate. To date, no amounts have been constrained in the initial or subsequent assessments of the transaction price. The Company did not recognize revenue from other performance obligations included in the Company's out-licensing agreements during the years ended December 31, 2021 or 2020. The Company recognized revenue allocated to development performance obligations upon transfer to the customer of $20.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2019.\nCertain out-license agreements include performance obligations to manufacture and provide drug product in the future for commercial sale when the licensed product is approved. For the commercial, sales-based royalties, the consideration is predominantly related to the licensed IP and is contingent on the customer's subsequent sales to another commercial customer. Consequently, the sales- or usage-based royalty exception would apply. Revenue will be recognized for the commercial, sales-based milestones as the underlying sales occur. The Company recognized $25.0 million in commercial milestones and $1.0 million in royalties during the year ended December 31, 2021. No such revenues were recorded during 2020.\nThe Company exercises significant judgment when identifying distinct performance obligations within its out-license arrangements, determining the transaction price, which often includes both fixed and variable considerations, and allocating the transaction price to the proper performance obligation. The Company did not use any other significant judgments related to out-licensing revenue during the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020.\n2.Global Supply Chain Platform\nThe Company's Global Supply Chain Platform manufactures API for use internally in its research and development activities as well as its clinical studies, and for sale to pharmaceutical customers globally. The Company generates additional revenue on this platform, by providing small to mid-scale cGMP manufacturing of clinical and commercial products for pharmaceutical and biotech companies and selling pharmaceutical products under 503B regulations set forth by the U.S. FDA.\nRevenue earned by the Global Supply Platform is recognized when the Company has satisfied its performance obligation, which is the shipment or the delivery of drug products. The underlying contracts for these sales are generally purchase orders and the Company recognizes revenue at a point-in-time. Any remaining performance obligations related to product sales are the result of customer deposits and are reflected in the deferred revenue contract liability balance.\n3.Commercial Platform\nThe Company's Commercial Platform generates revenue by distributing specialty products through independent pharmaceutical wholesalers. The wholesalers then sell to an end-user, normally a hospital, alternative healthcare facility, or an independent pharmacy, at a lower price previously established by the end-user and the Company. Upon the sale by the wholesaler to the end-user, the wholesaler will chargeback the difference, if any, between the original list price and price at which the product was sold to the end-user. The Company also offers cash discounts, which approximate 2.3% of the gross sales price, as an incentive for prompt customer payment, and, consistent with industry practice, the Company's return policy permits customers to return products within a window of time before and after the expiration of product dating. Further, the Company offers contractual allowances, generally in the form of rebates or administrative fees, to certain wholesale customers, group purchasing organizations ( GPOs\u201d), and end-user customers, consistent with pharmaceutical industry practices. Revenues are recorded net of provisions for variable consideration, including discounts, rebates, GPO allowances, price adjustments, returns, chargebacks, promotional programs and other sales allowances. Accruals for these provisions are presented in the consolidated financial statements as reductions in determining net sales and as a contra asset in accounts receivable, net (if settled via credit) and other current liabilities (if paid in cash). As of December 31, 2021 and 2020, the Company's total provision for chargebacks and other deductions included as a reduction of accounts receivable totaled $22.9 million and $12.6 million, respectively. The Company's total provision for chargebacks and other revenue deductions was $129.0 million, $89.3 million, and $87.2 million for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019, respectively.\nThe Company exercises significant judgment in its estimates of the variable transaction price at the time of the sale and recognizes revenue when the performance obligation is satisfied. Factors that determine the final net transaction price include chargebacks, fees for service, cash discounts, rebates, returns, warranties, and other factors. The Company estimates all of these variables based on historical data obtained from previous sales finalized with the end-user customer on a product-by-product basis. At the time of sale, revenue is recorded net of each of these deductions. Through the normal course of business, the wholesaler will sell the product to the end-user, determining the actual chargeback, return products, and take advantage of cash discounts, charge fees for services, and claim warranties on products. The final transaction price per product is compared to the initial estimated net sale price and reviewed for accuracy. The final prices and other factors are immediately included in the Company's historical data from which it will estimate the transaction price for future sales. The underlying contracts for these sales are generally purchase orders including a single performance obligation, generally the shipment or delivery of products and the Company recognizes this revenue at a point-in-time.\nResearch and Development Expenses\nResearch and development expenses represent costs associated with developing our proprietary drug candidates, our collaboration agreements for such drugs, and our ongoing clinical studies.\nClinical trial costs are a significant component of our research and development expenses. We have a history of contracting with third parties that perform various clinical trial activities on our behalf in the ongoing development of our drug candidates. Expenses related to clinical trials are accrued based on our estimates of the actual services performed by the third parties for the respective period. If the contracted amounts are revised or the scope of a contract is revised, we will modify the accruals accordingly on a prospective basis and will do so in the period in which the facts that give rise to the revision become reasonably certain.\nGoodwill\nThe Company tests goodwill for impairment annually on October 1st, the Company's annual goodwill impairment measurement date, or more frequently if a triggering event occurs, and it updates its test with information that becomes available through the end of the period reported. The Company has three operating segments, each of which represents a separate reporting unit: Oncology Innovation Platform, Commercial Platform, and Global Supply Chain Platform. Each of the three reporting units has discrete financial information that is reviewed by segment managers. Goodwill was assigned to two reporting units: Oncology Innovation Platform and Global Supply Chain Platform. Goodwill impairment exists when the fair value of goodwill is less than its carrying value. The Company determined that an impairment triggering event occurred during the first quarter of 2021 and, consistent with our annual policy, performed a test as of our annual goodwill impairment evaluation date, October 1, 2021, subsequently updating that analysis to December 31, 2021 using new information that became available regarding conditions that existed as of December 31, 2021, and concluded that there was goodwill impairment of $67.7 million for the three months ended December 31, 2021. No impairment of goodwill was recorded for the years ended December 31, 2020, and 2019. See Part II, Item 8, Note 8 - Goodwill and Intangible Assets, Net, and Note 9 -Fair Value Measurements, for additional information.\nIntangible Assets, net\nIntangible assets arising from a business acquisition are recognized at fair value as of the acquisition date. The Company amortizes intangible assets using the straight-line method. When the straight-line method of amortization is utilized, the estimated useful life of the intangible asset is shortened to assure the recognition of amortization expense corresponds with the expected cash flows. Other purchased intangibles, including certain licenses, are capitalized at cost and amortized on a straight-line basis over the license life, when a future economic benefit is probable and measurable. If a future economic benefit is not probable or measurable, the license costs are expensed as incurred within research and development expenses. In-process research and development (\"IPR&D\") intangible assets are not amortized, but rather are reviewed for impairment on an annual basis or more frequently if indicators of impairment are present, until the project is completed, abandoned, or transferred to a third party.\nImpairment of Long-Lived Assets\nThe Company reviews the recoverability of its long-lived assets, excluding goodwill, when events or changes in circumstances occur that indicate that the carrying value of the asset may not be recoverable. The assessment of possible impairment is based on the ability to recover the carrying value of the assets from the expected future cash flows (undiscounted and without interest expense) of the related operations. If these cash flows are less than the carrying value of such assets, an impairment loss for the difference between the estimated fair value and carrying value is recorded. The Company determined that impairment indicators occurred during the first and fourth quarters of 2021 and concluded that there was impairment of intangible assets other than goodwill amounting to $1.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. See Part II, Item 8, Note 8 - Goodwill and Intangible Assets, net for additional details.\nBusiness Acquisitions\nThe Company accounts for acquired businesses using the acquisition method of accounting, which requires that assets acquired and liabilities assumed be recognized at their estimated fair values as of the acquisition date. Identifiable amortizing intangible assets are recorded on the consolidated balance sheet at fair value and amortized over their estimated useful lives. Acquisition-related costs are expensed as incurred. Any excess of the consideration transferred over the estimated fair values of the net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill.\nContingent Consideration\nContingent consideration arising from a business acquisition is included as part of the purchase price and is recorded at fair value as of the acquisition date. Subsequent to the acquisition date, the Company remeasures contingent consideration arrangements at fair value at each reporting period until the contingency is resolved. The changes in fair value are recognized within selling, general,\nand administrative expenses in the Company's consolidated statement of operations and comprehensive loss. Changes in fair values reflect new information about the likelihood of the payment of the contingent consideration and the passage of time.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nIn the normal course of business, we evaluate all new accounting pronouncements issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board, SEC, or other authoritative accounting bodies to determine the potential impact they may have on our Consolidated Financial Statements. Refer to Note 2 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Item 8 of this report for additional information about these recently issued accounting standards and their potential impact on our financial condition or results of operations.", "item_7_truncated": "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nThe following discussion contains management's discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations and should be read together with the historical consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto included in Part II, Item 8 Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\u201d This discussion contains forward-looking statements that reflect our plans, estimates and beliefs and involve numerous risks and uncertainties, including but not limited to those described in the Risk Factors\u201d section of this Annual Report. Actual results may differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statements. You should carefully read Special Note About Forward-Looking Statements\u201d and Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors.\u201d\nOverview and Recent Developments\nWe are a biopharmaceutical company dedicated to becoming a leader in the discovery, development and commercialization of next generation drugs for the treatment of cancer. Our mission is to improve the lives of cancer patients by creating more effective, safer and tolerable treatments. We have assembled a strong and experienced leadership team and have established operations across the pharmaceutical value chain to execute our goal of becoming a global leader in bringing innovative cancer treatments to the market and improving health outcomes.\nWe are organized around three operating segments: (1) our Oncology Innovation Platform, dedicated to the research and development of our proprietary drugs; (2) our Commercial Platform, focused on the sales and marketing of our specialty drugs and the market development of our proprietary drugs; and (3) our Global Supply Chain Platform, dedicated to providing a stable and efficient supply of active pharmaceutical ingredients ( API\u201d) for our clinical and commercial efforts. Our current clinical pipeline in the Oncology Innovation Platform is derived from the following core technologies: (1) Cell Therapy, (2) Orascovery, based on a P-glycoprotein ( P-gp\u201d) pump inhibitor, and (3) Src Kinase Inhibition.\nOncology Innovation Platform Developments\nThrough our acquisition of Kuur Therapeutics, Inc. (formerly known as Cell Medica, Kuur\u201d) in 2021, we acquired rights to intellectual property to further the development of autologous and allogeneic, or off-the-shelf\u201d, natural killer T ( NKT\u201d) cell immunotherapies for the treatment of solid and hematological malignancies. We are advancing the following product candidates: KUR-501, KUR-502, and KUR-503.\nKUR-501 is an autologous product in which NKT cells are engineered with a chimeric antigen receptor ( CAR\u201d) targeting GD2 ( GINAKIT\u201d cells). GD2 is expressed on almost all neuroblastoma tumors and certain other malignancies. KUR-501 is currently being evaluated in a phase 1 clinical trial (GINAKIT2) treating children with relapsed-refractory ( R/R\u201d) high risk neuroblastoma. In May 2021, we presented an interim data update from the first eleven evaluable patients at the American Society of Gene & Cell Therapy ( ASGCT\u201d). During this initial evaluation, the safety profile of KUR-501 was manageable, and there was no dose limiting toxicity ( DLT\u201d). No patients experienced grade 2 or higher toxicities related to KUR-501. There were no grades 3-5 cytokine release syndrome ( CRS\u201d) and no evidence of immune effector cell-associated neurotoxicity syndrome ( ICANS\u201d) in any of the patients. Grades 3-4 adverse events ( AEs\u201d), reported regardless of relationship to KUR-501, have included anemia, leukopenia, lymphopenia, neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, abdominal distension, acute gastroenteritis, liver enzyme increase, vomiting, bone pain, headache, neck pain, fever, urinary tract infection, altered mental status, and hypoxia. As this clinical development program is still in the early stages, we do not yet have meaningful statistics on safety, including AEs, to report. Observed responses included one complete response ( CR\u201d) and one partial response ( PR\u201d). Four additional patients have exhibited stable disease ( SD\u201d). We also observed long-term persistence of NKT cells expressing CAR. Importantly, we observed NKT cell localization to the tumor site.\nKUR-502 is an allogeneic ( off-the-shelf\u201d) product in which NKT cells are engineered with a CAR targeting CD19. KUR-502 is currently being evaluated in a phase 1 clinical trial (ANCHOR) treating adults with R/R CD19 positive malignancies, including B cell lymphoma, acute lymphoblastic leukemia ( ALL\u201d), and chronic lymphocytic leukemia ( CLL\u201d). In December 2021, we presented an interim data update on the first five evaluable patients at the American Society of Hematology ( ASH\u201d) annual meeting. Tumor biopsies showed presence of NKT cells expressing CARs in the disease sites, indicating that the KUR-502 cells are able to traffic to the tumor. The safety profile was manageable with no DLT. There was one case of grade 1 CRS, no ICANS, and no graft versus host disease ( GvHD\u201d) attributable to KUR-502. Grades 3-4 AEs, reported regardless of relationship to KUR-502, have included lymphopenia, leukopenia, neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, liver enzyme elevation, bilirubin elevation, anemia, diarrhea, hypoalbuminemia, and myositis. As this clinical development program is still in the early stages, we do not yet have meaningful statistics on safety, including AEs, to report. Of the first five evaluable patients, the overall response rate was 80%, and the complete response rate was 60%.\nKUR-503 is an allogeneic ( off-the-shelf\u201d) product in which NKT cells are engineered with a CAR targeting glypican-3 ( GPC3\u201d). GPC3 is a molecule that is highly expressed on most hepatocellular carcinomas ( HCC\u201d) but not normal liver or other non-neoplastic tissue. KUR-503 is currently in preclinical development, and we are planning to submit an IND by the first half of 2023.\nPursuant to the terms of the Merger Agreement, we paid $70.0 million upfront to Kuur shareholders and its former employees and directors, comprised primarily of shares of our common stock. Additionally, Kuur shareholders and its former employees and\ndirectors are eligible to receive up to $115.0 million of milestone payments, which may be paid, at the Company's sole discretion, in either cash or additional common stock of the Company, or a combination of both. The Company identified the Merger as a business combination pursuant to ASC 805 and used the acquisition method of accounting to account for the transaction. The purchase price, after adjusted for closing conditions, consisted of 14,228,066 shares of the Company's common stock issued at $3.71 per share with a fair value of $52.8 million, plus the fair value of the future milestone payments amounting to $19.8 million, recorded as contingent consideration. For additional information, please see Part II, Item 8, Note 3-Business Combination.\u201d\nWe continue to advance TCR affinity-enhancing specific T-cell ( TAEST\u201d) therapy with our drug candidate, TCRT-ESO-A2. TCRT-ESO-A2 is an autologous T cell receptor ( TCR\u201d)-T cell therapy targeting solid tumors that are NY-ESO-1 positive in HLA-A*02:01 positive patients. A phase 1 clinical trial treating adults with advanced solid tumors expressing NY-ESO-1 is currently open enrolling.\nOn February 26, 2021, we received a Complete Response Letter (\"CRL\") from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration ( FDA\u201d) regarding our New Drug Application ( NDA\u201d) for oral paclitaxel and encequidar ( Oral Paclitaxel\u201d) for the treatment of metastatic breast cancer ( mBC\u201d). Following the CRL, we held two Type A meetings with the FDA to discuss the deficiencies raised in the CRL, review a proposed design for a new clinical trial intended to address the deficiencies raised in the CRL, and discuss the potential regulatory path forward for Oral Paclitaxel in mBC in the U.S. In October 2021, after careful consideration of the FDA feedback, we determined to redeploy our resources to focus on other ongoing studies of Oral Paclitaxel and our Cell Therapy platform. On November 29, 2021, we announced the U.K. Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency ( MHRA\u201d) validation of the Marketing Authorization Application ( MAA\u201d) for Oral Paclitaxel, for review. The Phase 3 study of Oral Paclitaxel in mBC (KX-ORAX-001) served as the basis of the MAA.\nWe are continuing to evaluate Oral Paclitaxel in combination with check point inhibitors. The development of our other Orascovery product candidates, including oral irinotecan and encequidar ( Oral Irinotecan\u201d), oral docetaxel and encequidar ( Oral Docetaxel\u201d), oral topotecan and encequidar ( Oral Topotecan\u201d), and oral eribulin and encequidar ( Oral Eribulin\u201d) has been suspended at this time.\nOn February 18, 2021, our partner Almirall (Almirall, S.A., BME: ALM) launched Klisyri\u00ae (tirbanibulin ointment) for actinic keratosis (AK) in the US. On September 27, 2021, we announced Almirall launched Klisyri in Germany and the UK, as part of a phased European launch, after receiving approval from the European Commission in July 2021 and the UK MHRA in August 2021, for Klisyri indicated for the topical treatment of AK of the face or scalp in adults. The launch of Klisyri in the U.S. resulted in a milestone payment of $20.0 million pursuant to our 2017 out-license agreement with Almirall, recognized as revenue in the first quarter of 2021, and the launch in Europe resulted in a milestone payment of $5.0 million, recognized as revenue in the third quarter of 2021.\nOn February 15, 2021, we entered into the Second Amendment to the 2011 license agreement with PharmaEssentia Corp. ( PharmaEssentia\u201d) for tirbanibulin ointment. The Second Amendment expands the territory to include Japan and South Korea and includes a license to use the intellectual property for additional dermatology indications and skin cancer in the existing territories. On July 26, 2021, we announced that we entered into licensing agreements and strategic partnerships with Seqirus Pty Ltd ( Seqirus\u201d), a subsidiary of CSL Limited, and AVIR Pharma Inc. ( AVIR\u201d) for tirbanibulin. Under the terms of the agreements, Seqirus will have an exclusive license to commercialize tirbanibulin in Australia and New Zealand, and AVIR will have an exclusive license to commercialize tirbanibulin in Canada.\nWith respect to Arginine Deprivation therapy, the enrollment of the Phase 1 trial of PT01 for the treatment of patients with advanced malignancies has been suspended, and no further studies are planned at this time.\nCommercial and Global Supply Chain Platform Developments\nWe suspended production activities at our Taihao API facility in Chongqing, China, in May 2019, based on concerns raised by the Department of Emergency Management of Chongqing ( DEMC\u201d) related to the location of our plant. We subsequently resumed producing API at the Taihao API facility primarily for our ongoing clinical studies and commercial launches of proprietary drugs in accordance with local regulatory guidance, while we started building out Sintaho, a new API facility in Chongqing. In July 2021, we received verbal notice from the DEMC that we will be required to terminate the production activities at its Taihao API facility. We are continuing to engage in dialogue with the DEMC. While we are able to continue producing certain API at the Taihao API facility in limited quantities and a certain extent of our operations are now being conducted at Sintaho, we are in the process of moving the remainder of the operations and production activities to Sintaho and exploring other sources of API, in the event we are unable to reach an agreement with the DEMC for the continued production activities of the Taihao API facility.\nOn October 1, 2021, we entered into a lease agreement with Fort Schuyler Management Corporation ( FSMC\u201d), a not-for-profit corporation affiliated with the State of New York, to lease the 409,000 square feet, newly constructed cGMP ISO Class 5 high potency pharmaceutical manufacturing facility located in Dunkirk, NY. This rights to lease this facility were transferred to ImmunityBio in February 2022. For additional information, please see Part II, Item 8, Note 21-Subsequent Events.\u201d\nCOVID-19 related measures\nSince early 2020, after monitoring developments related to the spread of COVID-19, we have undertaken a number of measures in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, with a goal to prioritize the health and safety of our employees and ensure continuity in our business. These measures included implementing a work-from-home policy at various times and other efforts in accordance with recommendations by local authorities for certain of our personnel across the globe as well as imposing restrictions on travel and in-person meetings to protect the health and safety of our workforce while we continue to advance our clinical programs and operations. We have continued to add additional safety procedures and tools in all our locations. We adhere to all state and federal requirements as the same may be in force from time to time.\nWe have been deemed an essential business\u201d by New York State and, as a result, we have experienced minimal disruptions at our New York-based operations in Clarence and Buffalo. Despite these efforts, we may from time to time experience additional disruptions related to the COVID-19 pandemic resulting from employees falling ill with COVID-19. We have supplied our employees with appropriate face coverings and other necessary personal protective equipment and have taken other measures to reduce the risk of the spread of COVID-19 at our work sites. We are actively monitoring our operations and supply chain across the globe and are making adjustments to respond to logistical challenges that arise due to the COVID-19 pandemic where appropriate, particularly due to the emergence and spread of the COVID-19 Omicron variant, which has impacted our operations and supply chain during 2021 as discussed further below. We have continued to produce some medicines that are used to treat COVID-19 as part of our commitment to contribute to the COVID-19 relief effort.\nWith respect to our clinical development program, for our earlier stage product candidates, we have experienced and expect to continue to experience slowed enrollment for our clinical trials as well as suspensions in our clinical trials as healthcare resources are diverted to address the COVID-19 pandemic. We remain committed to advancing our pipeline while ensuring the safety of all participants as well as the integrity of the data. We will continue to monitor developments with respect to the COVID-19 pandemic as well as industry and regulatory best practices for continuing clinical development programs during the pandemic, including, if and where appropriate, the use of virtual communications, interviews, and visits as well as self-administration and remote monitoring techniques to address health and safety concerns while minimizing disruptions and delays to our clinical development timelines.\nWe also put in place a number of measures intended to adjust or allocate resources towards prioritizing key business operations such as clinical and regulatory activities, and to delay or defray compensation costs in order to preserve our cash on hand and liquidity during a volatile period in the U.S. and global capital markets.\nWhile the disruptions to our business caused by the pandemic are currently expected to be temporary, there is still uncertainty regarding the pandemic's overall duration and the severity of any future outbreaks. For example, the surge of COVID-19 cases in the first half of 2021 in India, a country where we source products and maintain partnerships that are key to our specialty drug business, including API, presented business and supply chain disruption risks for us. We could face similar risks in other regions, or a resurgence in India, to the extent the virus is not able to be contained, there is widespread sickness and disruptions on. The scope and impact of any such measures is not yet known and will depend on a number of factors, including but not limited to the ultimate spread and severity of the outbreaks and the scope, duration and impact of containment measures on individuals and businesses. If our partners experience significant or extended disruptions to their business due to COVID-19, it could result in supply shortages and harm our specialty drug business, as well as our overall financial condition.\nGoing Concern Considerations\nWe have three operating segments: our Oncology Innovation Platform, Global Supply Chain Platform and Commercial Platform. Since inception, we have devoted a substantial amount of our resources to research and development of our lead product candidates under our Orascovery and Src Kinase Inhibition technology platforms, as well as under the Cell Therapy platform and Arginine Deprivation Therapy technology, while building up our commercial infrastructure. We have incurred significant net losses since inception.\nWe have incurred operating losses since inception and, as a result, as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, we had an accumulated deficit of $913.4 million and $713.6 million, respectively. We expect to incur significant expenses and operating losses for the foreseeable future. We project insufficient liquidity to fund our operations through the next twelve months beyond the date of this report. This condition raises substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. See Part II, Item 8. Note 1-Company and Nature of Business for further information regarding our ability to continue as a going concern.\nAs a result of the significant decrease in our market capitalization since we last performed a goodwill impairment test in the fourth quarter of 2020, we evaluated the impact on each of our reporting units to assess whether there was an impairment triggering event. The Company identified impairment triggering events during the first quarter of 2021 and, consistent with our annual policy, performed a test as of our annual goodwill impairment evaluation date, October 1, 2021, subsequently updating that analysis to December 31, 2021 using new information that became available regarding conditions that existed as of December 31, 2021. We compared the fair value of our Global Supply Chain Platform and Oncology Innovation Platform reporting units to carrying value. Based on the results from the test on March 31, 2021, the fair value of each of our reporting units exceeded their carrying value, and\nthe goodwill was not impaired. Based on the results from the test during the fourth quarter of 2021, the carrying value of the Global Supply Chain Platform and Oncology Innovation Platform reporting units exceeded their fair value, and therefore, goodwill was determined to be fully impaired. Accordingly, the Company recorded goodwill impairment of $67.7 million during the year ended December 31, 2021, of which, $26.6 million was related to the Global Supply Chain Platform reporting unit and $41.1 million was related to the Oncology Innovation Platform reporting unit (see Part II, Item 8. Note 8-Intangible Assets, Net). Estimating the fair value of goodwill requires the use of estimates and significant judgments that are based on a number of factors. These estimates and judgments may not be within our control and accordingly it is reasonably possible that the judgments and estimates could change in future periods.\nHowever, a lack of sustained recovery or further deterioration in market conditions related to the general economy and the industries in which we operate, a sustained trend of weaker than anticipated financial performance, further decline in our share price for a sustained period of time, or an increase in the market-based weighted average cost of capital, among other factors, could significantly impact the impairment analysis and may result in future impairment charges that, if incurred, could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe have funded our operations to date primarily from the issuance and sale of our common stock through public offerings, senior secured loans, private placements, and to a lesser extent, from convertible bond financing, revenue, and grant funding. As of December 31, 2021, we had cash and cash equivalents of $35.2 million, restricted cash of $16.5 million, and short-term investments of $10.2 million.\nOn August 20, 2021, we entered into a sales agreement (the Sales Agreement\u201d) with SVB Leerink LLC, in connection with the offer and sale of up to $100,000,000 of shares of our common stock, par value $0.001 per share ( ATM Shares\u201d). The ATM Shares to be offered and sold under the Sales Agreement will be issued and sold pursuant to a registration statement on Form S-3 (File No. 333-258185) that became effective on August 12, 2021. During the year ended December 31, 2021, we sold 762,825 shares of our common stock for an average price of $1.49 per share under the Sales Agreement.\nOutlook\nOur company's mission is to become a leader in bringing innovative cancer treatments to the market and to improve patient health outcomes. Historically, we had focused development of our Orascovery platform which is based on a technology that converts IV chemotherapy to oral chemotherapy. We conducted a large phase 3 clinical trial in metastatic breast cancer comparing Oral Paclitaxel to IV paclitaxel, which was the basis of our NDA submission. Unfortunately, in February 2021, we received a CRL from the FDA which asked for an additional clinical study to support approval. After careful evaluation and prioritization of our R&D pipeline, we have decided to focus our R&D resources on our innovative cell therapy platform, which is based on NKT cells. NKT cells have unique biology that has potential advantages over current T cell and NK cell based technologies. We believe these advantages include the following:\n(1)There is still a major unmet need in hematological and solid tumors in that even in those indications where autologous CAR-T cells have been previously approved, up to 60% of patients receiving CAR-T therapy do not achieve long term durable responses.\n(2)Cellular therapies have generally not been effective in the treatment of solid tumors. NKT cells are an ideal platform for treatment of solid tumors because NKT cells home to tumors, and we have data demonstrating that CAR-NKT cells are superior in tumor homing compared to CAR-T cells.\n(3)Our allogeneic ( off-the-shelf\u201d) CAR-NKT cell therapy products may be produced at larger scale than autologous products, potentially at lower cost.\n(4)Our allogeneic CAR-NKT cells are manufactured starting with the lymphocytes of healthy donors. Use of healthy donors, rather than patients (who are the source of autologous cell therapy starting materials), results in a more robust and consistent product, because patient lymphocytes are usually dysfunctional due to previous cancer therapy.\nNKT cells demonstrate anti-tumor activity, even without a CAR. This is because NKT cells can kill immune suppressive cells in the local tumor microenvironment. Thus, when we add a CAR to NKT cells they are now equipped with two different anti-tumor mechanisms, which may lead to more potent anti-tumor activity and reduce the potential for relapse.\nAdvancing KUR-501 CAR-NKT Targeting GD2 - KUR-501 is an autologous product in which NKT cells are engineered with a CAR targeting GD2 and is currently being evaluated in a phase 1 clinical trial (GINAKIT2) treating children with R/R high risk neuroblastoma. Neuroblastoma is a rare pediatric cancer and patients with R/R high risk neuroblastoma have very poor outcomes. Therefore, we believe there is a significant unmet need for better treatment options. Interim data presented at the American Society of Gene and Cell Therapy (ASGCT) 2021 Annual Meeting for the first eleven evaluable patients, showed long-term persistence of CAR-NKT cells and CAR-NKT cell localization at the tumor site. Responses were observed in two patients, including one CR, one PR, and four patients achieved SD. The safety profile of KUR-501 was manageable and the product is being administered in the outpatient\nsetting. GINATKIT2 will continue enrolling patients at higher dose level cohorts with a goal to identify an optimal dose that we may take into a pivotal study.\nAdvancing KUR-502 CAR-NKT Targeting CD19 - Early data, as presented at the ASH annual meeting in December of 2021, indicated that, of the first five evaluable patients, there was a promising overall response rate of 80% with a complete response rate of 60%. KUR-502 is an allogeneic, off-the-shelf\u201d product in which NKT cells are engineered with a CAR targeting CD19. Today, autologous CAR-T cell treatments are available to patients, but the patient-to-patient variability and long manufacturing lead times limit patient care options. As an allogeneic off-the-shelf\u201d product, KUR-502 leverages economies of scale and has the potential to significantly increase patient access to innovative CAR-NKT treatments. Our aim is to expand the phase 1 (ANCHOR) clinical trial treating adults with R/R CD19 positive malignancies currently being conducted at BCM to a phase 1 multicenter clinical trial (ANCHOR2).\nFocusing on Specific Programs of Oral Paclitaxel - For Oral Paclitaxel, while our MAA submission is currently under review by the U.K. MHRA, we have focused our efforts on our ongoing combination clinical trials with checkpoint inhibitors where we believe there is an opportunity. Oral Paclitaxel is currently being evaluated in combination with pembrolizumab in NSCLC; and dostarlimab +/- carboplatin in neoadjuvant breast cancer, as part of I-SPY 2.\nLicensing and Partnership Opportunities - We continue to increase the global reach of tirbanibulin 1% ointment by maintaining strong global partnerships with existing partners such as Almirall, Seqirus, and AVIR and by evaluating other strategic territories to launch the product. Our team will continue to work closely with our partners to explore additional treatment regimens and indications for tirbanibulin 1% ointment. We will pursue strategic licensing and partnership opportunities for our small molecule programs and target opportunities that will create potential value for stockholders and support our business strategy and mission.\nAs we pursue these strategic priorities, we expect to incur significant expenses and increasing operating losses for the foreseeable future. We anticipate that our expenses will increase as we seek to:\n\u2022Advance the preclinical and clinical research program and development activities of our Cell Therapy technology platform;\n\u2022Continue our preclinical and clinical research program and development activities related to our Mission;\n\u2022Seek to identify additional research programs and product candidates within existing Cell Therapy platform; and\n\u2022Maintain, expand, and protect our IP portfolio.\nResults of Operations\nExcept where otherwise noted, the following discussion compares fiscal years 2021 and 2020 results. For a discussion on the comparison between fiscal year 2020 and fiscal year 2019 results, see the Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2020, as filed with the SEC and incorporated by reference herein.\nSince inception, we have devoted a substantial amount of our resources to research and development of our lead product candidates under our Orascovery, Src Kinase inhibition, Cell Therapy and arginine deprivation therapy technologies, to sales and general administrative costs associated with our operations, and to the development of our specialty drug operations in our Commercial Platform and 503B operations. We have incurred significant net losses since inception. Our net losses were $202.0 million, $148.4 million, and $125.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019, respectively. As of December 31, 2021 and 2020, we had an accumulated deficit of approximately $913.4 million and $713.6 million, respectively.\nWe have funded our operations to date primarily from the issuance and sale of our common stock through public offerings, private placements, debt and convertible bonds, and to a lesser extent, through revenue generated from our Global Supply Chain Platform. Our operating activities from continuing operations used $138.3 million, $127.8 million and $97.0 million of cash during the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019, respectively. As of December 31, 2021, we had cash and cash equivalents of $35.2 million, restricted cash of $16.5 million, and short-term investments of $10.2 million.\nKey Components of Results of Operations\nRevenue\nWe derive our consolidated revenue primarily from (i) the sales of generic injectable products by our Commercial Platform; (ii) licensing and collaboration projects conducted by our Oncology Innovation Platform, which generates revenue in the form of upfront payments, milestone payments, and payments received for providing research and development services for our collaboration projects and for other third parties; (iii) the sales of 503B and API products by our Global Supply Chain Platform; and (iv) grant awards from government agencies and universities for our continuing research and development efforts.\nThe following table sets forth the components of our consolidated revenue and the amount as a percentage of total revenue for the periods indicated.\nTable 6: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Year ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2021\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2020\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2019\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Product sales, net\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>92,264\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>77%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>105,274\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>73%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>80,535\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>80%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>License and other revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>27,917\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>23%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>39,117\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>27%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>20,694\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>20%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>120,181\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>144,391\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>101,229\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nCost of Sales\nAlong with sourcing from third-party manufacturers, we manufacture clinical products in our U.S. current Good Manufacturing Practices ( cGMP\u201d) facility in New York. Cost of sales primarily includes the cost of finished products, raw materials, labor costs, manufacturing overhead expenses and reserves for expected scrap, as well as transportation costs. Cost of sales also includes depreciation expense for production equipment, changes to our excess and obsolete inventory reserves, certain direct costs such as shipping costs, net of costs charged to customers, and sublicense fees related to in-license agreements.\nResearch and Development Expenses\nResearch and development ( R&D\u201d) expenses primarily consist of the costs associated with in-licensing of product candidates, milestone payments, conducting preclinical studies and clinical trials, activities related to regulatory filings and other R&D activities. The following table sets forth the components of our R&D expenses and the amount as a percentage of total R&D expenses for the periods indicated.\nTable 7: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2021\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2020\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2019\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Wages, benefits, and related costs\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>22,136\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>28%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>22,809\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>30%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>19,569\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>23%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Clinical trial costs\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>22,953\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>29%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>36,245\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>48%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>45,839\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>54%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Preclinical research costs\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11,443\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>14%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8,411\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8,418\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Drug licensing costs\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8,559\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,437\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8,071\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Other research and development\ncosts\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>15,106\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>19%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6,002\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,496\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Total research and development\ncosts\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>80,197\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>75,904\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>84,393\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOur current R&D activities mainly relate to the clinical development of our Oncology Innovation Platform.\nWe expense R&D costs as incurred. We record costs for certain development activities, such as clinical trials, based on an evaluation of the progress to completion of specific tasks using data such as patient enrollment or clinical site activations. We do not allocate employee-related costs, depreciation, rental and other indirect costs to specific R&D programs because these costs are deployed across multiple product programs under R&D. For 2021, other research and development costs include the cost of manufacturing Oral Paclitaxel in advance of the potential product launch in 2021. These costs are not expected to continue.\nWe cannot determine with certainty the duration, costs and timing of the current or future preclinical or clinical studies of our drug candidates. The duration, costs, and timing of clinical studies and development of our drug candidates will depend on a variety of factors, including:\n\u2022The scope, rate of progress, and costs of our ongoing, as well as any additional, clinical studies and other R&D activities;\n\u2022Future clinical study results;\n\u2022Uncertainties in clinical study enrollment rates;\n\u2022Significant and changing government regulation; and\n\u2022The timing and receipt of any regulatory approvals.\nA change in the outcome of any of these variables with respect to the development of a drug candidate, including delays caused by the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, could mean a significant change in the costs and timing associated with the development of that drug candidate.\nR&D activities are central to our business model. We expect our R&D expenses to decrease overall, as the development of most non-Cell Therapy technologies has been suspended. R&D expenses related to our Cell Therapy platform are expected to increase as we prepare for additional clinical and preclinical studies for our Cell Therapy programs. There are numerous factors associated with the successful commercialization of any of our drug candidates, including future trial design and various regulatory requirements, many of which cannot be determined with accuracy at this time based on our stage of development. Additionally, future commercial, regulatory and public health, including the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, factors beyond our control will likely impact our clinical development programs and plans.\nSelling, General and Administrative Expenses\nSelling, general and administrative, ( SG&A\u201d), expenses primarily consist of compensation, including salary, employee benefits and stock-based compensation expenses for sales and marketing personnel, and for administrative personnel that support our general operations such as executive management, legal counsel, financial accounting, information technology, and human resources personnel. SG&A expenses also include professional fees for legal, patent, consulting, auditing and tax services, as well as other direct and allocated expenses for rent and maintenance of facilities, insurance and other supplies used in the selling, marketing, general and administrative activities. SG&A expenses also include costs associated with our commercialization efforts for our proprietary drugs, such as market research, brand strategy and development work on market access, scientific publication, product distribution, and patient support.\nWe anticipate that our SG&A costs associated with the commercialization of the Orascovery platform and the development of the facility in Dunkirk, NY will decrease in future periods. We expect that certain costs, including share compensation costs, insurance costs, and other administrative costs, will decrease as a result of the sale of our interest in the pharmaceutical manufacturing facility located in Dunkirk, NY. Meanwhile, we anticipate that cost related to legal, compliance, accounting and investor and public relations expenses associated with being a public company will remain consistent.\nInterest Expense and Interest Income\nInterest expense consists primarily of interest on our long-term loans and the amortization of our debt discount. Interest income consists primarily of interest generated from our cash and short-term investments in U.S. Treasury securities, U.S. agency securities, high rated commercial papers and corporate bonds.\nLoss on Extinguishment of Debt\nThe loss on extinguishment of debt is the result of refinancing the senior secured loan agreement with Perceptive Advisors LLC and its affiliates ( Perceptive\u201d) with the Senior Credit Agreement with Oaktree, as well as the subsequent assignment of a portion of the Senior Credit Agreement to Sagard. The refinancing of the senior secured loan agreement with Perceptive resulted in an exit fee and the recognition of the unamortized debt discount as a loss on extinguishment of debt in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss. The assignment of a portion of the Senior Credit Agreement to Sagard qualified as a partial debt extinguishment and resulted in a proportional loss from the existing unamortized debt discount, inclusive of unamortized deferred financing fees.\nResults of Operations\nYear Ended December 31, 2021 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2020\nThe following table sets forth a summary of our consolidated results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, together with the changes in those items in dollars and as a percentage. This information should be read together with our consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this report. Our operating results in any period are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for any future period.\nTable 8: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>

million, a decrease of $13.0 million, or 12%, as compared to $105.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. This decrease was primarily attributable to a decrease in APD product sales of $22.6 million. The prior year had an increase in demand for COVID-19 related drugs and for FDA shortage products, including some significant non-recurring orders. In addition, in the first half of 2021, we experienced significant COVID-related challenges in our Indian supply chain and to a lesser extent in China. As a result, we did not receive some inventory from our partners located in these countries for a certain period of time. This decrease in APD product sales was partially offset by an increase in 503B sales of $7.8 million as the result of the increase in demand for certain drugs used to treat patients hospitalized with COVID-19. Contract manufacturing sale and API product sales experienced increases of $1.4 million and $0.4 million, respectively.\nLicense fees and other revenue decreased to $27.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, from $39.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, a decrease of $11.2 million, or 29%. During the year ended December 31, 2021, we recorded $20.0 million and $5.0 million of license revenue pursuant to our license agreement with Almirall upon the launch of Klisyri in the U.S. in February 2021 and in Europe in September 2021, respectively, and $0.5 million related to the upfront fee pursuant to the Second Amendment to the PharmaEssentia Agreement, for the license of Tirbanibulin in Japan and South Korea. During the year ended December 31, 2020, we recognized $37.7 million in license revenue, net of $2.3 million VAT pursuant to the Xiangxue License to develop and commercialize Oral Paclitaxel, Oral Irinotecan, and tirbanibulin ointment in People's Republic of China ( PRC\u201d or China\u201d), Hong Kong, and Macau, and $1.0 million in license revenue pursuant to the license agreement we entered into with PharmaEssentia to develop and commercialize Oral Paclitaxel, Oral Irinotecan, and Oral Docetaxel in Taiwan, Singapore, and Vietnam.\nCost of Sales\nCost of sales totaled $82.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, a decrease of $12.9 million, or 14%, as compared to $95.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. The decrease in our cost of APD product sales was in-line with the decrease in APD product revenue and was partially offset by increases in cost of sales related to the increases in 503B, Contract Manufacturing, and API product sales. In the year ended December 31, 2020, we incurred sublicense fees of $5.8 million on our license revenue, which did not occur in 2021.\nResearch and Development Expenses\nR&D expenses totaled $80.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, an increase of $4.3 million, or 6%, as compared to $75.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. This was primarily due to an increase in costs related to Oral Paclitaxel, drug licensing costs, cell therapy costs, and compensation, and included the following:\n\u2022$9.5 million increase in Oral Paclitaxel product development, API, and medical affairs costs associated with the potential product launch in 2021;\n\u2022$6.2 million increase in drug licensing costs, due to license payments for specialty pharmaceutical products, a license milestone payment related to Arginine deprivation therapy, and the repurchase of Orascovery rights from Xiangxue; and\n\u2022$4.4 million increase in cell therapy development costs.\nThe increase in these R&D expenses was partially offset by a decrease of $8.8 million in costs of clinical operations after completion of the Phase 3 studies for tirbanibulin ointment and Oral Paclitaxel, a decrease of $4.4 million in regulatory costs in connection with our NDA preparations, a decrease of $1.4 million in preclinical operations, a decrease of $0.7 million in research and development related compensation and a decrease of $0.5 million in costs of other product development.\nSelling, General and Administrative Expenses\nSelling, general, and administrative expenses totaled $72.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, a decrease of $20.3 million, or 22%, as compared to $92.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. This was primarily due to a $24.8 million decrease of costs for preparing to commercialize Oral Paclitaxel as significant pre-launch activities occurred in 2020 and slowed upon receipt of the Complete Response Letter in February 2021. In addition, we did not record a provision for credit losses in 2021, compared to provision for credit losses of $8.9 million from 2020. Compensation related costs decreased by $0.2 million in 2021 compared to 2020. These decreases were partially offset by a $4.2 million increase from the change in fair value of contingent consideration, a $5.9 million increase in operating costs including insurance costs, IT costs, other professional fees, and the costs to operate our manufacturing facility in Chongqing, China, and a $3.5 million increase in professional fees and other expenses related to the acquisition of Kuur.\nImpairments\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2021, we recognized goodwill impairment expense of $67.7 million and impairment of other intangible assets of $1.7 million. Of the total goodwill impairment, $26.6 million was related to the Global Supply Chain Platform reporting unit, representing a full impairment of the goodwill allocated to that reporting unit, and $41.1 million was related to the Oncology Innovation Platform reporting unit, representing a full impairment of the goodwill allocated to that reporting unit. Goodwill impairment is the excess of a reporting unit's carrying amount over its fair value. The decrease in our estimation of the reporting units' fair value was related to the Company's decision to no longer pursue regulatory approval for Oral Paclitaxel monotherapy for the treatment of mBC in the U.S. and the delays in the launch of products in our newly constructed manufacturing facilities. No such impairment was recorded during the year ended December 31, 2020.\nInterest Income and Interest Expense\nInterest income consisted of interest earned on our short-term investments and decreased by $0.6 million, or 74%, from 2020 to 2021 due a decrease in our short-term investment holdings during the year and a decrease in market rates for commercial paper, corporate bonds, and U.S. Treasury securities. Interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2021 totaled $20.7 million, an increase of $9.5 million, or 85%, as compared to $11.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, primarily due to increased borrowings. Interest expense in 2021 consisted of interest on borrowings under the Senior Credit Agreement with Oaktree while interest expense in 2020 included interest on borrowings under the credit agreement with Perceptive we entered into in June 2018, and the Senior Credit Agreement with Oaktree we entered into in June 2020 to repay in full the outstanding loan and fees under the credit agreement with Perceptive.\nLoss on Extinguishment of Debt\nWe recognized a $7.2 million loss on the extinguishment of debt related to the termination of the senior secured loan agreement with Perceptive and a $3.0 million loss on the partial extinguishment of debt related to the assignment of a portion of the senior secured loan from Oaktree's co-investors to Sagard during the year ended December 31, 2020. We did not incur loss on the extinguishment of debt during the year ended December 31, 2021.\nIncome Tax Expense\nFor the year ended December 31, 2021, income tax benefit amounted to $10.6 million, compared to income tax expense of $4.1 million for 2020. The income tax benefit in the current year is primarily the result of taxable temporary difference due to the deferred\ntax liability recognized for the indefinite lived intangible assets acquired in connection with the acquisition of Kuur's in-process research and development ( IPR&D\u201d). This taxable temporary difference is considered a source of taxable income to support the realization of deferred tax assets from the acquirer which resulted in a reversal of our valuation allowance. The income tax expense in the prior year was primarily attributable to foreign income tax withholdings on our revenue earned under our out-license arrangements.\nLoss from discontinued operations\nLoss from discontinued operations is comprised of operating results of the activities related to the build out of our manufacturing facility in Dunkirk, NY. This facility was sold in the first quarter of 2022. The increase in loss from discontinued operations was due to an increase in headcount and general costs necessary to prepare the Dunkirk facility for manufacturing operations. This increase was partially offset by income from a government grant in 2021, which consisted of a reimbursement of operating expenses received from New York State related to the preparation of the facility. Distributions by New York State under this arrangement in prior years were made for direct construction costs that were capital in nature and were not made to offset our operating expenses incurred in relation to such construction.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nCapital Resources\nSince our inception, we have incurred net losses and negative cash flows from our operations. Our cash requirement was primarily cash used for our R&D programs, SG&A costs associated with our operations, the development of our specialty drug operations in our Commercial Platform and 503B operations, and the investment we made in our pre-launch activities in anticipation of commercializing our proprietary drugs. We incurred net losses of $202.0 million, $148.4 million and $125.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019, respectively. As of December 31, 2021, we had an accumulated deficit of $913.4 million. Our operating activities from continuing operations used $138.3 million, $127.8 million and $97.0 million of cash during the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019, respectively. We intend to continue to advance our various clinical and pre-clinical programs which could lead to increased cash outflow of R&D costs. While we expect our R&D expenses to decrease overall, as the development of most non-Cell Therapy technologies has been suspended, R&D expenses related to our Cell Therapy platform are expected to increase as we prepare for additional clinical and preclinical studies for our Cell Therapy programs. We can provide no assurance that the funding requirements to diversify the product portfolio for specialty drug products in the Commercial Platform and 503B operations will decline in the future. Our principal sources of liquidity as of December 31, 2021 were cash and cash equivalents totaling $35.2 million, restricted cash of $16.5 million, held in a controlled bank account in connection with the Senior Credit Agreement with Oaktree, and short-term investments totaling $10.2 million, which are generally high-quality investment grade corporate debt securities.\nOur obligations under the Senior Credit Agreement are guaranteed by us and certain of our existing domestic subsidiaries and subsequently acquired or organized subsidiaries subject to certain exceptions. Our obligations under the Senior Credit Agreement and the related guarantees thereunder are secured, subject to customary permitted liens and other agreed upon exceptions, by (i) a pledge of all of the equity interests of our direct subsidiaries, and (ii) a perfected security interest in all of our tangible and intangible assets.\nThe Senior Credit Agreement contains customary representations and warranties and customary affirmative and negative covenants, including, among other things, restrictions on indebtedness, liens, investments, mergers, dispositions, prepayment of other indebtedness, and dividends and other distributions, subject to certain exceptions, including specific exceptions with respect to product commercialization and development activities. In addition, the Senior Credit Agreement contains certain financial covenants, including, among other things, maintenance of minimum liquidity and a minimum revenue test, measured quarterly until the last day of the second consecutive fiscal quarter where the consolidated leverage ratio does not exceed 4.5 to 1, provided that thereafter we cannot allow our consolidated leverage ratio to exceed 4.5 to 1, measured quarterly. Failure of the Company to comply with the financial covenants will result in an event of default, subject to certain cure rights of the Company. At December 31, 2021, we were in compliance with all applicable covenants.\nDebt and Equity Financings\nATM Financing\nOn August 20, 2021, we entered into a sales agreement with SVB Leerink LLC, in connection with the offer and sale of up to $100,000,000 of shares of our common stock, par value $0.001 per share, in an at-the-market offering (the ATM Offering\u201d). During the year ended December 31, 2021, we sold 762,825 shares of our common stock for an average price of $1.49 per share under the Sales Agreement.\nPublic Offering of Stock\nIn September 2020, we completed an underwritten public offering of 10,000,000 shares of our common stock. We granted the underwriters a 30-day option to purchase up to an additional 1,500,000 shares of common stock, which was exercised in full in\nSeptember 2020. All shares were offered at a price of $11.00 per share. Net proceeds were $118.7 million, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and offering expenses of $7.9 million.\nOaktree Senior Credit Agreement\nOn June 19, 2020 (the Closing Date\u201d), we entered into the Senior Credit Agreement to borrow up to $225.0 million in five tranches with a maturity date of June 19, 2026, bearing interest at a fixed annual rate of 11.0%, payable quarterly. We are required to make quarterly interest-only payments until June 19, 2022, after which we are required to make quarterly amortizing payments, with the remaining balance of the principal plus accrued and unpaid interest due at maturity. Since September 17, 2020, we have been required to pay a commitment fee on any undrawn commitments equal to 0.6% per annum, payable on each subsequent funding date and the commitment termination date. We are also required to pay an exit fee at maturity equal to 2.0% of the aggregate principal amount of the loans funded under the Senior Credit Agreement.\nThe first tranche of $100.0 million was drawn prior to June 30, 2020, with $54.1 million of the proceeds used in part to repay in full the outstanding loan and fees under the credit agreement with Perceptive and an additional $11.0 million of the upfront loan proceeds held by us as restricted cash in a debt service reserve account, and $6.4 million in fees and expenses incurred in connection with the financing, leaving $28.5 million in available proceeds from the first tranche. The second tranche of $25.0 million was drawn prior to September 30, 2020 and the third tranche of $25.0 million was drawn prior to December 31, 2020. Our ability to draw Tranches C and E of the Senior Credit Agreement was associated with the marketing approval and future sales of Oral Paclitaxel. These tranches were reduced to zero in connection with the amendment described below and are not available for future borrowing.\nWe are required to make mandatory prepayments of the senior secured loans with net cash proceeds from certain asset sales or insurance proceeds or condemnation awards, in each case, subject to certain exceptions and reinvestment rights. In connection with the sale of the Dunkirk Facility in February 2022, we entered into an amendment to the Senior Credit Agreement (the January Credit Agreement Amendment\u201d) whereby we were required to repay $25.0 million, or 62.5% of the proceeds from the sale, of the outstanding principal of the loan. In addition, on the date of closing the Dunkirk Transaction, we were required to pay (i) accrued and unpaid interest and (ii) a 7.0% fee, allocated as a 2.0% Exit Fee and a 5.0% Prepayment Fee (each as defined in the Senior Credit Agreement), on the principal amount being repaid. We were required to pay Oaktree an amendment fee of $0.3 million and certain related expenses. Further, the January Credit Agreement Amendment requires us to make an additional prepayment of $12.5 million in principal plus the costs and fees described above by June 14, 2022, within 120 days of the closing of the Dunkirk Transaction.\nWe may voluntarily prepay the Senior Credit Agreement at any time subject to a prepayment premium which up until June 19, 2022 is equal to the amount of interest that would have been paid up to, but not including, June 19, 2022 (excluding interest amounts already paid), plus 3.0% of the principal amount of the senior secured loans being repaid. Thereafter, the prepayment premium equals 3.0% of the principal amount of the senior secured loans being repaid and is reduced over time until June 19, 2024, after which no prepayment premium is required.\nOur obligations under the Senior Credit Agreement are guaranteed by us and certain of our existing domestic subsidiaries and subsequently acquired or organized subsidiaries subject to certain exceptions. Our obligations under the Senior Credit Agreement and the related guarantees thereunder are secured, subject to customary permitted liens and other agreed upon exceptions, by (i) a pledge of all of the equity interests of our direct subsidiaries, and (ii) a perfected security interest in all of our tangible and intangible assets.\nThe Senior Credit Agreement contains customary representations and warranties and customary affirmative and negative covenants, including, among other things, restrictions on indebtedness, liens, investments, mergers, dispositions, prepayment of other indebtedness, and dividends and other distributions, subject to certain exceptions, including specific exceptions with respect to product commercialization and development activities. In addition, the Senior Credit Agreement contains certain financial covenants, including, among other things, maintenance of minimum liquidity and a minimum revenue test, measured quarterly until the last day of the second consecutive fiscal quarter where the consolidated leverage ratio does not exceed 4.5 to 1, provided that thereafter we cannot allow our consolidated leverage ratio to exceed 4.5 to 1, measured quarterly. Failure of the Company to comply with the financial covenants will result in an event of default, subject to certain cure rights of the Company. At December 31, 2021, we were in compliance with all applicable covenants.\nThe Senior Credit Agreement contains events of default which are customary for financings of this type, in certain circumstances subject to customary cure periods. Following an event of default and any cure period, if applicable, Oaktree will have the right upon notice to terminate any undrawn commitments and may accelerate all amounts outstanding under the Senior Credit Agreement, in addition to other remedies available to it as a secured creditor of the Company.\nIn connection with our entry into the Senior Credit Agreement, we granted warrants to Oaktree to purchase up to an aggregate of 908,393 shares of our common stock at a purchase price of $12.63 per share. Under the January Credit Agreement Amendment, the warrants were amended to change the exercise price to be paid per share upon exercise of the warrants. The January Credit Agreement Amendment provides that the exercise price for 50% of the shares underlying the warrants will be $1.10 per share. The exercise price for the remaining 50% of the warrants was not changed by the January Credit Agreement Amendment.\nOutlook\nWe have borrowed and, in the future, may borrow additional capital from institutional and commercial banking sources to fund future growth. We may borrow additional funds on terms that may include restrictive covenants, including covenants that further restrict the operation of our business, liens on assets, high effective interest rates, financial performance covenants and repayment provisions that reduce cash resources and limit future access to capital markets. In addition, we expect to continue to opportunistically seek access to the equity capital markets to support our development efforts and operations. To the extent that we raise additional capital by issuing equity securities, our stockholders may experience substantial dilution. To the extent that we raise additional funds through collaboration or partnering arrangements or by monetizing non-core assets, we may be required to relinquish some of our rights to our technologies or rights to market and sell our products in certain geographies, grant licenses on terms that are not favorable to us, or issue equity that may be substantially dilutive to our stockholders.\nAs of December 31, 2021, we had cash and cash equivalents of $35.2 million, restricted cash of $16.5 million, and short-term investments of $10.2 million. We are implementing cost savings programs and plan to monetize non-core assets and raise capital in order to extend our cash runway in 2022. If we are unable to raise additional capital or monetize assets, we believe that the existing cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash, and short-term investments will not be sufficient to fund current operating plans through one year after the date that these audited consolidated financial statements are issued. We have concluded that this raises substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. See Part II, Item 8. Note 1-Company and Nature of Business for further information regarding our ability to continue as a going concern. We have based these estimates on assumptions that may prove to be wrong, and we could spend the available financial resources much faster than expected and need to raise additional funds sooner than anticipated. Although we plan to raise additional funds though the sale of non-core assets and selling equity securities, these plans are subject to market conditions which are outside of our control, and therefore cannot be deemed to be probable. There can be no assurance that additional financing, if available, can be obtained on terms acceptable to us. If we are unable to obtain such additional financing, we would need to reevaluate our future operating plans.\nWe anticipate that our expenses will cover the following activities as we:\n\u2022Advance the preclinical and clinical research program and development activities of our Cell Therapy technology platform;\n\u2022Continue our preclinical and clinical research program and development activities related to our Mission;\n\u2022Seek to identify additional research programs and product candidates within existing Cell Therapy platform; and\n\u2022Maintain, expand and protect our intellectual property ( IP\u201d) portfolio.\nWe have made certain changes to our budgeted expenses in light of the CRL for Oral Paclitaxel we received in February 2021 and the Type A meetings with the FDA, including curtailing commercialization expenses and investing in additional products for our specialty drug product business. However, our expenses could increase as we continue to fund clinical and preclinical development of our research programs by advancing our Cell Therapy programs, certain candidates in our pipeline, our specialty drug products, working capital and other general corporate purposes. Capital expenditure at the Sintaho facility may continue to grow and be significant as we build out the plant to manufacture Tirbanibulin APIs. We have based our estimates on assumptions that might prove to be wrong and we might use our available capital resources sooner than we currently expect. Because of the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with the development and commercialization of our drug candidates, we are unable to accurately estimate the amounts of increased capital outlays and operating expenditures necessary to complete the development and commercialization of our drug candidates.\nOur future capital requirements will depend on many factors, some or all of which may be impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, including:\n\u2022Our ability to generate revenue and profits from our Commercial Platform or otherwise;\n\u2022The costs, timing and outcome of regulatory reviews and approvals;\n\u2022Progress of our drug candidates to progress through clinical development successfully;\n\u2022The initiation, progress, timing, costs and results of nonclinical studies and clinical trials for our other programs and potential drug candidates;\n\u2022The costs of construction and fit-out of planned drug manufacture at our API manufacturing facility;\n\u2022The number and characteristics of the drug candidates we pursue;\n\u2022The costs of preparing, filing and prosecuting patent applications, maintaining and enforcing our IP rights and defending IP related claims;\n\u2022The extent to which we acquire or in-license other products and technologies; and\n\u2022Our ability to maintain and establish collaboration arrangements on favorable terms, if at all.\nUntil we can generate substantial product revenue, we expect to finance our cash needs through a combination of equity offerings, debt financings, collaborations, strategic alliances, licensing arrangements, and government grants. To the extent that we raise additional capital through the sale of equity or convertible debt securities, the ownership interest of our existing stockholders will be diluted, and the terms of these securities may include liquidation or other preferences that adversely affect rights of holders of common stock. Debt financing, if available, may involve agreements that include covenants limiting or restricting our ability to take specific actions, such as incurring additional debt, making capital expenditures or declaring dividends and might require the issuance of warrants, which could potentially dilute the ownership interest of holders of common stock. If we raise additional funds through collaborations, strategic alliances or licensing arrangements with third parties, we might have to relinquish valuable rights to our technologies, future revenue streams or research programs or to grant licenses on terms that might not be favorable to us. If we are unable to raise additional funds through equity or debt financings when needed, we might be required to delay, limit, reduce, or terminate our product development or future commercialization efforts or grant rights to develop and market products or drug candidates that we would otherwise prefer to develop and market ourselves.\nWe believe that the existing cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash, and short-term investments will not be sufficient to fund current operating plans through one year after the date that these audited consolidated financial statements are issued. Our estimates are based on relevant conditions that are known and reasonably knowable at the date of these consolidated financial statements being available for issuance and are subject to change due to changes in business, industry or macroeconomic conditions. Further, we do not expect to have access to additional capital under the Senior Credit Agreement. We have based these estimates on assumptions that may prove to be wrong, and we could spend the available financial resources much faster than expected and need to raise additional funds sooner than anticipated. To the extent that we raise additional capital by issuing equity securities, our stockholders may experience substantial dilution. To the extent that we raise additional funds through collaboration or partnering arrangements, we may be required to relinquish some of our rights to our technologies or rights to market and sell our products in certain geographies, grant licenses on terms that are not favorable to us, or issue equity that may be substantially dilutive to our stockholders.\nCash Flows\nThe following table provides information regarding our cash flows from continuing and discontinued operations for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019:\nTable 9: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Year ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2021\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2020\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Net cash used in operating activities from continuing operations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(138,271\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(127,758\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(96,981\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Net cash provided by (used in) investing activities from continuing operations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>119,927\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(114,338\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11,357\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Net cash provided by financing activities from continuing operations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,640\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>209,519\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>167,452\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Net cash used in discontinued operations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(19,229\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(8,211\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(4,337\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Net effect of foreign exchange rate changes\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>548\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(799\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>389\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Net (decrease) increase in cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(34,385\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(41,587\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>77,880\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nNet Cash Used in Operating Activities\nThe use of cash in all periods presented resulted primarily from our net losses adjusted for non-cash charges and changes in components of working capital. The primary use of our cash in all periods presented was to fund our R&D, regulatory and other clinical trial costs, drug licensing costs, inventory purchases, pre-launch commercialization activities, build-out of our manufacturing facilities, and other expenditures related to sales, marketing and administration. Our prepaid expenses and other current assets, accounts payable and accrued expense balances in all periods presented were affected by the timing of vendor invoicing and payments.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2021, operating activities from continuing operations used $138.3 million of cash, which resulted principally from our net loss from continuing operations of $194.3 million, adjusted for non-cash charges of $90.7 million, non-cash income benefit of $10.8 million related to the reversal of our valuation allowance on our deferred tax assets to offset the deferred tax liability assumed in connection with the acquisition of Kuur's IPR&D, and cash used by our operating assets and liabilities of $23.8 million. Our net non-cash charges during the year ended December 31, 2021 consisted of $69.4 million of impairment of goodwill and intangible assets, $9.2 million of stock-based compensation expense, $4.7 million depreciation and amortization expense, $4.2 million change in fair value of contingent consideration, $2.9 million amortization of debt discount, and $0.6 million write-off of deferred debt issuance costs related to the Revenue Interest Financing. Our operating assets increased $2.7 million for accounts receivable mainly related to the timing of revenues, decreased $4.1 million in prepaid expenses and other assets, and increased $5.9 million for inventory of all drug products. Our operating liabilities decreased by $19.2 million mainly due to a decrease in accrued wages and benefits, accrued construction costs for the Dunkirk, NY facility, accrued costs for potential product launch, accrued selling fees and rebates, and accrued interest, partially offset by an increase in deferred revenue. Net cash used in operating activities from discontinued operations in 2021 was $4.1 million, primarily related to the operating expenses incurred by the activities at the Dunkirk facility.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2020, operating activities from continuing operations used $127.8 million of cash, which resulted principally from our net loss from continuing operations of $144.4 million, adjusted for non-cash charges of $37.2 million. Cash used by our operating assets and liabilities was $20.5 million primarily due to increases in accounts receivable and a decrease in accrued expenses. Our net non-cash charges during the year ended December 31, 2020 primarily consisted of $10.9 million of stock-based compensation, $10.3 million of loss on extinguishment of debt, $9.5 million provision for expected credit losses, $4.5 million of depreciation and amortization, and $1.8 million of amortization of debt discount. Net cash used in operating activities from discontinued operations in 2020 was $3.5 million, related to the operations at the Dunkirk facility.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2019, operating activities from continuing operations used $97.0 million of cash, which resulted principally from our net loss of $125.0 million, adjusted for non-cash charges of $15.4 million. Cash provided by our operating assets and liabilities was $12.6 million primarily due to increases in accounts payable and accrued expenses. Our net non-cash charges during the year ended December 31, 2019 primarily consisted of $3.8 million in depreciation and amortization expense, $9.9 million in stock-based compensation expense, and $1.0 million in amortization of debt discount. Net cash used in operating activities from discontinued operations in 2019 was $0.5 million, related to the operations at the Dunkirk facility.\nNet Cash (Used in) Provided by Investing Activities\nIn 2021, cash provided by investing activities of continuing operations of $119.9 million was primarily attributable to $128.9 million in the sale and maturity of short-term investments, net of purchases, $8.4 million in purchasing property and equipment for continuing operations, primarily, our Sintaho facility, and $2.1 million in payments for licenses, partially offset by cash received from the acquisition of Kuur of $1.4 million. Net cash used in investing activities of discontinued operations in 2021 was $14.9 million, related to purchasing property and equipment at the Dunkirk facility.\nIn 2020, cash used in investing activities of continuing operations of $114.3 million was primarily attributable to $105.5 million in purchases of short-term investments, net of sales and maturities, $8.6 million in purchasing property and equipment for continuing operations $0.2 million in payment for licenses. Net cash used in investing activities of discontinued operations in 2020 was $4.6 million, related to purchasing property and equipment at the Dunkirk facility.\nIn 2019, cash provided by investing activities of continuing operations of $11.4 million was primarily attributable to $24.4 million in sale and maturity of short-term investments, net of purchases, and $0.9 million provided by the acquisition of CIDAL, offset by $9.7 million in purchasing property and equipment for continuing operations, and $4.2 million in payment for licenses. Net cash used in investing activities of discontinued operations in 2019 was $3.9 million, related to purchasing property and equipment at the Dunkirk facility.\nNet Cash Provided by Financing Activities\nIn 2021, cash provided by financing activities of continuing operations was $2.6 million, which primarily consisted of the proceeds from the exercise of stock options of $1.6 million, proceeds from the sale of shares in the ATM Offering of $1.3 million in December, and proceeds from the issuance of debt of $0.8 million, partially offset by the repayment of long-term debt and finance lease obligations of $1.0 million. Net cash used in financing activities of discontinued operations in 2021 was $0.2 million, related to the repayment of finance lease obligations.\nIn 2020, cash provided by financing activities of continuing operations was $209.5 million, which primarily consisted of $127.0 million from the sale of common stock and $143.0 million from the draw downs of debt from our Senior Credit Agreement with Oaktree and $2.1 million to fund our new API plant in China, $7.0 million from the issuance of warrants to Oaktree and Sagard, and $1.7 million from the exercise of stock options, partially offset by $54.3 million repayment of the Perceptive loan and other long-term debt, and $7.9 million and $9.4 million issuance costs related to sale of our common stock in our underwritten follow-on public offering and the issuance of the new Oaktree debt and warrants to Oaktree and Sagard, respectively. Net cash used in financing activities of discontinued operations in 2020 was $0.1 million, related to the repayment of finance lease obligations.\nIn 2019, cash provided by financing activities of continuing operations was $167.5 million, which primarily consisted of net proceeds of $161.1 million from the issuance of our common stock mostly from private placements, net of offering expenses of approximately $1.1 million, and $6.5 million from the issuance of debt to fund our new API plant in China, offset by $1.0 million repayment of debt and finance lease obligations.\nIndebtedness\nWe had $157.7 million and $157.8 million of debt as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. As of December 31, 2021 and 2020, this primarily consisted of the Senior Credit Agreement entered into with Oaktree during 2020, and a credit agreement with Chongqing Maliu Riverside Development and Investment Co., LTD, and finance and operating lease obligations.\nIn 2020, we entered into a Senior Credit Agreement with Oaktree to borrow up to $225.0 million in five tranches with a maturity date of June 19, 2026, bearing interest at a fixed annual rate of 11.0%, payable quarterly. We have drawn three tranches amounting to $150.0 million; the remaining two tranches totaling $75.0 million were reduced to zero in connection with the January Credit Agreement Amendment in February 2022. We are required to make quarterly interest-only payments until June 19, 2022, after which we are also required to make quarterly amortizing payments, with the remaining balance of the principal plus accrued and unpaid interest due at maturity. Since September 17, 2020, we have been required to pay a commitment fee on any undrawn commitments equal to 0.6% per annum, payable on each subsequent funding date and the commitment termination date. We are also required to pay an exit fee at maturity equal to 2.0% of the aggregate principal amount of the loans funded under the Senior Credit Agreement. Upon closing of the Dunkirk Transaction in February 2022, we repaid $25.0 million of the outstanding principal, plus any unpaid and accrued interest, plus the 2.0% exit fee and the 5.0% prepayment fee pursuant to the January Credit Agreement Amendment.\nIn 2019, we entered into a credit agreement which amended the existing partnership agreement with Chongqing Maliu Riverside Development and Investment Co., LTD ( CQ\u201d), for a Renminbi \u00a550.0 million (USD $7.2 million at December 31, 2019) line of credit to be used for the construction of the new API plant in China. We are required to repay the principal amount with accrued interest within three years after the plant receives the cGMP certification, with 20% of the total loan with accrued interest is due within the first twelve months following receiving the certification, 30% of the total loan with accrued interest due within twenty-four months, and the remaining balance with accrued interest due within thirty-six months. Interest accrues at the three-year loan interest rate by the People's Bank of China for the same period on the date of the deposit of the full loan amount, which is expected to approximate 4.75% annually. If we fail to obtain the cGMP certification within three years upon the completion and acceptance of the plant, we shall return all renovation costs with the accrued interest to CQ, in a single transaction within the first ten business days of the next day. If we fail to obtain the cGMP certification within three years of the acceptance of the plant, we are required to return all renovation costs with accrued interest to CQ within ten business days. As of December 31, 2021, the balance due to CQ was $7.8 million.\nCapital Expenditures\nOur liquidity position and capital requirements are subject to a number of factors. For example, our cash inflow and outflow may be impacted by the following:\n\u2022Our ability to generate revenue;\n\u2022Our ability to improve margins on our commercial products;\n\u2022Fluctuations in working capital; and\n\u2022Our ability to raise additional funds.\nOur primary short-term capital needs, which are subject to change, include expenditures related to:\n\u2022Continuous support of the development and research of our proprietary drug products;\n\u2022Build out of our new API plant in China and improvements in our existing manufacturing capacity and efficiency;\n\u2022New research and product development efforts; and\n\u2022Support of our commercialization efforts related to our current and future products.\nAlthough we believe the foregoing items reflect our most likely uses of cash in the short term, we cannot predict with certainty all of our short-term cash uses or the timing or amounts of cash used. If cash generated from operations is insufficient to satisfy our working capital and capital expenditure requirements, we may be required to sell additional equity or debt securities or obtain credit financing. This capital may not be available on satisfactory terms, if at all. Furthermore, any additional equity financing may be dilutive to our stockholders, and debt financing, if available, may include restrictive covenants.\nContractual Obligations\nA summary of our contractual obligations as of December 31, 2021 is as follows:\nTable 10: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Payments Due by Period\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Less than 1\nyear\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1 to 3 years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3 to 5 years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>More than\n5 years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Amounts\nCommitted\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Operating leases\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,020\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>4,218\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,819\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>132\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>9,189\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Long-term debt\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>47,507\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>25,811\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>89,377\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>162,695\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Finance lease obligations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>159\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>207\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>366\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>License fees\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>916\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>400\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,316\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>51,602\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>30,636\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>91,196\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>132\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>173,566\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOur operating and finance leases are principally for facilities and equipment. We currently lease office space in the U.S. and foreign countries to support our operations as a global organization. The operating leases in the above table include our several locations with the amounts committed by each location: (1) the rental of our global headquarters in the Conventus Center for Collaborative Medicine in Buffalo, NY; (2) the rental of our research and development facility in the IC Development Centre in Hong Kong; (3) the rental of the Commercial Platform headquarters in Chicago, IL; (4) the rental of our clinical research headquarters in Cranford, NJ; (5) the rental of our clinical data management center in Taipei, Taiwan; (6) the rental of our contract research organization throughout Latin America; (7) the rental of our Global Supply Chain distribution office in Houston, TX; (8) the rental of our Global Supply Chain API manufacturing facility in Chongqing, China; and (9) the rental of other facilities and equipment located mainly in Buffalo, NY. These locations represent $4.6 million, $0.1 million, $1.6 million, $0.2 million, $0.2 million, $0.1 million, $0.2 million, $0.4 million, and $1.7 million, respectively, of the total amounts committed. In addition to the minimum rental commitments on our operating leases we may also be required to pay amounts for taxes, insurance, maintenance and other operating expenses.\nThe long-term debt includes our senior secured loan and the credit agreement with CQ. The finance lease obligations represent three leases of equipment in our 503B manufacturing facility outside of Buffalo, NY. The license fees in the above table represent the amount committed and accrued under in-license agreements for specialty drug products by the Commercial platform.\nIn addition, we have certain obligations under licensing arrangements with third parties contingent upon achieving various development, regulatory, and commercial milestones. Pursuant to our purchase agreement of Kuur Therapeutics, we may be required to make payments worth up to $115.0 million, payable in cash of shares of our common stock, upon the occurrence of certain development and regulatory milestones related to our NKT cell therapy. Pursuant to our license agreement with Polytom, we may be required to make payments worth up to $44.0 million of our common stock or cash upon the occurrence of certain regulatory milestones related to a pegylated genetically modified human arginase, and make royalty payments representing a percentage of net sales of the licensed products. Pursuant to our license agreement with Avalon HepaPOC, we may be required to make payments worth up to $4.8 million of our common stock or cash upon the occurrence of certain regulatory and sales milestones related to the meter and strips for conduct of liver function tests in humans taking our oncology drugs and make royalty payments representing a percentage of aggregate net sales of the licensed product. Pursuant to the license agreement with XLifeSc, our 55% owned joint venture Axis Therapeutics Limited, we may be required to make cash payments worth up to $108.0 million upon the occurrence of certain regulatory milestones related to XLifeSc's proprietary TCR-T technology, and make royalty payments representing a percentage of aggregate net income generated by sales of licensed products. Pursuant to our license agreements with Hanmi, we may be required to make equity payments of $24.0 million upon regulatory approval of a product within the Orasovery platform and make tiered royalty payments based on net sales of any product using the licensed intellectual property. These amounts are not included in the table above.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Significant Judgments and Estimates\nOur discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of our financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the periods. We evaluate our estimates and judgments on an ongoing basis, including but not limited to, estimating the useful lives of long-lived assets, assessing the impairment of long-lived assets, stock-based compensation expenses, and the realizability of deferred income tax assets. We base our estimates on historical experience, known trends and events, contractual milestones and other various factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Changes in the accounting estimates are likely to occur from period to period. Actual results could be significantly different from these estimates. We believe that the accounting policies discussed below are critical to understanding our historical and future performance, as these policies relate to the more significant areas involving management's judgment and estimates.\nRevenue Recognition\n1.Oncology Innovation Platform\nThe Company out-licenses certain of its IP to other pharmaceutical companies in specific territories that allow the customer to use, develop, commercialize, or otherwise exploit the licensed IP. In accordance with ASC 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers ( Topic 606\u201d), the Company analyzes the contracts to identify its performance obligations within the contract. Most of the Company's out-license arrangements contain multiple performance obligations and variable pricing. After the performance obligations are identified, the Company determines the transaction price, which generally includes upfront fees, milestone payments related to the achievement of developmental, regulatory, or commercial goals, and royalty payments on net sales of licensed products. The Company considers whether the transaction price is fixed or variable, and whether such consideration is subject to return. Variable consideration is only included in the transaction price to the extent that it is probable that a significant reversal in the amount of cumulative revenue recognized will not occur when the uncertainty associated with the variable consideration is subsequently resolved. If any portion of the transaction price is constrained, it is excluded from the transaction price until the constraint no longer exists. The Company then allocates the transaction price to the performance obligation to which the consideration is related. Where a portion of the transaction price is received and allocated to continuing performance obligations under the terms of the arrangement, it is recorded as deferred revenue and recognized as revenue when (or as) the underlying performance obligation is satisfied.\nThe Company's contracts may contain one or multiple promises, including the license of IP and development services. The licensed IP related to the Company's approved and late-stage drug candidates is capable of being distinct from the other performance obligations identified in the contract and is distinct within the context of the contract, as upon transfer of the IP, the customer is able to use and benefit from it, and the customer could obtain the development services from other parties. The Company also considers the economic and regulatory characteristics of the licensed IP and other promises in the contract to determine if it is a distinct performance obligation. The Company considers if the IP is modified or enhanced by other performance obligations through the life of the agreement and whether the customer is contractually or practically required to use updated IP. The IP licensed by the Company has been determined to be functional IP. The IP is not modified during the license period and therefore, the Company recognizes revenues from any portion of the transaction price allocated to the licensed IP when the license is transferred to the customer and they can benefit from the right to use the IP. The Company recognized $0.5 million in license revenue from an out-license arrangement for the year ended December 31, 2021, and $37.7 million in license revenue, net of $2.3 million value added tax ( VAT\u201d), and $1.0 million in license revenue from two of the Company's out-license arrangements for the year ended December 31, 2020. The Company recognized revenue allocated to the licensed IP performance obligation upon transfer of the license of $0.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. During the year ended December 31, 2021, the Company received $2.0 million in upfront fees for a license of TRC-T technology, which was deemed not to be distinct, as the IP is in an early stage and is dependent on development activities to be performed by the Company, and $0.7 million for licenses of Klisyri in territories in which it is not yet approved and further development activities are required to be performed by the Company. Therefore these licenses of IP and the development services were considered a bundled performance obligation. As of December 31, 2021, this bundle of performance obligations was not satisfied and the corresponding $2.7 million was recorded as deferred revenue on the Company's consolidated balance sheet.\nOther performance obligations included in most of the Company's out-licensing agreements include performing development services to reach clinical and regulatory milestone events. The Company satisfies these performance obligations at a point-in-time, because the customer does not simultaneously receive and consume the benefits as the development occurs, the development does not create or enhance an asset controlled by the customer, and the development does not create an asset with no alternative use. The Company considers milestone payments to be variable consideration measured using the most likely amount method, as the entitlement to the consideration is contingent on the occurrence or nonoccurrence of future events. The Company allocates each variable milestone payment to the associated milestone performance obligation, as the variable payment relates directly to the Company's efforts to satisfy the performance obligation and such allocation depicts the amount of consideration to which the\nCompany expects to be entitled for satisfying the corresponding performance obligation. The Company re-evaluates the probability of achievement of such performance obligations and any related constraint and adjusts its estimate of the transaction price as appropriate. To date, no amounts have been constrained in the initial or subsequent assessments of the transaction price. The Company did not recognize revenue from other performance obligations included in the Company's out-licensing agreements during the years ended December 31, 2021 or 2020. The Company recognized revenue allocated to development performance obligations upon transfer to the customer of $20.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2019.\nCertain out-license agreements include performance obligations to manufacture and provide drug product in the future for commercial sale when the licensed product is approved. For the commercial, sales-based royalties, the consideration is predominantly related to the licensed IP and is contingent on the customer's subsequent sales to another commercial customer. Consequently, the sales- or usage-based royalty exception would apply. Revenue will be recognized for the commercial, sales-based milestones as the underlying sales occur. The Company recognized $25.0 million in commercial milestones and $1.0 million in royalties during the year ended December 31, 2021. No such revenues were recorded during 2020.\nThe Company exercises significant judgment when identifying distinct performance obligations within its out-license arrangements, determining the transaction price, which often includes both fixed and variable considerations, and allocating the transaction price to the proper performance obligation. The Company did not use any other significant judgments related to out-licensing revenue during the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020.\n2.Global Supply Chain Platform\nThe Company's Global Supply Chain Platform manufactures API for use internally in its research and development activities as well as its clinical studies, and for sale to pharmaceutical customers globally. The Company generates additional revenue on this platform, by providing small to mid-scale cGMP manufacturing of clinical and commercial products for pharmaceutical and biotech companies and selling pharmaceutical products under 503B regulations set forth by the U.S. FDA.\nRevenue earned by the Global Supply Platform is recognized when the Company has satisfied its performance obligation, which is the shipment or the delivery of drug products. The underlying contracts for these sales are generally purchase orders and the Company recognizes revenue at a point-in-time. Any remaining performance obligations related to product sales are the result of customer deposits and are reflected in the deferred revenue contract liability balance.\n3.Commercial Platform\nThe Company's Commercial Platform generates revenue by distributing specialty products through independent pharmaceutical wholesalers. The wholesalers then sell to an end-user, normally a hospital, alternative healthcare facility, or an independent pharmacy, at a lower price previously established by the end-user and the Company. Upon the sale by the wholesaler to the end-user, the wholesaler will chargeback the difference, if any, between the original list price and price at which the product was sold to the end-user. The Company also offers cash discounts, which approximate 2.3% of the gross sales price, as an incentive for prompt customer payment, and, consistent with industry practice, the Company's return policy permits customers to return products within a window of time before and after the expiration of product dating. Further, the Company offers contractual allowances, generally in the form of rebates or administrative fees, to certain wholesale customers, group purchasing organizations ( GPOs\u201d), and end-user customers, consistent with pharmaceutical industry practices. Revenues are recorded net of provisions for variable consideration, including discounts, rebates, GPO allowances, price adjustments, returns, chargebacks, promotional programs and other sales allowances. Accruals for these provisions are presented in the consolidated financial statements as reductions in determining net sales and as a contra asset in accounts receivable, net (if settled via credit) and other current liabilities (if paid in cash). As of December 31, 2021 and 2020, the Company's total provision for chargebacks and other deductions included as a reduction of accounts receivable totaled $22.9 million and $12.6 million, respectively. The Company's total provision for chargebacks and other revenue deductions was $129.0 million, $89.3 million, and $87.2 million for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019, respectively.\nThe Company exercises significant judgment in its estimates of the variable transaction price at the time of the sale and recognizes revenue when the performance obligation is satisfied. Factors that determine the final net transaction price include chargebacks, fees for service, cash discounts, rebates, returns, warranties, and other factors. The Company estimates all of these variables based on historical data obtained from previous sales finalized with the end-user customer on a product-by-product basis. At the time of sale, revenue is recorded net of each of these deductions. Through the normal course of business, the wholesaler will sell the product to the end-user, determining the actual chargeback, return products, and take advantage of cash discounts, charge fees for services, and claim warranties on products. The final transaction price per product is compared to the initial estimated net sale price and reviewed for accuracy. The final prices and other factors are immediately included in the Company's historical data from which it will estimate the transaction price for future sales. The underlying contracts for these sales are generally purchase orders including a single performance obligation, generally the shipment or delivery of products and the Company recognizes this revenue at a point-in-time.\nResearch and Development Expenses\nResearch and development expenses represent costs associated with developing our proprietary drug candidates, our collaboration agreements for such drugs, and our ongoing clinical studies.\nClinical trial costs are a significant component of our research and development expenses. We have a history of contracting with third parties that perform various clinical trial activities on our behalf in the ongoing development of our drug candidates. Expenses related to clinical trials are accrued based on our estimates of the actual services performed by the third parties for the respective period. If the contracted amounts are revised or the scope of a contract is revised, we will modify the accruals accordingly on a prospective basis and will do so in the period in which the facts that give rise to the revision become reasonably certain.\nGoodwill\nThe Company tests goodwill for impairment annually on October 1st, the Company's annual goodwill impairment measurement date, or more frequently if a triggering event occurs, and it updates its test with information that becomes available through the end of the period reported. The Company has three operating segments, each of which represents a separate reporting unit: Oncology Innovation Platform, Commercial Platform, and Global Supply Chain Platform. Each of the three reporting units has discrete financial information that is reviewed by segment managers. Goodwill was assigned to two reporting units: Oncology Innovation Platform and Global Supply Chain Platform. Goodwill impairment exists when the fair value of goodwill is less than its carrying value. The Company determined that an impairment triggering event occurred during the first quarter of 2021 and, consistent with our annual policy, performed a test as of our annual goodwill impairment evaluation date, October 1, 2021, subsequently updating that analysis to December 31, 2021 using new information that became available regarding conditions that existed as of December 31, 2021, and concluded that there was goodwill impairment of $67.7 million for the three months ended December 31, 2021. No impairment of goodwill was recorded for the years ended December 31, 2020, and 2019. See Part II, Item 8, Note 8 - Goodwill and Intangible Assets, Net, and Note 9 -Fair Value Measurements, for additional information.\nIntangible Assets, net\nIntangible assets arising from a business acquisition are recognized at fair value as of the acquisition date. The Company amortizes intangible assets using the straight-line method. When the straight-line method of amortization is utilized, the estimated useful life of the intangible asset is shortened to assure the recognition of amortization expense corresponds with the expected cash flows. Other purchased intangibles, including certain licenses, are capitalized at cost and amortized on a straight-line basis over the license life, when a future economic benefit is probable and measurable. If a future economic benefit is not probable or measurable, the license costs are expensed as incurred within research and development expenses. In-process research and development (\"IPR&D\") intangible assets are not amortized, but rather are reviewed for impairment on an annual basis or more frequently if indicators of impairment are present, until the project is completed, abandoned, or transferred to a third party.\nImpairment of Long-Lived Assets\nThe Company reviews the recoverability of its long-lived assets, excluding goodwill, when events or changes in circumstances occur that indicate that the carrying value of the asset may not be recoverable. The assessment of possible impairment is based on the ability to recover the carrying value of the assets from the expected future cash flows (undiscounted and without interest expense) of the related operations. If these cash flows are less than the carrying value of such assets, an impairment loss for the difference between the estimated fair value and carrying value is recorded. The Company determined that impairment indicators occurred during the first and fourth quarters of 2021 and concluded that there was impairment of intangible assets other than goodwill amounting to $1.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. See Part II, Item 8, Note 8 - Goodwill and Intangible Assets, net for additional details.\nBusiness Acquisitions\nThe Company accounts for acquired businesses using the acquisition method of accounting, which requires that assets acquired and liabilities assumed be recognized at their estimated fair values as of the acquisition date. Identifiable amortizing intangible assets are recorded on the consolidated balance sheet at fair value and amortized over their estimated useful lives. Acquisition-related costs are expensed as incurred. Any excess of the consideration transferred over the estimated fair values of the net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill.\nContingent Consideration\nContingent consideration arising from a business acquisition is included as part of the purchase price and is recorded at fair value as of the acquisition date. Subsequent to the acquisition date, the Company remeasures contingent consideration arrangements at fair value at each reporting period until the contingency is resolved. The changes in fair value are recognized within selling, general,\nand administrative expenses in the Company's consolidated statement of operations and comprehensive loss. Changes in fair values reflect new information about the likelihood of the payment of the contingent consideration and the passage of time.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nIn the normal course of business, we evaluate all new accounting pronouncements issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board, SEC, or other authoritative accounting bodies to determine the potential impact they may have on our Consolidated Financial Statements. Refer to Note 2 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Item 8 of this report for additional information about these recently issued accounting standards and their potential impact on our financial condition or results of operations.", "item_7_text": "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nThe following discussion contains management's discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations and should be read together with the historical consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto included in Part II, Item 8 Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\u201d This discussion contains forward-looking statements that reflect our plans, estimates and beliefs and involve numerous risks and uncertainties, including but not limited to those described in the Risk Factors\u201d section of this Annual Report. Actual results may differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statements. You should carefully read Special Note About Forward-Looking Statements\u201d and Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors.\u201d\nOverview and Recent Developments\nWe are a biopharmaceutical company dedicated to becoming a leader in the discovery, development and commercialization of next generation drugs for the treatment of cancer. Our mission is to improve the lives of cancer patients by creating more effective, safer and tolerable treatments. We have assembled a strong and experienced leadership team and have established operations across the pharmaceutical value chain to execute our goal of becoming a global leader in bringing innovative cancer treatments to the market and improving health outcomes.\nWe are organized around three operating segments: (1) our Oncology Innovation Platform, dedicated to the research and development of our proprietary drugs; (2) our Commercial Platform, focused on the sales and marketing of our specialty drugs and the market development of our proprietary drugs; and (3) our Global Supply Chain Platform, dedicated to providing a stable and efficient supply of active pharmaceutical ingredients ( API\u201d) for our clinical and commercial efforts. Our current clinical pipeline in the Oncology Innovation Platform is derived from the following core technologies: (1) Cell Therapy, (2) Orascovery, based on a P-glycoprotein ( P-gp\u201d) pump inhibitor, and (3) Src Kinase Inhibition.\nOncology Innovation Platform Developments\nThrough our acquisition of Kuur Therapeutics, Inc. (formerly known as Cell Medica, Kuur\u201d) in 2021, we acquired rights to intellectual property to further the development of autologous and allogeneic, or off-the-shelf\u201d, natural killer T ( NKT\u201d) cell immunotherapies for the treatment of solid and hematological malignancies. We are advancing the following product candidates: KUR-501, KUR-502, and KUR-503.\nKUR-501 is an autologous product in which NKT cells are engineered with a chimeric antigen receptor ( CAR\u201d) targeting GD2 ( GINAKIT\u201d cells). GD2 is expressed on almost all neuroblastoma tumors and certain other malignancies. KUR-501 is currently being evaluated in a phase 1 clinical trial (GINAKIT2) treating children with relapsed-refractory ( R/R\u201d) high risk neuroblastoma. In May 2021, we presented an interim data update from the first eleven evaluable patients at the American Society of Gene & Cell Therapy ( ASGCT\u201d). During this initial evaluation, the safety profile of KUR-501 was manageable, and there was no dose limiting toxicity ( DLT\u201d). No patients experienced grade 2 or higher toxicities related to KUR-501. There were no grades 3-5 cytokine release syndrome ( CRS\u201d) and no evidence of immune effector cell-associated neurotoxicity syndrome ( ICANS\u201d) in any of the patients. Grades 3-4 adverse events ( AEs\u201d), reported regardless of relationship to KUR-501, have included anemia, leukopenia, lymphopenia, neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, abdominal distension, acute gastroenteritis, liver enzyme increase, vomiting, bone pain, headache, neck pain, fever, urinary tract infection, altered mental status, and hypoxia. As this clinical development program is still in the early stages, we do not yet have meaningful statistics on safety, including AEs, to report. Observed responses included one complete response ( CR\u201d) and one partial response ( PR\u201d). Four additional patients have exhibited stable disease ( SD\u201d). We also observed long-term persistence of NKT cells expressing CAR. Importantly, we observed NKT cell localization to the tumor site.\nKUR-502 is an allogeneic ( off-the-shelf\u201d) product in which NKT cells are engineered with a CAR targeting CD19. KUR-502 is currently being evaluated in a phase 1 clinical trial (ANCHOR) treating adults with R/R CD19 positive malignancies, including B cell lymphoma, acute lymphoblastic leukemia ( ALL\u201d), and chronic lymphocytic leukemia ( CLL\u201d). In December 2021, we presented an interim data update on the first five evaluable patients at the American Society of Hematology ( ASH\u201d) annual meeting. Tumor biopsies showed presence of NKT cells expressing CARs in the disease sites, indicating that the KUR-502 cells are able to traffic to the tumor. The safety profile was manageable with no DLT. There was one case of grade 1 CRS, no ICANS, and no graft versus host disease ( GvHD\u201d) attributable to KUR-502. Grades 3-4 AEs, reported regardless of relationship to KUR-502, have included lymphopenia, leukopenia, neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, liver enzyme elevation, bilirubin elevation, anemia, diarrhea, hypoalbuminemia, and myositis. As this clinical development program is still in the early stages, we do not yet have meaningful statistics on safety, including AEs, to report. Of the first five evaluable patients, the overall response rate was 80%, and the complete response rate was 60%.\nKUR-503 is an allogeneic ( off-the-shelf\u201d) product in which NKT cells are engineered with a CAR targeting glypican-3 ( GPC3\u201d). GPC3 is a molecule that is highly expressed on most hepatocellular carcinomas ( HCC\u201d) but not normal liver or other non-neoplastic tissue. KUR-503 is currently in preclinical development, and we are planning to submit an IND by the first half of 2023.\nPursuant to the terms of the Merger Agreement, we paid $70.0 million upfront to Kuur shareholders and its former employees and directors, comprised primarily of shares of our common stock. Additionally, Kuur shareholders and its former employees and\ndirectors are eligible to receive up to $115.0 million of milestone payments, which may be paid, at the Company's sole discretion, in either cash or additional common stock of the Company, or a combination of both. The Company identified the Merger as a business combination pursuant to ASC 805 and used the acquisition method of accounting to account for the transaction. The purchase price, after adjusted for closing conditions, consisted of 14,228,066 shares of the Company's common stock issued at $3.71 per share with a fair value of $52.8 million, plus the fair value of the future milestone payments amounting to $19.8 million, recorded as contingent consideration. For additional information, please see Part II, Item 8, Note 3-Business Combination.\u201d\nWe continue to advance TCR affinity-enhancing specific T-cell ( TAEST\u201d) therapy with our drug candidate, TCRT-ESO-A2. TCRT-ESO-A2 is an autologous T cell receptor ( TCR\u201d)-T cell therapy targeting solid tumors that are NY-ESO-1 positive in HLA-A*02:01 positive patients. A phase 1 clinical trial treating adults with advanced solid tumors expressing NY-ESO-1 is currently open enrolling.\nOn February 26, 2021, we received a Complete Response Letter (\"CRL\") from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration ( FDA\u201d) regarding our New Drug Application ( NDA\u201d) for oral paclitaxel and encequidar ( Oral Paclitaxel\u201d) for the treatment of metastatic breast cancer ( mBC\u201d). Following the CRL, we held two Type A meetings with the FDA to discuss the deficiencies raised in the CRL, review a proposed design for a new clinical trial intended to address the deficiencies raised in the CRL, and discuss the potential regulatory path forward for Oral Paclitaxel in mBC in the U.S. In October 2021, after careful consideration of the FDA feedback, we determined to redeploy our resources to focus on other ongoing studies of Oral Paclitaxel and our Cell Therapy platform. On November 29, 2021, we announced the U.K. Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency ( MHRA\u201d) validation of the Marketing Authorization Application ( MAA\u201d) for Oral Paclitaxel, for review. The Phase 3 study of Oral Paclitaxel in mBC (KX-ORAX-001) served as the basis of the MAA.\nWe are continuing to evaluate Oral Paclitaxel in combination with check point inhibitors. The development of our other Orascovery product candidates, including oral irinotecan and encequidar ( Oral Irinotecan\u201d), oral docetaxel and encequidar ( Oral Docetaxel\u201d), oral topotecan and encequidar ( Oral Topotecan\u201d), and oral eribulin and encequidar ( Oral Eribulin\u201d) has been suspended at this time.\nOn February 18, 2021, our partner Almirall (Almirall, S.A., BME: ALM) launched Klisyri\u00ae (tirbanibulin ointment) for actinic keratosis (AK) in the US. On September 27, 2021, we announced Almirall launched Klisyri in Germany and the UK, as part of a phased European launch, after receiving approval from the European Commission in July 2021 and the UK MHRA in August 2021, for Klisyri indicated for the topical treatment of AK of the face or scalp in adults. The launch of Klisyri in the U.S. resulted in a milestone payment of $20.0 million pursuant to our 2017 out-license agreement with Almirall, recognized as revenue in the first quarter of 2021, and the launch in Europe resulted in a milestone payment of $5.0 million, recognized as revenue in the third quarter of 2021.\nOn February 15, 2021, we entered into the Second Amendment to the 2011 license agreement with PharmaEssentia Corp. ( PharmaEssentia\u201d) for tirbanibulin ointment. The Second Amendment expands the territory to include Japan and South Korea and includes a license to use the intellectual property for additional dermatology indications and skin cancer in the existing territories. On July 26, 2021, we announced that we entered into licensing agreements and strategic partnerships with Seqirus Pty Ltd ( Seqirus\u201d), a subsidiary of CSL Limited, and AVIR Pharma Inc. ( AVIR\u201d) for tirbanibulin. Under the terms of the agreements, Seqirus will have an exclusive license to commercialize tirbanibulin in Australia and New Zealand, and AVIR will have an exclusive license to commercialize tirbanibulin in Canada.\nWith respect to Arginine Deprivation therapy, the enrollment of the Phase 1 trial of PT01 for the treatment of patients with advanced malignancies has been suspended, and no further studies are planned at this time.\nCommercial and Global Supply Chain Platform Developments\nWe suspended production activities at our Taihao API facility in Chongqing, China, in May 2019, based on concerns raised by the Department of Emergency Management of Chongqing ( DEMC\u201d) related to the location of our plant. We subsequently resumed producing API at the Taihao API facility primarily for our ongoing clinical studies and commercial launches of proprietary drugs in accordance with local regulatory guidance, while we started building out Sintaho, a new API facility in Chongqing. In July 2021, we received verbal notice from the DEMC that we will be required to terminate the production activities at its Taihao API facility. We are continuing to engage in dialogue with the DEMC. While we are able to continue producing certain API at the Taihao API facility in limited quantities and a certain extent of our operations are now being conducted at Sintaho, we are in the process of moving the remainder of the operations and production activities to Sintaho and exploring other sources of API, in the event we are unable to reach an agreement with the DEMC for the continued production activities of the Taihao API facility.\nOn October 1, 2021, we entered into a lease agreement with Fort Schuyler Management Corporation ( FSMC\u201d), a not-for-profit corporation affiliated with the State of New York, to lease the 409,000 square feet, newly constructed cGMP ISO Class 5 high potency pharmaceutical manufacturing facility located in Dunkirk, NY. This rights to lease this facility were transferred to ImmunityBio in February 2022. For additional information, please see Part II, Item 8, Note 21-Subsequent Events.\u201d\nCOVID-19 related measures\nSince early 2020, after monitoring developments related to the spread of COVID-19, we have undertaken a number of measures in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, with a goal to prioritize the health and safety of our employees and ensure continuity in our business. These measures included implementing a work-from-home policy at various times and other efforts in accordance with recommendations by local authorities for certain of our personnel across the globe as well as imposing restrictions on travel and in-person meetings to protect the health and safety of our workforce while we continue to advance our clinical programs and operations. We have continued to add additional safety procedures and tools in all our locations. We adhere to all state and federal requirements as the same may be in force from time to time.\nWe have been deemed an essential business\u201d by New York State and, as a result, we have experienced minimal disruptions at our New York-based operations in Clarence and Buffalo. Despite these efforts, we may from time to time experience additional disruptions related to the COVID-19 pandemic resulting from employees falling ill with COVID-19. We have supplied our employees with appropriate face coverings and other necessary personal protective equipment and have taken other measures to reduce the risk of the spread of COVID-19 at our work sites. We are actively monitoring our operations and supply chain across the globe and are making adjustments to respond to logistical challenges that arise due to the COVID-19 pandemic where appropriate, particularly due to the emergence and spread of the COVID-19 Omicron variant, which has impacted our operations and supply chain during 2021 as discussed further below. We have continued to produce some medicines that are used to treat COVID-19 as part of our commitment to contribute to the COVID-19 relief effort.\nWith respect to our clinical development program, for our earlier stage product candidates, we have experienced and expect to continue to experience slowed enrollment for our clinical trials as well as suspensions in our clinical trials as healthcare resources are diverted to address the COVID-19 pandemic. We remain committed to advancing our pipeline while ensuring the safety of all participants as well as the integrity of the data. We will continue to monitor developments with respect to the COVID-19 pandemic as well as industry and regulatory best practices for continuing clinical development programs during the pandemic, including, if and where appropriate, the use of virtual communications, interviews, and visits as well as self-administration and remote monitoring techniques to address health and safety concerns while minimizing disruptions and delays to our clinical development timelines.\nWe also put in place a number of measures intended to adjust or allocate resources towards prioritizing key business operations such as clinical and regulatory activities, and to delay or defray compensation costs in order to preserve our cash on hand and liquidity during a volatile period in the U.S. and global capital markets.\nWhile the disruptions to our business caused by the pandemic are currently expected to be temporary, there is still uncertainty regarding the pandemic's overall duration and the severity of any future outbreaks. For example, the surge of COVID-19 cases in the first half of 2021 in India, a country where we source products and maintain partnerships that are key to our specialty drug business, including API, presented business and supply chain disruption risks for us. We could face similar risks in other regions, or a resurgence in India, to the extent the virus is not able to be contained, there is widespread sickness and disruptions on. The scope and impact of any such measures is not yet known and will depend on a number of factors, including but not limited to the ultimate spread and severity of the outbreaks and the scope, duration and impact of containment measures on individuals and businesses. If our partners experience significant or extended disruptions to their business due to COVID-19, it could result in supply shortages and harm our specialty drug business, as well as our overall financial condition.\nGoing Concern Considerations\nWe have three operating segments: our Oncology Innovation Platform, Global Supply Chain Platform and Commercial Platform. Since inception, we have devoted a substantial amount of our resources to research and development of our lead product candidates under our Orascovery and Src Kinase Inhibition technology platforms, as well as under the Cell Therapy platform and Arginine Deprivation Therapy technology, while building up our commercial infrastructure. We have incurred significant net losses since inception.\nWe have incurred operating losses since inception and, as a result, as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, we had an accumulated deficit of $913.4 million and $713.6 million, respectively. We expect to incur significant expenses and operating losses for the foreseeable future. We project insufficient liquidity to fund our operations through the next twelve months beyond the date of this report. This condition raises substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. See Part II, Item 8. Note 1-Company and Nature of Business for further information regarding our ability to continue as a going concern.\nAs a result of the significant decrease in our market capitalization since we last performed a goodwill impairment test in the fourth quarter of 2020, we evaluated the impact on each of our reporting units to assess whether there was an impairment triggering event. The Company identified impairment triggering events during the first quarter of 2021 and, consistent with our annual policy, performed a test as of our annual goodwill impairment evaluation date, October 1, 2021, subsequently updating that analysis to December 31, 2021 using new information that became available regarding conditions that existed as of December 31, 2021. We compared the fair value of our Global Supply Chain Platform and Oncology Innovation Platform reporting units to carrying value. Based on the results from the test on March 31, 2021, the fair value of each of our reporting units exceeded their carrying value, and\nthe goodwill was not impaired. Based on the results from the test during the fourth quarter of 2021, the carrying value of the Global Supply Chain Platform and Oncology Innovation Platform reporting units exceeded their fair value, and therefore, goodwill was determined to be fully impaired. Accordingly, the Company recorded goodwill impairment of $67.7 million during the year ended December 31, 2021, of which, $26.6 million was related to the Global Supply Chain Platform reporting unit and $41.1 million was related to the Oncology Innovation Platform reporting unit (see Part II, Item 8. Note 8-Intangible Assets, Net). Estimating the fair value of goodwill requires the use of estimates and significant judgments that are based on a number of factors. These estimates and judgments may not be within our control and accordingly it is reasonably possible that the judgments and estimates could change in future periods.\nHowever, a lack of sustained recovery or further deterioration in market conditions related to the general economy and the industries in which we operate, a sustained trend of weaker than anticipated financial performance, further decline in our share price for a sustained period of time, or an increase in the market-based weighted average cost of capital, among other factors, could significantly impact the impairment analysis and may result in future impairment charges that, if incurred, could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe have funded our operations to date primarily from the issuance and sale of our common stock through public offerings, senior secured loans, private placements, and to a lesser extent, from convertible bond financing, revenue, and grant funding. As of December 31, 2021, we had cash and cash equivalents of $35.2 million, restricted cash of $16.5 million, and short-term investments of $10.2 million.\nOn August 20, 2021, we entered into a sales agreement (the Sales Agreement\u201d) with SVB Leerink LLC, in connection with the offer and sale of up to $100,000,000 of shares of our common stock, par value $0.001 per share ( ATM Shares\u201d). The ATM Shares to be offered and sold under the Sales Agreement will be issued and sold pursuant to a registration statement on Form S-3 (File No. 333-258185) that became effective on August 12, 2021. During the year ended December 31, 2021, we sold 762,825 shares of our common stock for an average price of $1.49 per share under the Sales Agreement.\nOutlook\nOur company's mission is to become a leader in bringing innovative cancer treatments to the market and to improve patient health outcomes. Historically, we had focused development of our Orascovery platform which is based on a technology that converts IV chemotherapy to oral chemotherapy. We conducted a large phase 3 clinical trial in metastatic breast cancer comparing Oral Paclitaxel to IV paclitaxel, which was the basis of our NDA submission. Unfortunately, in February 2021, we received a CRL from the FDA which asked for an additional clinical study to support approval. After careful evaluation and prioritization of our R&D pipeline, we have decided to focus our R&D resources on our innovative cell therapy platform, which is based on NKT cells. NKT cells have unique biology that has potential advantages over current T cell and NK cell based technologies. We believe these advantages include the following:\n(1)There is still a major unmet need in hematological and solid tumors in that even in those indications where autologous CAR-T cells have been previously approved, up to 60% of patients receiving CAR-T therapy do not achieve long term durable responses.\n(2)Cellular therapies have generally not been effective in the treatment of solid tumors. NKT cells are an ideal platform for treatment of solid tumors because NKT cells home to tumors, and we have data demonstrating that CAR-NKT cells are superior in tumor homing compared to CAR-T cells.\n(3)Our allogeneic ( off-the-shelf\u201d) CAR-NKT cell therapy products may be produced at larger scale than autologous products, potentially at lower cost.\n(4)Our allogeneic CAR-NKT cells are manufactured starting with the lymphocytes of healthy donors. Use of healthy donors, rather than patients (who are the source of autologous cell therapy starting materials), results in a more robust and consistent product, because patient lymphocytes are usually dysfunctional due to previous cancer therapy.\nNKT cells demonstrate anti-tumor activity, even without a CAR. This is because NKT cells can kill immune suppressive cells in the local tumor microenvironment. Thus, when we add a CAR to NKT cells they are now equipped with two different anti-tumor mechanisms, which may lead to more potent anti-tumor activity and reduce the potential for relapse.\nAdvancing KUR-501 CAR-NKT Targeting GD2 - KUR-501 is an autologous product in which NKT cells are engineered with a CAR targeting GD2 and is currently being evaluated in a phase 1 clinical trial (GINAKIT2) treating children with R/R high risk neuroblastoma. Neuroblastoma is a rare pediatric cancer and patients with R/R high risk neuroblastoma have very poor outcomes. Therefore, we believe there is a significant unmet need for better treatment options. Interim data presented at the American Society of Gene and Cell Therapy (ASGCT) 2021 Annual Meeting for the first eleven evaluable patients, showed long-term persistence of CAR-NKT cells and CAR-NKT cell localization at the tumor site. Responses were observed in two patients, including one CR, one PR, and four patients achieved SD. The safety profile of KUR-501 was manageable and the product is being administered in the outpatient\nsetting. GINATKIT2 will continue enrolling patients at higher dose level cohorts with a goal to identify an optimal dose that we may take into a pivotal study.\nAdvancing KUR-502 CAR-NKT Targeting CD19 - Early data, as presented at the ASH annual meeting in December of 2021, indicated that, of the first five evaluable patients, there was a promising overall response rate of 80% with a complete response rate of 60%. KUR-502 is an allogeneic, off-the-shelf\u201d product in which NKT cells are engineered with a CAR targeting CD19. Today, autologous CAR-T cell treatments are available to patients, but the patient-to-patient variability and long manufacturing lead times limit patient care options. As an allogeneic off-the-shelf\u201d product, KUR-502 leverages economies of scale and has the potential to significantly increase patient access to innovative CAR-NKT treatments. Our aim is to expand the phase 1 (ANCHOR) clinical trial treating adults with R/R CD19 positive malignancies currently being conducted at BCM to a phase 1 multicenter clinical trial (ANCHOR2).\nFocusing on Specific Programs of Oral Paclitaxel - For Oral Paclitaxel, while our MAA submission is currently under review by the U.K. MHRA, we have focused our efforts on our ongoing combination clinical trials with checkpoint inhibitors where we believe there is an opportunity. Oral Paclitaxel is currently being evaluated in combination with pembrolizumab in NSCLC; and dostarlimab +/- carboplatin in neoadjuvant breast cancer, as part of I-SPY 2.\nLicensing and Partnership Opportunities - We continue to increase the global reach of tirbanibulin 1% ointment by maintaining strong global partnerships with existing partners such as Almirall, Seqirus, and AVIR and by evaluating other strategic territories to launch the product. Our team will continue to work closely with our partners to explore additional treatment regimens and indications for tirbanibulin 1% ointment. We will pursue strategic licensing and partnership opportunities for our small molecule programs and target opportunities that will create potential value for stockholders and support our business strategy and mission.\nAs we pursue these strategic priorities, we expect to incur significant expenses and increasing operating losses for the foreseeable future. We anticipate that our expenses will increase as we seek to:\n\u2022Advance the preclinical and clinical research program and development activities of our Cell Therapy technology platform;\n\u2022Continue our preclinical and clinical research program and development activities related to our Mission;\n\u2022Seek to identify additional research programs and product candidates within existing Cell Therapy platform; and\n\u2022Maintain, expand, and protect our IP portfolio.\nResults of Operations\nExcept where otherwise noted, the following discussion compares fiscal years 2021 and 2020 results. For a discussion on the comparison between fiscal year 2020 and fiscal year 2019 results, see the Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2020, as filed with the SEC and incorporated by reference herein.\nSince inception, we have devoted a substantial amount of our resources to research and development of our lead product candidates under our Orascovery, Src Kinase inhibition, Cell Therapy and arginine deprivation therapy technologies, to sales and general administrative costs associated with our operations, and to the development of our specialty drug operations in our Commercial Platform and 503B operations. We have incurred significant net losses since inception. Our net losses were $202.0 million, $148.4 million, and $125.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019, respectively. As of December 31, 2021 and 2020, we had an accumulated deficit of approximately $913.4 million and $713.6 million, respectively.\nWe have funded our operations to date primarily from the issuance and sale of our common stock through public offerings, private placements, debt and convertible bonds, and to a lesser extent, through revenue generated from our Global Supply Chain Platform. Our operating activities from continuing operations used $138.3 million, $127.8 million and $97.0 million of cash during the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019, respectively. As of December 31, 2021, we had cash and cash equivalents of $35.2 million, restricted cash of $16.5 million, and short-term investments of $10.2 million.\nKey Components of Results of Operations\nRevenue\nWe derive our consolidated revenue primarily from (i) the sales of generic injectable products by our Commercial Platform; (ii) licensing and collaboration projects conducted by our Oncology Innovation Platform, which generates revenue in the form of upfront payments, milestone payments, and payments received for providing research and development services for our collaboration projects and for other third parties; (iii) the sales of 503B and API products by our Global Supply Chain Platform; and (iv) grant awards from government agencies and universities for our continuing research and development efforts.\nThe following table sets forth the components of our consolidated revenue and the amount as a percentage of total revenue for the periods indicated.\n\nCost of Sales\nAlong with sourcing from third-party manufacturers, we manufacture clinical products in our U.S. current Good Manufacturing Practices ( cGMP\u201d) facility in New York. Cost of sales primarily includes the cost of finished products, raw materials, labor costs, manufacturing overhead expenses and reserves for expected scrap, as well as transportation costs. Cost of sales also includes depreciation expense for production equipment, changes to our excess and obsolete inventory reserves, certain direct costs such as shipping costs, net of costs charged to customers, and sublicense fees related to in-license agreements.\nResearch and Development Expenses\nResearch and development ( R&D\u201d) expenses primarily consist of the costs associated with in-licensing of product candidates, milestone payments, conducting preclinical studies and clinical trials, activities related to regulatory filings and other R&D activities. The following table sets forth the components of our R&D expenses and the amount as a percentage of total R&D expenses for the periods indicated.\n\nOur current R&D activities mainly relate to the clinical development of our Oncology Innovation Platform.\nWe expense R&D costs as incurred. We record costs for certain development activities, such as clinical trials, based on an evaluation of the progress to completion of specific tasks using data such as patient enrollment or clinical site activations. We do not allocate employee-related costs, depreciation, rental and other indirect costs to specific R&D programs because these costs are deployed across multiple product programs under R&D. For 2021, other research and development costs include the cost of manufacturing Oral Paclitaxel in advance of the potential product launch in 2021. These costs are not expected to continue.\nWe cannot determine with certainty the duration, costs and timing of the current or future preclinical or clinical studies of our drug candidates. The duration, costs, and timing of clinical studies and development of our drug candidates will depend on a variety of factors, including:\n\u2022The scope, rate of progress, and costs of our ongoing, as well as any additional, clinical studies and other R&D activities;\n\u2022Future clinical study results;\n\u2022Uncertainties in clinical study enrollment rates;\n\u2022Significant and changing government regulation; and\n\u2022The timing and receipt of any regulatory approvals.\nA change in the outcome of any of these variables with respect to the development of a drug candidate, including delays caused by the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, could mean a significant change in the costs and timing associated with the development of that drug candidate.\nR&D activities are central to our business model. We expect our R&D expenses to decrease overall, as the development of most non-Cell Therapy technologies has been suspended. R&D expenses related to our Cell Therapy platform are expected to increase as we prepare for additional clinical and preclinical studies for our Cell Therapy programs. There are numerous factors associated with the successful commercialization of any of our drug candidates, including future trial design and various regulatory requirements, many of which cannot be determined with accuracy at this time based on our stage of development. Additionally, future commercial, regulatory and public health, including the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, factors beyond our control will likely impact our clinical development programs and plans.\nSelling, General and Administrative Expenses\nSelling, general and administrative, ( SG&A\u201d), expenses primarily consist of compensation, including salary, employee benefits and stock-based compensation expenses for sales and marketing personnel, and for administrative personnel that support our general operations such as executive management, legal counsel, financial accounting, information technology, and human resources personnel. SG&A expenses also include professional fees for legal, patent, consulting, auditing and tax services, as well as other direct and allocated expenses for rent and maintenance of facilities, insurance and other supplies used in the selling, marketing, general and administrative activities. SG&A expenses also include costs associated with our commercialization efforts for our proprietary drugs, such as market research, brand strategy and development work on market access, scientific publication, product distribution, and patient support.\nWe anticipate that our SG&A costs associated with the commercialization of the Orascovery platform and the development of the facility in Dunkirk, NY will decrease in future periods. We expect that certain costs, including share compensation costs, insurance costs, and other administrative costs, will decrease as a result of the sale of our interest in the pharmaceutical manufacturing facility located in Dunkirk, NY. Meanwhile, we anticipate that cost related to legal, compliance, accounting and investor and public relations expenses associated with being a public company will remain consistent.\nInterest Expense and Interest Income\nInterest expense consists primarily of interest on our long-term loans and the amortization of our debt discount. Interest income consists primarily of interest generated from our cash and short-term investments in U.S. Treasury securities, U.S. agency securities, high rated commercial papers and corporate bonds.\nLoss on Extinguishment of Debt\nThe loss on extinguishment of debt is the result of refinancing the senior secured loan agreement with Perceptive Advisors LLC and its affiliates ( Perceptive\u201d) with the Senior Credit Agreement with Oaktree, as well as the subsequent assignment of a portion of the Senior Credit Agreement to Sagard. The refinancing of the senior secured loan agreement with Perceptive resulted in an exit fee and the recognition of the unamortized debt discount as a loss on extinguishment of debt in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss. The assignment of a portion of the Senior Credit Agreement to Sagard qualified as a partial debt extinguishment and resulted in a proportional loss from the existing unamortized debt discount, inclusive of unamortized deferred financing fees.\nResults of Operations\nYear Ended December 31, 2021 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2020\nThe following table sets forth a summary of our consolidated results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, together with the changes in those items in dollars and as a percentage. This information should be read together with our consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this report. Our operating results in any period are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for any future period.\n\nRevenue\nProduct sales for the year ended December 31, 2021 was $92.6 million, a decrease of $13.0 million, or 12%, as compared to $105.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. This decrease was primarily attributable to a decrease in APD product sales of $22.6 million. The prior year had an increase in demand for COVID-19 related drugs and for FDA shortage products, including some significant non-recurring orders. In addition, in the first half of 2021, we experienced significant COVID-related challenges in our Indian supply chain and to a lesser extent in China. As a result, we did not receive some inventory from our partners located in these countries for a certain period of time. This decrease in APD product sales was partially offset by an increase in 503B sales of $7.8 million as the result of the increase in demand for certain drugs used to treat patients hospitalized with COVID-19. Contract manufacturing sale and API product sales experienced increases of $1.4 million and $0.4 million, respectively.\nLicense fees and other revenue decreased to $27.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, from $39.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, a decrease of $11.2 million, or 29%. During the year ended December 31, 2021, we recorded $20.0 million and $5.0 million of license revenue pursuant to our license agreement with Almirall upon the launch of Klisyri in the U.S. in February 2021 and in Europe in September 2021, respectively, and $0.5 million related to the upfront fee pursuant to the Second Amendment to the PharmaEssentia Agreement, for the license of Tirbanibulin in Japan and South Korea. During the year ended December 31, 2020, we recognized $37.7 million in license revenue, net of $2.3 million VAT pursuant to the Xiangxue License to develop and commercialize Oral Paclitaxel, Oral Irinotecan, and tirbanibulin ointment in People's Republic of China ( PRC\u201d or China\u201d), Hong Kong, and Macau, and $1.0 million in license revenue pursuant to the license agreement we entered into with PharmaEssentia to develop and commercialize Oral Paclitaxel, Oral Irinotecan, and Oral Docetaxel in Taiwan, Singapore, and Vietnam.\nCost of Sales\nCost of sales totaled $82.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, a decrease of $12.9 million, or 14%, as compared to $95.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. The decrease in our cost of APD product sales was in-line with the decrease in APD product revenue and was partially offset by increases in cost of sales related to the increases in 503B, Contract Manufacturing, and API product sales. In the year ended December 31, 2020, we incurred sublicense fees of $5.8 million on our license revenue, which did not occur in 2021.\nResearch and Development Expenses\nR&D expenses totaled $80.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, an increase of $4.3 million, or 6%, as compared to $75.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. This was primarily due to an increase in costs related to Oral Paclitaxel, drug licensing costs, cell therapy costs, and compensation, and included the following:\n\u2022$9.5 million increase in Oral Paclitaxel product development, API, and medical affairs costs associated with the potential product launch in 2021;\n\u2022$6.2 million increase in drug licensing costs, due to license payments for specialty pharmaceutical products, a license milestone payment related to Arginine deprivation therapy, and the repurchase of Orascovery rights from Xiangxue; and\n\u2022$4.4 million increase in cell therapy development costs.\nThe increase in these R&D expenses was partially offset by a decrease of $8.8 million in costs of clinical operations after completion of the Phase 3 studies for tirbanibulin ointment and Oral Paclitaxel, a decrease of $4.4 million in regulatory costs in connection with our NDA preparations, a decrease of $1.4 million in preclinical operations, a decrease of $0.7 million in research and development related compensation and a decrease of $0.5 million in costs of other product development.\nSelling, General and Administrative Expenses\nSelling, general, and administrative expenses totaled $72.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, a decrease of $20.3 million, or 22%, as compared to $92.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. This was primarily due to a $24.8 million decrease of costs for preparing to commercialize Oral Paclitaxel as significant pre-launch activities occurred in 2020 and slowed upon receipt of the Complete Response Letter in February 2021. In addition, we did not record a provision for credit losses in 2021, compared to provision for credit losses of $8.9 million from 2020. Compensation related costs decreased by $0.2 million in 2021 compared to 2020. These decreases were partially offset by a $4.2 million increase from the change in fair value of contingent consideration, a $5.9 million increase in operating costs including insurance costs, IT costs, other professional fees, and the costs to operate our manufacturing facility in Chongqing, China, and a $3.5 million increase in professional fees and other expenses related to the acquisition of Kuur.\nImpairments\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2021, we recognized goodwill impairment expense of $67.7 million and impairment of other intangible assets of $1.7 million. Of the total goodwill impairment, $26.6 million was related to the Global Supply Chain Platform reporting unit, representing a full impairment of the goodwill allocated to that reporting unit, and $41.1 million was related to the Oncology Innovation Platform reporting unit, representing a full impairment of the goodwill allocated to that reporting unit. Goodwill impairment is the excess of a reporting unit's carrying amount over its fair value. The decrease in our estimation of the reporting units' fair value was related to the Company's decision to no longer pursue regulatory approval for Oral Paclitaxel monotherapy for the treatment of mBC in the U.S. and the delays in the launch of products in our newly constructed manufacturing facilities. No such impairment was recorded during the year ended December 31, 2020.\nInterest Income and Interest Expense\nInterest income consisted of interest earned on our short-term investments and decreased by $0.6 million, or 74%, from 2020 to 2021 due a decrease in our short-term investment holdings during the year and a decrease in market rates for commercial paper, corporate bonds, and U.S. Treasury securities. Interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2021 totaled $20.7 million, an increase of $9.5 million, or 85%, as compared to $11.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, primarily due to increased borrowings. Interest expense in 2021 consisted of interest on borrowings under the Senior Credit Agreement with Oaktree while interest expense in 2020 included interest on borrowings under the credit agreement with Perceptive we entered into in June 2018, and the Senior Credit Agreement with Oaktree we entered into in June 2020 to repay in full the outstanding loan and fees under the credit agreement with Perceptive.\nLoss on Extinguishment of Debt\nWe recognized a $7.2 million loss on the extinguishment of debt related to the termination of the senior secured loan agreement with Perceptive and a $3.0 million loss on the partial extinguishment of debt related to the assignment of a portion of the senior secured loan from Oaktree's co-investors to Sagard during the year ended December 31, 2020. We did not incur loss on the extinguishment of debt during the year ended December 31, 2021.\nIncome Tax Expense\nFor the year ended December 31, 2021, income tax benefit amounted to $10.6 million, compared to income tax expense of $4.1 million for 2020. The income tax benefit in the current year is primarily the result of taxable temporary difference due to the deferred\ntax liability recognized for the indefinite lived intangible assets acquired in connection with the acquisition of Kuur's in-process research and development ( IPR&D\u201d). This taxable temporary difference is considered a source of taxable income to support the realization of deferred tax assets from the acquirer which resulted in a reversal of our valuation allowance. The income tax expense in the prior year was primarily attributable to foreign income tax withholdings on our revenue earned under our out-license arrangements.\nLoss from discontinued operations\nLoss from discontinued operations is comprised of operating results of the activities related to the build out of our manufacturing facility in Dunkirk, NY. This facility was sold in the first quarter of 2022. The increase in loss from discontinued operations was due to an increase in headcount and general costs necessary to prepare the Dunkirk facility for manufacturing operations. This increase was partially offset by income from a government grant in 2021, which consisted of a reimbursement of operating expenses received from New York State related to the preparation of the facility. Distributions by New York State under this arrangement in prior years were made for direct construction costs that were capital in nature and were not made to offset our operating expenses incurred in relation to such construction.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nCapital Resources\nSince our inception, we have incurred net losses and negative cash flows from our operations. Our cash requirement was primarily cash used for our R&D programs, SG&A costs associated with our operations, the development of our specialty drug operations in our Commercial Platform and 503B operations, and the investment we made in our pre-launch activities in anticipation of commercializing our proprietary drugs. We incurred net losses of $202.0 million, $148.4 million and $125.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019, respectively. As of December 31, 2021, we had an accumulated deficit of $913.4 million. Our operating activities from continuing operations used $138.3 million, $127.8 million and $97.0 million of cash during the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019, respectively. We intend to continue to advance our various clinical and pre-clinical programs which could lead to increased cash outflow of R&D costs. While we expect our R&D expenses to decrease overall, as the development of most non-Cell Therapy technologies has been suspended, R&D expenses related to our Cell Therapy platform are expected to increase as we prepare for additional clinical and preclinical studies for our Cell Therapy programs. We can provide no assurance that the funding requirements to diversify the product portfolio for specialty drug products in the Commercial Platform and 503B operations will decline in the future. Our principal sources of liquidity as of December 31, 2021 were cash and cash equivalents totaling $35.2 million, restricted cash of $16.5 million, held in a controlled bank account in connection with the Senior Credit Agreement with Oaktree, and short-term investments totaling $10.2 million, which are generally high-quality investment grade corporate debt securities.\nOur obligations under the Senior Credit Agreement are guaranteed by us and certain of our existing domestic subsidiaries and subsequently acquired or organized subsidiaries subject to certain exceptions. Our obligations under the Senior Credit Agreement and the related guarantees thereunder are secured, subject to customary permitted liens and other agreed upon exceptions, by (i) a pledge of all of the equity interests of our direct subsidiaries, and (ii) a perfected security interest in all of our tangible and intangible assets.\nThe Senior Credit Agreement contains customary representations and warranties and customary affirmative and negative covenants, including, among other things, restrictions on indebtedness, liens, investments, mergers, dispositions, prepayment of other indebtedness, and dividends and other distributions, subject to certain exceptions, including specific exceptions with respect to product commercialization and development activities. In addition, the Senior Credit Agreement contains certain financial covenants, including, among other things, maintenance of minimum liquidity and a minimum revenue test, measured quarterly until the last day of the second consecutive fiscal quarter where the consolidated leverage ratio does not exceed 4.5 to 1, provided that thereafter we cannot allow our consolidated leverage ratio to exceed 4.5 to 1, measured quarterly. Failure of the Company to comply with the financial covenants will result in an event of default, subject to certain cure rights of the Company. At December 31, 2021, we were in compliance with all applicable covenants.\nDebt and Equity Financings\nATM Financing\nOn August 20, 2021, we entered into a sales agreement with SVB Leerink LLC, in connection with the offer and sale of up to $100,000,000 of shares of our common stock, par value $0.001 per share, in an at-the-market offering (the ATM Offering\u201d). During the year ended December 31, 2021, we sold 762,825 shares of our common stock for an average price of $1.49 per share under the Sales Agreement.\nPublic Offering of Stock\nIn September 2020, we completed an underwritten public offering of 10,000,000 shares of our common stock. We granted the underwriters a 30-day option to purchase up to an additional 1,500,000 shares of common stock, which was exercised in full in\nSeptember 2020. All shares were offered at a price of $11.00 per share. Net proceeds were $118.7 million, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and offering expenses of $7.9 million.\nOaktree Senior Credit Agreement\nOn June 19, 2020 (the Closing Date\u201d), we entered into the Senior Credit Agreement to borrow up to $225.0 million in five tranches with a maturity date of June 19, 2026, bearing interest at a fixed annual rate of 11.0%, payable quarterly. We are required to make quarterly interest-only payments until June 19, 2022, after which we are required to make quarterly amortizing payments, with the remaining balance of the principal plus accrued and unpaid interest due at maturity. Since September 17, 2020, we have been required to pay a commitment fee on any undrawn commitments equal to 0.6% per annum, payable on each subsequent funding date and the commitment termination date. We are also required to pay an exit fee at maturity equal to 2.0% of the aggregate principal amount of the loans funded under the Senior Credit Agreement.\nThe first tranche of $100.0 million was drawn prior to June 30, 2020, with $54.1 million of the proceeds used in part to repay in full the outstanding loan and fees under the credit agreement with Perceptive and an additional $11.0 million of the upfront loan proceeds held by us as restricted cash in a debt service reserve account, and $6.4 million in fees and expenses incurred in connection with the financing, leaving $28.5 million in available proceeds from the first tranche. The second tranche of $25.0 million was drawn prior to September 30, 2020 and the third tranche of $25.0 million was drawn prior to December 31, 2020. Our ability to draw Tranches C and E of the Senior Credit Agreement was associated with the marketing approval and future sales of Oral Paclitaxel. These tranches were reduced to zero in connection with the amendment described below and are not available for future borrowing.\nWe are required to make mandatory prepayments of the senior secured loans with net cash proceeds from certain asset sales or insurance proceeds or condemnation awards, in each case, subject to certain exceptions and reinvestment rights. In connection with the sale of the Dunkirk Facility in February 2022, we entered into an amendment to the Senior Credit Agreement (the January Credit Agreement Amendment\u201d) whereby we were required to repay $25.0 million, or 62.5% of the proceeds from the sale, of the outstanding principal of the loan. In addition, on the date of closing the Dunkirk Transaction, we were required to pay (i) accrued and unpaid interest and (ii) a 7.0% fee, allocated as a 2.0% Exit Fee and a 5.0% Prepayment Fee (each as defined in the Senior Credit Agreement), on the principal amount being repaid. We were required to pay Oaktree an amendment fee of $0.3 million and certain related expenses. Further, the January Credit Agreement Amendment requires us to make an additional prepayment of $12.5 million in principal plus the costs and fees described above by June 14, 2022, within 120 days of the closing of the Dunkirk Transaction.\nWe may voluntarily prepay the Senior Credit Agreement at any time subject to a prepayment premium which up until June 19, 2022 is equal to the amount of interest that would have been paid up to, but not including, June 19, 2022 (excluding interest amounts already paid), plus 3.0% of the principal amount of the senior secured loans being repaid. Thereafter, the prepayment premium equals 3.0% of the principal amount of the senior secured loans being repaid and is reduced over time until June 19, 2024, after which no prepayment premium is required.\nOur obligations under the Senior Credit Agreement are guaranteed by us and certain of our existing domestic subsidiaries and subsequently acquired or organized subsidiaries subject to certain exceptions. Our obligations under the Senior Credit Agreement and the related guarantees thereunder are secured, subject to customary permitted liens and other agreed upon exceptions, by (i) a pledge of all of the equity interests of our direct subsidiaries, and (ii) a perfected security interest in all of our tangible and intangible assets.\nThe Senior Credit Agreement contains customary representations and warranties and customary affirmative and negative covenants, including, among other things, restrictions on indebtedness, liens, investments, mergers, dispositions, prepayment of other indebtedness, and dividends and other distributions, subject to certain exceptions, including specific exceptions with respect to product commercialization and development activities. In addition, the Senior Credit Agreement contains certain financial covenants, including, among other things, maintenance of minimum liquidity and a minimum revenue test, measured quarterly until the last day of the second consecutive fiscal quarter where the consolidated leverage ratio does not exceed 4.5 to 1, provided that thereafter we cannot allow our consolidated leverage ratio to exceed 4.5 to 1, measured quarterly. Failure of the Company to comply with the financial covenants will result in an event of default, subject to certain cure rights of the Company. At December 31, 2021, we were in compliance with all applicable covenants.\nThe Senior Credit Agreement contains events of default which are customary for financings of this type, in certain circumstances subject to customary cure periods. Following an event of default and any cure period, if applicable, Oaktree will have the right upon notice to terminate any undrawn commitments and may accelerate all amounts outstanding under the Senior Credit Agreement, in addition to other remedies available to it as a secured creditor of the Company.\nIn connection with our entry into the Senior Credit Agreement, we granted warrants to Oaktree to purchase up to an aggregate of 908,393 shares of our common stock at a purchase price of $12.63 per share. Under the January Credit Agreement Amendment, the warrants were amended to change the exercise price to be paid per share upon exercise of the warrants. The January Credit Agreement Amendment provides that the exercise price for 50% of the shares underlying the warrants will be $1.10 per share. The exercise price for the remaining 50% of the warrants was not changed by the January Credit Agreement Amendment.\nOutlook\nWe have borrowed and, in the future, may borrow additional capital from institutional and commercial banking sources to fund future growth. We may borrow additional funds on terms that may include restrictive covenants, including covenants that further restrict the operation of our business, liens on assets, high effective interest rates, financial performance covenants and repayment provisions that reduce cash resources and limit future access to capital markets. In addition, we expect to continue to opportunistically seek access to the equity capital markets to support our development efforts and operations. To the extent that we raise additional capital by issuing equity securities, our stockholders may experience substantial dilution. To the extent that we raise additional funds through collaboration or partnering arrangements or by monetizing non-core assets, we may be required to relinquish some of our rights to our technologies or rights to market and sell our products in certain geographies, grant licenses on terms that are not favorable to us, or issue equity that may be substantially dilutive to our stockholders.\nAs of December 31, 2021, we had cash and cash equivalents of $35.2 million, restricted cash of $16.5 million, and short-term investments of $10.2 million. We are implementing cost savings programs and plan to monetize non-core assets and raise capital in order to extend our cash runway in 2022. If we are unable to raise additional capital or monetize assets, we believe that the existing cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash, and short-term investments will not be sufficient to fund current operating plans through one year after the date that these audited consolidated financial statements are issued. We have concluded that this raises substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. See Part II, Item 8. Note 1-Company and Nature of Business for further information regarding our ability to continue as a going concern. We have based these estimates on assumptions that may prove to be wrong, and we could spend the available financial resources much faster than expected and need to raise additional funds sooner than anticipated. Although we plan to raise additional funds though the sale of non-core assets and selling equity securities, these plans are subject to market conditions which are outside of our control, and therefore cannot be deemed to be probable. There can be no assurance that additional financing, if available, can be obtained on terms acceptable to us. If we are unable to obtain such additional financing, we would need to reevaluate our future operating plans.\nWe anticipate that our expenses will cover the following activities as we:\n\u2022Advance the preclinical and clinical research program and development activities of our Cell Therapy technology platform;\n\u2022Continue our preclinical and clinical research program and development activities related to our Mission;\n\u2022Seek to identify additional research programs and product candidates within existing Cell Therapy platform; and\n\u2022Maintain, expand and protect our intellectual property ( IP\u201d) portfolio.\nWe have made certain changes to our budgeted expenses in light of the CRL for Oral Paclitaxel we received in February 2021 and the Type A meetings with the FDA, including curtailing commercialization expenses and investing in additional products for our specialty drug product business. However, our expenses could increase as we continue to fund clinical and preclinical development of our research programs by advancing our Cell Therapy programs, certain candidates in our pipeline, our specialty drug products, working capital and other general corporate purposes. Capital expenditure at the Sintaho facility may continue to grow and be significant as we build out the plant to manufacture Tirbanibulin APIs. We have based our estimates on assumptions that might prove to be wrong and we might use our available capital resources sooner than we currently expect. Because of the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with the development and commercialization of our drug candidates, we are unable to accurately estimate the amounts of increased capital outlays and operating expenditures necessary to complete the development and commercialization of our drug candidates.\nOur future capital requirements will depend on many factors, some or all of which may be impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, including:\n\u2022Our ability to generate revenue and profits from our Commercial Platform or otherwise;\n\u2022The costs, timing and outcome of regulatory reviews and approvals;\n\u2022Progress of our drug candidates to progress through clinical development successfully;\n\u2022The initiation, progress, timing, costs and results of nonclinical studies and clinical trials for our other programs and potential drug candidates;\n\u2022The costs of construction and fit-out of planned drug manufacture at our API manufacturing facility;\n\u2022The number and characteristics of the drug candidates we pursue;\n\u2022The costs of preparing, filing and prosecuting patent applications, maintaining and enforcing our IP rights and defending IP related claims;\n\u2022The extent to which we acquire or in-license other products and technologies; and\n\u2022Our ability to maintain and establish collaboration arrangements on favorable terms, if at all.\nUntil we can generate substantial product revenue, we expect to finance our cash needs through a combination of equity offerings, debt financings, collaborations, strategic alliances, licensing arrangements, and government grants. To the extent that we raise additional capital through the sale of equity or convertible debt securities, the ownership interest of our existing stockholders will be diluted, and the terms of these securities may include liquidation or other preferences that adversely affect rights of holders of common stock. Debt financing, if available, may involve agreements that include covenants limiting or restricting our ability to take specific actions, such as incurring additional debt, making capital expenditures or declaring dividends and might require the issuance of warrants, which could potentially dilute the ownership interest of holders of common stock. If we raise additional funds through collaborations, strategic alliances or licensing arrangements with third parties, we might have to relinquish valuable rights to our technologies, future revenue streams or research programs or to grant licenses on terms that might not be favorable to us. If we are unable to raise additional funds through equity or debt financings when needed, we might be required to delay, limit, reduce, or terminate our product development or future commercialization efforts or grant rights to develop and market products or drug candidates that we would otherwise prefer to develop and market ourselves.\nWe believe that the existing cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash, and short-term investments will not be sufficient to fund current operating plans through one year after the date that these audited consolidated financial statements are issued. Our estimates are based on relevant conditions that are known and reasonably knowable at the date of these consolidated financial statements being available for issuance and are subject to change due to changes in business, industry or macroeconomic conditions. Further, we do not expect to have access to additional capital under the Senior Credit Agreement. We have based these estimates on assumptions that may prove to be wrong, and we could spend the available financial resources much faster than expected and need to raise additional funds sooner than anticipated. To the extent that we raise additional capital by issuing equity securities, our stockholders may experience substantial dilution. To the extent that we raise additional funds through collaboration or partnering arrangements, we may be required to relinquish some of our rights to our technologies or rights to market and sell our products in certain geographies, grant licenses on terms that are not favorable to us, or issue equity that may be substantially dilutive to our stockholders.\nCash Flows\nThe following table provides information regarding our cash flows from continuing and discontinued operations for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019:\n\nNet Cash Used in Operating Activities\nThe use of cash in all periods presented resulted primarily from our net losses adjusted for non-cash charges and changes in components of working capital. The primary use of our cash in all periods presented was to fund our R&D, regulatory and other clinical trial costs, drug licensing costs, inventory purchases, pre-launch commercialization activities, build-out of our manufacturing facilities, and other expenditures related to sales, marketing and administration. Our prepaid expenses and other current assets, accounts payable and accrued expense balances in all periods presented were affected by the timing of vendor invoicing and payments.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2021, operating activities from continuing operations used $138.3 million of cash, which resulted principally from our net loss from continuing operations of $194.3 million, adjusted for non-cash charges of $90.7 million, non-cash income benefit of $10.8 million related to the reversal of our valuation allowance on our deferred tax assets to offset the deferred tax liability assumed in connection with the acquisition of Kuur's IPR&D, and cash used by our operating assets and liabilities of $23.8 million. Our net non-cash charges during the year ended December 31, 2021 consisted of $69.4 million of impairment of goodwill and intangible assets, $9.2 million of stock-based compensation expense, $4.7 million depreciation and amortization expense, $4.2 million change in fair value of contingent consideration, $2.9 million amortization of debt discount, and $0.6 million write-off of deferred debt issuance costs related to the Revenue Interest Financing. Our operating assets increased $2.7 million for accounts receivable mainly related to the timing of revenues, decreased $4.1 million in prepaid expenses and other assets, and increased $5.9 million for inventory of all drug products. Our operating liabilities decreased by $19.2 million mainly due to a decrease in accrued wages and benefits, accrued construction costs for the Dunkirk, NY facility, accrued costs for potential product launch, accrued selling fees and rebates, and accrued interest, partially offset by an increase in deferred revenue. Net cash used in operating activities from discontinued operations in 2021 was $4.1 million, primarily related to the operating expenses incurred by the activities at the Dunkirk facility.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2020, operating activities from continuing operations used $127.8 million of cash, which resulted principally from our net loss from continuing operations of $144.4 million, adjusted for non-cash charges of $37.2 million. Cash used by our operating assets and liabilities was $20.5 million primarily due to increases in accounts receivable and a decrease in accrued expenses. Our net non-cash charges during the year ended December 31, 2020 primarily consisted of $10.9 million of stock-based compensation, $10.3 million of loss on extinguishment of debt, $9.5 million provision for expected credit losses, $4.5 million of depreciation and amortization, and $1.8 million of amortization of debt discount. Net cash used in operating activities from discontinued operations in 2020 was $3.5 million, related to the operations at the Dunkirk facility.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2019, operating activities from continuing operations used $97.0 million of cash, which resulted principally from our net loss of $125.0 million, adjusted for non-cash charges of $15.4 million. Cash provided by our operating assets and liabilities was $12.6 million primarily due to increases in accounts payable and accrued expenses. Our net non-cash charges during the year ended December 31, 2019 primarily consisted of $3.8 million in depreciation and amortization expense, $9.9 million in stock-based compensation expense, and $1.0 million in amortization of debt discount. Net cash used in operating activities from discontinued operations in 2019 was $0.5 million, related to the operations at the Dunkirk facility.\nNet Cash (Used in) Provided by Investing Activities\nIn 2021, cash provided by investing activities of continuing operations of $119.9 million was primarily attributable to $128.9 million in the sale and maturity of short-term investments, net of purchases, $8.4 million in purchasing property and equipment for continuing operations, primarily, our Sintaho facility, and $2.1 million in payments for licenses, partially offset by cash received from the acquisition of Kuur of $1.4 million. Net cash used in investing activities of discontinued operations in 2021 was $14.9 million, related to purchasing property and equipment at the Dunkirk facility.\nIn 2020, cash used in investing activities of continuing operations of $114.3 million was primarily attributable to $105.5 million in purchases of short-term investments, net of sales and maturities, $8.6 million in purchasing property and equipment for continuing operations $0.2 million in payment for licenses. Net cash used in investing activities of discontinued operations in 2020 was $4.6 million, related to purchasing property and equipment at the Dunkirk facility.\nIn 2019, cash provided by investing activities of continuing operations of $11.4 million was primarily attributable to $24.4 million in sale and maturity of short-term investments, net of purchases, and $0.9 million provided by the acquisition of CIDAL, offset by $9.7 million in purchasing property and equipment for continuing operations, and $4.2 million in payment for licenses. Net cash used in investing activities of discontinued operations in 2019 was $3.9 million, related to purchasing property and equipment at the Dunkirk facility.\nNet Cash Provided by Financing Activities\nIn 2021, cash provided by financing activities of continuing operations was $2.6 million, which primarily consisted of the proceeds from the exercise of stock options of $1.6 million, proceeds from the sale of shares in the ATM Offering of $1.3 million in December, and proceeds from the issuance of debt of $0.8 million, partially offset by the repayment of long-term debt and finance lease obligations of $1.0 million. Net cash used in financing activities of discontinued operations in 2021 was $0.2 million, related to the repayment of finance lease obligations.\nIn 2020, cash provided by financing activities of continuing operations was $209.5 million, which primarily consisted of $127.0 million from the sale of common stock and $143.0 million from the draw downs of debt from our Senior Credit Agreement with Oaktree and $2.1 million to fund our new API plant in China, $7.0 million from the issuance of warrants to Oaktree and Sagard, and $1.7 million from the exercise of stock options, partially offset by $54.3 million repayment of the Perceptive loan and other long-term debt, and $7.9 million and $9.4 million issuance costs related to sale of our common stock in our underwritten follow-on public offering and the issuance of the new Oaktree debt and warrants to Oaktree and Sagard, respectively. Net cash used in financing activities of discontinued operations in 2020 was $0.1 million, related to the repayment of finance lease obligations.\nIn 2019, cash provided by financing activities of continuing operations was $167.5 million, which primarily consisted of net proceeds of $161.1 million from the issuance of our common stock mostly from private placements, net of offering expenses of approximately $1.1 million, and $6.5 million from the issuance of debt to fund our new API plant in China, offset by $1.0 million repayment of debt and finance lease obligations.\nIndebtedness\nWe had $157.7 million and $157.8 million of debt as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. As of December 31, 2021 and 2020, this primarily consisted of the Senior Credit Agreement entered into with Oaktree during 2020, and a credit agreement with Chongqing Maliu Riverside Development and Investment Co., LTD, and finance and operating lease obligations.\nIn 2020, we entered into a Senior Credit Agreement with Oaktree to borrow up to $225.0 million in five tranches with a maturity date of June 19, 2026, bearing interest at a fixed annual rate of 11.0%, payable quarterly. We have drawn three tranches amounting to $150.0 million; the remaining two tranches totaling $75.0 million were reduced to zero in connection with the January Credit Agreement Amendment in February 2022. We are required to make quarterly interest-only payments until June 19, 2022, after which we are also required to make quarterly amortizing payments, with the remaining balance of the principal plus accrued and unpaid interest due at maturity. Since September 17, 2020, we have been required to pay a commitment fee on any undrawn commitments equal to 0.6% per annum, payable on each subsequent funding date and the commitment termination date. We are also required to pay an exit fee at maturity equal to 2.0% of the aggregate principal amount of the loans funded under the Senior Credit Agreement. Upon closing of the Dunkirk Transaction in February 2022, we repaid $25.0 million of the outstanding principal, plus any unpaid and accrued interest, plus the 2.0% exit fee and the 5.0% prepayment fee pursuant to the January Credit Agreement Amendment.\nIn 2019, we entered into a credit agreement which amended the existing partnership agreement with Chongqing Maliu Riverside Development and Investment Co., LTD ( CQ\u201d), for a Renminbi \u00a550.0 million (USD $7.2 million at December 31, 2019) line of credit to be used for the construction of the new API plant in China. We are required to repay the principal amount with accrued interest within three years after the plant receives the cGMP certification, with 20% of the total loan with accrued interest is due within the first twelve months following receiving the certification, 30% of the total loan with accrued interest due within twenty-four months, and the remaining balance with accrued interest due within thirty-six months. Interest accrues at the three-year loan interest rate by the People's Bank of China for the same period on the date of the deposit of the full loan amount, which is expected to approximate 4.75% annually. If we fail to obtain the cGMP certification within three years upon the completion and acceptance of the plant, we shall return all renovation costs with the accrued interest to CQ, in a single transaction within the first ten business days of the next day. If we fail to obtain the cGMP certification within three years of the acceptance of the plant, we are required to return all renovation costs with accrued interest to CQ within ten business days. As of December 31, 2021, the balance due to CQ was $7.8 million.\nCapital Expenditures\nOur liquidity position and capital requirements are subject to a number of factors. For example, our cash inflow and outflow may be impacted by the following:\n\u2022Our ability to generate revenue;\n\u2022Our ability to improve margins on our commercial products;\n\u2022Fluctuations in working capital; and\n\u2022Our ability to raise additional funds.\nOur primary short-term capital needs, which are subject to change, include expenditures related to:\n\u2022Continuous support of the development and research of our proprietary drug products;\n\u2022Build out of our new API plant in China and improvements in our existing manufacturing capacity and efficiency;\n\u2022New research and product development efforts; and\n\u2022Support of our commercialization efforts related to our current and future products.\nAlthough we believe the foregoing items reflect our most likely uses of cash in the short term, we cannot predict with certainty all of our short-term cash uses or the timing or amounts of cash used. If cash generated from operations is insufficient to satisfy our working capital and capital expenditure requirements, we may be required to sell additional equity or debt securities or obtain credit financing. This capital may not be available on satisfactory terms, if at all. Furthermore, any additional equity financing may be dilutive to our stockholders, and debt financing, if available, may include restrictive covenants.\nContractual Obligations\nA summary of our contractual obligations as of December 31, 2021 is as follows:\n\nOur operating and finance leases are principally for facilities and equipment. We currently lease office space in the U.S. and foreign countries to support our operations as a global organization. The operating leases in the above table include our several locations with the amounts committed by each location: (1) the rental of our global headquarters in the Conventus Center for Collaborative Medicine in Buffalo, NY; (2) the rental of our research and development facility in the IC Development Centre in Hong Kong; (3) the rental of the Commercial Platform headquarters in Chicago, IL; (4) the rental of our clinical research headquarters in Cranford, NJ; (5) the rental of our clinical data management center in Taipei, Taiwan; (6) the rental of our contract research organization throughout Latin America; (7) the rental of our Global Supply Chain distribution office in Houston, TX; (8) the rental of our Global Supply Chain API manufacturing facility in Chongqing, China; and (9) the rental of other facilities and equipment located mainly in Buffalo, NY. These locations represent $4.6 million, $0.1 million, $1.6 million, $0.2 million, $0.2 million, $0.1 million, $0.2 million, $0.4 million, and $1.7 million, respectively, of the total amounts committed. In addition to the minimum rental commitments on our operating leases we may also be required to pay amounts for taxes, insurance, maintenance and other operating expenses.\nThe long-term debt includes our senior secured loan and the credit agreement with CQ. The finance lease obligations represent three leases of equipment in our 503B manufacturing facility outside of Buffalo, NY. The license fees in the above table represent the amount committed and accrued under in-license agreements for specialty drug products by the Commercial platform.\nIn addition, we have certain obligations under licensing arrangements with third parties contingent upon achieving various development, regulatory, and commercial milestones. Pursuant to our purchase agreement of Kuur Therapeutics, we may be required to make payments worth up to $115.0 million, payable in cash of shares of our common stock, upon the occurrence of certain development and regulatory milestones related to our NKT cell therapy. Pursuant to our license agreement with Polytom, we may be required to make payments worth up to $44.0 million of our common stock or cash upon the occurrence of certain regulatory milestones related to a pegylated genetically modified human arginase, and make royalty payments representing a percentage of net sales of the licensed products. Pursuant to our license agreement with Avalon HepaPOC, we may be required to make payments worth up to $4.8 million of our common stock or cash upon the occurrence of certain regulatory and sales milestones related to the meter and strips for conduct of liver function tests in humans taking our oncology drugs and make royalty payments representing a percentage of aggregate net sales of the licensed product. Pursuant to the license agreement with XLifeSc, our 55% owned joint venture Axis Therapeutics Limited, we may be required to make cash payments worth up to $108.0 million upon the occurrence of certain regulatory milestones related to XLifeSc's proprietary TCR-T technology, and make royalty payments representing a percentage of aggregate net income generated by sales of licensed products. Pursuant to our license agreements with Hanmi, we may be required to make equity payments of $24.0 million upon regulatory approval of a product within the Orasovery platform and make tiered royalty payments based on net sales of any product using the licensed intellectual property. These amounts are not included in the table above.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Significant Judgments and Estimates\nOur discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of our financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the periods. We evaluate our estimates and judgments on an ongoing basis, including but not limited to, estimating the useful lives of long-lived assets, assessing the impairment of long-lived assets, stock-based compensation expenses, and the realizability of deferred income tax assets. We base our estimates on historical experience, known trends and events, contractual milestones and other various factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Changes in the accounting estimates are likely to occur from period to period. Actual results could be significantly different from these estimates. We believe that the accounting policies discussed below are critical to understanding our historical and future performance, as these policies relate to the more significant areas involving management's judgment and estimates.\nRevenue Recognition\n1.Oncology Innovation Platform\nThe Company out-licenses certain of its IP to other pharmaceutical companies in specific territories that allow the customer to use, develop, commercialize, or otherwise exploit the licensed IP. In accordance with ASC 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers ( Topic 606\u201d), the Company analyzes the contracts to identify its performance obligations within the contract. Most of the Company's out-license arrangements contain multiple performance obligations and variable pricing. After the performance obligations are identified, the Company determines the transaction price, which generally includes upfront fees, milestone payments related to the achievement of developmental, regulatory, or commercial goals, and royalty payments on net sales of licensed products. The Company considers whether the transaction price is fixed or variable, and whether such consideration is subject to return. Variable consideration is only included in the transaction price to the extent that it is probable that a significant reversal in the amount of cumulative revenue recognized will not occur when the uncertainty associated with the variable consideration is subsequently resolved. If any portion of the transaction price is constrained, it is excluded from the transaction price until the constraint no longer exists. The Company then allocates the transaction price to the performance obligation to which the consideration is related. Where a portion of the transaction price is received and allocated to continuing performance obligations under the terms of the arrangement, it is recorded as deferred revenue and recognized as revenue when (or as) the underlying performance obligation is satisfied.\nThe Company's contracts may contain one or multiple promises, including the license of IP and development services. The licensed IP related to the Company's approved and late-stage drug candidates is capable of being distinct from the other performance obligations identified in the contract and is distinct within the context of the contract, as upon transfer of the IP, the customer is able to use and benefit from it, and the customer could obtain the development services from other parties. The Company also considers the economic and regulatory characteristics of the licensed IP and other promises in the contract to determine if it is a distinct performance obligation. The Company considers if the IP is modified or enhanced by other performance obligations through the life of the agreement and whether the customer is contractually or practically required to use updated IP. The IP licensed by the Company has been determined to be functional IP. The IP is not modified during the license period and therefore, the Company recognizes revenues from any portion of the transaction price allocated to the licensed IP when the license is transferred to the customer and they can benefit from the right to use the IP. The Company recognized $0.5 million in license revenue from an out-license arrangement for the year ended December 31, 2021, and $37.7 million in license revenue, net of $2.3 million value added tax ( VAT\u201d), and $1.0 million in license revenue from two of the Company's out-license arrangements for the year ended December 31, 2020. The Company recognized revenue allocated to the licensed IP performance obligation upon transfer of the license of $0.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. During the year ended December 31, 2021, the Company received $2.0 million in upfront fees for a license of TRC-T technology, which was deemed not to be distinct, as the IP is in an early stage and is dependent on development activities to be performed by the Company, and $0.7 million for licenses of Klisyri in territories in which it is not yet approved and further development activities are required to be performed by the Company. Therefore these licenses of IP and the development services were considered a bundled performance obligation. As of December 31, 2021, this bundle of performance obligations was not satisfied and the corresponding $2.7 million was recorded as deferred revenue on the Company's consolidated balance sheet.\nOther performance obligations included in most of the Company's out-licensing agreements include performing development services to reach clinical and regulatory milestone events. The Company satisfies these performance obligations at a point-in-time, because the customer does not simultaneously receive and consume the benefits as the development occurs, the development does not create or enhance an asset controlled by the customer, and the development does not create an asset with no alternative use. The Company considers milestone payments to be variable consideration measured using the most likely amount method, as the entitlement to the consideration is contingent on the occurrence or nonoccurrence of future events. The Company allocates each variable milestone payment to the associated milestone performance obligation, as the variable payment relates directly to the Company's efforts to satisfy the performance obligation and such allocation depicts the amount of consideration to which the\nCompany expects to be entitled for satisfying the corresponding performance obligation. The Company re-evaluates the probability of achievement of such performance obligations and any related constraint and adjusts its estimate of the transaction price as appropriate. To date, no amounts have been constrained in the initial or subsequent assessments of the transaction price. The Company did not recognize revenue from other performance obligations included in the Company's out-licensing agreements during the years ended December 31, 2021 or 2020. The Company recognized revenue allocated to development performance obligations upon transfer to the customer of $20.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2019.\nCertain out-license agreements include performance obligations to manufacture and provide drug product in the future for commercial sale when the licensed product is approved. For the commercial, sales-based royalties, the consideration is predominantly related to the licensed IP and is contingent on the customer's subsequent sales to another commercial customer. Consequently, the sales- or usage-based royalty exception would apply. Revenue will be recognized for the commercial, sales-based milestones as the underlying sales occur. The Company recognized $25.0 million in commercial milestones and $1.0 million in royalties during the year ended December 31, 2021. No such revenues were recorded during 2020.\nThe Company exercises significant judgment when identifying distinct performance obligations within its out-license arrangements, determining the transaction price, which often includes both fixed and variable considerations, and allocating the transaction price to the proper performance obligation. The Company did not use any other significant judgments related to out-licensing revenue during the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020.\n2.Global Supply Chain Platform\nThe Company's Global Supply Chain Platform manufactures API for use internally in its research and development activities as well as its clinical studies, and for sale to pharmaceutical customers globally. The Company generates additional revenue on this platform, by providing small to mid-scale cGMP manufacturing of clinical and commercial products for pharmaceutical and biotech companies and selling pharmaceutical products under 503B regulations set forth by the U.S. FDA.\nRevenue earned by the Global Supply Platform is recognized when the Company has satisfied its performance obligation, which is the shipment or the delivery of drug products. The underlying contracts for these sales are generally purchase orders and the Company recognizes revenue at a point-in-time. Any remaining performance obligations related to product sales are the result of customer deposits and are reflected in the deferred revenue contract liability balance.\n3.Commercial Platform\nThe Company's Commercial Platform generates revenue by distributing specialty products through independent pharmaceutical wholesalers. The wholesalers then sell to an end-user, normally a hospital, alternative healthcare facility, or an independent pharmacy, at a lower price previously established by the end-user and the Company. Upon the sale by the wholesaler to the end-user, the wholesaler will chargeback the difference, if any, between the original list price and price at which the product was sold to the end-user. The Company also offers cash discounts, which approximate 2.3% of the gross sales price, as an incentive for prompt customer payment, and, consistent with industry practice, the Company's return policy permits customers to return products within a window of time before and after the expiration of product dating. Further, the Company offers contractual allowances, generally in the form of rebates or administrative fees, to certain wholesale customers, group purchasing organizations ( GPOs\u201d), and end-user customers, consistent with pharmaceutical industry practices. Revenues are recorded net of provisions for variable consideration, including discounts, rebates, GPO allowances, price adjustments, returns, chargebacks, promotional programs and other sales allowances. Accruals for these provisions are presented in the consolidated financial statements as reductions in determining net sales and as a contra asset in accounts receivable, net (if settled via credit) and other current liabilities (if paid in cash). As of December 31, 2021 and 2020, the Company's total provision for chargebacks and other deductions included as a reduction of accounts receivable totaled $22.9 million and $12.6 million, respectively. The Company's total provision for chargebacks and other revenue deductions was $129.0 million, $89.3 million, and $87.2 million for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019, respectively.\nThe Company exercises significant judgment in its estimates of the variable transaction price at the time of the sale and recognizes revenue when the performance obligation is satisfied. Factors that determine the final net transaction price include chargebacks, fees for service, cash discounts, rebates, returns, warranties, and other factors. The Company estimates all of these variables based on historical data obtained from previous sales finalized with the end-user customer on a product-by-product basis. At the time of sale, revenue is recorded net of each of these deductions. Through the normal course of business, the wholesaler will sell the product to the end-user, determining the actual chargeback, return products, and take advantage of cash discounts, charge fees for services, and claim warranties on products. The final transaction price per product is compared to the initial estimated net sale price and reviewed for accuracy. The final prices and other factors are immediately included in the Company's historical data from which it will estimate the transaction price for future sales. The underlying contracts for these sales are generally purchase orders including a single performance obligation, generally the shipment or delivery of products and the Company recognizes this revenue at a point-in-time.\nResearch and Development Expenses\nResearch and development expenses represent costs associated with developing our proprietary drug candidates, our collaboration agreements for such drugs, and our ongoing clinical studies.\nClinical trial costs are a significant component of our research and development expenses. We have a history of contracting with third parties that perform various clinical trial activities on our behalf in the ongoing development of our drug candidates. Expenses related to clinical trials are accrued based on our estimates of the actual services performed by the third parties for the respective period. If the contracted amounts are revised or the scope of a contract is revised, we will modify the accruals accordingly on a prospective basis and will do so in the period in which the facts that give rise to the revision become reasonably certain.\nGoodwill\nThe Company tests goodwill for impairment annually on October 1st, the Company's annual goodwill impairment measurement date, or more frequently if a triggering event occurs, and it updates its test with information that becomes available through the end of the period reported. The Company has three operating segments, each of which represents a separate reporting unit: Oncology Innovation Platform, Commercial Platform, and Global Supply Chain Platform. Each of the three reporting units has discrete financial information that is reviewed by segment managers. Goodwill was assigned to two reporting units: Oncology Innovation Platform and Global Supply Chain Platform. Goodwill impairment exists when the fair value of goodwill is less than its carrying value. The Company determined that an impairment triggering event occurred during the first quarter of 2021 and, consistent with our annual policy, performed a test as of our annual goodwill impairment evaluation date, October 1, 2021, subsequently updating that analysis to December 31, 2021 using new information that became available regarding conditions that existed as of December 31, 2021, and concluded that there was goodwill impairment of $67.7 million for the three months ended December 31, 2021. No impairment of goodwill was recorded for the years ended December 31, 2020, and 2019. See Part II, Item 8, Note 8 - Goodwill and Intangible Assets, Net, and Note 9 -Fair Value Measurements, for additional information.\nIntangible Assets, net\nIntangible assets arising from a business acquisition are recognized at fair value as of the acquisition date. The Company amortizes intangible assets using the straight-line method. When the straight-line method of amortization is utilized, the estimated useful life of the intangible asset is shortened to assure the recognition of amortization expense corresponds with the expected cash flows. Other purchased intangibles, including certain licenses, are capitalized at cost and amortized on a straight-line basis over the license life, when a future economic benefit is probable and measurable. If a future economic benefit is not probable or measurable, the license costs are expensed as incurred within research and development expenses. In-process research and development (\"IPR&D\") intangible assets are not amortized, but rather are reviewed for impairment on an annual basis or more frequently if indicators of impairment are present, until the project is completed, abandoned, or transferred to a third party.\nImpairment of Long-Lived Assets\nThe Company reviews the recoverability of its long-lived assets, excluding goodwill, when events or changes in circumstances occur that indicate that the carrying value of the asset may not be recoverable. The assessment of possible impairment is based on the ability to recover the carrying value of the assets from the expected future cash flows (undiscounted and without interest expense) of the related operations. If these cash flows are less than the carrying value of such assets, an impairment loss for the difference between the estimated fair value and carrying value is recorded. The Company determined that impairment indicators occurred during the first and fourth quarters of 2021 and concluded that there was impairment of intangible assets other than goodwill amounting to $1.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. See Part II, Item 8, Note 8 - Goodwill and Intangible Assets, net for additional details.\nBusiness Acquisitions\nThe Company accounts for acquired businesses using the acquisition method of accounting, which requires that assets acquired and liabilities assumed be recognized at their estimated fair values as of the acquisition date. Identifiable amortizing intangible assets are recorded on the consolidated balance sheet at fair value and amortized over their estimated useful lives. Acquisition-related costs are expensed as incurred. Any excess of the consideration transferred over the estimated fair values of the net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill.\nContingent Consideration\nContingent consideration arising from a business acquisition is included as part of the purchase price and is recorded at fair value as of the acquisition date. Subsequent to the acquisition date, the Company remeasures contingent consideration arrangements at fair value at each reporting period until the contingency is resolved. The changes in fair value are recognized within selling, general,\nand administrative expenses in the Company's consolidated statement of operations and comprehensive loss. Changes in fair values reflect new information about the likelihood of the payment of the contingent consideration and the passage of time.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nIn the normal course of business, we evaluate all new accounting pronouncements issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board, SEC, or other authoritative accounting bodies to determine the potential impact they may have on our Consolidated Financial Statements. Refer to Note 2 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Item 8 of this report for additional information about these recently issued accounting standards and their potential impact on our financial condition or results of operations.", "item_7_tables": "Table 6: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td>

biopharmaceutical company focused on developing innovative cancer treatments. The company has 3 business platforms: Oncology Innovation Platform for R&D of proprietary drugs, Commercial Platform for sales of specialty drugs, and Global Supply Chain Platform for manufacturing APIs and drug products. \n\n- In 2021, Athenex revenue was $120.2 million, down from $144.4 million in 2020, mainly due to decreased product sales in the Commercial Platform. Net loss in 2021 was $202 million compared to $148.4 million in 2020, primarily due to impairment charges, higher R&D costs, and increased interest expense.\n\n- The company is advancing cell therapy programs, including KUR-501 for neuroblastoma and KUR-502 for blood cancers, after acquiring Kuur Therapeutics in 2021. Development of other drug candidates like Oral Paclitaxel has been suspended to focus R&D resources on cell therapies.\n\n- Athenex has been operating at a loss since inception and has an accumulated deficit of $913 million as of Dec 2021. The company expects to continue incurring losses as it advances its R&D programs. Additional funding will be needed to support operations.\n\n- As of Dec 2021, Athenex had $35 million in cash and cash equivalents. The company is implementing cost savings and plans to monetize assets to extend its cash runway into 2022. Access to additional capital is uncertain. The company has concluded there is substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern.\n\nIn summary, Athenex is focused on developing innovative cancer drugs but is facing financial challenges due to operating losses. The company is working to advance its cell therapy R&D programs while trying to extend its cash runway by cutting costs and monetizing assets."}
