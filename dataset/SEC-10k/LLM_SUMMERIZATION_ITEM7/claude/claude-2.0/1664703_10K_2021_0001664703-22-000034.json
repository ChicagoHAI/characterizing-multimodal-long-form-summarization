We created the first large-scale, commercially viable solid oxide fuel-cell based power generation platform that empowers businesses, essential services, critical infrastructure and communities to responsibly take charge of their energy.\nOur technology, invented in the United States, is one of the most advanced electricity and hydrogen producing technologies on the market today. Our fuel-flexible Bloom Energy Servers can use biogas, hydrogen, natural gas, or a blend of fuels to create resilient, sustainable and cost-predictable power at significantly higher efficiencies than traditional, combustion-based resources. In addition, our same solid oxide platform that powers our fuel cells can be used to create hydrogen, which is increasingly recognized as a critically important tool necessary for the full decarbonization of the energy economy. Our enterprise customers include some of the largest multinational corporations in the world. We also have strong relationships with some of the largest utility companies in the United States and the Republic of Korea.\nAt Bloom Energy, we look forward to a net-zero future. Our technology is designed to help enable this future in order to deliver reliable, low-carbon, electricity in a world facing unacceptable levels of power disruptions. Our resilient platform has kept electricity available for our customers through hurricanes, earthquakes, typhoons, forest fires, extreme heat and grid failures. Unlike traditional combustion power generation, our platform is community-friendly and designed to significantly reduce emissions of criteria air pollutants. We have made tremendous progress making renewable fuel production a reality through our biogas, hydrogen and electrolyzer programs, and we believe that we are well-positioned as a core platform and fixture in the new energy paradigm to help organizations and communities achieve their net-zero objectives.\nWe market and sell our Energy Servers primarily through our direct sales organization in the United States, and also have direct and indirect sales channels internationally. Recognizing that deploying our solutions requires a material financial commitment, we have developed a number of financing options to support sales of our Energy Servers to customers who lack the financial capability to purchase our Energy Servers directly, who prefer to finance the acquisition using third-party financing or who prefer to contract for our services on a pay-as-you-go model.\nOur typical target commercial or industrial customer has historically been either an investment-grade entity or a customer with investment-grade attributes such as size, assets and revenue, liquidity, geographically diverse operations and general financial stability. We have also expanded our product and financing options to the below-investment-grade customers and have also expanded internationally to target customers with deployments on a wholesale grid. Given that our customers are typically large institutions with multi-level decision making processes, we generally experience a lengthy sales process.\nStrategic Investment\nOn October 23, 2021, we entered into the SPA with SK ecoplant in connection with a strategic partnership. Pursuant to the SPA, on December 29, 2021, we sold to SK ecoplant 10 million shares of zero coupon, non-voting redeemable convertible Series A preferred stock in us, par value $0.0001 per share (\"RCPS\"), at a purchase price of $25.50 per share for an aggregate purchase price of $255 million (the \"Initial Investment\").\nSimultaneous with the execution of the SPA, we and SK ecoplant executed an amendment to the Joint Venture Agreement (\"JVA\"), an amendment and restatement to our Preferred Distribution Agreement (\"PDA Restatement\") and a new Commercial Cooperation Agreement regarding initiatives pertaining to the hydrogen market and general market expansion for the Bloom Energy Server and Bloom Energy Electrolyzer. For additional details about the transaction with SK ecoplant, please see Note 18 - SK ecoplant Strategic Investment, and for more information about our joint venture with SK ecoplant, please see Note 12 - Related Party Transactions in Part II, Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\nCOVID-19 Pandemic\nGeneral\nWe continue to monitor and adjust as appropriate our operations in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, including the Omicron variant. As a technology company that supplies resilient, reliable and clean energy, we have been able to conduct the majority of operations as an essential business\u201d in California and Delaware, where we manufacture and perform many of our\nTable 50: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Table of Contents\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Index to Financial Statements\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nR&D activities, as well as in other states and countries where we are installing or maintaining our Energy Servers. Many of our employees continue to work from home as a result of the spread of the Omicron variant unless they are directly supporting essential manufacturing production operations, installation work, and service and maintenance activities as well as some R&D and general administrative functions. We maintain protocols to minimize the risk of COVID-19 transmission within our facilities, including enhanced cleaning and masking if required by the local authorities, as well as providing testing for all employees. We will continue to follow CDC and local guidelines when notified of possible exposures. For more information regarding the risks posed to our company by the COVID-19 pandemic, refer to Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors - Risks Related to Our Products and Manufacturing - Our business has been and continues to be adversely affected by the COVID-19 pandemic.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nCOVID-19 created disruptions throughout various aspects of our business as noted herein, and impacted our results of operations in the year ended December 31, 2021. While we improved our liquidity in 2020, we increased our working capital spend in the first half of 2021. We have entered into new leases to maintain sufficient manufacturing facilities to meet anticipated demand in 2022, including new product line expansion. In addition, we also increased our working capital spend and resources to enhance our marketing efforts and to expand into new geographies both domestically and internationally.\nWe believe we have the sufficient capital to run our business over the next 12 months, including the completion of the build out of our manufacturing facilities. Our working capital was strengthened with the Initial Investment by SK ecoplant as described above. In addition, we may still enter the equity or debt market as need to support the expansion of our business. Please refer to Note 7 - Outstanding Loans and Security Agreements in Part II, Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data; and Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors - Risks Related to Our Liquidity - Our substantial indebtedness, and restrictions imposed by the agreements governing our and our PPA Entities' outstanding indebtedness, may limit our financial and operating activities and may adversely affect our ability to incur additional debt to fund future needs, and We may not be able to generate sufficient cash to meet our debt service obligations, for more information regarding the terms of and risks associated with our debt.\nSales\nWe did not experience a significant impact on our selling activity related to COVID-19 during the year ended December 31, 2021.\nCustomer Financing\nThe ongoing COVID-19 pandemic resulted in a significant drop in the ability of many financiers (particularly financing institutions) to monetize tax credits, primarily the result of a potential drop in taxable income stemming from the pandemic. However, during the last two quarters, we began to see this constraint improving. Our ability to obtain financing for our Energy Servers partly depends on the creditworthiness of our customers, and a few of our customers' credit ratings have fallen during the pandemic, which can impact the financing for their use of an Energy Server. We continue to work on obtaining the financing required for our 2022 installations but if we are unable to secure such financing our revenue, cash flow and liquidity will be materially impacted.\nInstallations and Maintenance of Energy Servers\nOur installation and maintenance operations were impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic in 2021. Our installation projects have experienced some delays relating to, among other things, shortages in available parts and labor for design, installation and other work; and the inability or delay in our ability to access customer facilities due to shutdowns or other restrictions. Despite the impact on installations during the year ended December 31, 2021 and given our mitigation strategies, we only had one instance of a significant delay in the installation of our Energy Servers as a result of supply chain issues that pushed an installation out a quarter.\nAs to maintenance, if we are delayed in or unable to perform scheduled or unscheduled maintenance, our previously-installed Energy Servers will likely experience adverse performance impacts including reduced output and/or efficiency, which could result in warranty and/or guaranty claims by our customers. Further, due to the nature of our Energy Servers, if we are unable to replace worn parts in accordance with our standard maintenance schedule, we may be subject to increased costs in the future. During the year ended December 31, 2021, we experienced no delays in servicing our Energy Servers due to COVID-19.\nTable 51: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Table of Contents\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Index to Financial Statements\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nSupply Chain\nDuring 2021, we experienced COVID-19 related delays from certain vendors and suppliers, although we were able to mitigate the impact so that we did not experience delays in the manufacture of our Energy Servers and experienced only one significant delay in the installation of our Energy Servers as mentioned above. We have a global supply chain and obtain components from Asia, Europe and India. In many cases, the components we obtain are jointly developed with our suppliers and unique to us, which makes it difficult to obtain and qualify alternative suppliers should our suppliers be impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic or related effects.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2021, we continued to experience supply chain disruptions due to direct and indirect COVID-19 impacts. There have been a number of disruptions throughout the global supply chain as the global economy opens up and drives demand for certain components that has outpaced the return of the global supply chain to full production. Although we were able to find alternatives for many component shortages, we experienced some delays and cost increases with respect to container shortages, ocean shipping and air freight. We have put actions in place to mitigate the disruptions by booking alternate sea routes, limiting our use of air shipments, creating virtual hubs and consolidating shipments coming from the same region. During the three months ended December 31, 2021, we continued to manage disruptions from an increase in lead times for most of our components due to a variety of factors, including supply shortages, shipping delays and labor shortages, and we expect this to continue through the first half of 2022. We expect raw material pricing pressures and component shortages especially for semiconductors and specialty metals to persist at least through this time period. In addition, the impact of inflation on the price of components, raw materials and labor may result in increased prices. In the event we are unable to mitigate the impact of delays and/or price increases in raw materials, electronic components and freight, it could delay the manufacturing and installation of our Energy Servers and increase the cost of our Energy Server, which would adversely impact our cash flows and results of operations, including revenue and gross margin.\nIf spikes in COVID-19 occur in regions in which our supply chain operates, including as a result of the Delta or Omicron variant, we could experience a delay in components and incur further freight price increases, which could in turn impact production and installations and our cash flow and results of operations, including revenue and gross margin.\nManufacturing\nAlthough we have experienced labor shortages due to COVID-19 absences and the relative shortage of labor, overall this has not impacted our production given the safety protocols we have put in place augmented by our ability to increase our shifts and obtain a contingent work force for some of the manufacturing activities. We have incurred additional labor expense due to enhanced safety protocols designed to minimize exposure and risk of COVID-19 transmission as well as increased wages in general. If COVID-19 materially impacts our supply chain or if we experience a significant COVID-19 outbreak that affects our manufacturing workforce, our production could be adversely impacted which could adversely impact our cash flow and results of operation, including revenue.\nPurchase and Financing Options\nOverview\nIn order to appeal to the largest variety of customers, we make available several options to our customers. Both in the United States and abroad, we sell Energy Servers directly to customers. In the United States, we also enable customers' use of the Energy Servers through a pay as you go offering, made possible through third-party ownership financing arrangements.\nOften our offerings take advantage of local incentives. In the United States, our financing arrangements are structured to optimize both federal and local incentives, including the ITC and accelerated depreciation. Internationally, our sales are made primarily to distributors who on-sell to, and install for, customers; these deals are also structured to use local incentives applicable to our Energy Servers. Increasingly, we use trusted installers and other sourcing collaborations in the United States to generate transactions.\nWhichever option is selected by a customer in the Unites States or internationally, the contract structure will include obligations on our part to operate and maintain the Energy Server ( O&M Obligations\u201d). The O&M Obligations may either be (i) for a one-year period, subject to annual renewal at the customer's option, which historically are almost always renewed year over year, or (ii) for a fixed term. In the United States, the contract structure often includes obligations on our part to install the Energy Servers ( Installation Obligations\u201d). Consequently, our transactions may generate revenue from the sale of Energy Servers and electricity, performance of O&M Obligations, and performance of Installation Obligations.\nIn addition to customary workmanship and materials warranties, as part of the O&M Obligations we provide warranties and guaranties regarding the efficiency and output of our Energy Servers to the customer and, in certain financing structures, to\nTable 52: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Table of Contents\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Index to Financial Statements\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nthe financing parties too. We refer to a performance warranty\u201d as an obligation to repair or replace the Energy Servers as necessary to return performance of an Energy Server to the warranted performance level. We refer to a performance guaranty\u201d as an obligation to make a payment to compensate for the failure of the Energy Server to meet the guaranteed performance level. Our obligation to make payments under the performance guaranty is always contractually capped.\nEnergy Server Sales\nThere are customers who purchase our Energy Servers directly from us pursuant to customary equipment sales contracts. In connection with the purchase of Energy Servers, the customers also enter into a contract with us for the O&M Obligations. The customer may elect to engage us to provide the Installation Obligations or engage a third-party provider. Internationally, sales often occur through distribution arrangements pursuant to which local construction services providers perform the Installation Obligations, as is the case in the Republic of Korea; we contract directly with the customer to provide O&M Obligations.\nA customer may enter into a contract for the sale of our Energy Servers and finance that acquisition through a sale-leaseback with a financial institution. In most cases, the financial institution completes its purchase from us immediately after commissioning. We both (i) facilitate this financing arrangement between the financial institution and the customer and (ii) provide ongoing operations and maintenance services for the Energy Servers (such arrangement, a Traditional Lease\u201d).\nCustomer Financing Options\nWith respect to the third-party financing options in the United States, a customer may choose a contract for the use Energy Servers in exchange for a capacity-based flat payment (a Managed Services Agreement\u201d) or one for the purchase of electricity generated by the Energy Servers in exchange for a scheduled dollars per kilowatt hour rate (a Power Purchase Agreement\u201d or PPA\u201d).\nCertain customer payments in a Managed Services Agreement are required regardless of the level of performance of the Energy Server; in some cases it may also include a variable payment based on the Energy Server's performance or a performance-related set-off. Managed Services Agreements are then financed pursuant to a sale-leaseback with a financial institution (a Managed Services Financing\u201d).\nPPAs are typically financed on a portfolio basis. We have financed portfolios through tax equity partnerships, acquisition financings and direct sales to investors (each, a Portfolio Financing\u201d).\nIn the United States, our capacity to offer our Energy Servers through either of these financed arrangements depends in large part on the ability of financing parties to optimize the tax benefits associated with a fuel cell, such as the ITC or accelerated depreciation. Interest rate fluctuations, and internationally, currency exchanges fluctuations, may also impact the attractiveness of any financing offerings for our customers. Our ability to finance a Managed Services Agreement or a PPA is also related to, and may be limited by, the creditworthiness of the customer. Additionally, the Managed Services Financing option is limited by a customer's willingness to commit to making payments to a financing party regardless of the level of performance of the Energy Server.\nIn each of our financing options, we typically perform the functions of a project developer, including identifying end customers and financiers, leading the negotiations of the customer agreements and financing agreements, securing all necessary permitting and interconnections approvals, and overseeing the design and construction of the project up to and including commissioning the Energy Servers. Increasingly, however, we are making sales to third-party developers.\nEach of our financing transaction structures is described in further detail below.\nTable 53: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Table of Contents\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Index to Financial Statements\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nManaged Services Financing\nUnder our Managed Services Financing option, we enter into a Managed Services Agreement with a customer for a certain term. The fixed capacity-based payments made by the customer under the Managed Services Agreement are applied toward our obligation to pay down our periodic rent liability under a sale-leaseback transaction with a financier. We assign all our rights to such fixed payments made by the customer to the financier, as lessor.\nOnce we enter into a Managed Services Agreement with the customer, and a financier is identified, we sell the Energy Server to the financier, as lessor, who then leases it back to us, as lessee, pursuant to a sale-leaseback transaction. Certain of our sale-leaseback transactions failed to achieve all of the criteria for sale accounting. For such failed sale-and-leaseback transactions, the proceeds from the transaction are recognized as a financing obligation within our consolidated balance sheet. For successful sale-and-leaseback transactions, the financier of a Managed Services Agreement typically pays the purchase price for an Energy Server at or around acceptance, and we recognize the fair value of the Energy Servers sold within product and install revenue and recognize a right-of-use (\"ROU\") asset and a lease liability on our consolidated balance sheet. Any proceeds in excess of the fair value of the Energy Servers are recognized as a financing obligation.\nThe duration of our current Managed Services Agreement offerings is between five and ten years.\nOur Managed Services Agreements typically provide for performance warranties of both the efficiency and output of the Energy Server and may include other warranties depending on the type of deployment. We often structure payments from the\nTable 54: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Table of Contents\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Index to Financial Statements\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\ncustomer as a dollars per kilowatt-hour payment and our pricing assumes revenue at the 95% output level. This means that our revenue may be lower than expected if output is less than 95% and higher if output exceeds 95%. As of December 31, 2021, we had incurred no liabilities due to failure to repair or replace our Energy Servers pursuant to these performance warranties and the fleet of our Energy Servers deployed pursuant to the Managed Services Financings was performing at a lifetime average output of approximately 85%.\nPortfolio Financings\nIn the past, we financed the Energy Servers subject to our PPAs through two types of Portfolio Financings. In one type of transaction, we sold a portfolio of PPAs to a tax equity partnership in which we held a managing member interest (such partnership in which we hold an interest, a PPA Entity\u201d). In these transactions, we sold the portfolio of Energy Servers to a limited liability project company of which the PPA Entity was the sole member (such portfolio owner, a Portfolio Company\u201d). Whether an investor, a tax equity partnership, or a single member limited liability company, the Portfolio Company is the entity that directly owns the portfolio. The Portfolio Company sells the electricity generated by the Energy Servers contemplated by the PPAs to the customers. We recognize revenue as the electricity is produced. Our current practices no longer contemplate these types of transactions.\nWe also finance PPAs through a second type of Portfolio Financing pursuant to which we (i) directly sell a portfolio of PPAs and the Energy Servers or (ii) sell a Portfolio Company, in each case to an investor or tax equity partnership in which we do not have an equity interest (a Third-Party PPA\u201d). Like the other Portfolio Financing structure, the investor or tax equity partnership owns the Portfolio Company or the Energy Servers directly, and in each case, sells the electricity generated by the Energy Servers contemplated by the PPAs to the customers. For further discussion, see Note 11 - Portfolio Financings in Part II, Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\nWhen we finance a portfolio of Energy Servers and PPAs through a Portfolio Financing, we typically enter into a sale, engineering and procurement and construction agreement ( EPC Agreement\u201d) and an O&M Agreement, with the Portfolio Company. As owner of the portfolio of PPAs and related Energy Servers, the Portfolio Company receives all customer payments generated under the PPAs, the benefits of the ITC and accelerated tax depreciation, and any other available state or local benefits arising out of the ownership or operation of the Energy Servers, to the extent not already allocated to the customer under the PPA.\nTable 55: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Table of Contents\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Index to Financial Statements\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe sales of our Energy Servers in connection with a Portfolio Financing have many of the same terms and conditions as a direct sale. Payment of the purchase price is generally broken down into multiple installments, which may include payments prior to shipment, upon shipment or delivery of the Energy Server, and upon acceptance of the Energy Server.\nUnder an O&M Agreement, a one-year service package is provided with the initial sale that includes performance warranties and performance guaranties. After the expiration of the initial standard one-year package, the Portfolio Company has the option to extend our services under the O&M Agreement on an annual basis at a price determined at the time of purchase of our Energy Server. After the standard one-year service package, the Portfolio Company has almost always exercised the option to renew our services under the O&M Agreement.\nAs of December 31, 2021, we had incurred no liabilities to investors in Portfolio Financings due to failure to repair or replace Energy Servers pursuant to these performance warranties. Our obligation to make payments for underperformance against the performance guaranties was capped at an aggregate total of approximately $114.6 million (including payments both for low output and for low efficiency) and our aggregate remaining potential liability under this cap was approximately $104.4 million.\nObligations to Portfolio Companies\nOur Portfolio Financings involve many obligations on our part to the Portfolio Company. These obligations are set forth in the applicable EPC Agreement and O&M Agreement, and may include some or all of the following obligations:\n\u2022designing, manufacturing, and installing the Energy Servers, and selling such Energy Servers to the Portfolio Company;\n\u2022obtaining all necessary permits and other governmental approvals necessary for the installation and operation of the Energy Servers, and maintaining such permits and approvals throughout the term of the EPC Agreements and O&M Agreements;\n\u2022operating and maintaining the Energy Servers in compliance with all applicable laws, permits and regulations;\n\u2022satisfying the performance warranties and guaranties set forth in the applicable O&M Agreements; and\n\u2022complying with any other specific requirements contained in the PPAs with customers.\nIn some cases, the EPC Agreement obligates us to repurchase the Energy Server in the event of certain IP Infringement claims. In others, a repurchase of the Energy Server is only one optional remedy we have to cure an IP Infringement claim. The O&M Agreement grants a Portfolio Company the right to obligate us to repurchase the Energy Servers in the event the Energy Servers fail to comply with the performance warranties and guaranties in the O&M Agreement and we do not cure such failure in the applicable time period, or that a PPA terminates as a result of any failure by us to perform the obligations in the O&M Agreement. In some of our Portfolio Financings, our obligation to repurchase Energy Servers under the O&M extends to the entire fleet of Energy Servers sold in the event a systemic failure that affects more than a specified number of Energy Servers.\nIn some Portfolio Financings, we have also agreed to pay liquidated damages to the applicable Portfolio Company in the event of delays in the manufacture and installation of our Energy Servers, either in the form of a cash payment or a reduction in the purchase price for the applicable Energy Servers.\nAdministration of Portfolio Companies\nIn each of our Portfolio Financings in which we hold an equity interest in the PPA Entity, we perform certain administrative services as managing member, including invoicing the end customers for amounts owed under the PPAs, administering the cash receipts of the Portfolio Company in accordance with the requirements of the financing arrangements, interfacing with applicable regulatory agencies, and other similar obligations. We are compensated for these services on a fixed dollar-per-kilowatt basis.\nFor those Portfolio Financings with project debt, the Portfolio Company owned by each of our PPA Entities (with the exception of one PPA Entity) incurred debt in order to finance the acquisition of the Energy Servers. The lenders for these transactions are a combination of banks and/or institutional investors. In each case, the debt is secured by all of the assets of the applicable Portfolio Company, such assets being primarily comprised of the Energy Servers and a collateral assignment of each of the contracts to which the Portfolio Company is a party, including the O&M Agreement and the PPAs. As further collateral, the lenders receive a security interest in 100% of the membership interest of the Portfolio Company. The lenders have no\nTable 56: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Table of Contents\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Index to Financial Statements\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nrecourse to us or to any of the other equity investors (the \"Equity Investors\") in the Portfolio Company for liabilities arising out of the portfolio.\nWe have determined that we are the primary beneficiary in the PPA Entities, subject to reassessments performed as a result of upgrade transactions. Accordingly, we consolidate 100% of the assets, liabilities and operating results of these PPA Entities, including the Energy Servers and lease income, in our consolidated financial statements. We recognize the Equity Investors' share of the net assets of the investment entities as noncontrolling interests in subsidiaries in our consolidated balance sheet. We recognize the amounts that are contractually payable to these investors in each period as distributions to noncontrolling interests in our consolidated statements of redeemable convertible preferred stock, redeemable noncontrolling interest, stockholders' (deficit) equity and noncontrolling interest.\nOur consolidated statements of cash flows reflect cash received from the Equity Investors as proceeds from investments by noncontrolling interests in subsidiaries. Our consolidated statements of cash flows also reflect cash paid to these investors as distributions paid to noncontrolling interests in subsidiaries. We reflect any unpaid distributions to these Equity Investors as distributions payable to noncontrolling interests in subsidiaries on our consolidated balance sheets. However, the PPA Entities are separate and distinct legal entities, and Bloom Energy Corporation may not receive cash or other distributions from the PPA Entities except in certain limited circumstances and upon the satisfaction of certain conditions, such as compliance with applicable debt service coverage ratios and the achievement of a targeted internal rates of return to the Equity Investors, or otherwise.\nFor further information about our Portfolio Financings, see Note 11 - Portfolio Financings in Part II, Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\nDelivery and Installation\nThe transfer of control of our product to our customer based on the delivery and installations of our products has a significant impact on the timing of the recognition of product and installation revenue. Many factors can cause a lag between the time that a customer signs a contract and our recognition of product revenue. These factors include the number of Energy Servers installed per site, local permitting and utility requirements, environmental, health and safety requirements, weather, customer facility construction schedules, customers' operational considerations and the timing of financing. Many of these factors are unpredictable and their resolution is often outside of our or our customers' control. Customers may also ask us to delay an installation for reasons unrelated to the foregoing, such as, for sales contracts, delays in their obtaining financing. Further, due to unexpected delays, deployments may require unanticipated expenses to expedite delivery of materials or labor to ensure the installation meets the timing objectives. These unexpected delays and expenses can be exacerbated in periods in which we deliver and install a larger number of smaller projects. In addition, if even relatively short delays occur, there may be a significant shortfall between the revenue we expect to generate in a particular period and the revenue that we are able to recognize.\nInternational Channel Partners\nIndia. In India, sales activities are currently conducted by Bloom Energy (India) Pvt. Ltd., our wholly-owned subsidiary; however, we continue to evaluate the Indian market to determine whether the use of channel partners would be a beneficial go-to-market strategy to grow our India market sales.\nJapan. In Japan, sales were previously conducted pursuant to a Japanese joint venture established between us and subsidiaries of SoftBank Corp., called Bloom Energy Japan Limited (\"Bloom Energy Japan\"). Under this arrangement, we sold Energy Servers to Bloom Energy Japan and we recognized revenue once the Energy Servers left the port in the United States. Bloom Energy Japan then entered into the contract with the end customer and performed all installation work as well as some of the operations and maintenance work. As of July 1, 2021, we acquired Softbank Corp.'s interest in Bloom Energy Japan for a cash payment and are now the sole owner of Bloom Energy Japan.\nThe Republic of Korea. In 2018, Bloom Energy Japan consummated a sale of Energy Servers in the Republic of Korea to Korea South-East Power Company. Following this sale, we entered into a Preferred Distributor Agreement in November 2018 with SK ecoplant for the marketing and sale of Bloom Energy Servers for the stationary utility and commercial and industrial South Korean power market.\nAs part of our expanded strategic partnership with SK ecoplant, the parties executed the PDA Restatement in October 2021, which incorporates previously amended terms and establishes: (i) SK ecoplant's purchase commitments for the next three years (on a take or pay basis) for Bloom Energy Servers; (ii) rollover procedures; (iii) premium pricing for product and\nTable 57: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Table of Contents\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Index to Financial Statements\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nservices; (iv) termination procedures for material breaches; and (v) procedures if there are material changes to the Republic of Korea Hydrogen Portfolio Standard. For additional details about the transaction with SK ecoplant, please see Note 18 - SK ecoplant Strategic Investment.\nUnder the terms of the PDA Restatement, we (or our subsidiary) contract directly with the customer to provide operations and maintenance services for the Energy Servers. We have established a subsidiary in the Republic of Korea, Bloom Energy Korea, LLC, to which we subcontract such operations and maintenance services. The terms of the operations and maintenance are negotiated on a case-by-case basis with each customer, but are generally expected to provide the customer with the option to receive services for at least 10 years, and for up to the life of the Energy Servers.\nSK ecoplant Joint Venture Agreement. In September 2019, we entered into a joint venture agreement with SK ecoplant to establish a light-assembly facility in the Republic of Korea for sales of certain portions of our Energy Server for the stationary utility and commercial and industrial market in the Republic of Korea. The joint venture is majority controlled and managed by us, with the facility, which became operational in July 2020. Other than a nominal initial capital contribution by Bloom Energy, the joint venture will be funded by SK ecoplant. SK ecoplant, who currently acts as a distributor for our Energy Servers for the stationary utility and commercial and industrial market in the Republic of Korea, is our primary customer for the products assembled by the joint venture. In October 2021, as part of our expanded strategic partnership with SK ecoplant, the parties agreed to amend the JVA, which increases the scope of the assembly work done in the joint venture facility.\nCommunity Distributed Generation Programs\nIn July 2015, the state of New York introduced its Community Distributed Generation (\"CDG\") program, which extends New York's net metering program in order to allow utility customers to receive net metering credits for electricity generated by distributed generation assets located on the utility's grid but not physically connected to the customer's facility. This program allows for the use of multiple generation technologies, including fuel cells. Since then other states have instituted similar programs and we expect that other states may do so as well in the future. In June 2020, the New York Public Service Commission issued an Order that limited the CDG compensation structure for high capacity factor resources,\u201d including fuel cells, in a way that will make the economics for these types of projects more challenging in the future. However, projects already under contract were grandfathered into the program under the previous compensation structure.\nWe have entered into sales, installation, operations and maintenance agreements with three developers for the deployment of our Energy Servers pursuant to the New York CDG program for a total of 441 systems. As of December 31, 2021, we have recognized revenue associated with 271 systems. We continue to believe that these types of subscriber-based programs could be a source of future revenue and will continue to look to generate sales through these programs in the future.\nComparison of the Years Ended December 31, 2021 and 2020\nA discussion regarding our results of operations for 2021 compared to 2020 is presented in this section. A discussion of 2020 to 2019 can be found under Item 7 of Part II of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2020, which is available free of charge on the SEC's website at www.sec.gov and the Investor section of our website at www.bloomenergy.com.\nKey Operating Metrics\nIn addition to the measures presented in the consolidated financial statements, we use certain key operating metrics below to evaluate business activity, to measure performance, to develop financial forecasts and to make strategic decisions:\n\u2022Product accepted - the number of customer acceptances of our Energy Servers in any period. We recognize revenue when an acceptance is achieved. We use this metric to measure the volume of deployment activity. We measure each Energy Server manufactured, shipped and accepted in terms of 100 kilowatt equivalents.\n\u2022Product costs of product accepted in the period (per kilowatt) - the average unit product cost for the Energy Servers that are accepted in a period. We use this metric to provide insight into the trajectory of product costs and, in particular, the effectiveness of cost reduction activities.\n\u2022Period costs of manufacturing expenses not included in product costs - the manufacturing and related operating costs that are incurred to procure parts and manufacture Energy Servers that are not included as part of product costs. We use this metric to measure any costs incurred to run our manufacturing operations that are not capitalized (i.e.,\nTable 58: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Table of Contents\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Index to Financial Statements\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nabsorbed, such as stock-based compensation) into inventory and therefore, expensed to our consolidated statement of operations in the period that they are incurred.\n\u2022Installation costs on product accepted (per kilowatt) - the average unit installation cost for Energy Servers that are accepted in a given period. This metric is used to provide insight into the trajectory of install costs and, in particular, to evaluate whether our installation costs are in line with our installation billings.\nWe no longer consider billings related to our products to be a key operating metric. Billings as a metric was introduced to provide insight into our customer contract billings as differentiated from revenue when a significant portion of those customer contracts had product and installation billings recognized as electricity revenue over the term of the contract instead of at the time of delivery or acceptance. Today, a very small portion of our customer contracts has revenue recognized over the term of the contract, and thus it is no longer a meaningful metric for us.\nAcceptances\nWe use acceptances as a key operating metric to measure the volume of our completed Energy Server installation activity from period to period. Acceptance typically occurs upon transfer of control to our customers, which depending on the contract terms is when the system is shipped and delivered to our customer, when the system is shipped and delivered and is physically ready for startup and commissioning, or when the system is shipped and delivered and is turned on and producing power.\nThe product acceptances in the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 were as follows:\nTable 59: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Years Ended\nDecember 31, </td> <td> </td> <td>Change </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2021 </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>Amount </td> <td> </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Product accepted during the period\n(in 100 kilowatt systems) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,879 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,326 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>553 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>41.7 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table>\nProduct accepted for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to the same period in 2020 increased by 553 systems, or 41.7%, as demand increased for our Energy Servers in the Republic of Korea and the utility sector where we accepted 196 systems as part of the CDG program.\nOur customers have several purchase options for our Energy Servers.

accepted for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to the same period in 2020 decreased by approximately $49 per kilowatt driven generally by our ongoing cost reduction efforts to reduce material costs in conjunction with our suppliers and our reduction in labor and overhead costs through increased volume, improved processes and automation at our manufacturing facilities. This decrease was partially offset by increases in freight and other supply chain-related pricing pressures.\nPeriod costs of manufacturing related expenses for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to the same period in 2020 increased by approximately $3.2 million primarily driven by increases in freight charges and other supply chain-related pricing pressures.\nInstallation costs on product accepted for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to the same period in 2020 decreased by approximately $339 per kilowatt. For the year ended December 31, 2021, the decrease in install cost was driven by site mix as many of the acceptances did not have installation, either because the installation was done by our distribution channel partner in the Republic of Korea or the final installation associated with a specific customer was scheduled to be completed at a later date although the Energy Servers were delivered and accepted during the period.\nTable 64: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Table of Contents\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Index to Financial Statements\n</td>

This increase was primarily driven by a $144.9 million increase in product revenue and a $34.6 million increase in service revenue partially offset by price reductions to expand our addressable market and $14.2 million of previously deferred revenue related to a specific contract that changed scope and was recognized in the year ended December 31, 2020.\nProduct Revenue\nProduct revenue increased by $144.9 million, or 27.9%, for the year ended December 31, 2021 as compared to the prior year period. The product revenue increase was driven primarily by a 41.7% increase in product acceptances as a result of expansion in existing markets and in our CDG program partially offset by price reductions to expand our addressable market and a $14.2 million of previously deferred revenue related to a specific contract that changed scope and was recognized in the year ended December 31, 2020.\nInstallation Revenue\nInstallation revenue decreased by $5.8 million, or (5.7)%, for the year ended December 31, 2021 as compared to the prior year period. This decrease in installation revenue was driven by site mix as many of the acceptances did not have installation, either because the installation was done by our distribution channel partner in the Republic of Korea or the final installation associated with a specific customer was scheduled to be completed at a later date although the Energy Servers were delivered and accepted during the period. We expect our installation revenue to continue to decline as percentage of total revenue as we ramp up shipments to SK ecoplant under PDA Restatement.\nService Revenue\nService revenue increased by $34.6 million, or 31.5%, for the year ended December 31, 2021 as compared to the prior year period. This increase was primarily due to the continued growth of our installation base driven by both an increase in new acceptances and renewal of existing service contracts. We expect our service revenue growth at a similar rate as we continue to expand our install base.\nElectricity Revenue\nElectricity revenue increased by $4.3 million, or 6.8%, for the year ended December 31, 2021 as compared to the prior year period due to the increase in Managed Services Financings.\nTable 66: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Table of

to the prior year period primarily driven by a $138.9 million increase in cost of product revenue, $16.0 million increase in cost of service revenue, increased freight charges and other supply chain-related pricing pressures. This increase was partially offset by a $6.3 million decrease in cost of installation revenue and our ongoing cost reduction efforts to reduce material costs in conjunction with our suppliers and our reduction in labor and overhead costs through increased volume, improved processes and automation at our manufacturing facilities.\nCost of Product Revenue\nCost of product revenue increased by $138.9 million, or 41.8%, for the year ended December 31, 2021 as compared to the prior year period. The cost of product revenue increase was driven primarily by a 41.7% increase in product acceptances, increased freight charges and other supply chain-related pricing pressures. This increase was partially offset by our ongoing cost reduction efforts to reduce material costs in conjunction with our suppliers and our reduction in labor and overhead costs through increased volume, improved processes and automation at our manufacturing facilities.\nCost of Installation Revenue\nCost of installation revenue decreased by $6.3 million, or (5.4)%, for the year ended December 31, 2021 as compared to the prior year period. This decrease, similar to the $5.8 million decrease in installation revenue, was driven by site mix as many of the acceptances did not have installation in the year ended December 31, 2021.\nCost of Service Revenue\nCost of service revenue increased by $16.0 million, or 12.1%, for the year ended December 31, 2021 as compared to the prior year period. This increase was primarily due to the 41.7% increase in acceptances plus the maintenance contract renewals associated with the increase in our fleet of Energy Servers, partially offset by the significant improvements in power module life, cost reductions and our actions to proactively manage fleet optimizations.\nCost of Electricity Revenue\nCost of electricity revenue decreased by $2.4 million, or (5.2)%, for the year ended December 31, 2021 as compared to the prior year period, primarily due to the $1.2 million change in the fair value of the natural gas fixed price forward contract and lower property tax expenses partially offset by the increase in Managed Services Financings.\nTable 68: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Table of Contents\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Index to Financial Statements\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nGross Profit and Gross Margin\nTable 69: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Years Ended\nDecember 31, </td> <td> </td> <td>Change </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2021 </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(dollars in thousands) </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gross profit: </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Product </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>191,858 </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>185,909 </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>5,949 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Installation </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(14,155) </td> <td> </td> <td>(14,655) </td> <td> </td> <td>500 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Service </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(4,102) </td> <td> </td> <td>(22,696) </td> <td> </td> <td>18,594 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Electricity </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>23,980 </td> <td> </td> <td>17,235 </td> <td> </td> <td>6,745 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total gross profit </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>197,581 </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>165,793 </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>31,788 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gross margin: </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Product </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>29 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>36 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Installation </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(15) </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>(14) </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Service </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(3) </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>(21) </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Electricity </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>35 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>27 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total gross margin </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>20 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>21 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTotal Gross Profit\nGross profit increased by $31.8 million in the year ended December 31, 2021 as compared to the prior year period primarily driven by the 41.7% increase in acceptances and our ongoing cost reduction efforts to reduce material costs in conjunction with our suppliers and our reduction in labor and overhead costs through increased volume, improved processes and automation at our manufacturing facilities. This increase was partially offset by price reductions to expand our addressable market and $14.2 million of previously deferred revenue related to a specific contract that changed scope and was recognized in the year ended December 31, 2020 without a corresponding increase in costs, increased freight charges and other supply chain-related pricing pressures.\nProduct Gross Profit\nProduct gross profit increased by $5.9 million in the year ended December 31, 2021 as compared to the prior year period. The improvement is driven by a 41.7% increase in product acceptances and our ongoing cost reduction efforts to reduce material costs in conjunction with our suppliers and our reduction in labor and overhead costs through increased volume, improved processes and automation at our manufacturing facilities. This increase was partially offset by price reductions to expand our addressable market and $14.2 million of previously deferred revenue related to a specific contract that changed scope and was recognized in the year ended December 30, 2020, increased freight charges and other supply chain-related pricing pressures.\nInstallation Gross Loss\nInstallation gross loss decreased by $0.5 million in the year ended December 31, 2021 as compared to the prior year period driven by the site mix, as many of the acceptances did not have installation in the current time period, and other site related factors such as site complexity, size, local ordinance requirements and location of the utility interconnect.\nService Gross Profit (Loss)\nService gross loss improved by $18.6 million in the year ended December 31, 2021 as compared to the prior year period. This was primarily due to the significant improvements in power module life, cost reductions and our actions to proactively manage fleet optimizations.\nTable 70: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>

Our cash and cash equivalents consist of highly liquid investments with maturities of three months or less, including money market funds. We maintain these balances with high credit quality counterparties, continually monitor the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer and diversify our investments in order to minimize our credit risk.\nIn October 2021, we entered into a Securities Purchase Agreement with SK ecoplant Co., Ltd. in connection with a strategic partnership. On December 29, 2021, we consummated the transactions related to the First Closing by issuing and selling to SK ecoplant 10,000,000 shares of RCPS, at a purchase price of $25.50 per share or an aggregate purchase price of $255 million. In November 2021, PPA V entered into a $136 million term loan, which replaces the LIBOR + 2.5% Term Loan due December 2021.\nAs of December 31, 2021, we had $291.8 million of total outstanding recourse debt, $234.9 million of non-recourse debt and $16.8 million of other long-term liabilities. For a complete description of our outstanding debt, please see Note 7 - Outstanding Loans and Security Agreements in Part II, Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\nThe combination of our existing cash and cash equivalents is expected to be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash flow needs for the next 12 months and thereafter for the foreseeable future. If these sources of cash are insufficient to satisfy our near-term or future cash needs, we may require additional capital from equity or debt financings to fund our operations, in particular, our manufacturing capacity, product development and market expansion requirements, to timely respond to competitive market pressures or strategic opportunities, or otherwise. We may, from time to time, engage in a variety of financing transactions for such purposes, including factoring our accounts receivable. We may not be able to secure timely additional financing on favorable terms, or at all. The terms of any additional financings may place limits on our financial and operating flexibility. If we raise additional funds through further issuances of equity or equity-linked securities, our existing stockholders could suffer dilution in their percentage ownership of us, and any new securities we issue could have rights, preferences and privileges senior to those of holders of our common stock.\nOur future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including our rate of revenue growth, the timing and extent of spending on research and development efforts and other business initiatives, the rate of growth in the volume of system builds and the need for additional manufacturing space, the expansion of sales and marketing activities both in domestic and international markets, market acceptance of our products, our ability to secure financing for customer use of our Energy Servers, the timing of installations, and overall economic conditions including the impact of COVID-19 on our ongoing and future operations. In order to support and achieve our future growth plans, we may need or seek advantageously to obtain additional funding through an equity or debt financing. Failure to obtain this financing or financing in future quarters will affect our results of operations, including revenue and cash flows.\nAs of December 31, 2021, the current portion of our total debt is $25.8 million, of which $17.5 million is outstanding non-recourse debt. We expect a certain portion of the non-recourse debt would be refinanced by the applicable PPA Entity prior to maturity.\nA summary of our consolidated sources and uses of cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash was as follows (in thousands):\nTable 79: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Years Ended\nDecember 31, </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2021 </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash provided by (used in): </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating activities </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(60,681) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(98,796) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Investing activities </td> <td> </td> <td>(46,696) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(37,913) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Financing activities </td> <td> </td> <td>306,375 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>176,031 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 80: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Table of Contents\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Index to Financial Statements\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nNet cash provided by (used in) our PPA Entities, which are incorporated into the consolidated statements of cash flows, was as follows (in thousands):\nTable 81: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Years Ended\nDecember 31, </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2021 </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>PPA Entities \u00b9 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash provided by PPA operating activities </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>3,188 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>26,039 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash provided by (used in) PPA financing activities </td> <td> </td> <td>3,231 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(23,784) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\n1 The PPA Entities' operating and financing cash flows are a subset of our consolidated cash flows and represent the stand-alone cash flows prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Operating activities consist principally of cash used to run the operations of the PPA Entities, the purchase of Energy Servers from us and principal reductions in loan balances. Financing activities consist primarily of changes in debt carried by our PPAs, and payments from and distributions to noncontrolling partnership interests. We believe this presentation of net cash provided by (used in) PPA activities is useful to provide the reader with the impact to consolidated cash flows of the PPA Entities in which we have only a minority interest.\nOperating Activities\nOur operating activities have consisted of net loss adjusted for certain non-cash items plus changes in our operating assets and liabilities or working capital. The increase in cash used in operating activities during the year ended December 31, 2021 as compared to the prior year period was primarily the result of an increase in our net working capital of $18.8 million in the year ended December 31, 2021 due to the timing of revenue transactions and corresponding collections and the increase in inventory levels to support future demand.\nInvesting Activities\nOur investing activities have consisted of capital expenditures that include investment to increase our production capacity. We expect to continue such activities as our business grows. Cash used in investing activities of $46.7 million during the year ended December 31, 2021 was primarily the result of expenditures on tenant improvements for a newly leased engineering building in Fremont, California. We expect to continue to make capital expenditures over the next few quarters to prepare our new manufacturing facility in Fremont, California for production, which includes the purchase of new equipment and other tenant improvements. We intend to fund these capital expenditures from cash on hand as well as cash flow to be generated from operations. We may also evaluate and arrange equipment lease financing to fund these capital expenditures.\nFinancing Activities\nHistorically, our financing activities have consisted of borrowings and repayments of debt including to related parties, proceeds and repayments of financing obligations, distributions paid to noncontrolling interests and redeemable noncontrolling interests, and the proceeds from the issuance of our common stock. Net cash provided by financing activities during the year ended December 31, 2021 was $306.4 million, an increase of $130.3 million compared to the prior year period, primarily due to the issuance of RCPS to SK ecoplant in December 2021, combined with proceeds in 2021 from stock option exercises and the sale of shares under our 2018 Employee Stock Purchase Plan.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe include in our consolidated financial statements all assets and liabilities and results of operations of our PPA Entities that we have entered into and over which we have substantial control. For additional information, see Note 13 - Portfolio Financings in Part II, Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\nWe have not entered into any other transactions that have generated relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships or special purpose entities. Accordingly, as of December 31, 2021 and 2020 we had no off-balance sheet arrangements.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nThe consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles as applied in the United States (\"U.S. GAAP\") The preparation of the consolidated financial statements requires us to make\nTable 82: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Table of Contents\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Index to Financial Statements\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nestimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, costs and expenses and related disclosures. Our discussion and analysis of our financial results under Results of Operations above are based on our audited results of operations, which we have prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. In preparing these consolidated financial statements, we make assumptions, judgments and estimates that can affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and net income. On an ongoing basis, we base our estimates on historical experience, as appropriate, and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Changes in the accounting estimates are representative of estimation uncertainty, and are reasonably likely to occur from period to period. Accordingly, actual results could differ significantly from the estimates made by our management. We evaluate our estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis. To the extent that there are material differences between these estimates and actual results, our future financial statement presentation, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows will be affected. We believe that the following critical accounting policies involve a greater degree of judgment and complexity than our other accounting policies. Accordingly, these are the policies we believe are the most critical to understanding and evaluating the consolidated financial condition and results of operations.\nThe accounting policies that most frequently require us to make assumptions, judgments and estimates, and therefore are critical to understanding our results of operations, include:\nDiscussion of Earliest Year of Changes in Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nWe include discussion of the earliest year of changes in financial condition and results of operations, as deemed appropriate, even when such information has been previously disclosed in our prior EDGAR filings. We consider the total mix of available information, including the impact of any recastable events when determining whether to omit discussion of the earliest year and the most appropriate form of presentation. We determine to limit the discussion to the information that has changed or has been determined to be significant to our operations or financial condition.\nRevenue Recognition\nWe apply Accounting Standards Codification (\"ASC\") Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers. We identify our contracts with Customers, determine our performance obligations and the transaction price, and after allocating the transaction price to the performance obligations, we recognize revenue as we satisfy our performance obligations and transfer control of our products and services to our customers. Most of our contracts with customers contain performance obligations with a combination of our Energy Server product, installation and maintenance services. For these performance obligations, we allocate the total transaction price to each performance obligation based on the relative standalone selling price.\nWe generally recognize product revenue from contracts with customers at the point that control is transferred to the customers. This occurs when we achieve customer acceptance which typically occurs upon transfer of control to our customers, which depending on the contract terms is when the system is shipped and delivered to our customers, when the system is shipped and delivered and is physically ready for start up and commissioning, or when the system is shipped and delivered and is turned on and producing power.\nWe recognize installation revenue when the system has been installed and is running at full power.\nService revenue is recognized ratably over the term of the first or renewed one-year service period. Given our customers' renewal history, we anticipate that most of them will continue to renew their maintenance services agreements each year for the period of their expected use of the Energy Server. The contractual renewal price may be less than the standalone selling price of the maintenance services and consequently the contract renewal option may provide the customer with a material right. We estimate the standalone selling price for customer renewal options that give rise to material rights using the practical alternative by reference to optional maintenance services renewal periods expected to be provided and the corresponding expected consideration for these services. This reflects the fact that our additional performance obligations in any contractual renewal period are consistent with the services provided under the standard first-year warranty. Where we have determined that a customer has a material right as a result of their contract renewal option, we recognize that portion of the transaction price allocated to the material right over the period in which such rights are exercised.\nGiven that we typically sell an Energy Server with a maintenance service agreement and have not provided maintenance services to a customer who does not have use of an Energy Server, standalone selling prices are estimated using a cost-plus approach. Costs relating to Energy Servers include all direct and indirect manufacturing costs, applicable overhead costs and costs for normal production inefficiencies (i.e., variances). We then apply a margin to the Energy Servers which may vary with the size of the customer, geographic region and the scale of the Energy Server deployment. Costs relating to installation include all direct and indirect installation costs. The margin we apply reflects our profit objectives relating to installation. Costs for\nTable 83: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Table of Contents\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Index to Financial Statements\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nmaintenance service arrangements are estimated over the life of the maintenance contracts and include estimated future service costs and future material costs. Material costs over the period of the service arrangement are impacted significantly by the longevity of the fuel cells themselves. After considering the total service costs, we apply a lower margin to our service costs than to our Energy Servers as it best reflects our long-term service margin expectations and comparable historical industry service margins. As a result, our estimate of our selling price is driven primarily by our expected margin on both the Energy Server and the maintenance service agreements based on their respective costs or, in the case of maintenance service agreements, the estimated costs to be incurred.\nThe total transaction price is determined based on the total consideration specified in the contract, including variable consideration in the form of a performance guaranty payment that represents potential amounts payable to customers. The expected value method is generally used when estimating variable consideration, which typically reduces the total transaction price due to the nature of the performance obligations to which the variable consideration relates. These estimates reflect our historical experience and current contractual requirements which cap the maximum amount that may be paid. The expected value method requires judgment and considers multiple factors that may vary over time depending upon the unique facts and circumstances related to each performance obligation. Depending on the facts and circumstances, a change in variable consideration estimate will either be accounted for at the contract level or using the portfolio method.\nFor successful sales-leaseback arrangements, we recognize product and installation revenue upon meeting criteria demonstrating we have transferred control to the customer (the Buyer-Lessor). When control of the Energy Server is transferred to the financier, and we determine the leaseback qualifies as an operating lease in accordance with ASC 842, Leases (\"ASC 842\"), we record a ROU asset and a lease liability, and recognize revenue based on the fair value of the Energy Servers with an allocation to product revenue and installations revenue based on the relative standalone selling prices. We recognize as financing obligations any proceeds received to finance our ongoing costs to operate the Energy Servers.\nValuation of Escalator Protection Plan Agreements (\"EPP\")\nWe have entered into agreements with certain customers which require us to recognize a liability in compliance with the financial accounting and reporting requirements of ASC Topic 820, Fair Value Measurement (\"ASC 820\"). We use third party valuation experts to provide us with the initial Level 3 fair value measurement that estimates the fair value of the subject liabilities using inputs of forecasted avoided costs and the cost of electricity. We determine our final estimate of liability based on internal reviews and in consideration of the estimates received. Although measured each reporting period, our estimates may vary from the actual payments made under the contractual agreements, as the estimates include current known liability and estimates of potential future payments. We use valuation methodology including using a Monte Carlo simulation model, with estimated inputs of beginning value, growth rate and volatility, and further discount our estimate of liability based on our cost of debt commensurate with the payment period.\nValuation of Certain Financial Instruments and Customer Financing Receivables\nWe have entered into certain Customer Financing Receivables with our PPA 3a arrangement, and debt financings that include Redeemable Senior Secured Notes, Convertible Senior Notes, Senior Secured Notes, Term Loans and Fixed Rate Notes. We are required to determine the fair value of the assets or liabilities for financial reporting purposes under ASC 820, and as applicable, under the guidance of ASC Topic 840, Leases, and ASC Topic 815, Derivatives and Hedging (\"ASC 815\"). We use third party valuation experts to provide us with the initial Level 3 fair value measurement that estimates the fair value of the subject assets or liabilities using inputs of principal to be received or paid, maturity dates, coupon rates, selected discount rate based on implied rating and comparable yield curves in Energy and Non-Financial markets. We determine our final estimate of fair value based on internal reviews and in consideration of the estimates received. The objective of the fair value measurement of our estimate is to represent the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date.\nValuation of Assets and Liabilities of the SK ecoplant Strategic Investment\nWe have entered into an agreement with SK ecoplant that provides the opportunity, but does not require, an additional investment in common stock Class A, subject to a cap on the total potential share purchase, and as a component of transaction, includes a purchase commitment by the investor for future product purchases.\nWe are required to determine the fair value of the assets or liabilities for financial reporting purposes under ASC 820, and as applicable, under the guidance of ASC 815 and ASC Topic 480 Distinguishing Liabilities from Equity. We use third party valuation experts that are recognized as financial instrument accounting specialists to provide us with the initial Level 3 fair value measurement that estimates the fair value of the subject assets or liabilities using inputs of number of shares,\nTable 84: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Table of Contents\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Index to Financial Statements\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nunderlying prices of Bloom Energy stock, rights and obligations of the counterparties, valuation assumptions related to options, and the assessed value of our product revenue streams and the timing of expected revenue recognition. We determine our final estimate of fair value based on internal reviews and in consideration of the estimates received. The objective of the fair value measurement of our estimate is to represent the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. We determine the reasonableness of our valuation methodology, assumptions on the timing and probability of a redemption event, and the expected number of shares to be exercised with the Option, and review the mathematical accuracy of the calculations before recording in our consolidated statement of operations and consolidated balance sheets. See Note 18 - SK ecoplant Strategic Investment.\nIncremental Borrowing Rate (\"IBR\") by Lease Class\nWe adopted ASC 842 on January 1, 2020 on a modified retrospective basis. This guidance requires that, for all our leases, we recognize ROU assets representing our right to use the underlying asset for the lease term, and lease liabilities related to the rights and obligations created by those leases, on the balance sheet regardless of whether they are classified as finance or operating leases, with classification affecting the pattern and presentation of expenses and cash flows on the consolidated financial statements. Lease liabilities are measured at the lease commencement date as the present value of future minimum lease payments over the reasonably certain lease term. Lease ROU assets are measured as the lease liability plus initial direct costs and prepaid lease payments less lease incentives. In measuring the present value of the future minimum lease payments, we used our collateralized incremental borrowing rate as our leases do not generally provide an implicit rate. The determination of the incremental borrowing rate considers qualitative and quantitative factors as well as the estimated impact that the collateral has on the rate. We determine our incremental borrowing rate based on the lease class of assets which relates to those supporting of manufacturing and general operations, and those supporting electricity revenue transactions.\nFor successful sale-leasebacks, as Seller-Lessee, we determine the collateralized IBR on our leased equipment based on a fair value assessment provided by third-party valuation experts.\nStock-Based Compensation\nWe account for stock options and other equity awards, such as restricted stock units and performance-based stock units, to employees and non-employee directors under the provisions of ASC 718, Compensation-Stock Compensation. Accordingly, the stock-based compensation expense for these awards is measured based on the fair value on the date of grant. For stock options, we recognize the expense, net of estimated forfeitures, under the straight-line attribution over the requisite service period which is generally the vesting term. The fair value of the stock options is estimated using the Black-Scholes valuation model. For options with a vesting condition tied to the attainment of service and market conditions, stock-based compensation costs are recognized using Monte Carlo simulations. In addition, we use the Black-Scholes valuation model to estimate the fair value of stock purchase rights under the Bloom Energy Corporation 2018 Employee Stock Purchase Plan (the \"2018 ESPP\"). The fair value of the 2018 ESPP purchase rights is recognized as expense under the multiple options approach.\nThe Black-Scholes valuation model uses as inputs the fair value of our common stock and assumptions we make for the volatility of our common stock, the expected term of the award, the risk-free interest rate for a period that approximates the expected term of the stock options and the expected dividend yield. In developing estimates used to calculate assumptions, we established the expected term for employee options as well as expected forfeiture rates based on the historical settlement experience and after giving consideration to vesting schedules.\nIncome Taxes\nWe account for income taxes using the liability method under ASC 740, Income Taxes. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on net operating loss carryforwards, research and development credit carryforwards and temporary differences resulting from the different treatment of items for tax and financial reporting purposes. Deferred items are measured using the enacted tax rates and laws that are expected to be in effect when the differences reverse. We must assess the likelihood that deferred tax assets will be recovered as deductions from future taxable income. This determination is based on expected future results and the future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences. Furthermore, uncertain tax positions are evaluated by management and amounts are recorded when it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination, including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes, based on the technical merits. Significant judgement is required throughout management's process in evaluating each uncertain tax position including future taxable income expectations and tax-planning strategies to determine whether the more likely than not recognition threshold has been met. We have provided a full valuation allowance on our domestic deferred tax assets because we believe it is more likely than not that our deferred tax assets will not be realized.\nTable 85: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Table of Contents\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Index to Financial Statements\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nPrinciples of Consolidation\nOur consolidated financial statements include the operations of our subsidiaries in which we have a controlling financial interest. We use a qualitative approach in assessing the consolidation requirements for each of our PPA Entities that are variable interest entities (\"VIEs\"). This approach focuses on determining whether we have the power to direct those activities that significantly affect their economic performance and whether we have the obligation to absorb losses, or the right to receive benefits that could potentially be significant to the PPA Entities. The considerations for VIE consolidation is a complex analysis that requires us to determine whether we are the primary beneficiary and therefore have the power to direct activities which are most significant to those PPA Entities.\nAllocation of Profits and Losses of Consolidated Entities to Noncontrolling Interests and Redeemable Noncontrolling Interests\nWe generally allocate profits and losses to noncontrolling interests under the HLBV method. The HLBV method is a balance sheet-oriented approach for applying the equity method of accounting when there is a complex structure, such as the flip structure of the PPA Entities.\nThe determination of equity in earnings under the HLBV method requires management to determine how proceeds, upon a hypothetical liquidation of the entity at book value, would be allocated between our investors. The noncontrolling interest balance is presented as a component of permanent equity in the consolidated balance sheets.\nNoncontrolling interests with redemption features, such as put options, that are not solely within our control are considered redeemable noncontrolling interests. Exercisability of put options are solely dependent upon the passage of time, and hence, such put options are considered to be probable of becoming exercisable. We elected to accrete changes in the redemption value over the period from the date it becomes probable that the instrument will become redeemable to the earliest redemption date of the instrument by using an interest method. The balance of redeemable noncontrolling interests on the balance sheets is reported at the greater of its carrying value or its maximum redemption value at each reporting date. The redeemable noncontrolling interests are classified as temporary equity and therefore are reported in the mezzanine section of the consolidated balance sheets as redeemable noncontrolling interests.\nTable 86: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Table of Contents\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Index to Financial Statements\n</td> </tr>\n</table>", "item_7_truncated": "ITEM 7 - MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF\nOPERATIONS\nOverview\nDescription of Bloom Energy\nOur mission is to make clean, reliable energy affordable for everyone in the world. We created the first large-scale, commercially viable solid oxide fuel-cell based power generation platform that empowers businesses, essential services, critical infrastructure and communities to responsibly take charge of their energy.\nOur technology, invented in the United States, is one of the most advanced electricity and hydrogen producing technologies on the market today. Our fuel-flexible Bloom Energy Servers can use biogas, hydrogen, natural gas, or a blend of fuels to create resilient, sustainable and cost-predictable power at significantly higher efficiencies than traditional, combustion-based resources. In addition, our same solid oxide platform that powers our fuel cells can be used to create hydrogen, which is increasingly recognized as a critically important tool necessary for the full decarbonization of the energy economy. Our enterprise customers include some of the largest multinational corporations in the world. We also have strong relationships with some of the largest utility companies in the United States and the Republic of Korea.\nAt Bloom Energy, we look forward to a net-zero future. Our technology is designed to help enable this future in order to deliver reliable, low-carbon, electricity in a world facing unacceptable levels of power disruptions. Our resilient platform has kept electricity available for our customers through hurricanes, earthquakes, typhoons, forest fires, extreme heat and grid failures. Unlike traditional combustion power generation, our platform is community-friendly and designed to significantly reduce emissions of criteria air pollutants. We have made tremendous progress making renewable fuel production a reality through our biogas, hydrogen and electrolyzer programs, and we believe that we are well-positioned as a core platform and fixture in the new energy paradigm to help organizations and communities achieve their net-zero objectives.\nWe market and sell our Energy Servers primarily through our direct sales organization in the United States, and also have direct and indirect sales channels internationally. Recognizing that deploying our solutions requires a material financial commitment, we have developed a number of financing options to support sales of our Energy Servers to customers who lack the financial capability to purchase our Energy Servers directly, who prefer to finance the acquisition using third-party financing or who prefer to contract for our services on a pay-as-you-go model.\nOur typical target commercial or industrial customer has historically been either an investment-grade entity or a customer with investment-grade attributes such as size, assets and revenue, liquidity, geographically diverse operations and general financial stability. We have also expanded our product and financing options to the below-investment-grade customers and have also expanded internationally to target customers with deployments on a wholesale grid. Given that our customers are typically large institutions with multi-level decision making processes, we generally experience a lengthy sales process.\nStrategic Investment\nOn October 23, 2021, we entered into the SPA with SK ecoplant in connection with a strategic partnership. Pursuant to the SPA, on December 29, 2021, we sold to SK ecoplant 10 million shares of zero coupon, non-voting redeemable convertible Series A preferred stock in us, par value $0.0001 per share (\"RCPS\"), at a purchase price of $25.50 per share for an aggregate purchase price of $255 million (the \"Initial Investment\").\nSimultaneous with the execution of the SPA, we and SK ecoplant executed an amendment to the Joint Venture Agreement (\"JVA\"), an amendment and restatement to our Preferred Distribution Agreement (\"PDA Restatement\") and a new Commercial Cooperation Agreement regarding initiatives pertaining to the hydrogen market and general market expansion for the Bloom Energy Server and Bloom Energy Electrolyzer. For additional details about the transaction with SK ecoplant, please see Note 18 - SK ecoplant Strategic Investment, and for more information about our joint venture with SK ecoplant, please see Note 12 - Related Party Transactions in Part II, Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\nCOVID-19 Pandemic\nGeneral\nWe continue to monitor and adjust as appropriate our operations in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, including the Omicron variant. As a technology company that supplies resilient, reliable and clean energy, we have been able to conduct the majority of operations as an essential business\u201d in California and Delaware, where we manufacture and perform many of our\nTable 50: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Table of Contents\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Index to Financial Statements\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nR&D activities, as well as in other states and countries where we are installing or maintaining our Energy Servers. Many of our employees continue to work from home as a result of the spread of the Omicron variant unless they are directly supporting essential manufacturing production operations, installation work, and service and maintenance activities as well as some R&D and general administrative functions. We maintain protocols to minimize the risk of COVID-19 transmission within our facilities, including enhanced cleaning and masking if required by the local authorities, as well as providing testing for all employees. We will continue to follow CDC and local guidelines when notified of possible exposures. For more information regarding the risks posed to our company by the COVID-19 pandemic, refer to Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors - Risks Related to Our Products and Manufacturing - Our business has been and continues to be adversely affected by the COVID-19 pandemic.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nCOVID-19 created disruptions throughout various aspects of our business as noted herein, and impacted our results of operations in the year ended December 31, 2021. While we improved our liquidity in 2020, we increased our working capital spend in the first half of 2021. We have entered into new leases to maintain sufficient manufacturing facilities to meet anticipated demand in 2022, including new product line expansion. In addition, we also increased our working capital spend and resources to enhance our marketing efforts and to expand into new geographies both domestically and internationally.\nWe believe we have the sufficient capital to run our business over the next 12 months, including the completion of the build out of our manufacturing facilities. Our working capital was strengthened with the Initial Investment by SK ecoplant as described above. In addition, we may still enter the equity or debt market as need to support the expansion of our business. Please refer to Note 7 - Outstanding Loans and Security Agreements in Part II, Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data; and Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors - Risks Related to Our Liquidity - Our substantial indebtedness, and restrictions imposed by the agreements governing our and our PPA Entities' outstanding indebtedness, may limit our financial and operating activities and may adversely affect our ability to incur additional debt to fund future needs, and We may not be able to generate sufficient cash to meet our debt service obligations, for more information regarding the terms of and risks associated with our debt.\nSales\nWe did not experience a significant impact on our selling activity related to COVID-19 during the year ended December 31, 2021.\nCustomer Financing\nThe ongoing COVID-19 pandemic resulted in a significant drop in the ability of many financiers (particularly financing institutions) to monetize tax credits, primarily the result of a potential drop in taxable income stemming from the pandemic. However, during the last two quarters, we began to see this constraint improving. Our ability to obtain financing for our Energy Servers partly depends on the creditworthiness of our customers, and a few of our customers' credit ratings have fallen during the pandemic, which can impact the financing for their use of an Energy Server. We continue to work on obtaining the financing required for our 2022 installations but if we are unable to secure such financing our revenue, cash flow and liquidity will be materially impacted.\nInstallations and Maintenance of Energy Servers\nOur installation and maintenance operations were impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic in 2021. Our installation projects have experienced some delays relating to, among other things, shortages in available parts and labor for design, installation and other work; and the inability or delay in our ability to access customer facilities due to shutdowns or other restrictions. Despite the impact on installations during the year ended December 31, 2021 and given our mitigation strategies, we only had one instance of a significant delay in the installation of our Energy Servers as a result of supply chain issues that pushed an installation out a quarter.\nAs to maintenance, if we are delayed in or unable to perform scheduled or unscheduled maintenance, our previously-installed Energy Servers will likely experience adverse performance impacts including reduced output and/or efficiency, which could result in warranty and/or guaranty claims by our customers. Further, due to the nature of our Energy Servers, if we are unable to replace worn parts in accordance with our standard maintenance schedule, we may be subject to increased costs in the future. During the year ended December 31, 2021, we experienced no delays in servicing our Energy Servers due to COVID-19.\nTable 51: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Table of Contents\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Index to Financial Statements\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nSupply Chain\nDuring 2021, we experienced COVID-19 related delays from certain vendors and suppliers, although we were able to mitigate the impact so that we did not experience delays in the manufacture of our Energy Servers and experienced only one significant delay in the installation of our Energy Servers as mentioned above. We have a global supply chain and obtain components from Asia, Europe and India. In many cases, the components we obtain are jointly developed with our suppliers and unique to us, which makes it difficult to obtain and qualify alternative suppliers should our suppliers be impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic or related effects.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2021, we continued to experience supply chain disruptions due to direct and indirect COVID-19 impacts. There have been a number of disruptions throughout the global supply chain as the global economy opens up and drives demand for certain components that has outpaced the return of the global supply chain to full production. Although we were able to find alternatives for many component shortages, we experienced some delays and cost increases with respect to container shortages, ocean shipping and air freight. We have put actions in place to mitigate the disruptions by booking alternate sea routes, limiting our use of air shipments, creating virtual hubs and consolidating shipments coming from the same region. During the three months ended December 31, 2021, we continued to manage disruptions from an increase in lead times for most of our components due to a variety of factors, including supply shortages, shipping delays and labor shortages, and we expect this to continue through the first half of 2022. We expect raw material pricing pressures and component shortages especially for semiconductors and specialty metals to persist at least through this time period. In addition, the impact of inflation on the price of components, raw materials and labor may result in increased prices. In the event we are unable to mitigate the impact of delays and/or price increases in raw materials, electronic components and freight, it could delay the manufacturing and installation of our Energy Servers and increase the cost of our Energy Server, which would adversely impact our cash flows and results of operations, including revenue and gross margin.\nIf spikes in COVID-19 occur in regions in which our supply chain operates, including as a result of the Delta or Omicron variant, we could experience a delay in components and incur further freight price increases, which could in turn impact production and installations and our cash flow and results of operations, including revenue and gross margin.\nManufacturing\nAlthough we have experienced labor shortages due to COVID-19 absences and the relative shortage of labor, overall this has not impacted our production given the safety protocols we have put in place augmented by our ability to increase our shifts and obtain a contingent work force for some of the manufacturing activities. We have incurred additional labor expense due to enhanced safety protocols designed to minimize exposure and risk of COVID-19 transmission as well as increased wages in general. If COVID-19 materially impacts our supply chain or if we experience a significant COVID-19 outbreak that affects our manufacturing workforce, our production could be adversely impacted which could adversely impact our cash flow and results of operation, including revenue.\nPurchase and Financing Options\nOverview\nIn order to appeal to the largest variety of customers, we make available several options to our customers. Both in the United States and abroad, we sell Energy Servers directly to customers. In the United States, we also enable customers' use of the Energy Servers through a pay as you go offering, made possible through third-party ownership financing arrangements.\nOften our offerings take advantage of local incentives. In the United States, our financing arrangements are structured to optimize both federal and local incentives, including the ITC and accelerated depreciation. Internationally, our sales are made primarily to distributors who on-sell to, and install for, customers; these deals are also structured to use local incentives applicable to our Energy Servers. Increasingly, we use trusted installers and other sourcing collaborations in the United States to generate transactions.\nWhichever option is selected by a customer in the Unites States or internationally, the contract structure will include obligations on our part to operate and maintain the Energy Server ( O&M Obligations\u201d). The O&M Obligations may either be (i) for a one-year period, subject to annual renewal at the customer's option, which historically are almost always renewed year over year, or (ii) for a fixed term. In the United States, the contract structure often includes obligations on our part to install the Energy Servers ( Installation Obligations\u201d). Consequently, our transactions may generate revenue from the sale of Energy Servers and electricity, performance of O&M Obligations, and performance of Installation Obligations.\nIn addition to customary workmanship and materials warranties, as part of the O&M Obligations we provide warranties and guaranties regarding the efficiency and output of our Energy Servers to the customer and, in certain financing structures, to\nTable 52: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Table of Contents\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Index to Financial Statements\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nthe financing parties too. We refer to a performance warranty\u201d as an obligation to repair or replace the Energy Servers as necessary to return performance of an Energy Server to the warranted performance level. We refer to a performance guaranty\u201d as an obligation to make a payment to compensate for the failure of the Energy Server to meet the guaranteed performance level. Our obligation to make payments under the performance guaranty is always contractually capped.\nEnergy Server Sales\nThere are customers who purchase our Energy Servers directly from us pursuant to customary equipment sales contracts. In connection with the purchase of Energy Servers, the customers also enter into a contract with us for the O&M Obligations. The customer may elect to engage us to provide the Installation Obligations or engage a third-party provider. Internationally, sales often occur through distribution arrangements pursuant to which local construction services providers perform the Installation Obligations, as is the case in the Republic of Korea; we contract directly with the customer to provide O&M Obligations.\nA customer may enter into a contract for the sale of our Energy Servers and finance that acquisition through a sale-leaseback with a financial institution. In most cases, the financial institution completes its purchase from us immediately after commissioning. We both (i) facilitate this financing arrangement between the financial institution and the customer and (ii) provide ongoing operations and maintenance services for the Energy Servers (such arrangement, a Traditional Lease\u201d).\nCustomer Financing Options\nWith respect to the third-party financing options in the United States, a customer may choose a contract for the use Energy Servers in exchange for a capacity-based flat payment (a Managed Services Agreement\u201d) or one for the purchase of electricity generated by the Energy Servers in exchange for a scheduled dollars per kilowatt hour rate (a Power Purchase Agreement\u201d or PPA\u201d).\nCertain customer payments in a Managed Services Agreement are required regardless of the level of performance of the Energy Server; in some cases it may also include a variable payment based on the Energy Server's performance or a performance-related set-off. Managed Services Agreements are then financed pursuant to a sale-leaseback with a financial institution (a Managed Services Financing\u201d).\nPPAs are typically financed on a portfolio basis. We have financed portfolios through tax equity partnerships, acquisition financings and direct sales to investors (each, a Portfolio Financing\u201d).\nIn the United States, our capacity to offer our Energy Servers through either of these financed arrangements depends in large part on the ability of financing parties to optimize the tax benefits associated with a fuel cell, such as the ITC or accelerated depreciation. Interest rate fluctuations, and internationally, currency exchanges fluctuations, may also impact the attractiveness of any financing offerings for our customers. Our ability to finance a Managed Services Agreement or a PPA is also related to, and may be limited by, the creditworthiness of the customer. Additionally, the Managed Services Financing option is limited by a customer's willingness to commit to making payments to a financing party regardless of the level of performance of the Energy Server.\nIn each of our financing options, we typically perform the functions of a project developer, including identifying end customers and financiers, leading the negotiations of the customer agreements and financing agreements, securing all necessary permitting and interconnections approvals, and overseeing the design and construction of the project up to and including commissioning the Energy Servers. Increasingly, however, we are making sales to third-party developers.\nEach of our financing transaction structures is described in further detail below.\nTable 53: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Table of Contents\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Index to Financial Statements\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nManaged Services Financing\nUnder our Managed Services Financing option, we enter into a Managed Services Agreement with a customer for a certain term. The fixed capacity-based payments made by the customer under the Managed Services Agreement are applied toward our obligation to pay down our periodic rent liability under a sale-leaseback transaction with a financier. We assign all our rights to such fixed payments made by the customer to the financier, as lessor.\nOnce we enter into a Managed Services Agreement with the customer, and a financier is identified, we sell the Energy Server to the financier, as lessor, who then leases it back to us, as lessee, pursuant to a sale-leaseback transaction. Certain of our sale-leaseback transactions failed to achieve all of the criteria for sale accounting. For such failed sale-and-leaseback transactions, the proceeds from the transaction are recognized as a financing obligation within our consolidated balance sheet. For successful sale-and-leaseback transactions, the financier of a Managed Services Agreement typically pays the purchase price for an Energy Server at or around acceptance, and we recognize the fair value of the Energy Servers sold within product and install revenue and recognize a right-of-use (\"ROU\") asset and a lease liability on our consolidated balance sheet. Any proceeds in excess of the fair value of the Energy Servers are recognized as a financing obligation.\nThe duration of our current Managed Services Agreement offerings is between five and ten years.\nOur Managed Services Agreements typically provide for performance warranties of both the efficiency and output of the Energy Server and may include other warranties depending on the type of deployment. We often structure payments from the\nTable 54: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Table of Contents\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Index to Financial Statements\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\ncustomer as a dollars per kilowatt-hour payment and our pricing assumes revenue at the 95% output level. This means that our revenue may be lower than expected if output is less than 95% and higher if output exceeds 95%. As of December 31, 2021, we had incurred no liabilities due to failure to repair or replace our Energy Servers pursuant to these performance warranties and the fleet of our Energy Servers deployed pursuant to the Managed Services Financings was performing at a lifetime average output of approximately 85%.\nPortfolio Financings\nIn the past, we financed the Energy Servers subject to our PPAs through two types of Portfolio Financings. In one type of transaction, we sold a portfolio of PPAs to a tax equity partnership in which we held a managing member interest (such partnership in which we hold an interest, a PPA Entity\u201d). In these transactions, we sold the portfolio of Energy Servers to a limited liability project company of which the PPA Entity was the sole member (such portfolio owner, a Portfolio Company\u201d). Whether an investor, a tax equity partnership, or a single member limited liability company, the Portfolio Company is the entity that directly owns the portfolio. The Portfolio Company sells the electricity generated by the Energy Servers contemplated by the PPAs to the customers. We recognize revenue as the electricity is produced. Our current practices no longer contemplate these types of transactions.\nWe also finance PPAs through a second type of Portfolio Financing pursuant to which we (i) directly sell a portfolio of PPAs and the Energy Servers or (ii) sell a Portfolio Company, in each case to an investor or tax equity partnership in which we do not have an equity interest (a Third-Party PPA\u201d). Like the other Portfolio Financing structure, the investor or tax equity partnership owns the Portfolio Company or the Energy Servers directly, and in each case, sells the electricity generated by the Energy Servers contemplated by the PPAs to the customers. For further discussion, see Note 11 - Portfolio Financings in Part II, Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\nWhen we finance a portfolio of Energy Servers and PPAs through a Portfolio Financing, we typically enter into a sale, engineering and procurement and construction agreement ( EPC Agreement\u201d) and an O&M Agreement, with the Portfolio Company. As owner of the portfolio of PPAs and related Energy Servers, the Portfolio Company receives all customer payments generated under the PPAs, the benefits of the ITC and accelerated tax depreciation, and any other available state or local benefits arising out of the ownership or operation of the Energy Servers, to the extent not already allocated to the customer under the PPA.\nTable 55: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Table of Contents\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Index to Financial Statements\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe sales of our Energy Servers in connection with a Portfolio Financing have many of the same terms and conditions as a direct sale. Payment of the purchase price is generally broken down into multiple installments, which may include payments prior to shipment, upon shipment or delivery of the Energy Server, and upon acceptance of the Energy Server.\nUnder an O&M Agreement, a one-year service package is provided with the initial sale that includes performance warranties and performance guaranties. After the expiration of the initial standard one-year package, the Portfolio Company has the option to extend our services under the O&M Agreement on an annual basis at a price determined at the time of purchase of our Energy Server. After the standard one-year service package, the Portfolio Company has almost always exercised the option to renew our services under the O&M Agreement.\nAs of December 31, 2021, we had incurred no liabilities to investors in Portfolio Financings due to failure to repair or replace Energy Servers pursuant to these performance warranties. Our obligation to make payments for underperformance against the performance guaranties was capped at an aggregate total of approximately $114.6 million (including payments both for low output and for low efficiency) and our aggregate remaining potential liability under this cap was approximately $104.4 million.\nObligations to Portfolio Companies\nOur Portfolio Financings involve many obligations on our part to the Portfolio Company. These obligations are set forth in the applicable EPC Agreement and O&M Agreement, and may include some or all of the following obligations:\n\u2022designing, manufacturing, and installing the Energy Servers, and selling such Energy Servers to the Portfolio Company;\n\u2022obtaining all necessary permits and other governmental approvals necessary for the installation and operation of the Energy Servers, and maintaining such permits and approvals throughout the term of the EPC Agreements and O&M Agreements;\n\u2022operating and maintaining the Energy Servers in compliance with all applicable laws, permits and regulations;\n\u2022satisfying the performance warranties and guaranties set forth in the applicable O&M Agreements; and\n\u2022complying with any other specific requirements contained in the PPAs with customers.\nIn some cases, the EPC Agreement obligates us to repurchase the Energy Server in the event of certain IP Infringement claims. In others, a repurchase of the Energy Server is only one optional remedy we have to cure an IP Infringement claim. The O&M Agreement grants a Portfolio Company the right to obligate us to repurchase the Energy Servers in the event the Energy Servers fail to comply with the performance warranties and guaranties in the O&M Agreement and we do not cure such failure in the applicable time period, or that a PPA terminates as a result of any failure by us to perform the obligations in the O&M Agreement. In some of our Portfolio Financings, our obligation to repurchase Energy Servers under the O&M extends to the entire fleet of Energy Servers sold in the event a systemic failure that affects more than a specified number of Energy Servers.\nIn some Portfolio Financings, we have also agreed to pay liquidated damages to the applicable Portfolio Company in the event of delays in the manufacture and installation of our Energy Servers, either in the form of a cash payment or a reduction in the purchase price for the applicable Energy Servers.\nAdministration of Portfolio Companies\nIn each of our Portfolio Financings in which we hold an equity interest in the PPA Entity, we perform certain administrative services as managing member, including invoicing the end customers for amounts owed under the PPAs, administering the cash receipts of the Portfolio Company in accordance with the requirements of the financing arrangements, interfacing with applicable regulatory agencies, and other similar obligations. We are compensated for these services on a fixed dollar-per-kilowatt basis.\nFor those Portfolio Financings with project debt, the Portfolio Company owned by each of our PPA Entities (with the exception of one PPA Entity) incurred debt in order to finance the acquisition of the Energy Servers. The lenders for these transactions are a combination of banks and/or institutional investors. In each case, the debt is secured by all of the assets of the applicable Portfolio Company, such assets being primarily comprised of the Energy Servers and a collateral assignment of each of the contracts to which the Portfolio Company is a party, including the O&M Agreement and the PPAs. As further collateral, the lenders receive a security interest in 100% of the membership interest of the Portfolio Company. The lenders have no\nTable 56: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Table of Contents\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Index to Financial Statements\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nrecourse to us or to any of the other equity investors (the \"Equity Investors\") in the Portfolio Company for liabilities arising out of the portfolio.\nWe have determined that we are the primary beneficiary in the PPA Entities, subject to reassessments performed as a result of upgrade transactions. Accordingly, we consolidate 100% of the assets, liabilities and operating results of these PPA Entities, including the Energy Servers and lease income, in our consolidated financial statements. We recognize the Equity Investors' share of the net assets of the investment entities as noncontrolling interests in subsidiaries in our consolidated balance sheet. We recognize the amounts that are contractually payable to these investors in each period as distributions to noncontrolling interests in our consolidated statements of redeemable convertible preferred stock, redeemable noncontrolling interest, stockholders' (deficit) equity and noncontrolling interest.\nOur consolidated statements of cash flows reflect cash received from the Equity Investors as proceeds from investments by noncontrolling interests in subsidiaries. Our consolidated statements of cash flows also reflect cash paid to these investors as distributions paid to noncontrolling interests in subsidiaries. We reflect any unpaid distributions to these Equity Investors as distributions payable to noncontrolling interests in subsidiaries on our consolidated balance sheets. However, the PPA Entities are separate and distinct legal entities, and Bloom Energy Corporation may not receive cash or other distributions from the PPA Entities except in certain limited circumstances and upon the satisfaction of certain conditions, such as compliance with applicable debt service coverage ratios and the achievement of a targeted internal rates of return to the Equity Investors, or otherwise.\nFor further information about our Portfolio Financings, see Note 11 - Portfolio Financings in Part II, Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\nDelivery and Installation\nThe transfer of control of our product to our customer based on the delivery and installations of our products has a significant impact on the timing of the recognition of product and installation revenue. Many factors can cause a lag between the time that a customer signs a contract and our recognition of product revenue. These factors include the number of Energy Servers installed per site, local permitting and utility requirements, environmental, health and safety requirements, weather, customer facility construction schedules, customers' operational considerations and the timing of financing. Many of these factors are unpredictable and their resolution is often outside of our or our customers' control. Customers may also ask us to delay an installation for reasons unrelated to the foregoing, such as, for sales contracts, delays in their obtaining financing. Further, due to unexpected delays, deployments may require unanticipated expenses to expedite delivery of materials or labor to ensure the installation meets the timing objectives. These unexpected delays and expenses can be exacerbated in periods in which we deliver and install a larger number of smaller projects. In addition, if even relatively short delays occur, there may be a significant shortfall between the revenue we expect to generate in a particular period and the revenue that we are able to recognize.\nInternational Channel Partners\nIndia. In India, sales activities are currently conducted by Bloom Energy (India) Pvt. Ltd., our wholly-owned subsidiary; however, we continue to evaluate the Indian market to determine whether the use of channel partners would be a beneficial go-to-market strategy to grow our India market sales.\nJapan. In Japan, sales were previously conducted pursuant to a Japanese joint venture established between us and subsidiaries of SoftBank Corp., called Bloom Energy Japan Limited (\"Bloom Energy Japan\"). Under this arrangement, we sold Energy Servers to Bloom Energy Japan and we recognized revenue once the Energy Servers left the port in the United States. Bloom Energy Japan then entered into the contract with the end customer and performed all installation work as well as some of the operations and maintenance work. As of July 1, 2021, we acquired Softbank Corp.'s interest in Bloom Energy Japan for a cash payment and are now the sole owner of Bloom Energy Japan.\nThe Republic of Korea. In 2018, Bloom Energy Japan consummated a sale of Energy Servers in the Republic of Korea to Korea South-East Power Company. Following this sale, we entered into a Preferred Distributor Agreement in November 2018 with SK ecoplant for the marketing and sale of Bloom Energy Servers for the stationary utility and commercial and industrial South Korean power market.\nAs part of our expanded strategic partnership with SK ecoplant, the parties executed the PDA Restatement in October 2021, which incorporates previously amended terms and establishes: (i) SK ecoplant's purchase commitments for the next three years (on a take or pay basis) for Bloom Energy Servers; (ii) rollover procedures; (iii) premium pricing for product and\nTable 57: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Table of Contents\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Index to Financial Statements\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nservices; (iv) termination procedures for material breaches; and (v) procedures if there are material changes to the Republic of Korea Hydrogen Portfolio Standard. For additional details about the transaction with SK ecoplant, please see Note 18 - SK ecoplant Strategic Investment.\nUnder the terms of the PDA Restatement, we (or our subsidiary) contract directly with the customer to provide operations and maintenance services for the Energy Servers. We have established a subsidiary in the Republic of Korea, Bloom Energy Korea, LLC, to which we subcontract such operations and maintenance services. The terms of the operations and maintenance are negotiated on a case-by-case basis with each customer, but are generally expected to provide the customer with the option to receive services for at least 10 years, and for up to the life of the Energy Servers.\nSK ecoplant Joint Venture Agreement. In September 2019, we entered into a joint venture agreement with SK ecoplant to establish a light-assembly facility in the Republic of Korea for sales of certain portions of our Energy Server for the stationary utility and commercial and industrial market in the Republic of Korea. The joint venture is majority controlled and managed by us, with the facility, which became operational in July 2020. Other than a nominal initial capital contribution by Bloom Energy, the joint venture will be funded by SK ecoplant. SK ecoplant, who currently acts as a distributor for our Energy Servers for the stationary utility and commercial and industrial market in the Republic of Korea, is our primary customer for the products assembled by the joint venture. In October 2021, as part of our expanded strategic partnership with SK ecoplant, the parties agreed to amend the JVA, which increases the scope of the assembly work done in the joint venture facility.\nCommunity Distributed Generation Programs\nIn July 2015, the state of New York introduced its Community Distributed Generation (\"CDG\") program, which extends New York's net metering program in order to allow utility customers to receive net metering credits for electricity generated by distributed generation assets located on the utility's grid but not physically connected to the customer's facility. This program allows for the use of multiple generation technologies, including fuel cells. Since then other states have instituted similar programs and we expect that other states may do so as well in the future. In June 2020, the New York Public Service Commission issued an Order that limited the CDG compensation structure for high capacity factor resources,\u201d including fuel cells, in a way that will make the economics for these types of projects more challenging in the future. However, projects already under contract were grandfathered into the program under the previous compensation structure.\nWe have entered into sales, installation, operations and maintenance agreements with three developers for the deployment of our Energy Servers pursuant to the New York CDG program for a total of 441 systems. As of December 31, 2021, we have recognized revenue associated with 271 systems. We continue to believe that these types of subscriber-based programs could be a source of future revenue and will continue to look to generate sales through these programs in the future.\nComparison of the Years Ended December 31, 2021 and 2020\nA discussion regarding our results of operations for 2021 compared to 2020 is presented in this section. A discussion of 2020 to 2019 can be found under Item 7 of Part II of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2020, which is available free of charge on the SEC's website at www.sec.gov and the Investor section of our website at www.bloomenergy.com.\nKey Operating Metrics\nIn addition to the measures presented in the consolidated financial statements, we use certain key operating metrics below to evaluate business activity, to measure performance, to develop financial forecasts and to make strategic decisions:\n\u2022Product accepted - the number of customer acceptances of our Energy Servers in any period. We recognize revenue when an acceptance is achieved. We use this metric to measure the volume of deployment activity. We measure each Energy Server manufactured, shipped and accepted in terms of 100 kilowatt equivalents.\n\u2022Product costs of product accepted in the period (per kilowatt) - the average unit product cost for the Energy Servers that are accepted in a period. We use this metric to provide insight into the trajectory of product costs and, in particular, the effectiveness of cost reduction activities.\n\u2022Period costs of manufacturing expenses not included in product costs - the manufacturing and related operating costs that are incurred to procure parts and manufacture Energy Servers that are not included as part of product costs. We use this metric to measure any costs incurred to run our manufacturing operations that are not capitalized (i.e.,\nTable 58: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Table of Contents\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Index to Financial Statements\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nabsorbed, such as stock-based compensation) into inventory and therefore, expensed to our consolidated statement of operations in the period that they are incurred.\n\u2022Installation costs on product accepted (per kilowatt) - the average unit installation cost for Energy Servers that are accepted in a given period. This metric is used to provide insight into the trajectory of install costs and, in particular, to evaluate whether our installation costs are in line with our installation billings.\nWe no longer consider billings related to our products to be a key operating metric. Billings as a metric was introduced to provide insight into our customer contract billings as differentiated from revenue when a significant portion of those customer contracts had product and installation billings recognized as electricity revenue over the term of the contract instead of at the time of delivery or acceptance. Today, a very small portion of our customer contracts has revenue recognized over the term of the contract, and thus it is no longer a meaningful metric for us.\nAcceptances\nWe use acceptances as a key operating metric to measure the volume of our completed Energy Server installation activity from period to period. Acceptance typically occurs upon transfer of control to our customers, which depending on the contract terms is when the system is shipped and delivered to our customer, when the system is shipped and delivered and is physically ready for startup and commissioning, or when the system is shipped and delivered and is turned on and producing power.\nThe product acceptances in the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 were as follows:\nTable 59: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Years Ended\nDecember 31, </td> <td> </td> <td>Change </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2021 </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>Amount </td> <td> </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Product accepted during the period\n(in 100 kilowatt systems) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,879 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,326 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>553 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>41.7 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table>\nProduct accepted for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to the same period in 2020 increased by 553 systems, or 41.7%, as demand increased for our Energy Servers in the Republic of Korea and the utility sector where we accepted 196 systems as part of the CDG program.\nOur customers have several purchase options for our Energy Servers.

accepted for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to the same period in 2020 decreased by approximately $49 per kilowatt driven generally by our ongoing cost reduction efforts to reduce material costs in conjunction with our suppliers and our reduction in labor and overhead costs through increased volume, improved processes and automation at our manufacturing facilities. This decrease was partially offset by increases in freight and other supply chain-related pricing pressures.\nPeriod costs of manufacturing related expenses for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to the same period in 2020 increased by approximately $3.2 million primarily driven by increases in freight charges and other supply chain-related pricing pressures.\nInstallation costs on product accepted for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to the same period in 2020 decreased by approximately $339 per kilowatt. For the year ended December 31, 2021, the decrease in install cost was driven by site mix as many of the acceptances did not have installation, either because the installation was done by our distribution channel partner in the Republic of Korea or the final installation associated with a specific customer was scheduled to be completed at a later date although the Energy Servers were delivered and accepted during the period.\nTable 64: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Table of Contents\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Index to Financial Statements\n</td>

This increase was primarily driven by a $144.9 million increase in product revenue and a $34.6 million increase in service revenue partially offset by price reductions to expand our addressable market and $14.2 million of previously deferred revenue related to a specific contract that changed scope and was recognized in the year ended December 31, 2020.\nProduct Revenue\nProduct revenue increased by $144.9 million, or 27.9%, for the year ended December 31, 2021 as compared to the prior year period. The product revenue increase was driven primarily by a 41.7% increase in product acceptances as a result of expansion in existing markets and in our CDG program partially offset by price reductions to expand our addressable market and a $14.2 million of previously deferred revenue related to a specific contract that changed scope and was recognized in the year ended December 31, 2020.\nInstallation Revenue\nInstallation revenue decreased by $5.8 million, or (5.7)%, for the year ended December 31, 2021 as compared to the prior year period. This decrease in installation revenue was driven by site mix as many of the acceptances did not have installation, either because the installation was done by our distribution channel partner in the Republic of Korea or the final installation associated with a specific customer was scheduled to be completed at a later date although the Energy Servers were delivered and accepted during the period. We expect our installation revenue to continue to decline as percentage of total revenue as we ramp up shipments to SK ecoplant under PDA Restatement.\nService Revenue\nService revenue increased by $34.6 million, or 31.5%, for the year ended December 31, 2021 as compared to the prior year period. This increase was primarily due to the continued growth of our installation base driven by both an increase in new acceptances and renewal of existing service contracts. We expect our service revenue growth at a similar rate as we continue to expand our install base.\nElectricity Revenue\nElectricity revenue increased by $4.3 million, or 6.8%, for the year ended December 31, 2021 as compared to the prior year period due to the increase in Managed Services Financings.\nTable 66: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Table of

to the prior year period primarily driven by a $138.9 million increase in cost of product revenue, $16.0 million increase in cost of service revenue, increased freight charges and other supply chain-related pricing pressures. This increase was partially offset by a $6.3 million decrease in cost of installation revenue and our ongoing cost reduction efforts to reduce material costs in conjunction with our suppliers and our reduction in labor and overhead costs through increased volume, improved processes and automation at our manufacturing facilities.\nCost of Product Revenue\nCost of product revenue increased by $138.9 million, or 41.8%, for the year ended December 31, 2021 as compared to the prior year period. The cost of product revenue increase was driven primarily by a 41.7% increase in product acceptances, increased freight charges and other supply chain-related pricing pressures. This increase was partially offset by our ongoing cost reduction efforts to reduce material costs in conjunction with our suppliers and our reduction in labor and overhead costs through increased volume, improved processes and automation at our manufacturing facilities.\nCost of Installation Revenue\nCost of installation revenue decreased by $6.3 million, or (5.4)%, for the year ended December 31, 2021 as compared to the prior year period. This decrease, similar to the $5.8 million decrease in installation revenue, was driven by site mix as many of the acceptances did not have installation in the year ended December 31, 2021.\nCost of Service Revenue\nCost of service revenue increased by $16.0 million, or 12.1%, for the year ended December 31, 2021 as compared to the prior year period. This increase was primarily due to the 41.7% increase in acceptances plus the maintenance contract renewals associated with the increase in our fleet of Energy Servers, partially offset by the significant improvements in power module life, cost reductions and our actions to proactively manage fleet optimizations.\nCost of Electricity Revenue\nCost of electricity revenue decreased by $2.4 million, or (5.2)%, for the year ended December 31, 2021 as compared to the prior year period, primarily due to the $1.2 million change in the fair value of the natural gas fixed price forward contract and lower property tax expenses partially offset by the increase in Managed Services Financings.\nTable 68: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Table of Contents\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Index to Financial Statements\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nGross Profit and Gross Margin\nTable 69: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Years Ended\nDecember 31, </td> <td> </td> <td>Change </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2021 </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(dollars in thousands) </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gross profit: </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Product </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>191,858 </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>185,909 </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>5,949 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Installation </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(14,155) </td> <td> </td> <td>(14,655) </td> <td> </td> <td>500 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Service </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(4,102) </td> <td> </td> <td>(22,696) </td> <td> </td> <td>18,594 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Electricity </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>23,980 </td> <td> </td> <td>17,235 </td> <td> </td> <td>6,745 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total gross profit </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>197,581 </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>165,793 </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>31,788 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gross margin: </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Product </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>29 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>36 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Installation </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(15) </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>(14) </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Service </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(3) </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>(21) </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Electricity </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>35 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>27 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total gross margin </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>20 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>21 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTotal Gross Profit\nGross profit increased by $31.8 million in the year ended December 31, 2021 as compared to the prior year period primarily driven by the 41.7% increase in acceptances and our ongoing cost reduction efforts to reduce material costs in conjunction with our suppliers and our reduction in labor and overhead costs through increased volume, improved processes and automation at our manufacturing facilities. This increase was partially offset by price reductions to expand our addressable market and $14.2 million of previously deferred revenue related to a specific contract that changed scope and was recognized in the year ended December 31, 2020 without a corresponding increase in costs, increased freight charges and other supply chain-related pricing pressures.\nProduct Gross Profit\nProduct gross profit increased by $5.9 million in the year ended December 31, 2021 as compared to the prior year period. The improvement is driven by a 41.7% increase in product acceptances and our ongoing cost reduction efforts to reduce material costs in conjunction with our suppliers and our reduction in labor and overhead costs through increased volume, improved processes and automation at our manufacturing facilities. This increase was partially offset by price reductions to expand our addressable market and $14.2 million of previously deferred revenue related to a specific contract that changed scope and was recognized in the year ended December 30, 2020, increased freight charges and other supply chain-related pricing pressures.\nInstallation Gross Loss\nInstallation gross loss decreased by $0.5 million in the year ended December 31, 2021 as compared to the prior year period driven by the site mix, as many of the acceptances did not have installation in the current time period, and other site related factors such as site complexity, size, local ordinance requirements and location of the utility interconnect.\nService Gross Profit (Loss)\nService gross loss improved by $18.6 million in the year ended December 31, 2021 as compared to the prior year period. This was primarily due to the significant improvements in power module life, cost reductions and our actions to proactively manage fleet optimizations.\nTable 70: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>

There were no comparable debt restructuring activities in the current year's period.\nGain (Loss) on Revaluation of Embedded Derivatives\nGain (loss) on revaluation of embedded derivatives is derived from the change in fair value of our sales contracts of embedded EPP derivatives valued using historical grid prices and available forecasts of future electricity prices to estimate future electricity prices.\nGain (loss) on revaluation of embedded derivatives for the year ended December 31, 2021 as compared to the prior year period worsened by $1.4 million due to the change in fair value of our embedded EPP derivatives in our sales contracts.\nProvision for Income Taxes\nTable 76: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Years Ended\nDecember 31, </td> <td> </td> <td>Change </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2021 </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>Amount </td> <td> </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(dollars in thousands) </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Income tax provision </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,046 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>256 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>790 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>308.6 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table>\nIncome tax provision consists primarily of income taxes in foreign jurisdictions in which we conduct business.

Our cash and cash equivalents consist of highly liquid investments with maturities of three months or less, including money market funds. We maintain these balances with high credit quality counterparties, continually monitor the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer and diversify our investments in order to minimize our credit risk.\nIn October 2021, we entered into a Securities Purchase Agreement with SK ecoplant Co., Ltd. in connection with a strategic partnership. On December 29, 2021, we consummated the transactions related to the First Closing by issuing and selling to SK ecoplant 10,000,000 shares of RCPS, at a purchase price of $25.50 per share or an aggregate purchase price of $255 million. In November 2021, PPA V entered into a $136 million term loan, which replaces the LIBOR + 2.5% Term Loan due December 2021.\nAs of December 31, 2021, we had $291.8 million of total outstanding recourse debt, $234.9 million of non-recourse debt and $16.8 million of other long-term liabilities. For a complete description of our outstanding debt, please see Note 7 - Outstanding Loans and Security Agreements in Part II, Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\nThe combination of our existing cash and cash equivalents is expected to be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash flow needs for the next 12 months and thereafter for the foreseeable future. If these sources of cash are insufficient to satisfy our near-term or future cash needs, we may require additional capital from equity or debt financings to fund our operations, in particular, our manufacturing capacity, product development and market expansion requirements, to timely respond to competitive market pressures or strategic opportunities, or otherwise. We may, from time to time, engage in a variety of financing transactions for such purposes, including factoring our accounts receivable. We may not be able to secure timely additional financing on favorable terms, or at all. The terms of any additional financings may place limits on our financial and operating flexibility. If we raise additional funds through further issuances of equity or equity-linked securities, our existing stockholders could suffer dilution in their percentage ownership of us, and any new securities we issue could have rights, preferences and privileges senior to those of holders of our common stock.\nOur future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including our rate of revenue growth, the timing and extent of spending on research and development efforts and other business initiatives, the rate of growth in the volume of system builds and the need for additional manufacturing space, the expansion of sales and marketing activities both in domestic and international markets, market acceptance of our products, our ability to secure financing for customer use of our Energy Servers, the timing of installations, and overall economic conditions including the impact of COVID-19 on our ongoing and future operations. In order to support and achieve our future growth plans, we may need or seek advantageously to obtain additional funding through an equity or debt financing. Failure to obtain this financing or financing in future quarters will affect our results of operations, including revenue and cash flows.\nAs of December 31, 2021, the current portion of our total debt is $25.8 million, of which $17.5 million is outstanding non-recourse debt. We expect a certain portion of the non-recourse debt would be refinanced by the applicable PPA Entity prior to maturity.\nA summary of our consolidated sources and uses of cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash was as follows (in thousands):\nTable 79: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Years Ended\nDecember 31, </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2021 </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash provided by (used in): </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating activities </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(60,681) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(98,796) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Investing activities </td> <td> </td> <td>(46,696) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(37,913) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Financing activities </td> <td> </td> <td>306,375 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>176,031 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 80: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Table of Contents\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Index to Financial Statements\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nNet cash provided by (used in) our PPA Entities, which are incorporated into the consolidated statements of cash flows, was as follows (in thousands):\nTable 81: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Years Ended\nDecember 31, </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2021 </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>PPA Entities 1 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash provided by PPA operating activities </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>3,188 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>26,039 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash provided by (used in) PPA financing activities </td> <td> </td> <td>3,231 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(23,784) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\n1 The PPA Entities' operating and financing cash flows are a subset of our consolidated cash flows and represent the stand-alone cash flows prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Operating activities consist principally of cash used to run the operations of the PPA Entities, the purchase of Energy Servers from us and principal reductions in loan balances. Financing activities consist primarily of changes in debt carried by our PPAs, and payments from and distributions to noncontrolling partnership interests. We believe this presentation of net cash provided by (used in) PPA activities is useful to provide the reader with the impact to consolidated cash flows of the PPA Entities in which we have only a minority interest.\nOperating Activities\nOur operating activities have consisted of net loss adjusted for certain non-cash items plus changes in our operating assets and liabilities or working capital. The increase in cash used in operating activities during the year ended December 31, 2021 as compared to the prior year period was primarily the result of an increase in our net working capital of $18.8 million in the year ended December 31, 2021 due to the timing of revenue transactions and corresponding collections and the increase in inventory levels to support future demand.\nInvesting Activities\nOur investing activities have consisted of capital expenditures that include investment to increase our production capacity. We expect to continue such activities as our business grows. Cash used in investing activities of $46.7 million during the year ended December 31, 2021 was primarily the result of expenditures on tenant improvements for a newly leased engineering building in Fremont, California. We expect to continue to make capital expenditures over the next few quarters to prepare our new manufacturing facility in Fremont, California for production, which includes the purchase of new equipment and other tenant improvements. We intend to fund these capital expenditures from cash on hand as well as cash flow to be generated from operations. We may also evaluate and arrange equipment lease financing to fund these capital expenditures.\nFinancing Activities\nHistorically, our financing activities have consisted of borrowings and repayments of debt including to related parties, proceeds and repayments of financing obligations, distributions paid to noncontrolling interests and redeemable noncontrolling interests, and the proceeds from the issuance of our common stock. Net cash provided by financing activities during the year ended December 31, 2021 was $306.4 million, an increase of $130.3 million compared to the prior year period, primarily due to the issuance of RCPS to SK ecoplant in December 2021, combined with proceeds in 2021 from stock option exercises and the sale of shares under our 2018 Employee Stock Purchase Plan.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe include in our consolidated financial statements all assets and liabilities and results of operations of our PPA Entities that we have entered into and over which we have substantial control. For additional information, see Note 13 - Portfolio Financings in Part II, Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\nWe have not entered into any other transactions that have generated relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships or special purpose entities. Accordingly, as of December 31, 2021 and 2020 we had no off-balance sheet arrangements.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nThe consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles as applied in the United States (\"U.S. GAAP\") The preparation of the consolidated financial statements requires us to make\nTable 82: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Table of Contents\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Index to Financial Statements\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nestimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, costs and expenses and related disclosures. Our discussion and analysis of our financial results under Results of Operations above are based on our audited results of operations, which we have prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. In preparing these consolidated financial statements, we make assumptions, judgments and estimates that can affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and net income. On an ongoing basis, we base our estimates on historical experience, as appropriate, and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Changes in the accounting estimates are representative of estimation uncertainty, and are reasonably likely to occur from period to period. Accordingly, actual results could differ significantly from the estimates made by our management. We evaluate our estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis. To the extent that there are material differences between these estimates and actual results, our future financial statement presentation, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows will be affected. We believe that the following critical accounting policies involve a greater degree of judgment and complexity than our other accounting policies. Accordingly, these are the policies we believe are the most critical to understanding and evaluating the consolidated financial condition and results of operations.\nThe accounting policies that most frequently require us to make assumptions, judgments and estimates, and therefore are critical to understanding our results of operations, include:\nDiscussion of Earliest Year of Changes in Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nWe include discussion of the earliest year of changes in financial condition and results of operations, as deemed appropriate, even when such information has been previously disclosed in our prior EDGAR filings. We consider the total mix of available information, including the impact of any recastable events when determining whether to omit discussion of the earliest year and the most appropriate form of presentation. We determine to limit the discussion to the information that has changed or has been determined to be significant to our operations or financial condition.\nRevenue Recognition\nWe apply Accounting Standards Codification (\"ASC\") Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers. We identify our contracts with Customers, determine our performance obligations and the transaction price, and after allocating the transaction price to the performance obligations, we recognize revenue as we satisfy our performance obligations and transfer control of our products and services to our customers. Most of our contracts with customers contain performance obligations with a combination of our Energy Server product, installation and maintenance services. For these performance obligations, we allocate the total transaction price to each performance obligation based on the relative standalone selling price.\nWe generally recognize product revenue from contracts with customers at the point that control is transferred to the customers. This occurs when we achieve customer acceptance which typically occurs upon transfer of control to our customers, which depending on the contract terms is when the system is shipped and delivered to our customers, when the system is shipped and delivered and is physically ready for start up and commissioning, or when the system is shipped and delivered and is turned on and producing power.\nWe recognize installation revenue when the system has been installed and is running at full power.\nService revenue is recognized ratably over the term of the first or renewed one-year service period. Given our customers' renewal history, we anticipate that most of them will continue to renew their maintenance services agreements each year for the period of their expected use of the Energy Server. The contractual renewal price may be less than the standalone selling price of the maintenance services and consequently the contract renewal option may provide the customer with a material right. We estimate the standalone selling price for customer renewal options that give rise to material rights using the practical alternative by reference to optional maintenance services renewal periods expected to be provided and the corresponding expected consideration for these services. This reflects the fact that our additional performance obligations in any contractual renewal period are consistent with the services provided under the standard first-year warranty. Where we have determined that a customer has a material right as a result of their contract renewal option, we recognize that portion of the transaction price allocated to the material right over the period in which such rights are exercised.\nGiven that we typically sell an Energy Server with a maintenance service agreement and have not provided maintenance services to a customer who does not have use of an Energy Server, standalone selling prices are estimated using a cost-plus approach. Costs relating to Energy Servers include all direct and indirect manufacturing costs, applicable overhead costs and costs for normal production inefficiencies (i.e., variances). We then apply a margin to the Energy Servers which may vary with the size of the customer, geographic region and the scale of the Energy Server deployment. Costs relating to installation include all direct and indirect installation costs. The margin we apply reflects our profit objectives relating to installation. Costs for\nTable 83: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Table of Contents\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Index to Financial Statements\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nmaintenance service arrangements are estimated over the life of the maintenance contracts and include estimated future service costs and future material costs. Material costs over the period of the service arrangement are impacted significantly by the longevity of the fuel cells themselves. After considering the total service costs, we apply a lower margin to our service costs than to our Energy Servers as it best reflects our long-term service margin expectations and comparable historical industry service margins. As a result, our estimate of our selling price is driven primarily by our expected margin on both the Energy Server and the maintenance service agreements based on their respective costs or, in the case of maintenance service agreements, the estimated costs to be incurred.\nThe total transaction price is determined based on the total consideration specified in the contract, including variable consideration in the form of a performance guaranty payment that represents potential amounts payable to customers. The expected value method is generally used when estimating variable consideration, which typically reduces the total transaction price due to the nature of the performance obligations to which the variable consideration relates. These estimates reflect our historical experience and current contractual requirements which cap the maximum amount that may be paid. The expected value method requires judgment and considers multiple factors that may vary over time depending upon the unique facts and circumstances related to each performance obligation. Depending on the facts and circumstances, a change in variable consideration estimate will either be accounted for at the contract level or using the portfolio method.\nFor successful sales-leaseback arrangements, we recognize product and installation revenue upon meeting criteria demonstrating we have transferred control to the customer (the Buyer-Lessor). When control of the Energy Server is transferred to the financier, and we determine the leaseback qualifies as an operating lease in accordance with ASC 842, Leases (\"ASC 842\"), we record a ROU asset and a lease liability, and recognize revenue based on the fair value of the Energy Servers with an allocation to product revenue and installations revenue based on the relative standalone selling prices. We recognize as financing obligations any proceeds received to finance our ongoing costs to operate the Energy Servers.\nValuation of Escalator Protection Plan Agreements (\"EPP\")\nWe have entered into agreements with certain customers which require us to recognize a liability in compliance with the financial accounting and reporting requirements of ASC Topic 820, Fair Value Measurement (\"ASC 820\"). We use third party valuation experts to provide us with the initial Level 3 fair value measurement that estimates the fair value of the subject liabilities using inputs of forecasted avoided costs and the cost of electricity. We determine our final estimate of liability based on internal reviews and in consideration of the estimates received. Although measured each reporting period, our estimates may vary from the actual payments made under the contractual agreements, as the estimates include current known liability and estimates of potential future payments. We use valuation methodology including using a Monte Carlo simulation model, with estimated inputs of beginning value, growth rate and volatility, and further discount our estimate of liability based on our cost of debt commensurate with the payment period.\nValuation of Certain Financial Instruments and Customer Financing Receivables\nWe have entered into certain Customer Financing Receivables with our PPA 3a arrangement, and debt financings that include Redeemable Senior Secured Notes, Convertible Senior Notes, Senior Secured Notes, Term Loans and Fixed Rate Notes. We are required to determine the fair value of the assets or liabilities for financial reporting purposes under ASC 820, and as applicable, under the guidance of ASC Topic 840, Leases, and ASC Topic 815, Derivatives and Hedging (\"ASC 815\"). We use third party valuation experts to provide us with the initial Level 3 fair value measurement that estimates the fair value of the subject assets or liabilities using inputs of principal to be received or paid, maturity dates, coupon rates, selected discount rate based on implied rating and comparable yield curves in Energy and Non-Financial markets. We determine our final estimate of fair value based on internal reviews and in consideration of the estimates received. The objective of the fair value measurement of our estimate is to represent the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date.\nValuation of Assets and Liabilities of the SK ecoplant Strategic Investment\nWe have entered into an agreement with SK ecoplant that provides the opportunity, but does not require, an additional investment in common stock Class A, subject to a cap on the total potential share purchase, and as a component of transaction, includes a purchase commitment by the investor for future product purchases.\nWe are required to determine the fair value of the assets or liabilities for financial reporting purposes under ASC 820, and as applicable, under the guidance of ASC 815 and ASC Topic 480 Distinguishing Liabilities from Equity. We use third party valuation experts that are recognized as financial instrument accounting specialists to provide us with the initial Level 3 fair value measurement that estimates the fair value of the subject assets or liabilities using inputs of number of shares,\nTable 84: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Table of Contents\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Index to Financial Statements\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nunderlying prices of Bloom Energy stock, rights and obligations of the counterparties, valuation assumptions related to options, and the assessed value of our product revenue streams and the timing of expected revenue recognition. We determine our final estimate of fair value based on internal reviews and in consideration of the estimates received. The objective of the fair value measurement of our estimate is to represent the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. We determine the reasonableness of our valuation methodology, assumptions on the timing and probability of a redemption event, and the expected number of shares to be exercised with the Option, and review the mathematical accuracy of the calculations before recording in our consolidated statement of operations and consolidated balance sheets. See Note 18 - SK ecoplant Strategic Investment.\nIncremental Borrowing Rate (\"IBR\") by Lease Class\nWe adopted ASC 842 on January 1, 2020 on a modified retrospective basis. This guidance requires that, for all our leases, we recognize ROU assets representing our right to use the underlying asset for the lease term, and lease liabilities related to the rights and obligations created by those leases, on the balance sheet regardless of whether they are classified as finance or operating leases, with classification affecting the pattern and presentation of expenses and cash flows on the consolidated financial statements. Lease liabilities are measured at the lease commencement date as the present value of future minimum lease payments over the reasonably certain lease term. Lease ROU assets are measured as the lease liability plus initial direct costs and prepaid lease payments less lease incentives. In measuring the present value of the future minimum lease payments, we used our collateralized incremental borrowing rate as our leases do not generally provide an implicit rate. The determination of the incremental borrowing rate considers qualitative and quantitative factors as well as the estimated impact that the collateral has on the rate. We determine our incremental borrowing rate based on the lease class of assets which relates to those supporting of manufacturing and general operations, and those supporting electricity revenue transactions.\nFor successful sale-leasebacks, as Seller-Lessee, we determine the collateralized IBR on our leased equipment based on a fair value assessment provided by third-party valuation experts.\nStock-Based Compensation\nWe account for stock options and other equity awards, such as restricted stock units and performance-based stock units, to employees and non-employee directors under the provisions of ASC 718, Compensation-Stock Compensation. Accordingly, the stock-based compensation expense for these awards is measured based on the fair value on the date of grant. For stock options, we recognize the expense, net of estimated forfeitures, under the straight-line attribution over the requisite service period which is generally the vesting term. The fair value of the stock options is estimated using the Black-Scholes valuation model. For options with a vesting condition tied to the attainment of service and market conditions, stock-based compensation costs are recognized using Monte Carlo simulations. In addition, we use the Black-Scholes valuation model to estimate the fair value of stock purchase rights under the Bloom Energy Corporation 2018 Employee Stock Purchase Plan (the \"2018 ESPP\"). The fair value of the 2018 ESPP purchase rights is recognized as expense under the multiple options approach.\nThe Black-Scholes valuation model uses as inputs the fair value of our common stock and assumptions we make for the volatility of our common stock, the expected term of the award, the risk-free interest rate for a period that approximates the expected term of the stock options and the expected dividend yield. In developing estimates used to calculate assumptions, we established the expected term for employee options as well as expected forfeiture rates based on the historical settlement experience and after giving consideration to vesting schedules.\nIncome Taxes\nWe account for income taxes using the liability method under ASC 740, Income Taxes. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on net operating loss carryforwards, research and development credit carryforwards and temporary differences resulting from the different treatment of items for tax and financial reporting purposes. Deferred items are measured using the enacted tax rates and laws that are expected to be in effect when the differences reverse. We must assess the likelihood that deferred tax assets will be recovered as deductions from future taxable income. This determination is based on expected future results and the future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences. Furthermore, uncertain tax positions are evaluated by management and amounts are recorded when it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination, including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes, based on the technical merits. Significant judgement is required throughout management's process in evaluating each uncertain tax position including future taxable income expectations and tax-planning strategies to determine whether the more likely than not recognition threshold has been met. We have provided a full valuation allowance on our domestic deferred tax assets because we believe it is more likely than not that our deferred tax assets will not be realized.\nTable 85: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Table of Contents\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Index to Financial Statements\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nPrinciples of Consolidation\nOur consolidated financial statements include the operations of our subsidiaries in which we have a controlling financial interest. We use a qualitative approach in assessing the consolidation requirements for each of our PPA Entities that are variable interest entities (\"VIEs\"). This approach focuses on determining whether we have the power to direct those activities that significantly affect their economic performance and whether we have the obligation to absorb losses, or the right to receive benefits that could potentially be significant to the PPA Entities. The considerations for VIE consolidation is a complex analysis that requires us to determine whether we are the primary beneficiary and therefore have the power to direct activities which are most significant to those PPA Entities.\nAllocation of Profits and Losses of Consolidated Entities to Noncontrolling Interests and Redeemable Noncontrolling Interests\nWe generally allocate profits and losses to noncontrolling interests under the HLBV method. The HLBV method is a balance sheet-oriented approach for applying the equity method of accounting when there is a complex structure, such as the flip structure of the PPA Entities.\nThe determination of equity in earnings under the HLBV method requires management to determine how proceeds, upon a hypothetical liquidation of the entity at book value, would be allocated between our investors. The noncontrolling interest balance is presented as a component of permanent equity in the consolidated balance sheets.\nNoncontrolling interests with redemption features, such as put options, that are not solely within our control are considered redeemable noncontrolling interests. Exercisability of put options are solely dependent upon the passage of time, and hence, such put options are considered to be probable of becoming exercisable. We elected to accrete changes in the redemption value over the period from the date it becomes probable that the instrument will become redeemable to the earliest redemption date of the instrument by using an interest method. The balance of redeemable noncontrolling interests on the balance sheets is reported at the greater of its carrying value or its maximum redemption value at each reporting date. The redeemable noncontrolling interests are classified as temporary equity and therefore are reported in the mezzanine section of the consolidated balance sheets as redeemable noncontrolling interests.\nTable 86: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Table of Contents\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Index to Financial Statements\n</td> </tr>\n</table>", "item_7_text": "ITEM 7 - MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF\nOPERATIONS\nOverview\nDescription of Bloom Energy\nOur mission is to make clean, reliable energy affordable for everyone in the world. We created the first large-scale, commercially viable solid oxide fuel-cell based power generation platform that empowers businesses, essential services, critical infrastructure and communities to responsibly take charge of their energy.\nOur technology, invented in the United States, is one of the most advanced electricity and hydrogen producing technologies on the market today. Our fuel-flexible Bloom Energy Servers can use biogas, hydrogen, natural gas, or a blend of fuels to create resilient, sustainable and cost-predictable power at significantly higher efficiencies than traditional, combustion-based resources. In addition, our same solid oxide platform that powers our fuel cells can be used to create hydrogen, which is increasingly recognized as a critically important tool necessary for the full decarbonization of the energy economy. Our enterprise customers include some of the largest multinational corporations in the world. We also have strong relationships with some of the largest utility companies in the United States and the Republic of Korea.\nAt Bloom Energy, we look forward to a net-zero future. Our technology is designed to help enable this future in order to deliver reliable, low-carbon, electricity in a world facing unacceptable levels of power disruptions. Our resilient platform has kept electricity available for our customers through hurricanes, earthquakes, typhoons, forest fires, extreme heat and grid failures. Unlike traditional combustion power generation, our platform is community-friendly and designed to significantly reduce emissions of criteria air pollutants. We have made tremendous progress making renewable fuel production a reality through our biogas, hydrogen and electrolyzer programs, and we believe that we are well-positioned as a core platform and fixture in the new energy paradigm to help organizations and communities achieve their net-zero objectives.\nWe market and sell our Energy Servers primarily through our direct sales organization in the United States, and also have direct and indirect sales channels internationally. Recognizing that deploying our solutions requires a material financial commitment, we have developed a number of financing options to support sales of our Energy Servers to customers who lack the financial capability to purchase our Energy Servers directly, who prefer to finance the acquisition using third-party financing or who prefer to contract for our services on a pay-as-you-go model.\nOur typical target commercial or industrial customer has historically been either an investment-grade entity or a customer with investment-grade attributes such as size, assets and revenue, liquidity, geographically diverse operations and general financial stability. We have also expanded our product and financing options to the below-investment-grade customers and have also expanded internationally to target customers with deployments on a wholesale grid. Given that our customers are typically large institutions with multi-level decision making processes, we generally experience a lengthy sales process.\nStrategic Investment\nOn October 23, 2021, we entered into the SPA with SK ecoplant in connection with a strategic partnership. Pursuant to the SPA, on December 29, 2021, we sold to SK ecoplant 10 million shares of zero coupon, non-voting redeemable convertible Series A preferred stock in us, par value $0.0001 per share (\"RCPS\"), at a purchase price of $25.50 per share for an aggregate purchase price of $255 million (the \"Initial Investment\").\nSimultaneous with the execution of the SPA, we and SK ecoplant executed an amendment to the Joint Venture Agreement (\"JVA\"), an amendment and restatement to our Preferred Distribution Agreement (\"PDA Restatement\") and a new Commercial Cooperation Agreement regarding initiatives pertaining to the hydrogen market and general market expansion for the Bloom Energy Server and Bloom Energy Electrolyzer. For additional details about the transaction with SK ecoplant, please see Note 18 - SK ecoplant Strategic Investment, and for more information about our joint venture with SK ecoplant, please see Note 12 - Related Party Transactions in Part II, Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\nCOVID-19 Pandemic\nGeneral\nWe continue to monitor and adjust as appropriate our operations in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, including the Omicron variant. As a technology company that supplies resilient, reliable and clean energy, we have been able to conduct the majority of operations as an essential business\u201d in California and Delaware, where we manufacture and perform many of our\n\nR&D activities, as well as in other states and countries where we are installing or maintaining our Energy Servers. Many of our employees continue to work from home as a result of the spread of the Omicron variant unless they are directly supporting essential manufacturing production operations, installation work, and service and maintenance activities as well as some R&D and general administrative functions. We maintain protocols to minimize the risk of COVID-19 transmission within our facilities, including enhanced cleaning and masking if required by the local authorities, as well as providing testing for all employees. We will continue to follow CDC and local guidelines when notified of possible exposures. For more information regarding the risks posed to our company by the COVID-19 pandemic, refer to Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors - Risks Related to Our Products and Manufacturing - Our business has been and continues to be adversely affected by the COVID-19 pandemic.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nCOVID-19 created disruptions throughout various aspects of our business as noted herein, and impacted our results of operations in the year ended December 31, 2021. While we improved our liquidity in 2020, we increased our working capital spend in the first half of 2021. We have entered into new leases to maintain sufficient manufacturing facilities to meet anticipated demand in 2022, including new product line expansion. In addition, we also increased our working capital spend and resources to enhance our marketing efforts and to expand into new geographies both domestically and internationally.\nWe believe we have the sufficient capital to run our business over the next 12 months, including the completion of the build out of our manufacturing facilities. Our working capital was strengthened with the Initial Investment by SK ecoplant as described above. In addition, we may still enter the equity or debt market as need to support the expansion of our business. Please refer to Note 7 - Outstanding Loans and Security Agreements in Part II, Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data; and Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors - Risks Related to Our Liquidity - Our substantial indebtedness, and restrictions imposed by the agreements governing our and our PPA Entities' outstanding indebtedness, may limit our financial and operating activities and may adversely affect our ability to incur additional debt to fund future needs, and We may not be able to generate sufficient cash to meet our debt service obligations, for more information regarding the terms of and risks associated with our debt.\nSales\nWe did not experience a significant impact on our selling activity related to COVID-19 during the year ended December 31, 2021.\nCustomer Financing\nThe ongoing COVID-19 pandemic resulted in a significant drop in the ability of many financiers (particularly financing institutions) to monetize tax credits, primarily the result of a potential drop in taxable income stemming from the pandemic. However, during the last two quarters, we began to see this constraint improving. Our ability to obtain financing for our Energy Servers partly depends on the creditworthiness of our customers, and a few of our customers' credit ratings have fallen during the pandemic, which can impact the financing for their use of an Energy Server. We continue to work on obtaining the financing required for our 2022 installations but if we are unable to secure such financing our revenue, cash flow and liquidity will be materially impacted.\nInstallations and Maintenance of Energy Servers\nOur installation and maintenance operations were impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic in 2021. Our installation projects have experienced some delays relating to, among other things, shortages in available parts and labor for design, installation and other work; and the inability or delay in our ability to access customer facilities due to shutdowns or other restrictions. Despite the impact on installations during the year ended December 31, 2021 and given our mitigation strategies, we only had one instance of a significant delay in the installation of our Energy Servers as a result of supply chain issues that pushed an installation out a quarter.\nAs to maintenance, if we are delayed in or unable to perform scheduled or unscheduled maintenance, our previously-installed Energy Servers will likely experience adverse performance impacts including reduced output and/or efficiency, which could result in warranty and/or guaranty claims by our customers. Further, due to the nature of our Energy Servers, if we are unable to replace worn parts in accordance with our standard maintenance schedule, we may be subject to increased costs in the future. During the year ended December 31, 2021, we experienced no delays in servicing our Energy Servers due to COVID-19.\n\nSupply Chain\nDuring 2021, we experienced COVID-19 related delays from certain vendors and suppliers, although we were able to mitigate the impact so that we did not experience delays in the manufacture of our Energy Servers and experienced only one significant delay in the installation of our Energy Servers as mentioned above. We have a global supply chain and obtain components from Asia, Europe and India. In many cases, the components we obtain are jointly developed with our suppliers and unique to us, which makes it difficult to obtain and qualify alternative suppliers should our suppliers be impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic or related effects.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2021, we continued to experience supply chain disruptions due to direct and indirect COVID-19 impacts. There have been a number of disruptions throughout the global supply chain as the global economy opens up and drives demand for certain components that has outpaced the return of the global supply chain to full production. Although we were able to find alternatives for many component shortages, we experienced some delays and cost increases with respect to container shortages, ocean shipping and air freight. We have put actions in place to mitigate the disruptions by booking alternate sea routes, limiting our use of air shipments, creating virtual hubs and consolidating shipments coming from the same region. During the three months ended December 31, 2021, we continued to manage disruptions from an increase in lead times for most of our components due to a variety of factors, including supply shortages, shipping delays and labor shortages, and we expect this to continue through the first half of 2022. We expect raw material pricing pressures and component shortages especially for semiconductors and specialty metals to persist at least through this time period. In addition, the impact of inflation on the price of components, raw materials and labor may result in increased prices. In the event we are unable to mitigate the impact of delays and/or price increases in raw materials, electronic components and freight, it could delay the manufacturing and installation of our Energy Servers and increase the cost of our Energy Server, which would adversely impact our cash flows and results of operations, including revenue and gross margin.\nIf spikes in COVID-19 occur in regions in which our supply chain operates, including as a result of the Delta or Omicron variant, we could experience a delay in components and incur further freight price increases, which could in turn impact production and installations and our cash flow and results of operations, including revenue and gross margin.\nManufacturing\nAlthough we have experienced labor shortages due to COVID-19 absences and the relative shortage of labor, overall this has not impacted our production given the safety protocols we have put in place augmented by our ability to increase our shifts and obtain a contingent work force for some of the manufacturing activities. We have incurred additional labor expense due to enhanced safety protocols designed to minimize exposure and risk of COVID-19 transmission as well as increased wages in general. If COVID-19 materially impacts our supply chain or if we experience a significant COVID-19 outbreak that affects our manufacturing workforce, our production could be adversely impacted which could adversely impact our cash flow and results of operation, including revenue.\nPurchase and Financing Options\nOverview\nIn order to appeal to the largest variety of customers, we make available several options to our customers. Both in the United States and abroad, we sell Energy Servers directly to customers. In the United States, we also enable customers' use of the Energy Servers through a pay as you go offering, made possible through third-party ownership financing arrangements.\nOften our offerings take advantage of local incentives. In the United States, our financing arrangements are structured to optimize both federal and local incentives, including the ITC and accelerated depreciation. Internationally, our sales are made primarily to distributors who on-sell to, and install for, customers; these deals are also structured to use local incentives applicable to our Energy Servers. Increasingly, we use trusted installers and other sourcing collaborations in the United States to generate transactions.\nWhichever option is selected by a customer in the Unites States or internationally, the contract structure will include obligations on our part to operate and maintain the Energy Server ( O&M Obligations\u201d). The O&M Obligations may either be (i) for a one-year period, subject to annual renewal at the customer's option, which historically are almost always renewed year over year, or (ii) for a fixed term. In the United States, the contract structure often includes obligations on our part to install the Energy Servers ( Installation Obligations\u201d). Consequently, our transactions may generate revenue from the sale of Energy Servers and electricity, performance of O&M Obligations, and performance of Installation Obligations.\nIn addition to customary workmanship and materials warranties, as part of the O&M Obligations we provide warranties and guaranties regarding the efficiency and output of our Energy Servers to the customer and, in certain financing structures, to\n\nthe financing parties too. We refer to a performance warranty\u201d as an obligation to repair or replace the Energy Servers as necessary to return performance of an Energy Server to the warranted performance level. We refer to a performance guaranty\u201d as an obligation to make a payment to compensate for the failure of the Energy Server to meet the guaranteed performance level. Our obligation to make payments under the performance guaranty is always contractually capped.\nEnergy Server Sales\nThere are customers who purchase our Energy Servers directly from us pursuant to customary equipment sales contracts. In connection with the purchase of Energy Servers, the customers also enter into a contract with us for the O&M Obligations. The customer may elect to engage us to provide the Installation Obligations or engage a third-party provider. Internationally, sales often occur through distribution arrangements pursuant to which local construction services providers perform the Installation Obligations, as is the case in the Republic of Korea; we contract directly with the customer to provide O&M Obligations.\nA customer may enter into a contract for the sale of our Energy Servers and finance that acquisition through a sale-leaseback with a financial institution. In most cases, the financial institution completes its purchase from us immediately after commissioning. We both (i) facilitate this financing arrangement between the financial institution and the customer and (ii) provide ongoing operations and maintenance services for the Energy Servers (such arrangement, a Traditional Lease\u201d).\nCustomer Financing Options\nWith respect to the third-party financing options in the United States, a customer may choose a contract for the use Energy Servers in exchange for a capacity-based flat payment (a Managed Services Agreement\u201d) or one for the purchase of electricity generated by the Energy Servers in exchange for a scheduled dollars per kilowatt hour rate (a Power Purchase Agreement\u201d or PPA\u201d).\nCertain customer payments in a Managed Services Agreement are required regardless of the level of performance of the Energy Server; in some cases it may also include a variable payment based on the Energy Server's performance or a performance-related set-off. Managed Services Agreements are then financed pursuant to a sale-leaseback with a financial institution (a Managed Services Financing\u201d).\nPPAs are typically financed on a portfolio basis. We have financed portfolios through tax equity partnerships, acquisition financings and direct sales to investors (each, a Portfolio Financing\u201d).\nIn the United States, our capacity to offer our Energy Servers through either of these financed arrangements depends in large part on the ability of financing parties to optimize the tax benefits associated with a fuel cell, such as the ITC or accelerated depreciation. Interest rate fluctuations, and internationally, currency exchanges fluctuations, may also impact the attractiveness of any financing offerings for our customers. Our ability to finance a Managed Services Agreement or a PPA is also related to, and may be limited by, the creditworthiness of the customer. Additionally, the Managed Services Financing option is limited by a customer's willingness to commit to making payments to a financing party regardless of the level of performance of the Energy Server.\nIn each of our financing options, we typically perform the functions of a project developer, including identifying end customers and financiers, leading the negotiations of the customer agreements and financing agreements, securing all necessary permitting and interconnections approvals, and overseeing the design and construction of the project up to and including commissioning the Energy Servers. Increasingly, however, we are making sales to third-party developers.\nEach of our financing transaction structures is described in further detail below.\n\nManaged Services Financing\nUnder our Managed Services Financing option, we enter into a Managed Services Agreement with a customer for a certain term. The fixed capacity-based payments made by the customer under the Managed Services Agreement are applied toward our obligation to pay down our periodic rent liability under a sale-leaseback transaction with a financier. We assign all our rights to such fixed payments made by the customer to the financier, as lessor.\nOnce we enter into a Managed Services Agreement with the customer, and a financier is identified, we sell the Energy Server to the financier, as lessor, who then leases it back to us, as lessee, pursuant to a sale-leaseback transaction. Certain of our sale-leaseback transactions failed to achieve all of the criteria for sale accounting. For such failed sale-and-leaseback transactions, the proceeds from the transaction are recognized as a financing obligation within our consolidated balance sheet. For successful sale-and-leaseback transactions, the financier of a Managed Services Agreement typically pays the purchase price for an Energy Server at or around acceptance, and we recognize the fair value of the Energy Servers sold within product and install revenue and recognize a right-of-use (\"ROU\") asset and a lease liability on our consolidated balance sheet. Any proceeds in excess of the fair value of the Energy Servers are recognized as a financing obligation.\nThe duration of our current Managed Services Agreement offerings is between five and ten years.\nOur Managed Services Agreements typically provide for performance warranties of both the efficiency and output of the Energy Server and may include other warranties depending on the type of deployment. We often structure payments from the\n\ncustomer as a dollars per kilowatt-hour payment and our pricing assumes revenue at the 95% output level. This means that our revenue may be lower than expected if output is less than 95% and higher if output exceeds 95%. As of December 31, 2021, we had incurred no liabilities due to failure to repair or replace our Energy Servers pursuant to these performance warranties and the fleet of our Energy Servers deployed pursuant to the Managed Services Financings was performing at a lifetime average output of approximately 85%.\nPortfolio Financings\nIn the past, we financed the Energy Servers subject to our PPAs through two types of Portfolio Financings. In one type of transaction, we sold a portfolio of PPAs to a tax equity partnership in which we held a managing member interest (such partnership in which we hold an interest, a PPA Entity\u201d). In these transactions, we sold the portfolio of Energy Servers to a limited liability project company of which the PPA Entity was the sole member (such portfolio owner, a Portfolio Company\u201d). Whether an investor, a tax equity partnership, or a single member limited liability company, the Portfolio Company is the entity that directly owns the portfolio. The Portfolio Company sells the electricity generated by the Energy Servers contemplated by the PPAs to the customers. We recognize revenue as the electricity is produced. Our current practices no longer contemplate these types of transactions.\nWe also finance PPAs through a second type of Portfolio Financing pursuant to which we (i) directly sell a portfolio of PPAs and the Energy Servers or (ii) sell a Portfolio Company, in each case to an investor or tax equity partnership in which we do not have an equity interest (a Third-Party PPA\u201d). Like the other Portfolio Financing structure, the investor or tax equity partnership owns the Portfolio Company or the Energy Servers directly, and in each case, sells the electricity generated by the Energy Servers contemplated by the PPAs to the customers. For further discussion, see Note 11 - Portfolio Financings in Part II, Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\nWhen we finance a portfolio of Energy Servers and PPAs through a Portfolio Financing, we typically enter into a sale, engineering and procurement and construction agreement ( EPC Agreement\u201d) and an O&M Agreement, with the Portfolio Company. As owner of the portfolio of PPAs and related Energy Servers, the Portfolio Company receives all customer payments generated under the PPAs, the benefits of the ITC and accelerated tax depreciation, and any other available state or local benefits arising out of the ownership or operation of the Energy Servers, to the extent not already allocated to the customer under the PPA.\n\nThe sales of our Energy Servers in connection with a Portfolio Financing have many of the same terms and conditions as a direct sale. Payment of the purchase price is generally broken down into multiple installments, which may include payments prior to shipment, upon shipment or delivery of the Energy Server, and upon acceptance of the Energy Server.\nUnder an O&M Agreement, a one-year service package is provided with the initial sale that includes performance warranties and performance guaranties. After the expiration of the initial standard one-year package, the Portfolio Company has the option to extend our services under the O&M Agreement on an annual basis at a price determined at the time of purchase of our Energy Server. After the standard one-year service package, the Portfolio Company has almost always exercised the option to renew our services under the O&M Agreement.\nAs of December 31, 2021, we had incurred no liabilities to investors in Portfolio Financings due to failure to repair or replace Energy Servers pursuant to these performance warranties. Our obligation to make payments for underperformance against the performance guaranties was capped at an aggregate total of approximately $114.6 million (including payments both for low output and for low efficiency) and our aggregate remaining potential liability under this cap was approximately $104.4 million.\nObligations to Portfolio Companies\nOur Portfolio Financings involve many obligations on our part to the Portfolio Company. These obligations are set forth in the applicable EPC Agreement and O&M Agreement, and may include some or all of the following obligations:\n\u2022designing, manufacturing, and installing the Energy Servers, and selling such Energy Servers to the Portfolio Company;\n\u2022obtaining all necessary permits and other governmental approvals necessary for the installation and operation of the Energy Servers, and maintaining such permits and approvals throughout the term of the EPC Agreements and O&M Agreements;\n\u2022operating and maintaining the Energy Servers in compliance with all applicable laws, permits and regulations;\n\u2022satisfying the performance warranties and guaranties set forth in the applicable O&M Agreements; and\n\u2022complying with any other specific requirements contained in the PPAs with customers.\nIn some cases, the EPC Agreement obligates us to repurchase the Energy Server in the event of certain IP Infringement claims. In others, a repurchase of the Energy Server is only one optional remedy we have to cure an IP Infringement claim. The O&M Agreement grants a Portfolio Company the right to obligate us to repurchase the Energy Servers in the event the Energy Servers fail to comply with the performance warranties and guaranties in the O&M Agreement and we do not cure such failure in the applicable time period, or that a PPA terminates as a result of any failure by us to perform the obligations in the O&M Agreement. In some of our Portfolio Financings, our obligation to repurchase Energy Servers under the O&M extends to the entire fleet of Energy Servers sold in the event a systemic failure that affects more than a specified number of Energy Servers.\nIn some Portfolio Financings, we have also agreed to pay liquidated damages to the applicable Portfolio Company in the event of delays in the manufacture and installation of our Energy Servers, either in the form of a cash payment or a reduction in the purchase price for the applicable Energy Servers.\nAdministration of Portfolio Companies\nIn each of our Portfolio Financings in which we hold an equity interest in the PPA Entity, we perform certain administrative services as managing member, including invoicing the end customers for amounts owed under the PPAs, administering the cash receipts of the Portfolio Company in accordance with the requirements of the financing arrangements, interfacing with applicable regulatory agencies, and other similar obligations. We are compensated for these services on a fixed dollar-per-kilowatt basis.\nFor those Portfolio Financings with project debt, the Portfolio Company owned by each of our PPA Entities (with the exception of one PPA Entity) incurred debt in order to finance the acquisition of the Energy Servers. The lenders for these transactions are a combination of banks and/or institutional investors. In each case, the debt is secured by all of the assets of the applicable Portfolio Company, such assets being primarily comprised of the Energy Servers and a collateral assignment of each of the contracts to which the Portfolio Company is a party, including the O&M Agreement and the PPAs. As further collateral, the lenders receive a security interest in 100% of the membership interest of the Portfolio Company. The lenders have no\n\nrecourse to us or to any of the other equity investors (the \"Equity Investors\") in the Portfolio Company for liabilities arising out of the portfolio.\nWe have determined that we are the primary beneficiary in the PPA Entities, subject to reassessments performed as a result of upgrade transactions. Accordingly, we consolidate 100% of the assets, liabilities and operating results of these PPA Entities, including the Energy Servers and lease income, in our consolidated financial statements. We recognize the Equity Investors' share of the net assets of the investment entities as noncontrolling interests in subsidiaries in our consolidated balance sheet. We recognize the amounts that are contractually payable to these investors in each period as distributions to noncontrolling interests in our consolidated statements of redeemable convertible preferred stock, redeemable noncontrolling interest, stockholders' (deficit) equity and noncontrolling interest.\nOur consolidated statements of cash flows reflect cash received from the Equity Investors as proceeds from investments by noncontrolling interests in subsidiaries. Our consolidated statements of cash flows also reflect cash paid to these investors as distributions paid to noncontrolling interests in subsidiaries. We reflect any unpaid distributions to these Equity Investors as distributions payable to noncontrolling interests in subsidiaries on our consolidated balance sheets. However, the PPA Entities are separate and distinct legal entities, and Bloom Energy Corporation may not receive cash or other distributions from the PPA Entities except in certain limited circumstances and upon the satisfaction of certain conditions, such as compliance with applicable debt service coverage ratios and the achievement of a targeted internal rates of return to the Equity Investors, or otherwise.\nFor further information about our Portfolio Financings, see Note 11 - Portfolio Financings in Part II, Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\nDelivery and Installation\nThe transfer of control of our product to our customer based on the delivery and installations of our products has a significant impact on the timing of the recognition of product and installation revenue. Many factors can cause a lag between the time that a customer signs a contract and our recognition of product revenue. These factors include the number of Energy Servers installed per site, local permitting and utility requirements, environmental, health and safety requirements, weather, customer facility construction schedules, customers' operational considerations and the timing of financing. Many of these factors are unpredictable and their resolution is often outside of our or our customers' control. Customers may also ask us to delay an installation for reasons unrelated to the foregoing, such as, for sales contracts, delays in their obtaining financing. Further, due to unexpected delays, deployments may require unanticipated expenses to expedite delivery of materials or labor to ensure the installation meets the timing objectives. These unexpected delays and expenses can be exacerbated in periods in which we deliver and install a larger number of smaller projects. In addition, if even relatively short delays occur, there may be a significant shortfall between the revenue we expect to generate in a particular period and the revenue that we are able to recognize.\nInternational Channel Partners\nIndia. In India, sales activities are currently conducted by Bloom Energy (India) Pvt. Ltd., our wholly-owned subsidiary; however, we continue to evaluate the Indian market to determine whether the use of channel partners would be a beneficial go-to-market strategy to grow our India market sales.\nJapan. In Japan, sales were previously conducted pursuant to a Japanese joint venture established between us and subsidiaries of SoftBank Corp., called Bloom Energy Japan Limited (\"Bloom Energy Japan\"). Under this arrangement, we sold Energy Servers to Bloom Energy Japan and we recognized revenue once the Energy Servers left the port in the United States. Bloom Energy Japan then entered into the contract with the end customer and performed all installation work as well as some of the operations and maintenance work. As of July 1, 2021, we acquired Softbank Corp.'s interest in Bloom Energy Japan for a cash payment and are now the sole owner of Bloom Energy Japan.\nThe Republic of Korea. In 2018, Bloom Energy Japan consummated a sale of Energy Servers in the Republic of Korea to Korea South-East Power Company. Following this sale, we entered into a Preferred Distributor Agreement in November 2018 with SK ecoplant for the marketing and sale of Bloom Energy Servers for the stationary utility and commercial and industrial South Korean power market.\nAs part of our expanded strategic partnership with SK ecoplant, the parties executed the PDA Restatement in October 2021, which incorporates previously amended terms and establishes: (i) SK ecoplant's purchase commitments for the next three years (on a take or pay basis) for Bloom Energy Servers; (ii) rollover procedures; (iii) premium pricing for product and\n\nservices; (iv) termination procedures for material breaches; and (v) procedures if there are material changes to the Republic of Korea Hydrogen Portfolio Standard. For additional details about the transaction with SK ecoplant, please see Note 18 - SK ecoplant Strategic Investment.\nUnder the terms of the PDA Restatement, we (or our subsidiary) contract directly with the customer to provide operations and maintenance services for the Energy Servers. We have established a subsidiary in the Republic of Korea, Bloom Energy Korea, LLC, to which we subcontract such operations and maintenance services. The terms of the operations and maintenance are negotiated on a case-by-case basis with each customer, but are generally expected to provide the customer with the option to receive services for at least 10 years, and for up to the life of the Energy Servers.\nSK ecoplant Joint Venture Agreement. In September 2019, we entered into a joint venture agreement with SK ecoplant to establish a light-assembly facility in the Republic of Korea for sales of certain portions of our Energy Server for the stationary utility and commercial and industrial market in the Republic of Korea. The joint venture is majority controlled and managed by us, with the facility, which became operational in July 2020. Other than a nominal initial capital contribution by Bloom Energy, the joint venture will be funded by SK ecoplant. SK ecoplant, who currently acts as a distributor for our Energy Servers for the stationary utility and commercial and industrial market in the Republic of Korea, is our primary customer for the products assembled by the joint venture. In October 2021, as part of our expanded strategic partnership with SK ecoplant, the parties agreed to amend the JVA, which increases the scope of the assembly work done in the joint venture facility.\nCommunity Distributed Generation Programs\nIn July 2015, the state of New York introduced its Community Distributed Generation (\"CDG\") program, which extends New York's net metering program in order to allow utility customers to receive net metering credits for electricity generated by distributed generation assets located on the utility's grid but not physically connected to the customer's facility. This program allows for the use of multiple generation technologies, including fuel cells. Since then other states have instituted similar programs and we expect that other states may do so as well in the future. In June 2020, the New York Public Service Commission issued an Order that limited the CDG compensation structure for high capacity factor resources,\u201d including fuel cells, in a way that will make the economics for these types of projects more challenging in the future. However, projects already under contract were grandfathered into the program under the previous compensation structure.\nWe have entered into sales, installation, operations and maintenance agreements with three developers for the deployment of our Energy Servers pursuant to the New York CDG program for a total of 441 systems. As of December 31, 2021, we have recognized revenue associated with 271 systems. We continue to believe that these types of subscriber-based programs could be a source of future revenue and will continue to look to generate sales through these programs in the future.\nComparison of the Years Ended December 31, 2021 and 2020\nA discussion regarding our results of operations for 2021 compared to 2020 is presented in this section. A discussion of 2020 to 2019 can be found under Item 7 of Part II of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2020, which is available free of charge on the SEC's website at www.sec.gov and the Investor section of our website at www.bloomenergy.com.\nKey Operating Metrics\nIn addition to the measures presented in the consolidated financial statements, we use certain key operating metrics below to evaluate business activity, to measure performance, to develop financial forecasts and to make strategic decisions:\n\u2022Product accepted - the number of customer acceptances of our Energy Servers in any period. We recognize revenue when an acceptance is achieved. We use this metric to measure the volume of deployment activity. We measure each Energy Server manufactured, shipped and accepted in terms of 100 kilowatt equivalents.\n\u2022Product costs of product accepted in the period (per kilowatt) - the average unit product cost for the Energy Servers that are accepted in a period. We use this metric to provide insight into the trajectory of product costs and, in particular, the effectiveness of cost reduction activities.\n\u2022Period costs of manufacturing expenses not included in product costs - the manufacturing and related operating costs that are incurred to procure parts and manufacture Energy Servers that are not included as part of product costs. We use this metric to measure any costs incurred to run our manufacturing operations that are not capitalized (i.e.,\n\nabsorbed, such as stock-based compensation) into inventory and therefore, expensed to our consolidated statement of operations in the period that they are incurred.\n\u2022Installation costs on product accepted (per kilowatt) - the average unit installation cost for Energy Servers that are accepted in a given period. This metric is used to provide insight into the trajectory of install costs and, in particular, to evaluate whether our installation costs are in line with our installation billings.\nWe no longer consider billings related to our products to be a key operating metric. Billings as a metric was introduced to provide insight into our customer contract billings as differentiated from revenue when a significant portion of those customer contracts had product and installation billings recognized as electricity revenue over the term of the contract instead of at the time of delivery or acceptance. Today, a very small portion of our customer contracts has revenue recognized over the term of the contract, and thus it is no longer a meaningful metric for us.\nAcceptances\nWe use acceptances as a key operating metric to measure the volume of our completed Energy Server installation activity from period to period. Acceptance typically occurs upon transfer of control to our customers, which depending on the contract terms is when the system is shipped and delivered to our customer, when the system is shipped and delivered and is physically ready for startup and commissioning, or when the system is shipped and delivered and is turned on and producing power.\nThe product acceptances in the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 were as follows:\n\nProduct accepted for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to the same period in 2020 increased by 553 systems, or 41.7%, as demand increased for our Energy Servers in the Republic of Korea and the utility sector where we accepted 196 systems as part of the CDG program.\nOur customers have several purchase options for our Energy Servers. The portion of acceptances attributable to each purchase option in the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 was as follows:\n\n\nThe portion of total revenue attributable to each purchase option in the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 was as follows:\n\nCosts Related to Our Products\nTotal product related costs for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 was as follows:\n\nProduct costs of product accepted for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to the same period in 2020 decreased by approximately $49 per kilowatt driven generally by our ongoing cost reduction efforts to reduce material costs in conjunction with our suppliers and our reduction in labor and overhead costs through increased volume, improved processes and automation at our manufacturing facilities. This decrease was partially offset by increases in freight and other supply chain-related pricing pressures.\nPeriod costs of manufacturing related expenses for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to the same period in 2020 increased by approximately $3.2 million primarily driven by increases in freight charges and other supply chain-related pricing pressures.\nInstallation costs on product accepted for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to the same period in 2020 decreased by approximately $339 per kilowatt. For the year ended December 31, 2021, the decrease in install cost was driven by site mix as many of the acceptances did not have installation, either because the installation was done by our distribution channel partner in the Republic of Korea or the final installation associated with a specific customer was scheduled to be completed at a later date although the Energy Servers were delivered and accepted during the period.\n\nResults of Operations\nA discussion regarding the comparison of our financial condition and results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 is presented below.\nRevenue\n\nTotal Revenue\nTotal revenue increased by $177.9 million, or 22.4%, for the year ended December 31, 2021 as compared to the prior year period. This increase was primarily driven by a $144.9 million increase in product revenue and a $34.6 million increase in service revenue partially offset by price reductions to expand our addressable market and $14.2 million of previously deferred revenue related to a specific contract that changed scope and was recognized in the year ended December 31, 2020.\nProduct Revenue\nProduct revenue increased by $144.9 million, or 27.9%, for the year ended December 31, 2021 as compared to the prior year period. The product revenue increase was driven primarily by a 41.7% increase in product acceptances as a result of expansion in existing markets and in our CDG program partially offset by price reductions to expand our addressable market and a $14.2 million of previously deferred revenue related to a specific contract that changed scope and was recognized in the year ended December 31, 2020.\nInstallation Revenue\nInstallation revenue decreased by $5.8 million, or (5.7)%, for the year ended December 31, 2021 as compared to the prior year period. This decrease in installation revenue was driven by site mix as many of the acceptances did not have installation, either because the installation was done by our distribution channel partner in the Republic of Korea or the final installation associated with a specific customer was scheduled to be completed at a later date although the Energy Servers were delivered and accepted during the period. We expect our installation revenue to continue to decline as percentage of total revenue as we ramp up shipments to SK ecoplant under PDA Restatement.\nService Revenue\nService revenue increased by $34.6 million, or 31.5%, for the year ended December 31, 2021 as compared to the prior year period. This increase was primarily due to the continued growth of our installation base driven by both an increase in new acceptances and renewal of existing service contracts. We expect our service revenue growth at a similar rate as we continue to expand our install base.\nElectricity Revenue\nElectricity revenue increased by $4.3 million, or 6.8%, for the year ended December 31, 2021 as compared to the prior year period due to the increase in Managed Services Financings.\n\nCost of Revenue\n\nTotal Cost of Revenue\nTotal cost of revenue increased by $146.1 million, or 23.3%, for the year ended December 31, 2021 as compared to the prior year period primarily driven by a $138.9 million increase in cost of product revenue, $16.0 million increase in cost of service revenue, increased freight charges and other supply chain-related pricing pressures. This increase was partially offset by a $6.3 million decrease in cost of installation revenue and our ongoing cost reduction efforts to reduce material costs in conjunction with our suppliers and our reduction in labor and overhead costs through increased volume, improved processes and automation at our manufacturing facilities.\nCost of Product Revenue\nCost of product revenue increased by $138.9 million, or 41.8%, for the year ended December 31, 2021 as compared to the prior year period. The cost of product revenue increase was driven primarily by a 41.7% increase in product acceptances, increased freight charges and other supply chain-related pricing pressures. This increase was partially offset by our ongoing cost reduction efforts to reduce material costs in conjunction with our suppliers and our reduction in labor and overhead costs through increased volume, improved processes and automation at our manufacturing facilities.\nCost of Installation Revenue\nCost of installation revenue decreased by $6.3 million, or (5.4)%, for the year ended December 31, 2021 as compared to the prior year period. This decrease, similar to the $5.8 million decrease in installation revenue, was driven by site mix as many of the acceptances did not have installation in the year ended December 31, 2021.\nCost of Service Revenue\nCost of service revenue increased by $16.0 million, or 12.1%, for the year ended December 31, 2021 as compared to the prior year period. This increase was primarily due to the 41.7% increase in acceptances plus the maintenance contract renewals associated with the increase in our fleet of Energy Servers, partially offset by the significant improvements in power module life, cost reductions and our actions to proactively manage fleet optimizations.\nCost of Electricity Revenue\nCost of electricity revenue decreased by $2.4 million, or (5.2)%, for the year ended December 31, 2021 as compared to the prior year period, primarily due to the $1.2 million change in the fair value of the natural gas fixed price forward contract and lower property tax expenses partially offset by the increase in Managed Services Financings.\n\nGross Profit and Gross Margin\n\nTotal Gross Profit\nGross profit increased by $31.8 million in the year ended December 31, 2021 as compared to the prior year period primarily driven by the 41.7% increase in acceptances and our ongoing cost reduction efforts to reduce material costs in conjunction with our suppliers and our reduction in labor and overhead costs through increased volume, improved processes and automation at our manufacturing facilities. This increase was partially offset by price reductions to expand our addressable market and $14.2 million of previously deferred revenue related to a specific contract that changed scope and was recognized in the year ended December 31, 2020 without a corresponding increase in costs, increased freight charges and other supply chain-related pricing pressures.\nProduct Gross Profit\nProduct gross profit increased by $5.9 million in the year ended December 31, 2021 as compared to the prior year period. The improvement is driven by a 41.7% increase in product acceptances and our ongoing cost reduction efforts to reduce material costs in conjunction with our suppliers and our reduction in labor and overhead costs through increased volume, improved processes and automation at our manufacturing facilities. This increase was partially offset by price reductions to expand our addressable market and $14.2 million of previously deferred revenue related to a specific contract that changed scope and was recognized in the year ended December 30, 2020, increased freight charges and other supply chain-related pricing pressures.\nInstallation Gross Loss\nInstallation gross loss decreased by $0.5 million in the year ended December 31, 2021 as compared to the prior year period driven by the site mix, as many of the acceptances did not have installation in the current time period, and other site related factors such as site complexity, size, local ordinance requirements and location of the utility interconnect.\nService Gross Profit (Loss)\nService gross loss improved by $18.6 million in the year ended December 31, 2021 as compared to the prior year period. This was primarily due to the significant improvements in power module life, cost reductions and our actions to proactively manage fleet optimizations.\n\nElectricity Gross Profit\nElectricity gross profit increased by $6.7 million in the year ended December 31, 2021 as compared to the prior year period mainly due to the $1.2 million change in the fair value of the natural gas fixed price forward contract and lower property tax expenses.\nOperating Expenses\n\nTotal Operating Expenses\nTotal operating expenses increased by $65.5 million in the year ended December 31, 2021 as compared to the prior year period. This increase was primarily attributable to our investment in business development and front-end sales both in the United States and internationally, investment in brand and product management, and our continued investment in our R&D capabilities to support our technology roadmap.\nResearch and Development\nResearch and development expenses increased by $19.8 million in the year ended December 31, 2021 as compared to the prior year period as we began shifting our investments from sustaining engineering projects for the current Energy Server platform, to continued development of the next generation platform and to support our technology roadmap, including our hydrogen, electrolyzer, carbon capture, marine and biogas solutions.\nSales and Marketing\nSales and marketing expenses increased by $30.6 million in the year ended December 31, 2021 as compared to the prior year period. This increase was primarily driven by the efforts to expand our U.S. and international sales force, as well as increased investment in brand and product management.\nGeneral and Administrative\nGeneral and administrative expenses increased by $15.1 million in the year ended December 31, 2021 as compared to the prior year period. This increase was primarily driven by increases in outside services and consulting expense, payroll expense and facilities expense to ensure our infrastructure and control environment is ready to scale for growth, partially offset by lower legal expense.\n\nStock-Based Compensation\n\nTotal stock-based compensation for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to the prior year period increased by $2.2 million primarily driven by the efforts to expand our U.S. and international sales force, as well as investment to build our brand and product management teams.\nOther Income and Expense\n\nInterest Income\nInterest income is derived from investment earnings on our cash balances primarily from money market funds.\nInterest income for the year ended December 31, 2021 as compared to the prior year period decreased by $1.2 million primarily due to the decrease in the rates of interest earned on our cash balances.\nInterest Expense\nInterest expense is from our debt held by third parties. Interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2021 as compared to the prior year period decreased by $7.3 million. This decrease was primarily due to lower interest expense as a result of refinancing our notes at a lower interest rate, and the elimination of the amortization of the debt discount associated with notes that have been converted to equity, partially offset by $0.6 million related to an interest rate swap settlement.\nInterest Expense - Related Parties\nInterest expense - related parties is from our debt held by related parties. Interest expense - related parties for the year ended December 31, 2021 as compared to the prior year period decreased by $2.5 million due to the conversion of all of our notes held by related parties during 2020.\n\nOther Expense, net\nOther expense, net, is primarily derived from investments in joint ventures, plus the impact of foreign currency translation. Other expense, net for the year ended December 31, 2021 as compared to the prior year period decreased by $0.2 million due to a $2.0 million gain recorded on fair value remeasurement of our equity investment in the Bloom Energy Japan joint venture in connection with the acquisition thereof plus the prior year's $3.9 million write-off of our investment in the Bloom Energy Japan joint venture.\nLoss on Extinguishment of Debt\nLoss on extinguishment of debt for the year ended December 31, 2021 as compared to the prior year period improved by $12.9 million resulting from our debt restructuring and debt extinguishment in the prior year period. There were no comparable debt restructuring activities in the current year's period.\nGain (Loss) on Revaluation of Embedded Derivatives\nGain (loss) on revaluation of embedded derivatives is derived from the change in fair value of our sales contracts of embedded EPP derivatives valued using historical grid prices and available forecasts of future electricity prices to estimate future electricity prices.\nGain (loss) on revaluation of embedded derivatives for the year ended December 31, 2021 as compared to the prior year period worsened by $1.4 million due to the change in fair value of our embedded EPP derivatives in our sales contracts.\nProvision for Income Taxes\n\nIncome tax provision consists primarily of income taxes in foreign jurisdictions in which we conduct business. We maintain a full valuation allowance for domestic deferred tax assets, including net operating loss and certain tax credit carryforwards.\nIncome tax provision increased for the year ended December 31, 2021 as compared to the prior year period was primarily due to fluctuations in the effective tax rates on income earned by international entities.\nNet Loss Attributable to Noncontrolling Interests and Redeemable Noncontrolling Interests\n\nNet loss attributable to noncontrolling interests is the result of allocating profits and losses to noncontrolling interests under the hypothetical liquidation at book value (\"HLBV\") method. HLBV is a balance sheet-oriented approach for applying the equity method of accounting when there is a complex structure, such as the flip structure of the PPA Entities.\nNet loss attributable to noncontrolling interests and redeemable noncontrolling interests for the year ended December 31, 2021 as compared to the prior year period changed by $7.4 million due to increased losses in our PPA Entities, which are allocated to our noncontrolling interests.\n\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nAs of December 31, 2021, we had cash and cash equivalents of $396.0 million. Our cash and cash equivalents consist of highly liquid investments with maturities of three months or less, including money market funds. We maintain these balances with high credit quality counterparties, continually monitor the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer and diversify our investments in order to minimize our credit risk.\nIn October 2021, we entered into a Securities Purchase Agreement with SK ecoplant Co., Ltd. in connection with a strategic partnership. On December 29, 2021, we consummated the transactions related to the First Closing by issuing and selling to SK ecoplant 10,000,000 shares of RCPS, at a purchase price of $25.50 per share or an aggregate purchase price of $255 million. In November 2021, PPA V entered into a $136 million term loan, which replaces the LIBOR + 2.5% Term Loan due December 2021.\nAs of December 31, 2021, we had $291.8 million of total outstanding recourse debt, $234.9 million of non-recourse debt and $16.8 million of other long-term liabilities. For a complete description of our outstanding debt, please see Note 7 - Outstanding Loans and Security Agreements in Part II, Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\nThe combination of our existing cash and cash equivalents is expected to be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash flow needs for the next 12 months and thereafter for the foreseeable future. If these sources of cash are insufficient to satisfy our near-term or future cash needs, we may require additional capital from equity or debt financings to fund our operations, in particular, our manufacturing capacity, product development and market expansion requirements, to timely respond to competitive market pressures or strategic opportunities, or otherwise. We may, from time to time, engage in a variety of financing transactions for such purposes, including factoring our accounts receivable. We may not be able to secure timely additional financing on favorable terms, or at all. The terms of any additional financings may place limits on our financial and operating flexibility. If we raise additional funds through further issuances of equity or equity-linked securities, our existing stockholders could suffer dilution in their percentage ownership of us, and any new securities we issue could have rights, preferences and privileges senior to those of holders of our common stock.\nOur future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including our rate of revenue growth, the timing and extent of spending on research and development efforts and other business initiatives, the rate of growth in the volume of system builds and the need for additional manufacturing space, the expansion of sales and marketing activities both in domestic and international markets, market acceptance of our products, our ability to secure financing for customer use of our Energy Servers, the timing of installations, and overall economic conditions including the impact of COVID-19 on our ongoing and future operations. In order to support and achieve our future growth plans, we may need or seek advantageously to obtain additional funding through an equity or debt financing. Failure to obtain this financing or financing in future quarters will affect our results of operations, including revenue and cash flows.\nAs of December 31, 2021, the current portion of our total debt is $25.8 million, of which $17.5 million is outstanding non-recourse debt. We expect a certain portion of the non-recourse debt would be refinanced by the applicable PPA Entity prior to maturity.\nA summary of our consolidated sources and uses of cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash was as follows (in thousands):\n\n\nNet cash provided by (used in) our PPA Entities, which are incorporated into the consolidated statements of cash flows, was as follows (in thousands):\n\n1 The PPA Entities' operating and financing cash flows are a subset of our consolidated cash flows and represent the stand-alone cash flows prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Operating activities consist principally of cash used to run the operations of the PPA Entities, the purchase of Energy Servers from us and principal reductions in loan balances. Financing activities consist primarily of changes in debt carried by our PPAs, and payments from and distributions to noncontrolling partnership interests. We believe this presentation of net cash provided by (used in) PPA activities is useful to provide the reader with the impact to consolidated cash flows of the PPA Entities in which we have only a minority interest.\nOperating Activities\nOur operating activities have consisted of net loss adjusted for certain non-cash items plus changes in our operating assets and liabilities or working capital. The increase in cash used in operating activities during the year ended December 31, 2021 as compared to the prior year period was primarily the result of an increase in our net working capital of $18.8 million in the year ended December 31, 2021 due to the timing of revenue transactions and corresponding collections and the increase in inventory levels to support future demand.\nInvesting Activities\nOur investing activities have consisted of capital expenditures that include investment to increase our production capacity. We expect to continue such activities as our business grows. Cash used in investing activities of $46.7 million during the year ended December 31, 2021 was primarily the result of expenditures on tenant improvements for a newly leased engineering building in Fremont, California. We expect to continue to make capital expenditures over the next few quarters to prepare our new manufacturing facility in Fremont, California for production, which includes the purchase of new equipment and other tenant improvements. We intend to fund these capital expenditures from cash on hand as well as cash flow to be generated from operations. We may also evaluate and arrange equipment lease financing to fund these capital expenditures.\nFinancing Activities\nHistorically, our financing activities have consisted of borrowings and repayments of debt including to related parties, proceeds and repayments of financing obligations, distributions paid to noncontrolling interests and redeemable noncontrolling interests, and the proceeds from the issuance of our common stock. Net cash provided by financing activities during the year ended December 31, 2021 was $306.4 million, an increase of $130.3 million compared to the prior year period, primarily due to the issuance of RCPS to SK ecoplant in December 2021, combined with proceeds in 2021 from stock option exercises and the sale of shares under our 2018 Employee Stock Purchase Plan.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe include in our consolidated financial statements all assets and liabilities and results of operations of our PPA Entities that we have entered into and over which we have substantial control. For additional information, see Note 13 - Portfolio Financings in Part II, Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\nWe have not entered into any other transactions that have generated relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships or special purpose entities. Accordingly, as of December 31, 2021 and 2020 we had no off-balance sheet arrangements.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nThe consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles as applied in the United States (\"U.S. GAAP\") The preparation of the consolidated financial statements requires us to make\n\nestimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, costs and expenses and related disclosures. Our discussion and analysis of our financial results under Results of Operations above are based on our audited results of operations, which we have prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. In preparing these consolidated financial statements, we make assumptions, judgments and estimates that can affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and net income. On an ongoing basis, we base our estimates on historical experience, as appropriate, and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Changes in the accounting estimates are representative of estimation uncertainty, and are reasonably likely to occur from period to period. Accordingly, actual results could differ significantly from the estimates made by our management. We evaluate our estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis. To the extent that there are material differences between these estimates and actual results, our future financial statement presentation, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows will be affected. We believe that the following critical accounting policies involve a greater degree of judgment and complexity than our other accounting policies. Accordingly, these are the policies we believe are the most critical to understanding and evaluating the consolidated financial condition and results of operations.\nThe accounting policies that most frequently require us to make assumptions, judgments and estimates, and therefore are critical to understanding our results of operations, include:\nDiscussion of Earliest Year of Changes in Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nWe include discussion of the earliest year of changes in financial condition and results of operations, as deemed appropriate, even when such information has been previously disclosed in our prior EDGAR filings. We consider the total mix of available information, including the impact of any recastable events when determining whether to omit discussion of the earliest year and the most appropriate form of presentation. We determine to limit the discussion to the information that has changed or has been determined to be significant to our operations or financial condition.\nRevenue Recognition\nWe apply Accounting Standards Codification (\"ASC\") Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers. We identify our contracts with Customers, determine our performance obligations and the transaction price, and after allocating the transaction price to the performance obligations, we recognize revenue as we satisfy our performance obligations and transfer control of our products and services to our customers. Most of our contracts with customers contain performance obligations with a combination of our Energy Server product, installation and maintenance services. For these performance obligations, we allocate the total transaction price to each performance obligation based on the relative standalone selling price.\nWe generally recognize product revenue from contracts with customers at the point that control is transferred to the customers. This occurs when we achieve customer acceptance which typically occurs upon transfer of control to our customers, which depending on the contract terms is when the system is shipped and delivered to our customers, when the system is shipped and delivered and is physically ready for start up and commissioning, or when the system is shipped and delivered and is turned on and producing power.\nWe recognize installation revenue when the system has been installed and is running at full power.\nService revenue is recognized ratably over the term of the first or renewed one-year service period. Given our customers' renewal history, we anticipate that most of them will continue to renew their maintenance services agreements each year for the period of their expected use of the Energy Server. The contractual renewal price may be less than the standalone selling price of the maintenance services and consequently the contract renewal option may provide the customer with a material right. We estimate the standalone selling price for customer renewal options that give rise to material rights using the practical alternative by reference to optional maintenance services renewal periods expected to be provided and the corresponding expected consideration for these services. This reflects the fact that our additional performance obligations in any contractual renewal period are consistent with the services provided under the standard first-year warranty. Where we have determined that a customer has a material right as a result of their contract renewal option, we recognize that portion of the transaction price allocated to the material right over the period in which such rights are exercised.\nGiven that we typically sell an Energy Server with a maintenance service agreement and have not provided maintenance services to a customer who does not have use of an Energy Server, standalone selling prices are estimated using a cost-plus approach. Costs relating to Energy Servers include all direct and indirect manufacturing costs, applicable overhead costs and costs for normal production inefficiencies (i.e., variances). We then apply a margin to the Energy Servers which may vary with the size of the customer, geographic region and the scale of the Energy Server deployment. Costs relating to installation include all direct and indirect installation costs. The margin we apply reflects our profit objectives relating to installation. Costs for\n\nmaintenance service arrangements are estimated over the life of the maintenance contracts and include estimated future service costs and future material costs. Material costs over the period of the service arrangement are impacted significantly by the longevity of the fuel cells themselves. After considering the total service costs, we apply a lower margin to our service costs than to our Energy Servers as it best reflects our long-term service margin expectations and comparable historical industry service margins. As a result, our estimate of our selling price is driven primarily by our expected margin on both the Energy Server and the maintenance service agreements based on their respective costs or, in the case of maintenance service agreements, the estimated costs to be incurred.\nThe total transaction price is determined based on the total consideration specified in the contract, including variable consideration in the form of a performance guaranty payment that represents potential amounts payable to customers. The expected value method is generally used when estimating variable consideration, which typically reduces the total transaction price due to the nature of the performance obligations to which the variable consideration relates. These estimates reflect our historical experience and current contractual requirements which cap the maximum amount that may be paid. The expected value method requires judgment and considers multiple factors that may vary over time depending upon the unique facts and circumstances related to each performance obligation. Depending on the facts and circumstances, a change in variable consideration estimate will either be accounted for at the contract level or using the portfolio method.\nFor successful sales-leaseback arrangements, we recognize product and installation revenue upon meeting criteria demonstrating we have transferred control to the customer (the Buyer-Lessor). When control of the Energy Server is transferred to the financier, and we determine the leaseback qualifies as an operating lease in accordance with ASC 842, Leases (\"ASC 842\"), we record a ROU asset and a lease liability, and recognize revenue based on the fair value of the Energy Servers with an allocation to product revenue and installations revenue based on the relative standalone selling prices. We recognize as financing obligations any proceeds received to finance our ongoing costs to operate the Energy Servers.\nValuation of Escalator Protection Plan Agreements (\"EPP\")\nWe have entered into agreements with certain customers which require us to recognize a liability in compliance with the financial accounting and reporting requirements of ASC Topic 820, Fair Value Measurement (\"ASC 820\"). We use third party valuation experts to provide us with the initial Level 3 fair value measurement that estimates the fair value of the subject liabilities using inputs of forecasted avoided costs and the cost of electricity. We determine our final estimate of liability based on internal reviews and in consideration of the estimates received. Although measured each reporting period, our estimates may vary from the actual payments made under the contractual agreements, as the estimates include current known liability and estimates of potential future payments. We use valuation methodology including using a Monte Carlo simulation model, with estimated inputs of beginning value, growth rate and volatility, and further discount our estimate of liability based on our cost of debt commensurate with the payment period.\nValuation of Certain Financial Instruments and Customer Financing Receivables\nWe have entered into certain Customer Financing Receivables with our PPA 3a arrangement, and debt financings that include Redeemable Senior Secured Notes, Convertible Senior Notes, Senior Secured Notes, Term Loans and Fixed Rate Notes. We are required to determine the fair value of the assets or liabilities for financial reporting purposes under ASC 820, and as applicable, under the guidance of ASC Topic 840, Leases, and ASC Topic 815, Derivatives and Hedging (\"ASC 815\"). We use third party valuation experts to provide us with the initial Level 3 fair value measurement that estimates the fair value of the subject assets or liabilities using inputs of principal to be received or paid, maturity dates, coupon rates, selected discount rate based on implied rating and comparable yield curves in Energy and Non-Financial markets. We determine our final estimate of fair value based on internal reviews and in consideration of the estimates received. The objective of the fair value measurement of our estimate is to represent the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date.\nValuation of Assets and Liabilities of the SK ecoplant Strategic Investment\nWe have entered into an agreement with SK ecoplant that provides the opportunity, but does not require, an additional investment in common stock Class A, subject to a cap on the total potential share purchase, and as a component of transaction, includes a purchase commitment by the investor for future product purchases.\nWe are required to determine the fair value of the assets or liabilities for financial reporting purposes under ASC 820, and as applicable, under the guidance of ASC 815 and ASC Topic 480 Distinguishing Liabilities from Equity. We use third party valuation experts that are recognized as financial instrument accounting specialists to provide us with the initial Level 3 fair value measurement that estimates the fair value of the subject assets or liabilities using inputs of number of shares,\n\nunderlying prices of Bloom Energy stock, rights and obligations of the counterparties, valuation assumptions related to options, and the assessed value of our product revenue streams and the timing of expected revenue recognition. We determine our final estimate of fair value based on internal reviews and in consideration of the estimates received. The objective of the fair value measurement of our estimate is to represent the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. We determine the reasonableness of our valuation methodology, assumptions on the timing and probability of a redemption event, and the expected number of shares to be exercised with the Option, and review the mathematical accuracy of the calculations before recording in our consolidated statement of operations and consolidated balance sheets. See Note 18 - SK ecoplant Strategic Investment.\nIncremental Borrowing Rate (\"IBR\") by Lease Class\nWe adopted ASC 842 on January 1, 2020 on a modified retrospective basis. This guidance requires that, for all our leases, we recognize ROU assets representing our right to use the underlying asset for the lease term, and lease liabilities related to the rights and obligations created by those leases, on the balance sheet regardless of whether they are classified as finance or operating leases, with classification affecting the pattern and presentation of expenses and cash flows on the consolidated financial statements. Lease liabilities are measured at the lease commencement date as the present value of future minimum lease payments over the reasonably certain lease term. Lease ROU assets are measured as the lease liability plus initial direct costs and prepaid lease payments less lease incentives. In measuring the present value of the future minimum lease payments, we used our collateralized incremental borrowing rate as our leases do not generally provide an implicit rate. The determination of the incremental borrowing rate considers qualitative and quantitative factors as well as the estimated impact that the collateral has on the rate. We determine our incremental borrowing rate based on the lease class of assets which relates to those supporting of manufacturing and general operations, and those supporting electricity revenue transactions.\nFor successful sale-leasebacks, as Seller-Lessee, we determine the collateralized IBR on our leased equipment based on a fair value assessment provided by third-party valuation experts.\nStock-Based Compensation\nWe account for stock options and other equity awards, such as restricted stock units and performance-based stock units, to employees and non-employee directors under the provisions of ASC 718, Compensation-Stock Compensation. Accordingly, the stock-based compensation expense for these awards is measured based on the fair value on the date of grant. For stock options, we recognize the expense, net of estimated forfeitures, under the straight-line attribution over the requisite service period which is generally the vesting term. The fair value of the stock options is estimated using the Black-Scholes valuation model. For options with a vesting condition tied to the attainment of service and market conditions, stock-based compensation costs are recognized using Monte Carlo simulations. In addition, we use the Black-Scholes valuation model to estimate the fair value of stock purchase rights under the Bloom Energy Corporation 2018 Employee Stock Purchase Plan (the \"2018 ESPP\"). The fair value of the 2018 ESPP purchase rights is recognized as expense under the multiple options approach.\nThe Black-Scholes valuation model uses as inputs the fair value of our common stock and assumptions we make for the volatility of our common stock, the expected term of the award, the risk-free interest rate for a period that approximates the expected term of the stock options and the expected dividend yield. In developing estimates used to calculate assumptions, we established the expected term for employee options as well as expected forfeiture rates based on the historical settlement experience and after giving consideration to vesting schedules.\nIncome Taxes\nWe account for income taxes using the liability method under ASC 740, Income Taxes. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on net operating loss carryforwards, research and development credit carryforwards and temporary differences resulting from the different treatment of items for tax and financial reporting purposes. Deferred items are measured using the enacted tax rates and laws that are expected to be in effect when the differences reverse. We must assess the likelihood that deferred tax assets will be recovered as deductions from future taxable income. This determination is based on expected future results and the future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences. Furthermore, uncertain tax positions are evaluated by management and amounts are recorded when it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination, including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes, based on the technical merits. Significant judgement is required throughout management's process in evaluating each uncertain tax position including future taxable income expectations and tax-planning strategies to determine whether the more likely than not recognition threshold has been met. We have provided a full valuation allowance on our domestic deferred tax assets because we believe it is more likely than not that our deferred tax assets will not be realized.\n\nPrinciples of Consolidation\nOur consolidated financial statements include the operations of our subsidiaries in which we have a controlling financial interest. We use a qualitative approach in assessing the consolidation requirements for each of our PPA Entities that are variable interest entities (\"VIEs\"). This approach focuses on determining whether we have the power to direct those activities that significantly affect their economic performance and whether we have the obligation to absorb losses, or the right to receive benefits that could potentially be significant to the PPA Entities. The considerations for VIE consolidation is a complex analysis that requires us to determine whether we are the primary beneficiary and therefore have the power to direct activities which are most significant to those PPA Entities.\nAllocation of Profits and Losses of Consolidated Entities to Noncontrolling Interests and Redeemable Noncontrolling Interests\nWe generally allocate profits and losses to noncontrolling interests under the HLBV method. The HLBV method is a balance sheet-oriented approach for applying the equity method of accounting when there is a complex structure, such as the flip structure of the PPA Entities.\nThe determination of equity in earnings under the HLBV method requires management to determine how proceeds, upon a hypothetical liquidation of the entity at book value, would be allocated between our investors. The noncontrolling interest balance is presented as a component of permanent equity in the consolidated balance sheets.\nNoncontrolling interests with redemption features, such as put options, that are not solely within our control are considered redeemable noncontrolling interests. Exercisability of put options are solely dependent upon the passage of time, and hence, such put options are considered to be probable of becoming exercisable. We elected to accrete changes in the redemption value over the period from the date it becomes probable that the instrument will become redeemable to the earliest redemption date of the instrument by using an interest method. The balance of redeemable noncontrolling interests on the balance sheets is reported at the greater of its carrying value or its maximum redemption value at each reporting date. The redeemable noncontrolling interests are classified as temporary equity and therefore are reported in the mezzanine section of the consolidated balance sheets as redeemable noncontrolling interests.\n", "item_7_tables": "Table 50: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Table of Contents\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Index to Financial Statements\n</td> </tr>\n</table>Table

and 32% increase in service revenue. Acceptances grew 42% due to expansion in Korea and the utility sector.\n\n- Gross margin declined slightly to 20% in 2021 from 21% in 2020. Product gross margin declined due to price reductions and supply chain cost pressures, partially offset by cost reduction efforts. Service gross margin improved significantly due to power module life improvements.  \n\n- Operating expenses increased 27% to $312 million, reflecting investments in R&D, sales, marketing, and infrastructure. Net loss widened to $253 million.\n\n- Cash used in operations was $61 million in 2021 versus $99 million in 2020, reflecting increased working capital needs. Cash from financing was $306 million, including proceeds from the SK ecoplant investment. \n\n- Liquidity remains sufficient to meet needs over the next 12 months. Additional financing may be required to support growth plans and manufacturing expansion.\n\n- Critical accounting policies and estimates include revenue recognition, valuation of embedded derivatives, incremental borrowing rates, and consolidation principles for VIEs. Judgments are required in these areas.\n\nIn summary, Bloom Energy showed strong revenue growth in 2021 but higher costs led to a wider net loss. Liquidity appears sufficient in the near term but additional financing may be needed to support growth. Critical estimates could impact the financial statements."}
