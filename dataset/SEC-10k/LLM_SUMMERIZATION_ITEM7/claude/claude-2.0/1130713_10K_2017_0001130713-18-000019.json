MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe following discussion and analysis contains forward-looking statement relating to future events or our future financial or operating performance that involve risks and uncertainties, as set forth above under \"Special Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements.\" Our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of certain factors described in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including those set forth above under \"Special Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\" or in Item 1A under the heading \"Risk Factors\" or elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. In addition, our future results may be significantly different from our historical results. The following discussion and analysis also should be read in conjunction with the disclosures in Item 1. Business\u201d under Our Retail Business,\u201d Medici,\u201d and Potential Strategic Initiatives,\u201d as well as the risk factors described in Item 1A. Risk Factors.\u201d\nIntroduction\nWe are an online retailer and advancer of blockchain technology. Through our online retail business, we offer a broad range of price-competitive products, including furniture, home decor, bedding and bath, housewares, jewelry and watches,\namong other products. We sell our products and services through our Internet websites located at www.overstock.com, www.o.co and www.o.biz (referred to collectively as the \"Website\"). Although our three websites are located at different domain addresses, the technology and equipment and processes supporting the Website and the process of order fulfillment described herein are the same for all three websites.\nIn late 2014, we began working on initiatives to develop and advance blockchain technology, which we refer to collectively as Medici. As part of our Medici initiatives, we have formed a wholly-owned subsidiary Medici Ventures, Inc. (\"Medici Ventures\") and acquired a majority interest in a financial technology company and two related registered broker dealers which are owned by our majority-owned subsidiary t\u00d8.com, Inc. (\"tZERO\"). Medici Ventures has also purchased interests in several blockchain technology companies. In 2015, we were the first public company to issue a private security using blockchain technology and in December 2016, as a demonstration of our technology, we issued publicly traded blockchain preferred shares of Overstock.com, Inc.\nWe have engaged Guggenheim Securities, LLC to help us identify and evaluate certain strategic initiatives. We are considering a range of potential transactions, including a sale of our e-commerce business and additional equity or debt financings. Our Board continually discusses a variety of potential strategic and financial options and other changes to our business, but has not made any determination to undertake any strategic transaction, and may not do so in the foreseeable future or at all. See Item 1 of Part I, \"Business-Potential Strategic Initiatives,\" and Item 1A, \"Risk Factors-Risks Relating to Our Current Review of Strategic Initiatives.\"\nOur company, based near Salt Lake City, Utah, was founded in 1997. We launched our initial website in March 1999 and were re-incorporated in Delaware in 2002. As used herein, \"Overstock,\" \"Overstock.com,\", \"O.co,\" \"we,\" \"our\" and similar terms include Overstock.com, Inc. and our majority-owned subsidiaries, unless the context indicates otherwise.\nOur Retail Business\nOur retail business constitutes the vast majority of our business and, through December 31, 2017, generated nearly all of our net revenues. In our retail business, our goal is to provide goods to furnish and accessorize \"dream homes\" for our target customers-consumers who seek quality, stylish merchandise at bargain prices. At December 31, 2017, we offered 2.8 million products (6.0 million SKUs), of which over 99% were in-line products (products in active production). At December 31, 2017, we were offering three private label brands - Porch & Den, Carson Carrington and OSleep - and had more than 1,000 private label products available on our Website and intend to add additional private label brands, including home products brands, using our strength in home products to help build our private label brands. We regularly change our product assortment to meet the evolving preferences of our customers and current trends. Our products include, among others, furniture, home d\u00e9cor including rugs, bedding and bath, home improvement and kitchen items, and, to a lesser extent, jewelry and watches. We compete primarily based on:\nTable 209: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Quality customer experience with an emphasis on price, value, and a wide assortment of products delivered in a personalized format with the convenience of our mobile app, and with the benefits of our award-winning customer care;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 210: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Proprietary technologies which we believe help us provide our customers with a quality shopping experience;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 211: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Logistics capabilities tailored to the furniture and home goods category and developed over our many years of e-commerce experience;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 212: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Long-term mutually beneficial relationships with our partners, which currently number approximately 4,100; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 213: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Our Club O Loyalty Program, which we believe increases customer engagement and retention.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe have organized our retail business (sales of product offered through the Shopping Section of our Website) into two principal segments - a \"direct\" business and a \"partner\" business. For 2017, approximately 95% of our net sales were from transactions in which we fulfilled orders from manufacturers, distributors and other suppliers (\"partners\") selling on our website, who we generally direct to ship goods sold from their own warehouses, while we generally handle returns and customer service (our \"partner\" business). The remaining 5% of our net sales came from direct sales of our own inventory shipped from our warehouse, including some customer returns of partner products (our \"direct\" business). We provide our partners with access to a large customer base and convenient services for order fulfillment, customer service, returns handling, and other services. Our team of customer service representatives assists customers by telephone, instant online chat and e-mail. We also derive revenue from other businesses advertising products or services on our Website. Our sales are primarily to customers located in the United States. During the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015 no single customer accounted for more than 1% of our total net revenue.\nRetail direct business\nOur retail direct business includes sales made to individual consumers and businesses from our owned inventory which are fulfilled primarily from our warehouse in Salt Lake City, Utah. Our warehouses primarily fulfill orders from our retail direct business. Our warehouses generally ship between 2,000 and 5,000 packages per day and up to approximately 6,000 packages per day during peak periods.\nRetail partner business\nIn our retail partner business, we sell merchandise from our partners primarily through our Website. We are the primary obligor for the majority of these sales transactions and we record revenue from the majority of these sales transactions on a gross basis. We generally have the ability to set pricing and source merchandise from our partners based on our discretion. Our use of the term \"partner\" does not mean that we have formed any legal partnerships with any of our partners. We currently have relationships with approximately 4,100 third parties who supply the vast majority of products on our Website. These partners generally perform the same fulfillment operations as our warehouses, such as order picking and shipping. We retain the right to re-direct and control the products during shipment and we handle returns and customer service related to substantially all orders placed through our Website. Revenue generated from sales on our Shopping site from both the direct and partner businesses is recorded net of returns, coupons and other discounts.\nBoth direct and partner revenues are seasonal, with revenues historically being the highest in the fourth quarter, which ends December 31, reflecting higher consumer holiday spending. We anticipate this will continue for the foreseeable future. To the extent possible we maintain supplier relationships, and seek new supplier relationships, for both our direct and partner businesses, and also use our working capital, to ensure a continuous allotment of product offerings for our customers. Because some (less than 1%) of our product offerings are closeout merchandise, some of our suppliers cannot supply products to us on a continuous basis.\nGenerally, we require authorization from credit card or other payment vendors whose services we offer to our customers (such as PayPal) or verification of receipt of payment, before we ship products to consumers or business purchasers. From time to time we grant credit to our business purchasers with normal credit terms (typically 30 days). For sales in our partner business, we generally receive payments from our customers before our payments to our suppliers are due.\nGrowth Strategies for Our E-Commerce Business\nWe believe that some of our direct competitors spend significantly higher percentages of their revenue on marketing than we do, and that we need to increase our branding and marketing expenditures in order to increase our market share in the e-commerce home goods market and educate consumers about our current position as an online retailer offering a wide assortment of quality home goods and other products at low prices and with a high level of customer service. We have developed and implemented marketing and branding initiatives to address this, and believe that additional marketing and branding efforts will have significant long-term positive results. However, a significant increase in our branding and marketing expenditures or other expenses would be likely to adversely affect our short-term results.\nWe also want to invest in additional distribution facilities to speed shipping and improve our customer service; in additional automation, technology and engineering resources because we believe they can improve our customers' shopping experience and increase our sales; in our Club O rewards program, primarily to increase member benefits and to develop additional personalization programs; and in expansion of our private label initiative because we believe that private label brands can generate significant brand equity and customer loyalty. However, our ability to pursue some or all of these plans, and the extent to which we would be able to pursue some or all of them, will depend on the resources we have available, and may require significantly more capital than we currently have. See \"Liquidity and Capital Resources.\"\nMedici Business Initiatives\nOur Medici business initiatives seek to leverage the security, transparency and immutability of cryptographically protected, distributed ledgers, such as blockchains, and are focused on solving important problems, including financial transaction issues, particularly in the area of securities settlement. Our wholly-owned subsidiary, Medici Ventures, conducts its primary business through its majority-owned subsidiary tZERO, which includes a financial technology company and two related registered broker dealers. Medici Ventures also holds interests in several technology companies whose focuses include commercial blockchain applications, digital currency solutions, compliance, identity, voting, and land.\nAs described further in Item 15 of Part IV, \"Financial Statements\"-Note 21. Business Segments, contained in the \"Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\" of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we determined our segments based on how\nwe manage our business, which, in our view, consists primarily of our Retail and Medici businesses. As described above, our Retail business consists of our Direct and Partner reportable segments. We use gross profit as the measure to determine our reportable segments because there is not discrete financial information available below gross profit for our Direct and Partner segments. As a result, our Medici business is not significant as compared to our Direct and Partner segments and is included in Other. Our Other segment consists of Medici.\nOther Offerings\nWe offer additional products or services that may complement our primary offerings, but are not significant to our revenues. These include:\nTable 214: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Worldstock Fair Trade, a store within our Website that offers handcrafted products made by artisans all over the world to help improve the lives of people in emerging economies;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 215: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Supplier Oasis, a single integration point through which our partners can manage their products, inventory and sales channels, and also obtain multi-channel fulfillment services through our distribution network;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 216: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Our international business where we offer products to customers outside the United States using third party logistics providers;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 217: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Cars by Overstock, a portal within our Website where our customers can search millions of new, used and certified pre-owned cars from dealers and private parties - all in one place with convenient financing and warranty options;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 218: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>FinanceHub, a portal within our Website where our customers can shop for loans, credit cards, and insurance, and can now also access links to automated financial advisory services and discounted stock brokerage services; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 219: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Pet Adoptions, a free service and portal within our Website that leverages our technology to display pets available for adoption from shelters across the United States.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (\"GAAP\") requires estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. The Securities and Exchange Commission (\"SEC\") has defined a company's critical accounting policies as the ones that are most important to the portrayal of the company's financial condition and results of operations, and which require the company to make its most difficult and subjective judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates of matters that are inherently uncertain. Based on this definition, we have identified the critical accounting policies, estimates and judgments addressed below. We also have other key accounting policies, which involve the use of estimates, judgments, and assumptions that are significant to understanding our results. For additional information, see Item 15 of Part IV, \"Financial Statements\"-Note 2. Accounting Policies. Although we believe that our estimates, assumptions, and judgments are reasonable, they are based upon information presently available. Actual results may differ significantly from these estimates. Our critical accounting policies are as follows:\nTable 220: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>revenue recognition;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 221: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>accounting for income taxes; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 222: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>accounting for intangible assets other than goodwill in business combination.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nRevenue recognition\nWe derive our revenue primarily from retail merchandise sales on our Website.\nRevenue is recognized when the following revenue recognition criteria are met: (1) persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists; (2) delivery has occurred or the service has been provided; (3) the selling price or fee revenue earned is fixed or determinable; and (4) collection of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured. Revenue related to merchandise sales is recognized upon delivery to our customers. As we ship high volumes of packages through multiple carriers, it is not practical for us to track the actual delivery date of each shipment. Therefore, we use estimates to determine which shipments are delivered and, therefore, recognized as revenue at the end of the period. Our delivery date estimates are based on average shipping transit times, which are calculated using the following factors: (i) the type of shipping carrier (as carriers have different in-transit times); (ii) the fulfillment source (either our warehouses, those warehouses we control, or those of our partners); (iii) the delivery destination; and (iv) actual transit time experience, which shows that delivery date is typically one to eight business days from the date of shipment. We review and update our estimates on a quarterly basis based on our actual transit time experience. However, actual shipping times may differ from our estimates.\nWe evaluate the criteria outlined in ASC Topic 605-45, Principal Agent Considerations, in determining whether it is appropriate to record the gross amount of product sales and related costs or the net amount earned as commissions. When we are the primary obligor in a transaction, are subject to inventory risk, have latitude in establishing prices and selecting suppliers, or have several but not all of these indicators, revenue is recorded gross. If we are not the primary obligor in the transaction and amounts earned are determined using a fixed percentage, revenue is recorded on a net basis. Currently, the majority of both direct revenue and partner revenue is recorded on a gross basis, as we are the primary obligor. We present revenue net of sales taxes. We periodically provide incentive offers to our customers to encourage purchases. Such offers include current discount offers, such as percentage discounts off current purchases and other similar offers, which, when used by customers, are treated as a reduction of revenue.\nThe following table shows the effect that hypothetical changes in the estimate of average shipping transit times would have had on the reported amount of revenue and income before taxes for the year ended December 31, 2017 (in thousands):\nTable 223: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended\nDecember 31, 2017\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Change in the Estimate of Average Transit Times (Days)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Increase (Decrease)\nRevenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Increase (Decrease)\nIncome Before Tax\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(10,986\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(1,164\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(7,540\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(796\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>As reported\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> As reported\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>As reported\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>5,918\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>635\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(2)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>10,874\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,160\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB), which sets accounting standards for U.S. public companies, has issued new standards relating to revenue recognition, which became effective on January 1, 2018, and which will apply to our interim financial statements for the quarter ending March 31, 2018. We are in the process of analyzing the new standards and their application to our processes, accounting, financial reporting presentation, disclosures, and controls. Under previous FASB standards, we recognized revenue from the majority of these sales transactions on a gross basis. We have not reached a definite conclusion, but we believe we will continue to recognize revenue from the majority of our retail business on a gross basis. If our adoption of the new standards requires us to recognize these revenues on a net basis, our future revenue will be substantially less than it was under the previous standards despite having no impact on gross profits. This could have a material adverse effect on the market price of our common stock.\nAccounting for income taxes\nWe are subject to taxation from federal, state and international jurisdictions. A significant amount of judgment is involved in preparing our provision for income taxes and the calculation of resulting deferred tax assets and liabilities.\nWe account for income taxes in accordance with ASC Topic 740, Income Taxes (\"ASC 740\"), which requires the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between tax and financial reporting. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the currently enacted tax rates that apply to taxable income in effect for the years in which those tax assets are expected to be realized or settled. The effect of a change in tax rates on deferred tax assets and liabilities is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date.\nTax laws and regulations themselves are subject to change as a result of changes in fiscal policy, changes in legislation, the evolution of regulations, and court rulings. On December 22, 2017, the President signed into law Public Law No. 115-97, commonly referred to as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (\"TCJA\"), following its passage by the United States Congress. The TCJA will make significant changes to U.S. federal income tax laws, mostly effective for tax years beginning after December 31, 2017. Among many other changes, the new law lowers the corporate tax rate from 35% to 21% for tax years beginning in 2018, transitions U.S international taxation from a worldwide tax system to a territorial system, and includes a one-time transition tax on the mandatory deemed repatriation of cumulative foreign earnings as of December 31, 2017. Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118 (\"SAB 118\") was issued to address the application of US GAAP in situations when a registrant does not have the necessary information available, prepared, or analyzed (including computations) in reasonable detail to complete the accounting for certain income tax effects of the TCJA. As of the date of this filing, we have not completed our accounting for the tax effects of the TCJA. In accordance with SAB 118, we have calculated our best estimate of the impact of the TCJA in our year end income tax provision in accordance with our understanding of the law and guidance available as of the date of this filing and as a result\nhave recorded $25.3 million as additional income tax expense in the fourth quarter of 2017. The amount related to the remeasurement of certain deferred tax assets and liabilities, based on the rates at which they are expected to reverse in the future, was $25.2 million. Although the tax rate reduction is known, our analysis may also be affected by other analyses related to the TCJA, including, but not limited to, our calculation of the mandatory deemed repatriation of cumulative foreign earnings and the state tax effect of adjustments made to federal temporary differences, which are uncertain at this time. The provisional amount related to the one-time transition tax on the mandatory deemed repatriation of cumulative foreign earnings was $41,000. The net charge is subject to revisions as we complete our analysis of the TCJA, collect and prepare necessary data, and interpret any additional guidance issued by the U.S. Treasury Department, Internal Revenue Service (\"IRS\"), FASB, and other standard-setting and regulatory bodies. Any subsequent adjustment to these amounts will be recorded to tax expense in the quarter when the analysis is complete. Our accounting for the tax effects of the TCJA will be completed during the measurement period, which should not extend beyond one year from the enactment date.\nThe TCJA includes a provision to tax global intangible low-taxed income (\"GILTI\") of foreign subsidiaries in excess of a deemed return on tangible assets of foreign corporations beginning in 2018. Under GAAP, we can make an accounting policy election to either treat taxes due on the GILTI inclusion as a current period expense, or factor such amounts into our measurement of deferred taxes. Due to the complexity of the new GILTI tax rules, we are continuing to evaluate this provision of the TCJA and the application of GAAP and we have not yet elected an accounting policy.\nWe assess available positive and negative evidence to estimate whether we will generate sufficient future taxable income to use our existing deferred tax assets. We have no carryback ability and do not expect significant future reversals of taxable temporary differences to recover our existing deferred tax assets, therefore we must rely on future taxable income, including tax planning strategies, to support their realizability. We have concluded based on all available evidence that it is more likely than not that our deferred tax assets as of December 31, 2017 will not be realized in the future. Therefore, it is appropriate to record a valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets, net of deferred tax liabilities related to assets with a definite reversal period. In reaching these conclusions we considered, among other things, three significant pieces of negative evidence that occurred during the quarter ended December 31, 2017. First, a significant piece of objective negative evidence evaluated was the cumulative loss incurred over the three-year period ended December 31, 2017. We expect the trends that contributed to the loss to continue. Such objective evidence limits the ability to consider other subjective evidence, such as projections for future taxable income, if any. Second, during the quarter ended December 31, 2017, forecasts for future years were significantly revised. We are projecting significant pretax operating losses over the next several years and it is uncertain when we will return to profitability. While forecasts of future years are a more subjective piece of evidence, these forecasted losses in the near-term are further negative evidence that we will not have sufficient future taxable income to use our existing deferred tax assets. Third, we have certain tax planning strategies that we intended to implement to accelerate taxable income into earlier periods in order to utilize loss carryforwards and tax credits prior to expiration. While these tax planning strategies previously would have been sufficient to utilize most of our deferred tax assets in periods of low pretax income, these tax planning strategies will not be sufficient to utilize deferred tax assets in periods where we generate significant pretax losses, such as our current year operating results or our newly revised projections for future years. Additionally, one of our tax planning strategies was significantly impacted and reduced in application due to the TCJA, enacted on December 22, 2017. Therefore, we no longer have prudent and feasible tax planning strategies to support the realizability of deferred tax assets. We intend to continue maintaining a valuation allowance on our net deferred tax assets until there is sufficient evidence to support the reversal of all or some portion of these allowances. The amount of the deferred tax asset considered realizable could be adjusted if objective negative evidence in the form of cumulative losses is no longer present and additional weight may be given to subjective evidence such as long-term projections for growth.\nASC 740 clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprise's financial statements in accordance with GAAP. ASC 740 prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. This statement also provides guidance on de-recognition, classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods, and disclosure.\nThe calculation of our tax liabilities is subject to legal and factual interpretation, judgment, and uncertainty in a multitude of jurisdictions. This includes addressing uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations. We recognize liabilities for uncertain tax positions in the U.S. and other tax jurisdictions based on recognition and measurement criteria prescribed by ASC 740. We record an amount as an estimate of probable additional income tax liability at the largest amount that we determine is more likely than not, based upon the technical merits of the position, to be sustained upon audit by the relevant tax authority. The liabilities are periodically reviewed for their adequacy and appropriateness. Changes to our assumptions could cause us to find a revision of estimates appropriate. Such a change in measurement would result in the recognition of a tax benefit or an additional charge to the tax provision.\nWe are currently under audit in Ireland for the 2016 tax year. The IRS concluded an audit of our 2015 federal income tax return in 2017 with no changes to the return. Tax periods within the statutory period of limitations not previously audited are potentially open for examination by the tax authorities. Potential liabilities associated with these years will be resolved when an event occurs to warrant closure, primarily through the completion of audits by the tax jurisdictions and/or the expiration of the statutes of limitation. To the extent audits or other events result in a material adjustment to the accrued estimates, the effect would be recognized during the period of the event. We believe that an appropriate estimated liability has been established for potential exposures.\nOur uncertain tax positions related to state income taxes represent a cash settlement contingency and are recorded as a liability in our consolidated balance sheets. To the extent interest and penalties would be assessed by taxing authorities on any underpayment of income taxes, such amounts are accrued and classified as a component of income tax expense on our consolidated statements of income and comprehensive income. Realization of the unrecognized tax benefits results in a favorable impact to the effective tax rate.\nAccounting for intangible assets other than goodwill in business combination\nIntangible assets other than goodwill acquired as part of a business combination are capitalized at their acquisition-date fair value. We amortize intangible assets other than goodwill over their estimated useful lives unless such lives are indefinite. Intangible assets other than goodwill are amortized using the straight-line method of amortization over their useful lives, with the exception of certain intangibles (such as acquired technology, customer relationships, and trade names) which are amortized using an accelerated method of amortization based on cash flows. These assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying amount may not be recoverable.\nThe following table details the identifiable intangible assets acquired at their fair value and remaining useful lives as of December 31, 2017 (amounts in thousands):\nTable 224: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Intangible Assets\n</td> <td>Fair Value\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Weighted Average Useful Life (years)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Technology and developed software\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>13,600\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.92\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Customer relationships\n</td> <td>1,900\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Trade names\n</td> <td>300\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5.93\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other\n</td> <td>200\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total acquired intangible assets as of the acquisition date\n</td> <td>16,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Less: accumulated amortization of acquired intangible assets\n</td> <td>(9,228\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total acquired intangible assets, net\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>6,772\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nRecently issued accounting standards\nFor information about recent accounting pronouncements, see Item 15 of Part IV, \"Financial Statements\"-Note 2. Accounting Policies.\nPreliminary Estimates for the Quarter ending March 31, 2018\nWe have determined to switch to a growth strategy in our ecommerce business, which we believe will lead to higher revenue growth, but also incur significant losses in the process. In pursuit of this growth strategy, in Q1 2018 we have increased our sales and marketing expenditures substantially to increase revenue growth and to test new marketing initiatives. Largely as a result of this new strategy, we expect to incur a total pre-tax loss of approximately $50 million in Q1 2018 ($35 million ecommerce, $15 million Medici).\nOur estimated results for the quarter ended March 31, 2018 are preliminary and subject to substantial uncertainty and numerous risks including those outlined in Item 1A of Part I, \"Risk Factors\". We caution you that our estimates are forward-looking statements and are not guarantees of future performance or outcomes and that actual results may differ materially.\nComparison of Years Ended December 31, 2017 and 2016\nExecutive Commentary\nThis executive commentary is intended to provide investors with a view of our business through the eyes of our management. As an executive commentary, it necessarily focuses on selected aspects of our business. This executive commentary is intended as a supplement to, but not a substitute for, the more detailed discussion of our business included elsewhere herein. Investors are cautioned to read our entire \"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,\" as well as our interim and audited financial statements, and the discussion of our business and risk factors and other information included elsewhere or incorporated in this report. This executive commentary includes forward-looking statements, and investors are cautioned to read \"Special Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements.\"\nOur $111.9 million consolidated net loss in 2017 was the result primarily of our $46.6 million operating loss in 2017 and our $64.2 million income tax expense in 2017. The operating loss was caused primarily by changes that Google made in its natural search engine algorithms and an increasingly competitive digital marketing landscape. The income tax expense included $25.3 million of expense caused by the enactment in late December 2017 of the TCJA and $59.0 million of expense caused by our establishment of a valuation allowance against our net deferred tax assets at December 31, 2017. These matters are discussed in more detail below.\nRevenues in 2017 decreased 3% compared to 2016. Beginning in mid-2017 and continuing in the fourth quarter of 2017, we experienced difficulties which we believe were due in part to changes that Google, Inc. (\"Google\") has made in its natural search engine algorithms. It has taken us longer to analyze and to seek to adapt to the 2017 algorithm adjustments than it took us to respond to Google's changes in previous years. We have reorganized a large number of resources around addressing this challenge, as well as seeking to prevent it from occurring again. We have implemented a variety of innovations and technical improvements in this area and expect to continue to do so. However, we cannot offer any assurance that we will be able to fully adapt to the 2017 algorithm adjustments or will be able to rely in the future on natural search results as we have in the past. This decrease to revenue was partially offset by efforts to increase revenue in other marketing channels such as sponsored search and email.\nGross profit in 2017 increased 3% compared to 2016 primarily as a result of increased gross margin. Gross margin increased to 19.5% in 2017 compared to 18.4% in 2016. The increase in gross margin was primarily due to a continued shift in sales mix into higher margin home and garden products and an increase in marketplace sales (which we recognize on a net basis), partially offset by increased promotional activities, including coupons and site sales due to our driving a higher proportion of our sales using such promotions.\nSales and marketing expenses as a percentage of revenue increased from 8.2% to 10.4% in 2017 as compared to 2016, primarily due to increased spending in the sponsored search and display ads on social media marketing channels, due in part to our seeking to increase revenue in these channels to partially offset the effects of the Google algorithm changes described above.\nWhile we work to adapt to Google's changes, we have increased our emphasis on other marketing channels, such as sponsored search, which has generated revenue growth but with higher associated marketing expenses than natural search. We expect this trend to continue while we work to adapt to these changes.\nWe are also experiencing an increasingly competitive digital marketing landscape. We have competitors who are spending significant amounts on advertising bidding up the cost of certain marketing channels, such as paid keywords. While we may not choose to match their levels of spending, this has increased our marketing costs in recent quarters. We expect this trend to continue. However, we do have a number of important digital marketing initiatives that we are testing and implementing that we believe will improve our competitive position in this area.\nAs a result of these factors, our contribution decreased 19% in 2017 compared to 2016 (see Non-GAAP Financial Measures below for a reconciliation of Contribution to Gross Profit). Contribution margin was 9.3% in 2017 compared to 11.1% in 2016.\nWe believe that to build market share in the e-commerce home goods market, we will need to significantly increase our marketing and branding expenditures, which we expect would lead to increased revenues but also lead to future net losses in the near-term.\nTechnology expenses in 2017 increased $9.1 million compared to 2016 primarily due to an increase in staff related costs of $4.9 million, and an increase in technology licenses and maintenance costs of $4.0 million.\nGeneral and administrative expenses in 2017 increased $1.4 million compared to 2016, primarily due to an increase in staff related costs of $4.9 million, partially offset by a decrease in legal fees of $3.0 million, and a decrease in bad debt expense of $1.1 million.\nOur provision for income taxes totaled $64.2 million and $9.3 million for 2017 and 2016, respectively. The increase in 2017 expense compared to 2016 is primarily attributable to our decision to establish a valuation allowance against our net deferred tax assets, as well as the impact of the TCJA. On December 22, 2017, the President signed into law the TCJA. Among many other changes, the new law lowers the corporate tax rate from 35% to 21% for tax years beginning in 2018. Therefore, we re-valued our deferred tax assets in 2017 due to the federal rate reduction, which resulted in an increase in our 2017 income tax expense of $25.3 million. Additionally, each quarter we assess available positive and negative evidence to estimate whether we will generate sufficient future taxable income to use our existing deferred tax assets. Due to losses incurred in 2017 and the potential for future losses, we have recorded a valuation allowance on our deferred tax assets, net of deferred tax liabilities, which further increased our 2017 income tax expense by $59.0 million.\nWe continue to seek opportunities for growth, in our retail business and through our Medici blockchain and financial technology initiatives and through other means. As a result of these initiatives, we will continue to incur additional expenses and may purchase interests in, or make acquisitions of, other technologies or businesses. We anticipate that our initiatives may cause us to incur losses in the foreseeable future. These losses, additional expenses, acquisitions or purchases may be material, and, coupled with existing marketing expense trends, our plans to increase our marketing and branding expenditures, and strategic changes in our retail business, may lead to increased consolidated losses in some periods, and to reduced liquidity. Additionally, we may recognize additional impairment charges from our ownership interest in other entities.\nThe balance of our Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations provides further information about the matters discussed above and other important matters affecting our business.\nResults of Operations\nThe following table sets forth our results of

</tr>\n</table>\nThe decrease in total net revenue for the year ended December 31, 2017, as compared to the same period in 2016, was due in part to changes that we believe Google has made in its natural search engine algorithms. In addition, we had an increase in product sales for which we record only our commission as revenue, and an increase in promotional activities, including coupons and site sales due to our driving a higher proportion of our sales using such promotions.\nThe decrease in direct revenue for the year ended December 31, 2017, as compared to the same period in 2016, was due in part to the changes that Google has made in its natural search engine algorithms. The decrease to revenue can also be explained by a decrease in sales of direct home and garden, clothing, and jewelry products, and increased promotional activities, including coupons and site sales due to our driving a higher proportion of our sales using such promotions. These were partially offset by\ndeferring a lower number of orders taken but not delivered due to decreased direct revenue, and a decrease in Club O Rewards earned due to discontinuing rewards on the Club O Silver program in Q4 2016.\nThe decrease in partner revenue for the year ended December 31, 2017, as compared to the same period in 2016, was due in part to the changes that Google has made in its natural search engine algorithms. The decrease to revenue can also be explained by an increase in product sales for which we record only our commission as revenue, and an increase in promotional activities, including coupons and site sales due to our driving a higher proportion of our sales using such promotions. We also had a decrease in sales in categories on which we placed a reduced emphasis, which was partially offset by an increase in sales of home and garden products which we have emphasized.\nWe continue to seek increased participation in our Club O loyalty program, including, in certain instances, by increasing Club O Rewards to our Club O members in lieu of coupons we offer to all customers. For additional information regarding our Club O loyalty program see Item 15 of Part IV, \"Financial Statements\"-Note 2. Accounting Policies, Club O loyalty program.\nThe shift of business from direct to partner (or vice versa) is an economic result based on the economics of each particular product offering at the time and we generally do not have particular goals for an \"appropriate\" mix or percentage for the size of either. Although we have experienced a trend from direct revenue to partner revenue in recent years, we believe that the mix of the business between direct and partner remains consistent with our strategic objectives for our business model in the current economic environment and we do not currently foresee any material shifts in this trend.\nThe products and product lines we offer, and their respective percentages of our revenue, are based on many factors including customer demand, our marketing efforts, promotional pricing, joint-marketing offered by our suppliers, the types of inventory we are able to obtain and the number of SKUs we offer. These factors change frequently and can affect the mix of the product lines we sell. We have experienced a trend toward our home and garden category in recent years and we have recently focused our marketing and branding efforts towards our home and garden product line. We are also working to increase the number of SKUs we offer. While we do not currently expect any material shifts in our product line mix, the relative amounts of the product lines we sell, and the revenue we earn from those product lines, is generally an economic result of the factors described above, which may change from time to time.\nInternational sales were less than 3% of total net revenues for 2017 and 2016.\nGross profit and gross margin\nOur overall gross margins fluctuate based on our sales volume mix between our direct business and partner business; changes in supplier cost and / or sales price, including competitive pricing; inventory management decisions within the direct business; sales coupons and promotions; product mix of sales; and operational and fulfillment costs.\nThe following table reflects our net revenues, cost of

margin. Gross margin increased to 19.5% for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to 18.4% for the same period in 2016. This increase in gross margin was primarily due to a continued shift in sales mix into higher margin home and garden products and an increase in marketplace sales (which we recognize on a net basis), partially offset by increased promotional activities, including coupons and site sales due to our driving a higher proportion of our sales using such promotions.\nThe 225 basis point decrease in direct gross margin for the year ended December 31, 2017, as compared to the same period in 2016, was primarily due to increased promotional activities, including coupons and site sales due to our driving a higher proportion of our sales using such promotions, and increased freight costs primarily in the fourth quarter, partially offset by a shift in sales mix into higher margin home and garden products.\nThe 115 basis point increase in partner gross margin for the year ended December 31, 2017, as compared to the same period in 2016 was primarily due to a continued shift in sales mix into higher margin home and garden products, partially offset by increased promotional activities, including coupons and site sales due to our driving a higher proportion of our sales using such promotions.\nCost of goods sold includes stock-based compensation expense of $183,000 and $266,000 for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.\nFulfillment costs\nFulfillment costs include all warehousing costs, including fixed overhead and variable handling costs (excluding packaging costs), as well as credit card fees and customer service costs, all of which we include as costs in calculating gross margin. We believe that some companies in our industry, including some of our competitors, account for fulfillment costs within operating expenses, and therefore exclude fulfillment costs from gross margin. As a result, our gross margin may not be directly comparable to others in our industry.\nThe following table has been included to provide investors additional information regarding our classification of fulfillment costs, gross profit and margin, thus enabling investors to better compare our gross margin with others in our industry (in thousands): Table 230: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Year ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total revenue, net\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,744,756\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>100%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,799,963\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>100%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cost of goods sold\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Product costs and other cost of goods sold\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,328,749\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>76.2%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,391,736\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>77.3%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Fulfillment and related costs\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>75,456\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.3%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>76,878\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.3%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total cost of goods sold\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,404,205\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>80.5%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,468,614\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>81.6%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gross profit\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>340,551\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>19.5%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>331,349\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>18.4%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nFulfillment costs as a percentage of sales may vary due to several factors, such as our ability to manage costs at our warehouses, significant changes in the number of units received and fulfilled, the extent to which we use third party fulfillment services and warehouses, and our ability to effectively manage customer service costs and credit card fees. Fulfillment and related costs remained relatively flat during the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to 2016.\nSee Gross profit and gross margin above for additional discussion.\nOperating expenses\nSales and marketing expenses\nWe use a variety of methods to target our consumer audience, including online campaigns, such as advertising through keywords, product listing ads, display ads, search engines, affiliate marketing programs, social coupon websites, portals, banners, e-mail, direct mail and viral and social media campaigns. We also do brand advertising through television, radio, print ads, and event sponsorships.\nThe following table reflects our sales and marketing expenses for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 (in thousands):\nTable 231: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Year ended\nDecember 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$ Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>% Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Sales and marketing expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>180,589\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>147,896\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>32,693\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>22.1\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Sales and marketing expenses as a percent of net revenues\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10.4\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8.2\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe 220 basis point increase in sales and marketing expenses as a percentage of revenue for the year ended December 31, 2017, as compared to the same period in 2016, was primarily due to increased spending in sponsored search and display ads on social media, and television marketing channels, and increased staff related costs.\nWhile we work to adapt to Google's changes in its natural search engine algorithms as noted above, we have increased our emphasis on other marketing channels, such as sponsored search, which has generated revenue growth but with higher associated marketing expenses than natural search. We expect this trend to continue while we work to adapt to these changes.\nWe are also experiencing an increasingly competitive digital marketing landscape. We have competitors who are spending significant amounts on advertising bidding up the cost of certain marketing channels, such as paid keywords. While we may not choose to match their levels of spending, this has increased our marketing costs in recent quarters. We expect this trend to continue. However, we do have a number of important digital marketing initiatives that we are testing and implementing that we believe will improve our competitive position in this area.\nSales and marketing expenses include stock-based compensation expense of $415,000 and $249,000 for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.\nWe do not include costs associated with our discounted shipping and other promotions, such as coupons in sales and marketing expense. Rather, we account for them as a reduction of revenue and therefore affect sales and gross margin. We consider discounted shipping and other promotions, such as our policy of free shipping on orders over $45, as an effective marketing tool, and intend to continue to offer them as we deem appropriate as part of our overall marketing plan.\nTechnology expenses\nWe seek to invest efficiently in technology, including web services, customer support solutions, website search, expansion of new and existing product categories, and in technology to enhance the customer experience, improve our process efficiency and support and expand our logistics infrastructure. We may increase our technology expenses to support these initiatives and these increases may be material.\nThe frequency and variety of cyber-attacks on our Website, our corporate systems, and on third parties we use to support our technology continue to increase. The impact of these attacks, their costs, and the costs we incur to protect ourselves against future attacks have not been material. However, we consider the threat from cyber-attacks to be serious and will continue to incur costs related to protecting ourselves against them.\nThe following table reflects our technology expenses for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 (in thousands):\nTable 232: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Year ended\nDecember 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$ Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>% Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Technology expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>115,878\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>106,760\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>9,118\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8.5\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Technology expenses as a percent of net revenues\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6.6\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5.9\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe $9.1 million increase in technology costs for the year ended December 31, 2017, as compared to the same period in 2016, was primarily due to an increase in staff related costs of $4.9 million, and an increase in technology licenses and maintenance of $4.0 million.\nTechnology expenses include stock-based compensation expense of $649,000 and $777,000 for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.\nGeneral and administrative expenses\nThe following table reflects our general and administrative expenses (\"G&A\") for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 (in thousands):\nTable 233: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Year ended\nDecember 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$ Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>% Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>General and administrative expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>90,718\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>89,298\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,420\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.6\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>General and administrative expenses as a percent of net revenues\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5.2\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe $1.4 million increase in general and administrative expenses (\"G&A\") for the year ended December 31, 2017, as compared to the same period in 2016, was primarily due to an increase in staff related costs of $4.9 million, partially offset by a decrease in legal fees of $3.0 million, and a decrease in bad debt expense of $1.1 million.\nG&A expenses include stock-based compensation expense of approximately $2.8 million and $3.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.\nWe continue to seek opportunities for growth, in our retail business and through our Medici blockchain and financial technology initiatives and through other means. As a result of these initiatives, we will continue to incur additional expenses and may purchase interests in, or make acquisitions of, other technologies or businesses. We anticipate that our initiatives may cause us to incur losses in the foreseeable future. These losses, additional expenses, acquisitions or purchases may be material, and, coupled with existing marketing expense trends, our plans to increase our marketing and branding expenditures, and strategic changes in our retail business, may lead to increased consolidated losses in some periods, and to reduced liquidity. Additionally, we may recognize additional impairment charges from our ownership interest in other entities.\nLitigation settlement\nIn Q1 2016, we entered into a settlement agreement in our prime broker litigation which concluded the litigation in its entirety and we recognized settlement proceeds of $19.5 million. Related costs associated with the litigation and settlement of approximately $1.0 million were included in G&A expenses during Q1 2016.\nDepreciation and amortization expense\nDepreciation expense is classified within the corresponding operating expense categories in the consolidated statements of operations as follows (in thousands):\nTable 234: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Year ended\nDecember 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cost of goods sold - direct\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>307\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>310\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Technology\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>24,604\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>25,693\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Sales and marketing\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>124\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>General and administrative\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,937\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,156\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total depreciation, including internal-use software and website development\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>28,848\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>27,283\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nAmortization of intangible assets other than goodwill is classified within the corresponding operating expense categories in the consolidated statements of operations as follows (in thousands):\nTable 235: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Year ended\nDecember 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Technology\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,620\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,904\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Sales and marketing\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>83\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,008\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>General and administrative\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>296\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>56\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total amortization\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,999\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,968\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nNon-operating income (expense)\nInterest expense\nTotal interest expense increased $2.1 million, from $877,000 for the year ended December 31, 2016 to $2.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. The increase in interest expense is primarily due to no longer capitalizing interest on our headquarters loan due to construction completion.\nOther income, net\nOther income, net for the year ended December 31, 2017 was $1.2 million as compared to $14.2 million in 2016. The decrease is primarily due to a decrease in Club O Rewards breakage of $14.2 million due to discontinuing our Club O Silver rewards program in Q4 2016, an increase in impairment charges of $2.6 million related to cost method investments, and an increase in debt extinguishment costs of $2.5 million. These decreases were partially offset by an increase in realized gains on sales of cryptocurrencies and precious metals of $6.6 million.\nIncome taxes\nOur effective tax rate for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 was (134.5)% and 45.3%, respectively. Our effective tax rate is affected by recurring items such as research tax credits and non-recurring items such as changes in valuation allowances. It is also affected to a lesser extent by tax rates in foreign jurisdictions and the relative amount of income we earn in those jurisdictions, which we expect to be fairly consistent in the near term. The decrease in the 2017 effective tax rate relative to the 2016 effective tax rate is primarily attributable to our decision to establish a valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets, net of deferred tax liabilities, as well as the impact of the TCJA. In our decision to establish a valuation allowance, we concluded that the negative evidence outweighed the positive evidence and that it was not more likely than not that all our federal and state deferred tax assets will be realized (see Item 15 of Part IV, \"Financial Statements\"-Note 18. Income Taxes, contained in the \"Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\" of this Annual Report on Form 10-K).\nWe have indefinitely reinvested foreign earnings of $1.3 million at December 31, 2017. The TCJA includes a mandatory deemed repatriation of cumulative foreign earnings for the year ended December 31, 2017, for which we accrued provisional tax expense. However, we would still need to accrue and pay various other taxes on this amount if repatriated. We are currently analyzing our global working capital and cash requirements and the potential tax liabilities attributable to a\nrepatriation, including calculating any excess of the amount for financial reporting over the tax basis in our foreign subsidiaries, but we have yet to determine whether we plan to change our prior assertion and repatriate earnings. Accordingly, we have not recorded any deferred taxes attributable to our investments in our foreign subsidiaries. We will record the tax effects of any change in our prior assertion in the period that we complete our analysis and are able to make a reasonable estimate, and disclose any unrecognized deferred tax liability for temporary differences related to our foreign investments, if practicable, in the period that we are first able to make a reasonable estimate, no later than December 2018.\nSeasonality\nBased upon our historical experience, revenue typically increases during the fourth quarter because of the holiday retail season and gross margin decreases due to increased sales of certain lower margin products, such as electronics. Revenue typically decreases in the following quarter(s), as shown in the table below. The actual quarterly results for each quarter could differ materially depending upon consumer preferences, availability of product and competition, among other risks and uncertainties. Accordingly, there can be no assurances that seasonal variations will not materially affect our results of operations in the future.\nThe following table reflects our total net revenues for each of the quarters in 2017, 2016 and 2015 (in thousands):\nTable 236: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>First\nQuarter\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Second\nQuarter\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Third\nQuarter\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Fourth\nQuarter\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>432,435\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>432,024\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>424,007\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>456,290\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>413,677\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>418,540\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>441,564\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>526,182\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>398,344\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>388,013\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>391,211\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>480,270\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nComparison of Years Ended December 31, 2016 and 2015\nExecutive Commentary\nThis executive commentary is intended to provide investors with a view of our business through the eyes of our management. As an executive commentary, it necessarily focuses on selected aspects of our business. This executive commentary is intended as a supplement to, but not a substitute for, the more detailed discussion of our business included elsewhere herein. Investors are cautioned to read our entire \"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,\" as well as our interim and audited financial statements, and the discussion of our business and risk factors and other information included elsewhere or incorporated in this report. This executive commentary includes forward-looking statements, and investors are cautioned to read \"Special Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements.\"\nRevenues in 2016 increased 9% compared to 2015. The growth in revenue was primarily due to a 6% increase in average order size, coupled with a 4% increase in orders. These increases were partially offset by increased promotional activities, including coupons and site sales (which we recognize as a reduction of revenue) due to our driving a higher proportion of our sales using such promotions. Our average order size has increased in recent years due primarily to a sales mix shift into home and garden products. We are uncertain how long this trend will continue.\nGross profit in 2016 increased 9% compared to 2015 primarily as a result of revenue growth. Gross margin was flat at 18.4% in 2016 compared to 2015. Gross margin increased due to a continued shift in sales mix into higher margin home and garden products, but that increase was offset by increased promotional activities.\nSales and marketing expenses as a percentage of revenue increased from 7.5% to 8.2% during 2016 as compared to 2015, primarily due to increased spending in the sponsored search marketing channels and increased staff related costs.\nAs a result of these factors, our Contribution increased 8% in 2016 compared to 2015 (see Non-GAAP Financial Measures below for a reconciliation of Contribution to Gross Profit). Contribution margin was 11.1% in 2016 compared to 11.2% in 2015.\nTechnology expenses in 2016 increased $8.2 million compared to 2015, primarily due to an increase in depreciation of $5.9 million, an increase in staff-related costs of $2.5 million, and an increase of $1.6 million in technology licenses and maintenance. These increases were partially offset by a $1.3 million decrease in outside consulting services.\nGeneral and administrative expenses in 2016 increased $7.1 million compared to 2015, primarily due to an increase of $7.6 million in staff related costs and $1.1 million in bad debt expense for accounts receivable due from a marketplace in which we also have a minority interest. These increases were partially offset by a $1.9 million decrease in legal fees and a $1.3 million decrease in consulting and outside services.\nDuring Q3 2016, we recognized an impairment charge of $2.9 million in Other income, net related to an international marketplace company in which we hold a minority interest that has historically been recorded at cost.\nIn Q1 2016, we entered into a settlement agreement in our prime broker litigation which concluded the litigation in its entirety and we recognized settlement proceeds of $19.5 million. Related costs associated with the litigation and settlement of approximately $1.0 million were included in G&A expenses during Q1 2016.\nIn December 2016, as a demonstration of the platform and technology developed by our majority-owned subsidiary t\u00d8.com, Inc., we issued publicly traded preferred shares of Overstock.com, Inc. for proceeds of $7.6 million, net of offering costs. Additionally, as part of our Medici initiatives to develop this technology, in Q1 2016, we completed the acquisition of two registered broker-dealers. In 2015 we acquired a related financial technology company.\nThe balance of our Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations provides further information about the matters discussed above and other important matters affecting our business.\nResults of Operations\nThe following table sets forth our results of operations expressed as a percentage of total net

for the year ended December 31, 2016, as compared to the same period in 2015, was a 6% increase in average order size, coupled with a 4% increase in orders. These increases were partially offset by increased promotional activities, including coupons and site sales (which we recognize as a reduction of revenue) due to our driving a higher proportion of our sales using such promotions. Our average order size has increased in recent years due primarily to a sales mix shift into home and garden products. We are uncertain how long this trend will continue.\nThe primary reason for decreased direct revenue for the year ended December 31, 2016, as compared to the same period in 2015, was a decrease in sales of home and garden products (primarily due to a shift from our direct segment to our partner segment) in addition to increased promotional activities, including coupons and site sales (which we recognize as a reduction of\nrevenue) due to our driving a higher proportion of our sales using such promotions. Also, the percentage of revenue we defer from orders taken but not delivered was higher due to the timing of year end.\nThe increase in partner revenue for the year ended December 31, 2016, as compared to the same period in 2015, was primarily due to an increase in sales of home and garden products. This increase was partially offset by increased promotional activities, including coupons and site sales (which we recognize as a reduction of revenue) due to our driving a higher proportion of our sales using such promotions.\nSince mid-2015 through the first half of 2016, we experienced some slowing of our overall revenue growth, which we believe was due in part to changes that Google made in its natural search engine algorithms. While we worked to adapt to Google's changes, we increased our emphasis on other marketing channels, such as sponsored search, which generated revenue growth but with higher associated marketing expenses than natural search.\nWe continue to seek increased participation in our Club O loyalty program, including, in certain instances, by increasing Club O Rewards to our Club O members in lieu of coupons we offer to all customers. For additional information regarding our Club O loyalty program see Item 15 of Part IV, \"Financial Statements\"-Note 2. Accounting Policies, Club O loyalty program.\nThe shift of business from direct to partner (or vice versa) is an economic result based on the economics of each particular product offering at the time and we generally do not have particular goals for an \"appropriate\" mix or percentage for the size of either. Although we have experienced a trend from direct revenue to partner revenue in recent years, we believe that the mix of the business between direct and partner remains consistent with our strategic objectives for our business model in the current economic environment and we do not currently foresee any material shifts in this trend.\nThe products and product lines we offer, and their respective percentages of our revenue, are based on many factors including customer demand, our marketing efforts, promotional pricing, joint-marketing offered by our suppliers, the types of inventory we are able to obtain and the number of SKUs we offer. These factors change frequently and can affect the mix of the product lines we sell. We have experienced a trend toward our home and garden category in recent years and we have recently focused our marketing and branding efforts towards our home and garden product line. We are also working to increase the number of SKUs we offer. While we do not currently expect any material shifts in our product line mix, the relative amounts of the product lines we sell, and the revenue we earn from those product lines, is generally an economic result of the factors described above, which may change from time to time.\nInternational sales were less than 2% of total net revenues for 2016 and 2015.\nGross profit and gross margin\nOur overall gross margins fluctuate based on our sales volume mix between our direct business and partner business; changes in supplier cost and / or sales price, including competitive pricing; inventory management decisions within the direct business; sales coupons and promotions; product mix of sales; and operational and fulfillment costs.\nThe following table reflects our net revenues, cost of

</tr>\n</table>\nGross profit in 2016 increased 9% compared to 2015 primarily as a result of revenue growth. Gross margin was flat at 18.4% in 2016 compared to 2015. Gross margin increased due to a continued shift in sales mix into higher margin home and garden products, but that increase was offset by increased promotional activities, including coupons and site sales (which we recognize as a reduction of revenue) due to our driving a higher proportion of our sales using such promotions.\nThe 182 basis point decrease in direct gross margin for the year ended December 31, 2016, as compared to the same period in 2015, was primarily due to increased promotional activities, including coupons and site sales (which we recognize as a reduction of revenue) due to our driving a higher proportion of our sales using such promotions, and increased warehousing costs as a percentage of revenue due to lower revenue, partially offset by a shift in sales mix into higher margin products.\nThe 21 basis point decrease in partner gross margin for the year ended December 31, 2016, as compared to the same period in 2015 was primarily due to increased promotional activities, including coupons and site sales (which we recognize as a reduction of revenue) due to our driving a higher proportion of our sales using such promotions, partially offset by a continued shift in sales mix into higher margin home and garden products.\nCost of goods sold includes stock-based compensation expense of $266,000 and $179,000 for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively.\nFulfillment costs\nFulfillment costs include all warehousing costs, including fixed overhead and variable handling costs (excluding packaging costs), as well as credit card fees and customer service costs, all of which we include as costs in calculating gross margin. We believe that some companies in our industry, including some of our competitors, account for fulfillment costs within operating expenses, and therefore exclude fulfillment costs from gross margin. As a result, our gross margin may not be directly comparable to others in our industry.\nThe following table has been included to provide investors additional information regarding our classification of fulfillment costs, gross profit and margin, thus enabling investors to better compare our gross margin with others in our industry (in thousands): Table 242: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Year ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total revenue, net\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,799,963\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>100%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,657,838\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>100%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cost of goods sold\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Product costs and other cost of goods sold\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,391,736\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>77.3%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,279,766\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>77.2%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Fulfillment and related costs\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>76,878\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.3%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>73,418\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.4%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total cost of goods sold\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,468,614\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>81.6%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,353,184\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>81.6%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gross profit\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>331,349\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>18.4%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>304,654\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>18.4%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nFulfillment costs as a percentage of sales may vary due to several factors, such as our ability to manage costs at our warehouses, significant changes in the number of units received and fulfilled, the extent to which we use third party fulfillment services and warehouses, and our ability to effectively manage customer service costs and credit card fees. Fulfillment and related costs remained relatively flat during the year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to 2015.\nSee Gross profit and gross margin above for additional discussion.\nOperating expenses\nSales and marketing expenses\nWe use a variety of methods to target our consumer audience, including online campaigns, such as advertising through keywords, product listing ads, display ads, search engines, affiliate marketing programs, social coupon websites, portals, banners, e-mail, direct mail and viral and social media campaigns. We also do brand advertising through television, radio, print ads, and event sponsorships.\nThe following table reflects our sales and marketing expenses for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 (in thousands):\nTable 243: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Year ended\nDecember 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$ Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>% Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Sales and marketing expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>147,896\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>124,468\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>23,428\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>18.8\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Sales and marketing expenses as a percent of net revenues\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8.2\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7.5\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe 71 basis point increase in sales and marketing expenses as a percentage of revenue for the year ended December 31, 2016, as compared to the same period in 2015, was primarily due to increased spending in the sponsored search marketing channels and increased staff related costs.\nSales and marketing expenses include stock-based compensation expense of $249,000 and $217,000 for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively.\nCosts associated with our discounted shipping and other promotions, such as coupons, are not included in marketing expense. Rather, they are accounted for as a reduction of revenue and therefore affect sales and gross margin. We consider discounted shipping and other promotions, such as our policy of free shipping on orders over $45, as an effective marketing tool, and intend to continue to offer them as we deem appropriate as part of our overall marketing plan.\nWe constantly evaluate where we spend our sales and marketing dollars and have experienced a trend of increasing costs to acquire customers. From time to time, our competitors may bid up the cost of certain marketing channels, such as paid keywords. At such times, we may reduce the amounts we spend in those marketing channels, which may lead to decreased visitors to our site for a time. For example, during Q4 2016 and Q4 2015, the number of unique visitors to our site decreased by approximately 2% and 8%, respectively, as compared to the prior years, in part we believe as a result of such changes.\nTechnology expenses\nWe seek to invest efficiently in technology, including web services, customer support solutions, website search, expansion of new and existing product categories, and in technology to enhance the customer experience, improve our process efficiency and support and expand our logistics infrastructure. We may increase our technology expenses to support these initiatives and these increases may be material.\nThe frequency and variety of cyber-attacks on our Website, our corporate systems, and on third parties that we use to support our technology continue to increase, including an attack that took place in October 2016 which interrupted traffic for several major websites in the United States. The impact of these attacks, their costs, and the costs we incur to protect ourselves against future attacks have not been material. However, we consider the threat from cyber-attacks to be serious and will continue to incur costs related to protecting ourselves against them.\nThe following table reflects our technology expenses for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 (in thousands):\nTable 244: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Year ended\nDecember 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$ Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>% Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Technology expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>106,760\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>98,533\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>8,227\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8.3\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Technology expenses as a percent of net revenues\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5.9\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5.9\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe $8.2 million increase in technology costs for the year ended December 31, 2016, as compared to the same period in 2015, was primarily due to an increase in depreciation and amortization of $5.9 million, an increase in staff-related costs of $2.5 million (net employee and contractor change), and an increase of $1.6 million in technology licenses and maintenance.

During 2015, our Medici-related subsidiaries incurred a pre-tax loss of approximately $7.0 million, which includes $1.5 million of amortization and depreciation expense.\nLitigation settlement\nIn Q1 2016, we entered into a settlement agreement in our prime broker litigation which concluded the litigation in its entirety and we recognized settlement proceeds of $19.5 million. Related costs associated with the litigation and settlement of approximately $1.0 million were included in G&A expenses during Q1 2016.\nDepreciation and amortization expense\nDepreciation expense is classified within the corresponding operating expense categories in the consolidated statements of operations as follows (in thousands):\nTable 246: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Year ended\nDecember 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cost of goods sold - direct\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>310\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>283\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Technology\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>25,693\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>22,126\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Sales and marketing\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>124\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>General and administrative\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,156\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,107\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total depreciation, including internal-use software and website development\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>27,283\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>23,516\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nAmortization of intangible assets other than goodwill is classified within the corresponding operating expense categories in the consolidated statements of operations as follows (in thousands):\nTable 247: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Year ended\nDecember 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Technology\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,904\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>605\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Sales and marketing\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,008\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>531\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>General and administrative\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>56\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>445\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total amortization\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,968\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,581\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nNon-operating income (expense)\nInterest expense\nTotal interest expense increased $737,000, or 526%, from $140,000 in 2015 to $877,000 in 2016. The increase in interest expense is primarily due to no longer capitalizing interest on our headquarters loan due to construction completion.\nOther income (expense), net\nOther income, net for the year ended December 31, 2016 was $14.2 million as compared to $3.6 million in 2015. The increase is primarily due to increased Club O Rewards breakage of $10.9 million due to growth in the Club O Rewards program, particularly our Club O Silver program, a $1.2 million decrease in unrealized losses on our precious metals (no losses incurred in 2016), and an $850,000 decrease in costs related to cryptobond transactions (none incurred in 2016). These increases were partially offset by an impairment charge of $2.9 million related to a company in which we hold a minority interest that has historically been recorded at cost.\nBeginning in 2015, we enrolled a significant number of members in Club O Silver, a newly introduced Club O membership tier for customers who agree to receive promotional emails. Club O Silver members earned Club O Rewards on qualifying purchases that expire after 90 days from a qualifying purchase. We discontinued Club O Silver in October 2016, and as a result we do not expect further Club O Silver rewards breakage in the future.\nIncome taxes\nOur effective tax rate for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 was 45.3% and 60.8%, respectively. Our effective tax rate is affected by recurring items such as research tax credits and non-recurring items such as changes in valuation allowances. It is also affected to a lesser extent by tax rates in foreign jurisdictions and the relative amount of income we earn in those jurisdictions, which we expect to be fairly consistent in the near term. The decrease in the 2016 effective tax rate relative to the 2015 effective tax rate is primarily attributable to our increased pre-tax income in 2016 over 2015 and increased ownership of our majority-owned subsidiary, tZERO. Prior to Q3 2015, we owned 75.1% of tZERO. Tax losses incurred while holding less than 80% of the business cannot offset our consolidated taxable income and are fully valued. The operating losses that tZERO incurred after we increased our ownership during Q3 2015 did not require a valuation allowance since the subsidiary now qualified for tax consolidation. The decrease in the effective tax rate was partially offset by an increase in our\nvaluation allowance for capital losses due to an impairment loss on a minority interest in an international marketplace and share-based compensation tax deficiencies due to a decline in our stock price. We expect volatility in our tax rate in future periods due to share-based compensation deductions that will result from our adoption of ASU No. 2016-09, Compensation-Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting.\nWe had indefinitely reinvested foreign earnings of $421,000 at December 31, 2016. We would need to accrue and pay U.S. income tax on this amount if repatriated. At the time, we did not intend to repatriate these earnings.\nSeasonality\nBased upon our historical experience, revenue typically increases during the fourth quarter because of the holiday retail season and gross margin decreases due to increased sales of certain lower margin products, such as electronics. Revenue typically decreases in the following quarter(s), as shown in the table below. The actual quarterly results for each quarter could differ materially depending upon consumer preferences, availability of product and competition, among other risks and uncertainties. Accordingly, there can be no assurances that seasonal variations will not materially affect our results of operations in the future.\nThe following table reflects our total net revenues for each of the quarters in 2016, 2015 and 2014 (in thousands):\nTable 248: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>First\nQuarter\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Second\nQuarter\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Third\nQuarter\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Fourth\nQuarter\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>413,677\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>418,540\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>441,564\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>526,182\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>398,344\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>388,013\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>391,211\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>480,270\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>341,207\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>332,545\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>352,991\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>470,360\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nOverview\nAlthough we believe that our cash and cash equivalents currently on hand and expected cash flows from future operations will be sufficient to continue operations for at least the next twelve months, we also believe that we will need to raise additional capital and/or obtain significant additional debt financing to be able to fully pursue our plans for increasing market share in our retail business while also funding the needs of our Medici initiatives.\nWe believe that some of our direct competitors spend significantly higher percentages of their revenue on marketing than we do, and that we need to increase our branding and marketing expenditures in order to increase our market share in the e-commerce home goods market and educate consumers about our current position as an online retailer offering a wide assortment of quality home goods and other products at low prices and with a high level of customer service. We have developed and implemented marketing and branding initiatives to address this, and believe that additional marketing and branding efforts will have significant long-term positive results. However, a significant increase in our branding and marketing expenditures or other expenses would be likely to adversely affect our short-term results.\nWe also want to invest in additional distribution facilities to speed shipping and improve our customer service; in additional automation, technology and engineering resources because we believe they can improve our customers' shopping experience and increase our sales; in our Club O rewards program, primarily to increase member benefits and to develop additional personalization programs; and in expansion of our private label initiative because we believe that private label brands can generate significant brand equity and customer loyalty. See Item 1 of Part I, \"Business\"-\"Our Retail Business\"-\"Growth Strategies for Our E-Commerce Business.\"\nOur Medici initiatives also require substantial funding. Medici Ventures and its majority-owned subsidiary, tZERO, continue to identify, evaluate and pursue various opportunities for strategic acquisitions or purchases of interests to add to the services and expertise they offer their customers. See Item 1 of Part I, \"Business\"-Medici for information regarding our recent and planned strategic acquisitions or purchases of interests.\nOur ability to pursue some or all of these plans, and the extent to which we would be able to pursue some or all of them, will depend on the resources we have available, and will require significantly more capital than we currently have.\nCurrent sources of liquidity\nWe believe that our cash and cash equivalents currently on hand and expected cash flows from future operations will be sufficient to continue operations for at least the next twelve months. Our failure to generate sufficient revenues or profits or to obtain additional financing or raise additional capital could have a material adverse effect on our operations and on our ability to achieve our business objectives. Any projections of future cash needs and cash flows are subject to substantial uncertainty.\nIn November 2017, we entered into a $40.0 million loan agreement with PCL L.L.C., an entity directly or indirectly wholly owned by the mother and brother of our Chief Executive Officer, Dr. Patrick Byrne. For additional information, see Borrowings-PCL loan below.\nIn November 2017, we issued two warrants to purchase the company's common stock in privately negotiated transactions for an aggregate purchase price of $6.5 million. In December 2017, one warrant was exercised and we issued common shares of Overstock.com, Inc. for proceeds of $100.0 million before expenses. On January 17, 2018, the other warrant was exercised in full and proceeds of $50.6 million were received.\nIn December 2017, tZERO launched an offering (the \"security token offering\") of the right to acquire, if issued by tZERO in the future, tZERO Preferred Equity Tokens (the \"tZERO Security Token\") through a Simple Agreement for Future Equity (\"SAFE\"). The security token offering is expected to run through May 14, 2018 but may be extended or shortened and is subject to withdrawal rights under certain circumstances. As of March 14, 2018, tZERO has received $91.4 million in proceeds, net of requested withdrawals.\nOur principal sources of liquidity are cash flows generated from operations, and our existing cash and cash equivalents. At December 31, 2017, we had cash and cash equivalents of $203.2 million.\nCash flow information is as follows (in thousands):\nTable 249: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Year ended\nDecember 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cash provided by (used in):\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(35,321\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>39,564\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Investing activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(17,960\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(79,447\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Financing activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>73,398\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>52,719\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nFree cash flow\n\"Free Cash Flow\" (a non-GAAP measure) for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, was $(58.9) million and $(32.7) million, respectively. See Non-GAAP Financial Measures below for a reconciliation of Free Cash Flow to net cash provided by (used in) operating activities.\nCash flows from operating activities\nFor the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, our operating activities resulted in net cash outflow of $35.3 million and net cash inflow of $39.6 million, respectively.\nCash received from customers generally corresponds to our net revenues as our customers primarily use credit cards to buy from us causing our receivables from these sales transactions to settle quickly. We have payment terms with our partners that generally extend beyond the amount of time necessary to collect proceeds from our customers. As a result, following our typically seasonally strong fourth quarter sales, at December 31 of each year, our cash, cash equivalents and accounts payable balances normally reach their highest level (other than as a result of cash flows provided by or used in investing and financing activities). However, our accounts payable balance normally declines during the first three months following year-end, which normally results in a decline in our cash and cash equivalents balances from the year-end balance. The seasonality of our business normally causes payables and accruals to grow significantly in the fourth quarter, and then decrease in the first quarter when they are typically paid.\nThe $35.3 million of net cash used in operating activities during the year ended December 31, 2017 was primarily from a consolidated net loss of $111.9 million, and a decrease in accounts payable of $21.0 million. These were partially offset\nby non-cash deferred income taxes of $65.2 million, and depreciation of $28.8 million. The change in accounts payable was primarily due to lower sales volume in December 2017 compared to the same period in 2016. We recorded a significant amount of deferred income taxes in 2017 attributable to our decision to establish a valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets, net of deferred tax liabilities, as well as the impact of the TCJA. Depreciation expense incurred is primarily due to depreciation of web development projects and our new corporate headquarters.\nThe $39.6 million of net cash provided by operating activities during the year ended December 31, 2016 was primarily from non-cash depreciation of $27.3 million, an increase in accrued expenses of $16.9 million, and consolidated net income of $11.2 million. These were offset by a decrease in accounts payable of $18.8 million. Depreciation expense incurred is primarily due to the depreciation of web development projects and our new corporate headquarters which was completed in Q3 2016. The change in accounts payable was primarily due to timing of payments to suppliers. In 2016, some holiday sales occurred earlier than in 2015 (including sales on Black Friday and Cyber Monday) which resulted in earlier payments to our suppliers resulting in lower operating cash flow than in 2015. Changes in accrued liabilities were also due to timing of invoice approval.\nCash flows from investing activities\nFor the year ended December 31, 2017, investing activities resulted in net cash outflows of $18.0 million, primarily from expenditures for fixed assets of $23.6 million, equity method investments of $3.0 million, and cost method investments of $2.2 million, offset by proceeds from sale of precious metals of $11.9 million.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2016, investing activities resulted in net cash outflows of $79.4 million, primarily from expenditures for fixed assets of $72.3 million, cost method investments of $4.8 million and disbursements for loans made of $3.7 million.\nCash flows from financing activities\nFor the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, financing activities resulted in net cash inflows of $73.4 million and $52.7 million, respectively.\nThe $73.4 million provided by financing activities during the year ended December 31, 2017 resulted primarily from $100.0 million of proceeds from exercise of a stock warrant, $40.0 million of proceeds from our PCL term loan, offset by $45.8 million of repayments on our U.S. Bank term loan, $15.3 million of repayments on lease finance obligations with U.S. Bank and $11.2 million of purchases of treasury stock.\nThe $52.7 million provided by financing activities during the year ended December 31, 2016 resulted primarily from $36.3 million of proceeds from our U.S. Bank term loan, $11.4 million of proceeds from lease finance obligations with U.S. Bank and $7.6 million of proceeds, net of offering costs, from our preferred stock offering in Q4 2016, partially offset by $1.9 million for payments on finance obligations.\nContractual Obligations and Commitments\nThe following table summarizes our contractual obligations as of December 31, 2017 and the effect such obligations and commitments are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flow in future periods (in thousands):\nTable 250: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Payments Due by Period\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Contractual Obligations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2020\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2021\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2022\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Thereafter\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Total\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>PCL term loan payments\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,200\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>41,052\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>44,252\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating leases\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6,962\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6,733\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,292\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,335\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,439\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>16,356\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>43,117\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Purchase obligations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5,487\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5,487\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Technology services\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,369\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,901\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,584\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,854\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total contractual cash obligations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>17,018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>49,686\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>5,876\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>4,335\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>4,439\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>16,356\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>97,710\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nPCL term loan payments\nWe are party to a financing agreement related to our corporate headquarters (see Borrowings below). The amounts presented reflect our related principal and interest payments.\nOperating leases\nFrom time to time we enter into operating leases for facilities and equipment for use in our operations.\nPurchase obligations\nThe amount of purchase obligations shown above is based on assumptions regarding the legal enforceability against us of inventory purchase orders we had outstanding at December 31, 2017. Under different assumptions regarding our rights to cancel our purchase orders or different assumptions regarding the enforceability of the purchase orders under applicable law, the amount of purchase obligations shown in the table above would be less.\nTechnology services\nFrom time to time we enter into long-term contractual agreements for technology services and capital leases for equipment included in such service agreements.\nTax contingencies\nWe are involved in various tax matters, the outcomes of which are uncertain. As of December 31, 2017 and 2016, tax contingencies were $1.7 million and $1.5 million, respectively, which are included in our reconciliation of unrecognized tax benefits (see Item 15 of Part IV, \"Financial Statements\"-Note 18. Income Taxes, contained in the \"Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\" of this Annual Report on Form 10-K). We expect the total amount of tax contingencies to increase in the future. In addition, changes in state, federal, and foreign tax laws may increase our tax contingencies. The timing of the resolution of income tax contingencies is highly uncertain, and the amounts ultimately paid, if any, upon resolution of issues raised by the taxing authorities may differ from the amounts accrued. It is reasonably possible that within the next 12 months we will receive additional assessments by various tax authorities. These assessments may or may not result in changes to our contingencies related to positions on prior years' tax filings.\nBorrowings\nPCL L.L.C. term loan agreement\nOn November 6, 2017, we entered into a loan agreement with PCL L.L.C., an entity directly or indirectly wholly owned by the mother and brother of our Chief Executive Officer, Dr. Patrick Byrne. The agreement provides for a $40.0 million term loan (the \"PCL Loan\") which carries an annual interest rate of 8.0% and a default rate of 18.0%. The PCL Loan is for a term of 18 months, subject to mandatory prepayment under certain circumstances, and is prepayable at our election at any time without penalty or premium. Interest only is due monthly.\nThe principal amount and any then unpaid interest will be due and payable on May 1, 2019 subject to mandatory prepayment in the event of a sale or encumbrance of the headquarters building or a change of ownership of Overstock or the occurrence of certain other events, including material changes to Overstock's business, the loss of management control of Overstock by Dr. Patrick Byrne and other events. The PCL Loan is secured by our corporate headquarters and the related land, fixtures and certain related personal property. We incurred insignificant debt issuance costs with the new loan agreement. The $40.0 million proceeds from this loan together with our cash resources were used to repay the remaining outstanding balances and terminate the U.S. Bank Term Loan, Revolving Loan, Master Lease Agreement, and associated derivative instruments.\nAt December 31, 2017, our outstanding balance on the PCL Loan was $40.0 million. Amounts outstanding under the Term Loan are presented net of discount and issuance costs in our consolidated balance sheets.\nU.S. Bank letters of credit\nAt December 31, 2017 and 2016, letters of credit totaling $355,000, were issued on our behalf collateralized by compensating cash balances held at U.S. Bank, which are included in Restricted cash in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.\nU.S. Bank commercial purchasing card agreement\nWe have a commercial purchasing card (the \"Purchasing Card\") agreement with U.S. Bank. We use the Purchasing Card for business purpose purchasing and must pay it in full each month. At December 31, 2017, $822,000 was outstanding and $4.2 million was available under the Purchasing Card. At December 31, 2016, $811,000 was outstanding and $4.2 million was available under the Purchasing Card.\nOther Factors that May Affect Future Results\nWe believe that our cash and cash equivalents currently on hand and expected cash flows from future operations will be sufficient to continue operations for at least the next twelve months. Any projections of future cash needs and cash flows are subject to substantial uncertainty. See Item 1A of Part I, \"Risk Factors.\"\nWe periodically evaluate opportunities to repurchase our equity securities, obtain credit facilities, or issue additional debt or equity securities. In addition, we may, from time to time, consider the investment in, or acquisition of, complementary businesses, products, services, or technologies, any of which might affect our liquidity requirements or cause us to issue additional debt or equity securities. There can be no assurance that financing arrangements will be available in amounts or on terms acceptable to us, if at all. Our future results may be significantly different from our historical results for several other reasons as well, including the possibility discussed in this Annual Report on Form 10-K that we may sell our retail business, which would have a dramatic effect on our future results. Other reasons that our future results may be significantly different from our historical results include the potential effects on us of the accounting and tax changes discussed in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, the security token offering being conducted by our majority-owned subsidiary tZERO, and other reasons described in Item 1. Business\u201d under Our Retail Business,\u201d Medici,\u201d and Potential Strategic Initiatives,\u201d as well as the risk factors described in Item 1A. Risk Factors.\u201d\nAny investment in our securities involves a high degree of risk. Investors should consider carefully the risks and uncertainties described in this Form 10-K, including the risks described in Item 1A of Part I, \"Risk Factors\", and all other information in this Form 10-K and in our other filings with the SEC including those we file after we file this Form 10-K, before deciding whether to purchase or hold our securities. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also become important factors that may harm our business. The occurrence of any of the risks described under \"Risk Factors\" in this report could harm our business. The trading price of our securities could decline due to any of these risks and uncertainties, and investors may lose part or all of their investment.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that would be material to investors.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nRegulation G, Conditions for Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures, and other SEC regulations regulate the disclosure of certain non-GAAP financial information.\nContribution and contribution margin\nContribution and contribution margin (non-GAAP financial measures - which we reconcile to \"Gross Profit\" in our consolidated statement of operations) consist of gross profit less sales and marketing expense plus Club O Rewards and gift card breakage and reflects an additional way of viewing our results. Contribution margin is contribution as a percentage of total net revenue. We believe contribution and contribution margin provide management and users of the financial statements information about our ability to cover our operating costs, such as technology and general and administrative expenses, while reflecting the selling costs we incurred to generate our revenues and adding back the reductions in revenue that we recognized for Club O Rewards that have subsequently expired and for gift cards whose redemption is remote. Contribution and contribution margin are used in addition to and in conjunction with results presented in accordance with GAAP and should not be relied upon to the exclusion of GAAP financial measures. The material limitation associated with the use of contribution is that it is an incomplete measure of profitability as it does not include all operating expenses or all non-operating income and expenses. Management compensates for these limitations when using this measure by looking at other GAAP measures, such as operating income and net income. You should review our financial statements and publicly-filed reports in their entirety and not rely on any single financial measure. For additional information regarding our segment reporting, see Item 15 of Part IV,\n\"Financial Statements\"-Note 21.

Business Segments, contained in the \"Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\" of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nFree cash flow\nFree cash flow (a non-GAAP financial measure) reflects an additional way of viewing our cash flows and liquidity that, when viewed with our GAAP results, provides a more complete understanding of factors and trends affecting our cash flows and liquidity. Free cash flow, which we reconcile below to \"Net cash provided by (used in) operating activities,\" the nearest GAAP financial measure, is net cash provided by operating activities reduced by \"Expenditures for fixed assets, including internal-use software and website development.\" We believe that net cash provided by operating activities is an important measure, since it includes both the cash impact of the continuing operations of the business and changes in the balance sheet that impact cash. We believe free cash flow is a useful measure to evaluate our business since purchases of fixed assets are a necessary component of ongoing operations and free cash flow measures the amount of cash we have available for mandatory debt service and financing obligations, changes in our capital structure, and future investments after purchases of fixed assets. Free cash flow measures have limitations as they omit certain components of the overall consolidated statement of cash flows and do not represent the residual cash flow available for discretionary expenditures. Free cash flow should not be considered a substitute for net income or cash flow data prepared in accordance with GAAP and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies. Therefore, we believe it is important to view free cash flow as a complement to our entire consolidated statements of cash flows as reconciled below (in thousands):\nTable 253: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Year ended\nDecember 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash provided by operating activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(35,321\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>39,564\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>54,516\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Expenditures for fixed assets, including internal-use software and website development\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(23,586\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(72,281\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(59,513\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Free cash flow\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(58,907\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(32,717\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(4,997\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n</table>", "item_7_truncated": "ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe following discussion and analysis contains forward-looking statement relating to future events or our future financial or operating performance that involve risks and uncertainties, as set forth above under \"Special Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements.\" Our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of certain factors described in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including those set forth above under \"Special Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\" or in Item 1A under the heading \"Risk Factors\" or elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. In addition, our future results may be significantly different from our historical results. The following discussion and analysis also should be read in conjunction with the disclosures in Item 1. Business\u201d under Our Retail Business,\u201d Medici,\u201d and Potential Strategic Initiatives,\u201d as well as the risk factors described in Item 1A. Risk Factors.\u201d\nIntroduction\nWe are an online retailer and advancer of blockchain technology. Through our online retail business, we offer a broad range of price-competitive products, including furniture, home decor, bedding and bath, housewares, jewelry and watches,\namong other products. We sell our products and services through our Internet websites located at www.overstock.com, www.o.co and www.o.biz (referred to collectively as the \"Website\"). Although our three websites are located at different domain addresses, the technology and equipment and processes supporting the Website and the process of order fulfillment described herein are the same for all three websites.\nIn late 2014, we began working on initiatives to develop and advance blockchain technology, which we refer to collectively as Medici. As part of our Medici initiatives, we have formed a wholly-owned subsidiary Medici Ventures, Inc. (\"Medici Ventures\") and acquired a majority interest in a financial technology company and two related registered broker dealers which are owned by our majority-owned subsidiary t\u00d8.com, Inc. (\"tZERO\"). Medici Ventures has also purchased interests in several blockchain technology companies. In 2015, we were the first public company to issue a private security using blockchain technology and in December 2016, as a demonstration of our technology, we issued publicly traded blockchain preferred shares of Overstock.com, Inc.\nWe have engaged Guggenheim Securities, LLC to help us identify and evaluate certain strategic initiatives. We are considering a range of potential transactions, including a sale of our e-commerce business and additional equity or debt financings. Our Board continually discusses a variety of potential strategic and financial options and other changes to our business, but has not made any determination to undertake any strategic transaction, and may not do so in the foreseeable future or at all. See Item 1 of Part I, \"Business-Potential Strategic Initiatives,\" and Item 1A, \"Risk Factors-Risks Relating to Our Current Review of Strategic Initiatives.\"\nOur company, based near Salt Lake City, Utah, was founded in 1997. We launched our initial website in March 1999 and were re-incorporated in Delaware in 2002. As used herein, \"Overstock,\" \"Overstock.com,\", \"O.co,\" \"we,\" \"our\" and similar terms include Overstock.com, Inc. and our majority-owned subsidiaries, unless the context indicates otherwise.\nOur Retail Business\nOur retail business constitutes the vast majority of our business and, through December 31, 2017, generated nearly all of our net revenues. In our retail business, our goal is to provide goods to furnish and accessorize \"dream homes\" for our target customers-consumers who seek quality, stylish merchandise at bargain prices. At December 31, 2017, we offered 2.8 million products (6.0 million SKUs), of which over 99% were in-line products (products in active production). At December 31, 2017, we were offering three private label brands - Porch & Den, Carson Carrington and OSleep - and had more than 1,000 private label products available on our Website and intend to add additional private label brands, including home products brands, using our strength in home products to help build our private label brands. We regularly change our product assortment to meet the evolving preferences of our customers and current trends. Our products include, among others, furniture, home d\u00e9cor including rugs, bedding and bath, home improvement and kitchen items, and, to a lesser extent, jewelry and watches. We compete primarily based on:\n \u2022 Quality customer experience with an emphasis on price, value, and a wide assortment of products delivered in a personalized format with the convenience of our mobile app, and with the benefits of our award-winning customer care; \n \u2022 Proprietary technologies which we believe help us provide our customers with a quality shopping experience; \n \u2022 Logistics capabilities tailored to the furniture and home goods category and developed over our many years of e-commerce experience; \n \u2022 Long-term mutually beneficial relationships with our partners, which currently number approximately 4,100; and \n \u2022 Our Club O Loyalty Program, which we believe increases customer engagement and retention. \nWe have organized our retail business (sales of product offered through the Shopping Section of our Website) into two principal segments - a \"direct\" business and a \"partner\" business. For 2017, approximately 95% of our net sales were from transactions in which we fulfilled orders from manufacturers, distributors and other suppliers (\"partners\") selling on our website, who we generally direct to ship goods sold from their own warehouses, while we generally handle returns and customer service (our \"partner\" business). The remaining 5% of our net sales came from direct sales of our own inventory shipped from our warehouse, including some customer returns of partner products (our \"direct\" business). We provide our partners with access to a large customer base and convenient services for order fulfillment, customer service, returns handling, and other services. Our team of customer service representatives assists customers by telephone, instant online chat and e-mail. We also derive revenue from other businesses advertising products or services on our Website. Our sales are primarily to customers located in the United States. During the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015 no single customer accounted for more than 1% of our total net revenue.\nRetail direct business\nOur retail direct business includes sales made to individual consumers and businesses from our owned inventory which are fulfilled primarily from our warehouse in Salt Lake City, Utah. Our warehouses primarily fulfill orders from our retail direct business. Our warehouses generally ship between 2,000 and 5,000 packages per day and up to approximately 6,000 packages per day during peak periods.\nRetail partner business\nIn our retail partner business, we sell merchandise from our partners primarily through our Website. We are the primary obligor for the majority of these sales transactions and we record revenue from the majority of these sales transactions on a gross basis. We generally have the ability to set pricing and source merchandise from our partners based on our discretion. Our use of the term \"partner\" does not mean that we have formed any legal partnerships with any of our partners. We currently have relationships with approximately 4,100 third parties who supply the vast majority of products on our Website. These partners generally perform the same fulfillment operations as our warehouses, such as order picking and shipping. We retain the right to re-direct and control the products during shipment and we handle returns and customer service related to substantially all orders placed through our Website. Revenue generated from sales on our Shopping site from both the direct and partner businesses is recorded net of returns, coupons and other discounts.\nBoth direct and partner revenues are seasonal, with revenues historically being the highest in the fourth quarter, which ends December 31, reflecting higher consumer holiday spending. We anticipate this will continue for the foreseeable future. To the extent possible we maintain supplier relationships, and seek new supplier relationships, for both our direct and partner businesses, and also use our working capital, to ensure a continuous allotment of product offerings for our customers. Because some (less than 1%) of our product offerings are closeout merchandise, some of our suppliers cannot supply products to us on a continuous basis.\nGenerally, we require authorization from credit card or other payment vendors whose services we offer to our customers (such as PayPal) or verification of receipt of payment, before we ship products to consumers or business purchasers. From time to time we grant credit to our business purchasers with normal credit terms (typically 30 days). For sales in our partner business, we generally receive payments from our customers before our payments to our suppliers are due.\nGrowth Strategies for Our E-Commerce Business\nWe believe that some of our direct competitors spend significantly higher percentages of their revenue on marketing than we do, and that we need to increase our branding and marketing expenditures in order to increase our market share in the e-commerce home goods market and educate consumers about our current position as an online retailer offering a wide assortment of quality home goods and other products at low prices and with a high level of customer service. We have developed and implemented marketing and branding initiatives to address this, and believe that additional marketing and branding efforts will have significant long-term positive results. However, a significant increase in our branding and marketing expenditures or other expenses would be likely to adversely affect our short-term results.\nWe also want to invest in additional distribution facilities to speed shipping and improve our customer service; in additional automation, technology and engineering resources because we believe they can improve our customers' shopping experience and increase our sales; in our Club O rewards program, primarily to increase member benefits and to develop additional personalization programs; and in expansion of our private label initiative because we believe that private label brands can generate significant brand equity and customer loyalty. However, our ability to pursue some or all of these plans, and the extent to which we would be able to pursue some or all of them, will depend on the resources we have available, and may require significantly more capital than we currently have. See \"Liquidity and Capital Resources.\"\nMedici Business Initiatives\nOur Medici business initiatives seek to leverage the security, transparency and immutability of cryptographically protected, distributed ledgers, such as blockchains, and are focused on solving important problems, including financial transaction issues, particularly in the area of securities settlement. Our wholly-owned subsidiary, Medici Ventures, conducts its primary business through its majority-owned subsidiary tZERO, which includes a financial technology company and two related registered broker dealers. Medici Ventures also holds interests in several technology companies whose focuses include commercial blockchain applications, digital currency solutions, compliance, identity, voting, and land.\nAs described further in Item 15 of Part IV, \"Financial Statements\"-Note 21. Business Segments, contained in the \"Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\" of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we determined our segments based on how\nwe manage our business, which, in our view, consists primarily of our Retail and Medici businesses. As described above, our Retail business consists of our Direct and Partner reportable segments. We use gross profit as the measure to determine our reportable segments because there is not discrete financial information available below gross profit for our Direct and Partner segments. As a result, our Medici business is not significant as compared to our Direct and Partner segments and is included in Other. Our Other segment consists of Medici.\nOther Offerings\nWe offer additional products or services that may complement our primary offerings, but are not significant to our revenues. These include:\n \u2022 Worldstock Fair Trade, a store within our Website that offers handcrafted products made by artisans all over the world to help improve the lives of people in emerging economies; \n \u2022 Supplier Oasis, a single integration point through which our partners can manage their products, inventory and sales channels, and also obtain multi-channel fulfillment services through our distribution network; \n \u2022 Our international business where we offer products to customers outside the United States using third party logistics providers; \n \u2022 Cars by Overstock, a portal within our Website where our customers can search millions of new, used and certified pre-owned cars from dealers and private parties - all in one place with convenient financing and warranty options; \n \u2022 FinanceHub, a portal within our Website where our customers can shop for loans, credit cards, and insurance, and can now also access links to automated financial advisory services and discounted stock brokerage services; and \n \u2022 Pet Adoptions, a free service and portal within our Website that leverages our technology to display pets available for adoption from shelters across the United States. \nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (\"GAAP\") requires estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. The Securities and Exchange Commission (\"SEC\") has defined a company's critical accounting policies as the ones that are most important to the portrayal of the company's financial condition and results of operations, and which require the company to make its most difficult and subjective judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates of matters that are inherently uncertain. Based on this definition, we have identified the critical accounting policies, estimates and judgments addressed below. We also have other key accounting policies, which involve the use of estimates, judgments, and assumptions that are significant to understanding our results. For additional information, see Item 15 of Part IV, \"Financial Statements\"-Note 2. Accounting Policies. Although we believe that our estimates, assumptions, and judgments are reasonable, they are based upon information presently available. Actual results may differ significantly from these estimates. Our critical accounting policies are as follows:\n \u2022 revenue recognition; \n \u2022 accounting for income taxes; and \n \u2022 accounting for intangible assets other than goodwill in business combination. \nRevenue recognition\nWe derive our revenue primarily from retail merchandise sales on our Website.\nRevenue is recognized when the following revenue recognition criteria are met: (1) persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists; (2) delivery has occurred or the service has been provided; (3) the selling price or fee revenue earned is fixed or determinable; and (4) collection of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured. Revenue related to merchandise sales is recognized upon delivery to our customers. As we ship high volumes of packages through multiple carriers, it is not practical for us to track the actual delivery date of each shipment. Therefore, we use estimates to determine which shipments are delivered and, therefore, recognized as revenue at the end of the period. Our delivery date estimates are based on average shipping transit times, which are calculated using the following factors: (i) the type of shipping carrier (as carriers have different in-transit times); (ii) the fulfillment source (either our warehouses, those warehouses we control, or those of our partners); (iii) the delivery destination; and (iv) actual transit time experience, which shows that delivery date is typically one to eight business days from the date of shipment. We review and update our estimates on a quarterly basis based on our actual transit time experience. However, actual shipping times may differ from our estimates.\nWe evaluate the criteria outlined in ASC Topic 605-45, Principal Agent Considerations, in determining whether it is appropriate to record the gross amount of product sales and related costs or the net amount earned as commissions. When we are the primary obligor in a transaction, are subject to inventory risk, have latitude in establishing prices and selecting suppliers, or have several but not all of these indicators, revenue is recorded gross. If we are not the primary obligor in the transaction and amounts earned are determined using a fixed percentage, revenue is recorded on a net basis. Currently, the majority of both direct revenue and partner revenue is recorded on a gross basis, as we are the primary obligor. We present revenue net of sales taxes. We periodically provide incentive offers to our customers to encourage purchases. Such offers include current discount offers, such as percentage discounts off current purchases and other similar offers, which, when used by customers, are treated as a reduction of revenue.\nThe following table shows the effect that hypothetical changes in the estimate of average shipping transit times would have had on the reported amount of revenue and income before taxes for the year ended December 31, 2017 (in thousands):\nTable 223: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended\nDecember 31, 2017\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Change in the Estimate of Average Transit Times (Days)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Increase (Decrease)\nRevenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Increase (Decrease)\nIncome Before Tax\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(10,986\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(1,164\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(7,540\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(796\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>As reported\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> As reported\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>As reported\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>5,918\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>635\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(2)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>10,874\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,160\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB), which sets accounting standards for U.S. public companies, has issued new standards relating to revenue recognition, which became effective on January 1, 2018, and which will apply to our interim financial statements for the quarter ending March 31, 2018. We are in the process of analyzing the new standards and their application to our processes, accounting, financial reporting presentation, disclosures, and controls. Under previous FASB standards, we recognized revenue from the majority of these sales transactions on a gross basis. We have not reached a definite conclusion, but we believe we will continue to recognize revenue from the majority of our retail business on a gross basis. If our adoption of the new standards requires us to recognize these revenues on a net basis, our future revenue will be substantially less than it was under the previous standards despite having no impact on gross profits. This could have a material adverse effect on the market price of our common stock.\nAccounting for income taxes\nWe are subject to taxation from federal, state and international jurisdictions. A significant amount of judgment is involved in preparing our provision for income taxes and the calculation of resulting deferred tax assets and liabilities.\nWe account for income taxes in accordance with ASC Topic 740, Income Taxes (\"ASC 740\"), which requires the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between tax and financial reporting. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the currently enacted tax rates that apply to taxable income in effect for the years in which those tax assets are expected to be realized or settled. The effect of a change in tax rates on deferred tax assets and liabilities is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date.\nTax laws and regulations themselves are subject to change as a result of changes in fiscal policy, changes in legislation, the evolution of regulations, and court rulings. On December 22, 2017, the President signed into law Public Law No. 115-97, commonly referred to as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (\"TCJA\"), following its passage by the United States Congress. The TCJA will make significant changes to U.S. federal income tax laws, mostly effective for tax years beginning after December 31, 2017. Among many other changes, the new law lowers the corporate tax rate from 35% to 21% for tax years beginning in 2018, transitions U.S international taxation from a worldwide tax system to a territorial system, and includes a one-time transition tax on the mandatory deemed repatriation of cumulative foreign earnings as of December 31, 2017. Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118 (\"SAB 118\") was issued to address the application of US GAAP in situations when a registrant does not have the necessary information available, prepared, or analyzed (including computations) in reasonable detail to complete the accounting for certain income tax effects of the TCJA. As of the date of this filing, we have not completed our accounting for the tax effects of the TCJA. In accordance with SAB 118, we have calculated our best estimate of the impact of the TCJA in our year end income tax provision in accordance with our understanding of the law and guidance available as of the date of this filing and as a result\nhave recorded $25.3 million as additional income tax expense in the fourth quarter of 2017. The amount related to the remeasurement of certain deferred tax assets and liabilities, based on the rates at which they are expected to reverse in the future, was $25.2 million. Although the tax rate reduction is known, our analysis may also be affected by other analyses related to the TCJA, including, but not limited to, our calculation of the mandatory deemed repatriation of cumulative foreign earnings and the state tax effect of adjustments made to federal temporary differences, which are uncertain at this time. The provisional amount related to the one-time transition tax on the mandatory deemed repatriation of cumulative foreign earnings was $41,000. The net charge is subject to revisions as we complete our analysis of the TCJA, collect and prepare necessary data, and interpret any additional guidance issued by the U.S. Treasury Department, Internal Revenue Service (\"IRS\"), FASB, and other standard-setting and regulatory bodies. Any subsequent adjustment to these amounts will be recorded to tax expense in the quarter when the analysis is complete. Our accounting for the tax effects of the TCJA will be completed during the measurement period, which should not extend beyond one year from the enactment date.\nThe TCJA includes a provision to tax global intangible low-taxed income (\"GILTI\") of foreign subsidiaries in excess of a deemed return on tangible assets of foreign corporations beginning in 2018. Under GAAP, we can make an accounting policy election to either treat taxes due on the GILTI inclusion as a current period expense, or factor such amounts into our measurement of deferred taxes. Due to the complexity of the new GILTI tax rules, we are continuing to evaluate this provision of the TCJA and the application of GAAP and we have not yet elected an accounting policy.\nWe assess available positive and negative evidence to estimate whether we will generate sufficient future taxable income to use our existing deferred tax assets. We have no carryback ability and do not expect significant future reversals of taxable temporary differences to recover our existing deferred tax assets, therefore we must rely on future taxable income, including tax planning strategies, to support their realizability. We have concluded based on all available evidence that it is more likely than not that our deferred tax assets as of December 31, 2017 will not be realized in the future. Therefore, it is appropriate to record a valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets, net of deferred tax liabilities related to assets with a definite reversal period. In reaching these conclusions we considered, among other things, three significant pieces of negative evidence that occurred during the quarter ended December 31, 2017. First, a significant piece of objective negative evidence evaluated was the cumulative loss incurred over the three-year period ended December 31, 2017. We expect the trends that contributed to the loss to continue. Such objective evidence limits the ability to consider other subjective evidence, such as projections for future taxable income, if any. Second, during the quarter ended December 31, 2017, forecasts for future years were significantly revised. We are projecting significant pretax operating losses over the next several years and it is uncertain when we will return to profitability. While forecasts of future years are a more subjective piece of evidence, these forecasted losses in the near-term are further negative evidence that we will not have sufficient future taxable income to use our existing deferred tax assets. Third, we have certain tax planning strategies that we intended to implement to accelerate taxable income into earlier periods in order to utilize loss carryforwards and tax credits prior to expiration. While these tax planning strategies previously would have been sufficient to utilize most of our deferred tax assets in periods of low pretax income, these tax planning strategies will not be sufficient to utilize deferred tax assets in periods where we generate significant pretax losses, such as our current year operating results or our newly revised projections for future years. Additionally, one of our tax planning strategies was significantly impacted and reduced in application due to the TCJA, enacted on December 22, 2017. Therefore, we no longer have prudent and feasible tax planning strategies to support the realizability of deferred tax assets. We intend to continue maintaining a valuation allowance on our net deferred tax assets until there is sufficient evidence to support the reversal of all or some portion of these allowances. The amount of the deferred tax asset considered realizable could be adjusted if objective negative evidence in the form of cumulative losses is no longer present and additional weight may be given to subjective evidence such as long-term projections for growth.\nASC 740 clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprise's financial statements in accordance with GAAP. ASC 740 prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. This statement also provides guidance on de-recognition, classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods, and disclosure.\nThe calculation of our tax liabilities is subject to legal and factual interpretation, judgment, and uncertainty in a multitude of jurisdictions. This includes addressing uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations. We recognize liabilities for uncertain tax positions in the U.S. and other tax jurisdictions based on recognition and measurement criteria prescribed by ASC 740. We record an amount as an estimate of probable additional income tax liability at the largest amount that we determine is more likely than not, based upon the technical merits of the position, to be sustained upon audit by the relevant tax authority. The liabilities are periodically reviewed for their adequacy and appropriateness. Changes to our assumptions could cause us to find a revision of estimates appropriate. Such a change in measurement would result in the recognition of a tax benefit or an additional charge to the tax provision.\nWe are currently under audit in Ireland for the 2016 tax year. The IRS concluded an audit of our 2015 federal income tax return in 2017 with no changes to the return. Tax periods within the statutory period of limitations not previously audited are potentially open for examination by the tax authorities. Potential liabilities associated with these years will be resolved when an event occurs to warrant closure, primarily through the completion of audits by the tax jurisdictions and/or the expiration of the statutes of limitation. To the extent audits or other events result in a material adjustment to the accrued estimates, the effect would be recognized during the period of the event. We believe that an appropriate estimated liability has been established for potential exposures.\nOur uncertain tax positions related to state income taxes represent a cash settlement contingency and are recorded as a liability in our consolidated balance sheets. To the extent interest and penalties would be assessed by taxing authorities on any underpayment of income taxes, such amounts are accrued and classified as a component of income tax expense on our consolidated statements of income and comprehensive income. Realization of the unrecognized tax benefits results in a favorable impact to the effective tax rate.\nAccounting for intangible assets other than goodwill in business combination\nIntangible assets other than goodwill acquired as part of a business combination are capitalized at their acquisition-date fair value. We amortize intangible assets other than goodwill over their estimated useful lives unless such lives are indefinite. Intangible assets other than goodwill are amortized using the straight-line method of amortization over their useful lives, with the exception of certain intangibles (such as acquired technology, customer relationships, and trade names) which are amortized using an accelerated method of amortization based on cash flows. These assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying amount may not be recoverable.\nThe following table details the identifiable intangible assets acquired at their fair value and remaining useful lives as of December 31, 2017 (amounts in thousands):\nTable 224: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Intangible Assets\n</td> <td>Fair Value\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Weighted Average Useful Life (years)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Technology and developed software\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>13,600\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.92\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Customer relationships\n</td> <td>1,900\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Trade names\n</td> <td>300\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5.93\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other\n</td> <td>200\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total acquired intangible assets as of the acquisition date\n</td> <td>16,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Less: accumulated amortization of acquired intangible assets\n</td> <td>(9,228\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total acquired intangible assets, net\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>6,772\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nRecently issued accounting standards\nFor information about recent accounting pronouncements, see Item 15 of Part IV, \"Financial Statements\"-Note 2. Accounting Policies.\nPreliminary Estimates for the Quarter ending March 31, 2018\nWe have determined to switch to a growth strategy in our ecommerce business, which we believe will lead to higher revenue growth, but also incur significant losses in the process. In pursuit of this growth strategy, in Q1 2018 we have increased our sales and marketing expenditures substantially to increase revenue growth and to test new marketing initiatives. Largely as a result of this new strategy, we expect to incur a total pre-tax loss of approximately $50 million in Q1 2018 ($35 million ecommerce, $15 million Medici).\nOur estimated results for the quarter ended March 31, 2018 are preliminary and subject to substantial uncertainty and numerous risks including those outlined in Item 1A of Part I, \"Risk Factors\". We caution you that our estimates are forward-looking statements and are not guarantees of future performance or outcomes and that actual results may differ materially.\nComparison of Years Ended December 31, 2017 and 2016\nExecutive Commentary\nThis executive commentary is intended to provide investors with a view of our business through the eyes of our management. As an executive commentary, it necessarily focuses on selected aspects of our business. This executive commentary is intended as a supplement to, but not a substitute for, the more detailed discussion of our business included elsewhere herein. Investors are cautioned to read our entire \"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,\" as well as our interim and audited financial statements, and the discussion of our business and risk factors and other information included elsewhere or incorporated in this report. This executive commentary includes forward-looking statements, and investors are cautioned to read \"Special Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements.\"\nOur $111.9 million consolidated net loss in 2017 was the result primarily of our $46.6 million operating loss in 2017 and our $64.2 million income tax expense in 2017. The operating loss was caused primarily by changes that Google made in its natural search engine algorithms and an increasingly competitive digital marketing landscape. The income tax expense included $25.3 million of expense caused by the enactment in late December 2017 of the TCJA and $59.0 million of expense caused by our establishment of a valuation allowance against our net deferred tax assets at December 31, 2017. These matters are discussed in more detail below.\nRevenues in 2017 decreased 3% compared to 2016. Beginning in mid-2017 and continuing in the fourth quarter of 2017, we experienced difficulties which we believe were due in part to changes that Google, Inc. (\"Google\") has made in its natural search engine algorithms. It has taken us longer to analyze and to seek to adapt to the 2017 algorithm adjustments than it took us to respond to Google's changes in previous years. We have reorganized a large number of resources around addressing this challenge, as well as seeking to prevent it from occurring again. We have implemented a variety of innovations and technical improvements in this area and expect to continue to do so. However, we cannot offer any assurance that we will be able to fully adapt to the 2017 algorithm adjustments or will be able to rely in the future on natural search results as we have in the past. This decrease to revenue was partially offset by efforts to increase revenue in other marketing channels such as sponsored search and email.\nGross profit in 2017 increased 3% compared to 2016 primarily as a result of increased gross margin. Gross margin increased to 19.5% in 2017 compared to 18.4% in 2016. The increase in gross margin was primarily due to a continued shift in sales mix into higher margin home and garden products and an increase in marketplace sales (which we recognize on a net basis), partially offset by increased promotional activities, including coupons and site sales due to our driving a higher proportion of our sales using such promotions.\nSales and marketing expenses as a percentage of revenue increased from 8.2% to 10.4% in 2017 as compared to 2016, primarily due to increased spending in the sponsored search and display ads on social media marketing channels, due in part to our seeking to increase revenue in these channels to partially offset the effects of the Google algorithm changes described above.\nWhile we work to adapt to Google's changes, we have increased our emphasis on other marketing channels, such as sponsored search, which has generated revenue growth but with higher associated marketing expenses than natural search. We expect this trend to continue while we work to adapt to these changes.\nWe are also experiencing an increasingly competitive digital marketing landscape. We have competitors who are spending significant amounts on advertising bidding up the cost of certain marketing channels, such as paid keywords. While we may not choose to match their levels of spending, this has increased our marketing costs in recent quarters. We expect this trend to continue. However, we do have a number of important digital marketing initiatives that we are testing and implementing that we believe will improve our competitive position in this area.\nAs a result of these factors, our contribution decreased 19% in 2017 compared to 2016 (see Non-GAAP Financial Measures below for a reconciliation of Contribution to Gross Profit). Contribution margin was 9.3% in 2017 compared to 11.1% in 2016.\nWe believe that to build market share in the e-commerce home goods market, we will need to significantly increase our marketing and branding expenditures, which we expect would lead to increased revenues but also lead to future net losses in the near-term.\nTechnology expenses in 2017 increased $9.1 million compared to 2016 primarily due to an increase in staff related costs of $4.9 million, and an increase in technology licenses and maintenance costs of $4.0 million.\nGeneral and administrative expenses in 2017 increased $1.4 million compared to 2016, primarily due to an increase in staff related costs of $4.9 million, partially offset by a decrease in legal fees of $3.0 million, and a decrease in bad debt expense of $1.1 million.\nOur provision for income taxes totaled $64.2 million and $9.3 million for 2017 and 2016, respectively. The increase in 2017 expense compared to 2016 is primarily attributable to our decision to establish a valuation allowance against our net deferred tax assets, as well as the impact of the TCJA. On December 22, 2017, the President signed into law the TCJA. Among many other changes, the new law lowers the corporate tax rate from 35% to 21% for tax years beginning in 2018. Therefore, we re-valued our deferred tax assets in 2017 due to the federal rate reduction, which resulted in an increase in our 2017 income tax expense of $25.3 million. Additionally, each quarter we assess available positive and negative evidence to estimate whether we will generate sufficient future taxable income to use our existing deferred tax assets. Due to losses incurred in 2017 and the potential for future losses, we have recorded a valuation allowance on our deferred tax assets, net of deferred tax liabilities, which further increased our 2017 income tax expense by $59.0 million.\nWe continue to seek opportunities for growth, in our retail business and through our Medici blockchain and financial technology initiatives and through other means. As a result of these initiatives, we will continue to incur additional expenses and may purchase interests in, or make acquisitions of, other technologies or businesses. We anticipate that our initiatives may cause us to incur losses in the foreseeable future. These losses, additional expenses, acquisitions or purchases may be material, and, coupled with existing marketing expense trends, our plans to increase our marketing and branding expenditures, and strategic changes in our retail business, may lead to increased consolidated losses in some periods, and to reduced liquidity. Additionally, we may recognize additional impairment charges from our ownership interest in other entities.\nThe balance of our Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations provides further information about the matters discussed above and other important matters affecting our business.\nResults of Operations\nThe following table sets forth our results of

In addition, we had an increase in product sales for which we record only our commission as revenue, and an increase in promotional activities, including coupons and site sales due to our driving a higher proportion of our sales using such promotions.\nThe decrease in direct revenue for the year ended December 31, 2017, as compared to the same period in 2016, was due in part to the changes that Google has made in its natural search engine algorithms. The decrease to revenue can also be explained by a decrease in sales of direct home and garden, clothing, and jewelry products, and increased promotional activities, including coupons and site sales due to our driving a higher proportion of our sales using such promotions. These were partially offset by\ndeferring a lower number of orders taken but not delivered due to decreased direct revenue, and a decrease in Club O Rewards earned due to discontinuing rewards on the Club O Silver program in Q4 2016.\nThe decrease in partner revenue for the year ended December 31, 2017, as compared to the same period in 2016, was due in part to the changes that Google has made in its natural search engine algorithms. The decrease to revenue can also be explained by an increase in product sales for which we record only our commission as revenue, and an increase in promotional activities, including coupons and site sales due to our driving a higher proportion of our sales using such promotions. We also had a decrease in sales in categories on which we placed a reduced emphasis, which was partially offset by an increase in sales of home and garden products which we have emphasized.\nWe continue to seek increased participation in our Club O loyalty program, including, in certain instances, by increasing Club O Rewards to our Club O members in lieu of coupons we offer to all customers. For additional information regarding our Club O loyalty program see Item 15 of Part IV, \"Financial Statements\"-Note 2. Accounting Policies, Club O loyalty program.\nThe shift of business from direct to partner (or vice versa) is an economic result based on the economics of each particular product offering at the time and we generally do not have particular goals for an \"appropriate\" mix or percentage for the size of either. Although we have experienced a trend from direct revenue to partner revenue in recent years, we believe that the mix of the business between direct and partner remains consistent with our strategic objectives for our business model in the current economic environment and we do not currently foresee any material shifts in this trend.\nThe products and product lines we offer, and their respective percentages of our revenue, are based on many factors including customer demand, our marketing efforts, promotional pricing, joint-marketing offered by our suppliers, the types of inventory we are able to obtain and the number of SKUs we offer. These factors change frequently and can affect the mix of the product lines we sell. We have experienced a trend toward our home and garden category in recent years and we have recently focused our marketing and branding efforts towards our home and garden product line. We are also working to increase the number of SKUs we offer. While we do not currently expect any material shifts in our product line mix, the relative amounts of the product lines we sell, and the revenue we earn from those product lines, is generally an economic result of the factors described above, which may change from time to time.\nInternational sales were less than 3% of total net revenues for 2017 and 2016.\nGross profit and gross margin\nOur overall gross margins fluctuate based on our sales volume mix between our direct business and partner business; changes in supplier cost and / or sales price, including competitive pricing; inventory management decisions within the direct business; sales coupons and promotions; product mix of sales; and operational and fulfillment costs.\nThe following table reflects our net revenues, cost of

margin. Gross margin increased to 19.5% for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to 18.4% for the same period in 2016. This increase in gross margin was primarily due to a continued shift in sales mix into higher margin home and garden products and an increase in marketplace sales (which we recognize on a net basis), partially offset by increased promotional activities, including coupons and site sales due to our driving a higher proportion of our sales using such promotions.\nThe 225 basis point decrease in direct gross margin for the year ended December 31, 2017, as compared to the same period in 2016, was primarily due to increased promotional activities, including coupons and site sales due to our driving a higher proportion of our sales using such promotions, and increased freight costs primarily in the fourth quarter, partially offset by a shift in sales mix into higher margin home and garden products.\nThe 115 basis point increase in partner gross margin for the year ended December 31, 2017, as compared to the same period in 2016 was primarily due to a continued shift in sales mix into higher margin home and garden products, partially offset by increased promotional activities, including coupons and site sales due to our driving a higher proportion of our sales using such promotions.\nCost of goods sold includes stock-based compensation expense of $183,000 and $266,000 for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.\nFulfillment costs\nFulfillment costs include all warehousing costs, including fixed overhead and variable handling costs (excluding packaging costs), as well as credit card fees and customer service costs, all of which we include as costs in calculating gross margin. We believe that some companies in our industry, including some of our competitors, account for fulfillment costs within operating expenses, and therefore exclude fulfillment costs from gross margin. As a result, our gross margin may not be directly comparable to others in our industry.\nThe following table has been included to provide investors additional information regarding our classification of fulfillment costs, gross profit and margin, thus enabling investors to better compare our gross margin with others in our industry (in thousands): Table 230: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Year ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total revenue, net\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,744,756\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>100%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,799,963\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>100%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cost of goods sold\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Product costs and other cost of goods sold\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,328,749\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>76.2%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,391,736\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>77.3%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Fulfillment and related costs\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>75,456\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.3%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>76,878\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.3%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total cost of goods sold\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,404,205\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>80.5%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,468,614\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>81.6%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gross profit\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>340,551\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>19.5%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>331,349\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>18.4%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nFulfillment costs as a percentage of sales may vary due to several factors, such as our ability to manage costs at our warehouses, significant changes in the number of units received and fulfilled, the extent to which we use third party fulfillment services and warehouses, and our ability to effectively manage customer service costs and credit card fees. Fulfillment and related costs remained relatively flat during the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to 2016.\nSee Gross profit and gross margin above for additional discussion.\nOperating expenses\nSales and marketing expenses\nWe use a variety of methods to target our consumer audience, including online campaigns, such as advertising through keywords, product listing ads, display ads, search engines, affiliate marketing programs, social coupon websites, portals, banners, e-mail, direct mail and viral and social media campaigns. We also do brand advertising through television, radio, print ads, and event sponsorships.\nThe following table reflects our sales and marketing expenses for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 (in thousands):\nTable 231: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Year ended\nDecember 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$ Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>% Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Sales and marketing expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>180,589\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>147,896\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>32,693\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>22.1\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Sales and marketing expenses as a percent of net revenues\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10.4\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8.2\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe 220 basis point increase in sales and marketing expenses as a percentage of revenue for the year ended December 31, 2017, as compared to the same period in 2016, was primarily due to increased spending in sponsored search and display ads on social media, and television marketing channels, and increased staff related costs.\nWhile we work to adapt to Google's changes in its natural search engine algorithms as noted above, we have increased our emphasis on other marketing channels, such as sponsored search, which has generated revenue growth but with higher associated marketing expenses than natural search. We expect this trend to continue while we work to adapt to these changes.\nWe are also experiencing an increasingly competitive digital marketing landscape. We have competitors who are spending significant amounts on advertising bidding up the cost of certain marketing channels, such as paid keywords. While we may not choose to match their levels of spending, this has increased our marketing costs in recent quarters. We expect this trend to continue. However, we do have a number of important digital marketing initiatives that we are testing and implementing that we believe will improve our competitive position in this area.\nSales and marketing expenses include stock-based compensation expense of $415,000 and $249,000 for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.\nWe do not include costs associated with our discounted shipping and other promotions, such as coupons in sales and marketing expense. Rather, we account for them as a reduction of revenue and therefore affect sales and gross margin. We consider discounted shipping and other promotions, such as our policy of free shipping on orders over $45, as an effective marketing tool, and intend to continue to offer them as we deem appropriate as part of our overall marketing plan.\nTechnology expenses\nWe seek to invest efficiently in technology, including web services, customer support solutions, website search, expansion of new and existing product categories, and in technology to enhance the customer experience, improve our process efficiency and support and expand our logistics infrastructure. We may increase our technology expenses to support these initiatives and these increases may be material.\nThe frequency and variety of cyber-attacks on our Website, our corporate systems, and on third parties we use to support our technology continue to increase. The impact of these attacks, their costs, and the costs we incur to protect ourselves against future attacks have not been material. However, we consider the threat from cyber-attacks to be serious and will continue to incur costs related to protecting ourselves against them.\nThe following table reflects our technology expenses for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 (in thousands):\nTable 232: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Year ended\nDecember 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$ Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>% Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Technology expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>115,878\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>106,760\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>9,118\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8.5\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Technology expenses as a percent of net revenues\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6.6\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5.9\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe $9.1 million increase in technology costs for the year ended December 31, 2017, as compared to the same period in 2016, was primarily due to an increase in staff related costs of $4.9 million, and an increase in technology licenses and maintenance of $4.0 million.\nTechnology expenses include stock-based compensation expense of $649,000 and $777,000 for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.\nGeneral and administrative expenses\nThe following table reflects our general and administrative expenses (\"G&A\") for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 (in thousands):\nTable 233: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Year ended\nDecember 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$ Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>% Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>General and administrative expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>90,718\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>89,298\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,420\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.6\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>General and administrative expenses as a percent of net revenues\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5.2\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe $1.4 million increase in general and administrative expenses (\"G&A\") for the year ended December 31, 2017, as compared to the same period in 2016, was primarily due to an increase in staff related costs of $4.9 million, partially offset by a decrease in legal fees of $3.0 million, and a decrease in bad debt expense of $1.1 million.\nG&A expenses include stock-based compensation expense of approximately $2.8 million and $3.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.\nWe continue to seek opportunities for growth, in our retail business and through our Medici blockchain and financial technology initiatives and through other means. As a result of these initiatives, we will continue to incur additional expenses and may purchase interests in, or make acquisitions of, other technologies or businesses. We anticipate that our initiatives may cause us to incur losses in the foreseeable future. These losses, additional expenses, acquisitions or purchases may be material, and, coupled with existing marketing expense trends, our plans to increase our marketing and branding expenditures, and strategic changes in our retail business, may lead to increased consolidated losses in some periods, and to reduced liquidity. Additionally, we may recognize additional impairment charges from our ownership interest in other entities.\nLitigation settlement\nIn Q1 2016, we entered into a settlement agreement in our prime broker litigation which concluded the litigation in its entirety and we recognized settlement proceeds of $19.5 million. Related costs associated with the litigation and settlement of approximately $1.0 million were included in G&A expenses during Q1 2016.\nDepreciation and amortization expense\nDepreciation expense is classified within the corresponding operating expense categories in the consolidated statements of operations as follows (in thousands):\nTable 234: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Year ended\nDecember 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cost of goods sold - direct\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>307\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>310\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Technology\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>24,604\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>25,693\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Sales and marketing\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>124\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>General and administrative\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,937\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,156\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total depreciation, including internal-use software and website development\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>28,848\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>27,283\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nAmortization of intangible assets other than goodwill is classified within the corresponding operating expense categories in the consolidated statements of operations as follows (in thousands):\nTable 235: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Year ended\nDecember 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Technology\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,620\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,904\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Sales and marketing\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>83\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,008\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>General and administrative\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>296\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>56\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total amortization\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,999\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,968\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nNon-operating income (expense)\nInterest expense\nTotal interest expense increased $2.1 million, from $877,000 for the year ended December 31, 2016 to $2.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. The increase in interest expense is primarily due to no longer capitalizing interest on our headquarters loan due to construction completion.\nOther income, net\nOther income, net for the year ended December 31, 2017 was $1.2 million as compared to $14.2 million in 2016. The decrease is primarily due to a decrease in Club O Rewards breakage of $14.2 million due to discontinuing our Club O Silver rewards program in Q4 2016, an increase in impairment charges of $2.6 million related to cost method investments, and an increase in debt extinguishment costs of $2.5 million. These decreases were partially offset by an increase in realized gains on sales of cryptocurrencies and precious metals of $6.6 million.\nIncome taxes\nOur effective tax rate for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 was (134.5)% and 45.3%, respectively. Our effective tax rate is affected by recurring items such as research tax credits and non-recurring items such as changes in valuation allowances. It is also affected to a lesser extent by tax rates in foreign jurisdictions and the relative amount of income we earn in those jurisdictions, which we expect to be fairly consistent in the near term. The decrease in the 2017 effective tax rate relative to the 2016 effective tax rate is primarily attributable to our decision to establish a valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets, net of deferred tax liabilities, as well as the impact of the TCJA. In our decision to establish a valuation allowance, we concluded that the negative evidence outweighed the positive evidence and that it was not more likely than not that all our federal and state deferred tax assets will be realized (see Item 15 of Part IV, \"Financial Statements\"-Note 18. Income Taxes, contained in the \"Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\" of this Annual Report on Form 10-K).\nWe have indefinitely reinvested foreign earnings of $1.3 million at December 31, 2017. The TCJA includes a mandatory deemed repatriation of cumulative foreign earnings for the year ended December 31, 2017, for which we accrued provisional tax expense. However, we would still need to accrue and pay various other taxes on this amount if repatriated. We are currently analyzing our global working capital and cash requirements and the potential tax liabilities attributable to a\nrepatriation, including calculating any excess of the amount for financial reporting over the tax basis in our foreign subsidiaries, but we have yet to determine whether we plan to change our prior assertion and repatriate earnings. Accordingly, we have not recorded any deferred taxes attributable to our investments in our foreign subsidiaries. We will record the tax effects of any change in our prior assertion in the period that we complete our analysis and are able to make a reasonable estimate, and disclose any unrecognized deferred tax liability for temporary differences related to our foreign investments, if practicable, in the period that we are first able to make a reasonable estimate, no later than December 2018.\nSeasonality\nBased upon our historical experience, revenue typically increases during the fourth quarter because of the holiday retail season and gross margin decreases due to increased sales of certain lower margin products, such as electronics. Revenue typically decreases in the following quarter(s), as shown in the table below. The actual quarterly results for each quarter could differ materially depending upon consumer preferences, availability of product and competition, among other risks and uncertainties. Accordingly, there can be no assurances that seasonal variations will not materially affect our results of operations in the future.\nThe following table reflects our total net revenues for each of the quarters in 2017, 2016 and 2015 (in thousands):\nTable 236: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>First\nQuarter\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Second\nQuarter\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Third\nQuarter\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Fourth\nQuarter\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>432,435\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>432,024\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>424,007\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>456,290\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>413,677\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>418,540\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>441,564\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>526,182\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>398,344\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>388,013\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>391,211\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>480,270\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nComparison of Years Ended December 31, 2016 and 2015\nExecutive Commentary\nThis executive commentary is intended to provide investors with a view of our business through the eyes of our management. As an executive commentary, it necessarily focuses on selected aspects of our business. This executive commentary is intended as a supplement to, but not a substitute for, the more detailed discussion of our business included elsewhere herein. Investors are cautioned to read our entire \"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,\" as well as our interim and audited financial statements, and the discussion of our business and risk factors and other information included elsewhere or incorporated in this report. This executive commentary includes forward-looking statements, and investors are cautioned to read \"Special Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements.\"\nRevenues in 2016 increased 9% compared to 2015. The growth in revenue was primarily due to a 6% increase in average order size, coupled with a 4% increase in orders. These increases were partially offset by increased promotional activities, including coupons and site sales (which we recognize as a reduction of revenue) due to our driving a higher proportion of our sales using such promotions. Our average order size has increased in recent years due primarily to a sales mix shift into home and garden products. We are uncertain how long this trend will continue.\nGross profit in 2016 increased 9% compared to 2015 primarily as a result of revenue growth. Gross margin was flat at 18.4% in 2016 compared to 2015. Gross margin increased due to a continued shift in sales mix into higher margin home and garden products, but that increase was offset by increased promotional activities.\nSales and marketing expenses as a percentage of revenue increased from 7.5% to 8.2% during 2016 as compared to 2015, primarily due to increased spending in the sponsored search marketing channels and increased staff related costs.\nAs a result of these factors, our Contribution increased 8% in 2016 compared to 2015 (see Non-GAAP Financial Measures below for a reconciliation of Contribution to Gross Profit). Contribution margin was 11.1% in 2016 compared to 11.2% in 2015.\nTechnology expenses in 2016 increased $8.2 million compared to 2015, primarily due to an increase in depreciation of $5.9 million, an increase in staff-related costs of $2.5 million, and an increase of $1.6 million in technology licenses and maintenance. These increases were partially offset by a $1.3 million decrease in outside consulting services.\nGeneral and administrative expenses in 2016 increased $7.1 million compared to 2015, primarily due to an increase of $7.6 million in staff related costs and $1.1 million in bad debt expense for accounts receivable due from a marketplace in which we also have a minority interest. These increases were partially offset by a $1.9 million decrease in legal fees and a $1.3 million decrease in consulting and outside services.\nDuring Q3 2016, we recognized an impairment charge of $2.9 million in Other income, net related to an international marketplace company in which we hold a minority interest that has historically been recorded at cost.\nIn Q1 2016, we entered into a settlement agreement in our prime broker litigation which concluded the litigation in its entirety and we recognized settlement proceeds of $19.5 million. Related costs associated with the litigation and settlement of approximately $1.0 million were included in G&A expenses during Q1 2016.\nIn December 2016, as a demonstration of the platform and technology developed by our majority-owned subsidiary t\u00d8.com, Inc., we issued publicly traded preferred shares of Overstock.com, Inc. for proceeds of $7.6 million, net of offering costs. Additionally, as part of our Medici initiatives to develop this technology, in Q1 2016, we completed the acquisition of two registered broker-dealers. In 2015 we acquired a related financial technology company.\nThe balance of our Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations provides further information about the matters discussed above and other important matters affecting our business.\nResults of Operations\nThe following table sets forth our results of operations expressed as a percentage of total net

for the year ended December 31, 2016, as compared to the same period in 2015, was a 6% increase in average order size, coupled with a 4% increase in orders. These increases were partially offset by increased promotional activities, including coupons and site sales (which we recognize as a reduction of revenue) due to our driving a higher proportion of our sales using such promotions. Our average order size has increased in recent years due primarily to a sales mix shift into home and garden products. We are uncertain how long this trend will continue.\nThe primary reason for decreased direct revenue for the year ended December 31, 2016, as compared to the same period in 2015, was a decrease in sales of home and garden products (primarily due to a shift from our direct segment to our partner segment) in addition to increased promotional activities, including coupons and site sales (which we recognize as a reduction of\nrevenue) due to our driving a higher proportion of our sales using such promotions. Also, the percentage of revenue we defer from orders taken but not delivered was higher due to the timing of year end.\nThe increase in partner revenue for the year ended December 31, 2016, as compared to the same period in 2015, was primarily due to an increase in sales of home and garden products. This increase was partially offset by increased promotional activities, including coupons and site sales (which we recognize as a reduction of revenue) due to our driving a higher proportion of our sales using such promotions.\nSince mid-2015 through the first half of 2016, we experienced some slowing of our overall revenue growth, which we believe was due in part to changes that Google made in its natural search engine algorithms. While we worked to adapt to Google's changes, we increased our emphasis on other marketing channels, such as sponsored search, which generated revenue growth but with higher associated marketing expenses than natural search.\nWe continue to seek increased participation in our Club O loyalty program, including, in certain instances, by increasing Club O Rewards to our Club O members in lieu of coupons we offer to all customers. For additional information regarding our Club O loyalty program see Item 15 of Part IV, \"Financial Statements\"-Note 2. Accounting Policies, Club O loyalty program.\nThe shift of business from direct to partner (or vice versa) is an economic result based on the economics of each particular product offering at the time and we generally do not have particular goals for an \"appropriate\" mix or percentage for the size of either. Although we have experienced a trend from direct revenue to partner revenue in recent years, we believe that the mix of the business between direct and partner remains consistent with our strategic objectives for our business model in the current economic environment and we do not currently foresee any material shifts in this trend.\nThe products and product lines we offer, and their respective percentages of our revenue, are based on many factors including customer demand, our marketing efforts, promotional pricing, joint-marketing offered by our suppliers, the types of inventory we are able to obtain and the number of SKUs we offer. These factors change frequently and can affect the mix of the product lines we sell. We have experienced a trend toward our home and garden category in recent years and we have recently focused our marketing and branding efforts towards our home and garden product line. We are also working to increase the number of SKUs we offer. While we do not currently expect any material shifts in our product line mix, the relative amounts of the product lines we sell, and the revenue we earn from those product lines, is generally an economic result of the factors described above, which may change from time to time.\nInternational sales were less than 2% of total net revenues for 2016 and 2015.\nGross profit and gross margin\nOur overall gross margins fluctuate based on our sales volume mix between our direct business and partner business; changes in supplier cost and / or sales price, including competitive pricing; inventory management decisions within the direct business; sales coupons and promotions; product mix of sales; and operational and fulfillment costs.\nThe following table reflects our net revenues, cost of

Gross margin increased due to a continued shift in sales mix into higher margin home and garden products, but that increase was offset by increased promotional activities, including coupons and site sales (which we recognize as a reduction of revenue) due to our driving a higher proportion of our sales using such promotions.\nThe 182 basis point decrease in direct gross margin for the year ended December 31, 2016, as compared to the same period in 2015, was primarily due to increased promotional activities, including coupons and site sales (which we recognize as a reduction of revenue) due to our driving a higher proportion of our sales using such promotions, and increased warehousing costs as a percentage of revenue due to lower revenue, partially offset by a shift in sales mix into higher margin products.\nThe 21 basis point decrease in partner gross margin for the year ended December 31, 2016, as compared to the same period in 2015 was primarily due to increased promotional activities, including coupons and site sales (which we recognize as a reduction of revenue) due to our driving a higher proportion of our sales using such promotions, partially offset by a continued shift in sales mix into higher margin home and garden products.\nCost of goods sold includes stock-based compensation expense of $266,000 and $179,000 for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively.\nFulfillment costs\nFulfillment costs include all warehousing costs, including fixed overhead and variable handling costs (excluding packaging costs), as well as credit card fees and customer service costs, all of which we include as costs in calculating gross margin. We believe that some companies in our industry, including some of our competitors, account for fulfillment costs within operating expenses, and therefore exclude fulfillment costs from gross margin. As a result, our gross margin may not be directly comparable to others in our industry.\nThe following table has been included to provide investors additional information regarding our classification of fulfillment costs, gross profit and margin, thus enabling investors to better compare our gross margin with others in our industry (in thousands): Table 242: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Year ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total revenue, net\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,799,963\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>100%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,657,838\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>100%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cost of goods sold\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Product costs and other cost of goods sold\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,391,736\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>77.3%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,279,766\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>77.2%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Fulfillment and related costs\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>76,878\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.3%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>73,418\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.4%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total cost of goods sold\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,468,614\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>81.6%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,353,184\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>81.6%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gross profit\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>331,349\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>18.4%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>304,654\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>18.4%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nFulfillment costs as a percentage of sales may vary due to several factors, such as our ability to manage costs at our warehouses, significant changes in the number of units received and fulfilled, the extent to which we use third party fulfillment services and warehouses, and our ability to effectively manage customer service costs and credit card fees. Fulfillment and related costs remained relatively flat during the year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to 2015.\nSee Gross profit and gross margin above for additional discussion.\nOperating expenses\nSales and marketing expenses\nWe use a variety of methods to target our consumer audience, including online campaigns, such as advertising through keywords, product listing ads, display ads, search engines, affiliate marketing programs, social coupon websites, portals, banners, e-mail, direct mail and viral and social media campaigns. We also do brand advertising through television, radio, print ads, and event sponsorships.\nThe following table reflects our sales and marketing expenses for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 (in thousands):\nTable 243: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Year ended\nDecember 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$ Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>% Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Sales and marketing expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>147,896\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>124,468\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>23,428\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>18.8\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Sales and marketing expenses as a percent of net revenues\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8.2\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7.5\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe 71 basis point increase in sales and marketing expenses as a percentage of revenue for the year ended December 31, 2016, as compared to the same period in 2015, was primarily due to increased spending in the sponsored search marketing channels and increased staff related costs.\nSales and marketing expenses include stock-based compensation expense of $249,000 and $217,000 for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively.\nCosts associated with our discounted shipping and other promotions, such as coupons, are not included in marketing expense. Rather, they are accounted for as a reduction of revenue and therefore affect sales and gross margin. We consider discounted shipping and other promotions, such as our policy of free shipping on orders over $45, as an effective marketing tool, and intend to continue to offer them as we deem appropriate as part of our overall marketing plan.\nWe constantly evaluate where we spend our sales and marketing dollars and have experienced a trend of increasing costs to acquire customers. From time to time, our competitors may bid up the cost of certain marketing channels, such as paid keywords. At such times, we may reduce the amounts we spend in those marketing channels, which may lead to decreased visitors to our site for a time. For example, during Q4 2016 and Q4 2015, the number of unique visitors to our site decreased by approximately 2% and 8%, respectively, as compared to the prior years, in part we believe as a result of such changes.\nTechnology expenses\nWe seek to invest efficiently in technology, including web services, customer support solutions, website search, expansion of new and existing product categories, and in technology to enhance the customer experience, improve our process efficiency and support and expand our logistics infrastructure. We may increase our technology expenses to support these initiatives and these increases may be material.\nThe frequency and variety of cyber-attacks on our Website, our corporate systems, and on third parties that we use to support our technology continue to increase, including an attack that took place in October 2016 which interrupted traffic for several major websites in the United States. The impact of these attacks, their costs, and the costs we incur to protect ourselves against future attacks have not been material. However, we consider the threat from cyber-attacks to be serious and will continue to incur costs related to protecting ourselves against them.\nThe following table reflects our technology expenses for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 (in thousands):\nTable 244: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Year ended\nDecember 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$ Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>% Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Technology expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>106,760\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>98,533\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>8,227\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8.3\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Technology expenses as a percent of net revenues\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5.9\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5.9\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe $8.2 million increase in technology costs for the year ended December 31, 2016, as compared to the same period in 2015, was primarily due to an increase in depreciation and amortization of $5.9 million, an increase in staff-related costs of $2.5 million (net employee and contractor change), and an increase of $1.6 million in technology licenses and maintenance. These increases were partially offset by a $1.3 million decrease in outside consulting services.\nTechnology expenses include stock-based compensation expense of $777,000 and $646,000 for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively.\nGeneral and administrative expenses\nThe following table reflects our general and administrative expenses (\"G&A\") for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 (in thousands):\nTable 245: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Year ended\nDecember 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$ Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>% Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>General and administrative expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>89,298\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>82,187\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>7,111\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8.7\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>General and administrative expenses as a percent of net revenues\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe $7.1 million increase in general and administrative expenses (\"G&A\") for the year ended December 31, 2016, as compared to the same period in 2015, was primarily due to an increase of $7.6 million in staff related costs and $1.1 million in bad debt expense for accounts receivable due from a marketplace in which also we have a minority interest. These increases were partially offset by a $1.9 million decrease in legal fees and a $1.3 million decrease in consulting and outside services.\nG&A expenses include stock-based compensation expense of approximately $3.6 million and $2.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively.\nDuring 2016, our Medici-related subsidiaries incurred a pre-tax loss of approximately $11.8 million, which includes $4.4 million of amortization and depreciation expense. During 2015, our Medici-related subsidiaries incurred a pre-tax loss of approximately $7.0 million, which includes $1.5 million of amortization and depreciation expense.\nLitigation settlement\nIn Q1 2016, we entered into a settlement agreement in our prime broker litigation which concluded the litigation in its entirety and we recognized settlement proceeds of $19.5 million. Related costs associated with the litigation and settlement of approximately $1.0 million were included in G&A expenses during Q1 2016.\nDepreciation and amortization expense\nDepreciation expense is classified within the corresponding operating expense categories in the consolidated statements of operations as follows (in thousands):\nTable 246: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Year ended\nDecember 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cost of goods sold - direct\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>310\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>283\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Technology\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>25,693\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>22,126\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Sales and marketing\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>124\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>General and administrative\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,156\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,107\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total depreciation, including internal-use software and website development\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>27,283\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>23,516\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nAmortization of intangible assets other than goodwill is classified within the corresponding operating expense categories in the consolidated statements of operations as follows (in thousands):\nTable 247: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Year ended\nDecember 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Technology\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,904\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>605\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Sales and marketing\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,008\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>531\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>General and administrative\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>56\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>445\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total amortization\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,968\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,581\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nNon-operating income (expense)\nInterest expense\nTotal interest expense increased $737,000, or 526%, from $140,000 in 2015 to $877,000 in 2016. The increase in interest expense is primarily due to no longer capitalizing interest on our headquarters loan due to construction completion.\nOther income (expense), net\nOther income, net for the year ended December 31, 2016 was $14.2 million as compared to $3.6 million in 2015. The increase is primarily due to increased Club O Rewards breakage of $10.9 million due to growth in the Club O Rewards program, particularly our Club O Silver program, a $1.2 million decrease in unrealized losses on our precious metals (no losses incurred in 2016), and an $850,000 decrease in costs related to cryptobond transactions (none incurred in 2016). These increases were partially offset by an impairment charge of $2.9 million related to a company in which we hold a minority interest that has historically been recorded at cost.\nBeginning in 2015, we enrolled a significant number of members in Club O Silver, a newly introduced Club O membership tier for customers who agree to receive promotional emails. Club O Silver members earned Club O Rewards on qualifying purchases that expire after 90 days from a qualifying purchase. We discontinued Club O Silver in October 2016, and as a result we do not expect further Club O Silver rewards breakage in the future.\nIncome taxes\nOur effective tax rate for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 was 45.3% and 60.8%, respectively. Our effective tax rate is affected by recurring items such as research tax credits and non-recurring items such as changes in valuation allowances. It is also affected to a lesser extent by tax rates in foreign jurisdictions and the relative amount of income we earn in those jurisdictions, which we expect to be fairly consistent in the near term. The decrease in the 2016 effective tax rate relative to the 2015 effective tax rate is primarily attributable to our increased pre-tax income in 2016 over 2015 and increased ownership of our majority-owned subsidiary, tZERO. Prior to Q3 2015, we owned 75.1% of tZERO. Tax losses incurred while holding less than 80% of the business cannot offset our consolidated taxable income and are fully valued. The operating losses that tZERO incurred after we increased our ownership during Q3 2015 did not require a valuation allowance since the subsidiary now qualified for tax consolidation. The decrease in the effective tax rate was partially offset by an increase in our\nvaluation allowance for capital losses due to an impairment loss on a minority interest in an international marketplace and share-based compensation tax deficiencies due to a decline in our stock price. We expect volatility in our tax rate in future periods due to share-based compensation deductions that will result from our adoption of ASU No. 2016-09, Compensation-Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting.\nWe had indefinitely reinvested foreign earnings of $421,000 at December 31, 2016. We would need to accrue and pay U.S. income tax on this amount if repatriated. At the time, we did not intend to repatriate these earnings.\nSeasonality\nBased upon our historical experience, revenue typically increases during the fourth quarter because of the holiday retail season and gross margin decreases due to increased sales of certain lower margin products, such as electronics. Revenue typically decreases in the following quarter(s), as shown in the table below. The actual quarterly results for each quarter could differ materially depending upon consumer preferences, availability of product and competition, among other risks and uncertainties. Accordingly, there can be no assurances that seasonal variations will not materially affect our results of operations in the future.\nThe following table reflects our total net revenues for each of the quarters in 2016, 2015 and 2014 (in thousands):\nTable 248: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>First\nQuarter\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Second\nQuarter\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Third\nQuarter\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Fourth\nQuarter\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>413,677\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>418,540\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>441,564\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>526,182\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>398,344\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>388,013\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>391,211\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>480,270\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>341,207\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>332,545\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>352,991\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>470,360\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nOverview\nAlthough we believe that our cash and cash equivalents currently on hand and expected cash flows from future operations will be sufficient to continue operations for at least the next twelve months, we also believe that we will need to raise additional capital and/or obtain significant additional debt financing to be able to fully pursue our plans for increasing market share in our retail business while also funding the needs of our Medici initiatives.\nWe believe that some of our direct competitors spend significantly higher percentages of their revenue on marketing than we do, and that we need to increase our branding and marketing expenditures in order to increase our market share in the e-commerce home goods market and educate consumers about our current position as an online retailer offering a wide assortment of quality home goods and other products at low prices and with a high level of customer service. We have developed and implemented marketing and branding initiatives to address this, and believe that additional marketing and branding efforts will have significant long-term positive results. However, a significant increase in our branding and marketing expenditures or other expenses would be likely to adversely affect our short-term results.\nWe also want to invest in additional distribution facilities to speed shipping and improve our customer service; in additional automation, technology and engineering resources because we believe they can improve our customers' shopping experience and increase our sales; in our Club O rewards program, primarily to increase member benefits and to develop additional personalization programs; and in expansion of our private label initiative because we believe that private label brands can generate significant brand equity and customer loyalty. See Item 1 of Part I, \"Business\"-\"Our Retail Business\"-\"Growth Strategies for Our E-Commerce Business.\"\nOur Medici initiatives also require substantial funding. Medici Ventures and its majority-owned subsidiary, tZERO, continue to identify, evaluate and pursue various opportunities for strategic acquisitions or purchases of interests to add to the services and expertise they offer their customers. See Item 1 of Part I, \"Business\"-Medici for information regarding our recent and planned strategic acquisitions or purchases of interests.\nOur ability to pursue some or all of these plans, and the extent to which we would be able to pursue some or all of them, will depend on the resources we have available, and will require significantly more capital than we currently have.\nCurrent sources of liquidity\nWe believe that our cash and cash equivalents currently on hand and expected cash flows from future operations will be sufficient to continue operations for at least the next twelve months. Our failure to generate sufficient revenues or profits or to obtain additional financing or raise additional capital could have a material adverse effect on our operations and on our ability to achieve our business objectives. Any projections of future cash needs and cash flows are subject to substantial uncertainty.\nIn November 2017, we entered into a $40.0 million loan agreement with PCL L.L.C., an entity directly or indirectly wholly owned by the mother and brother of our Chief Executive Officer, Dr. Patrick Byrne. For additional information, see Borrowings-PCL loan below.\nIn November 2017, we issued two warrants to purchase the company's common stock in privately negotiated transactions for an aggregate purchase price of $6.5 million. In December 2017, one warrant was exercised and we issued common shares of Overstock.com, Inc. for proceeds of $100.0 million before expenses. On January 17, 2018, the other warrant was exercised in full and proceeds of $50.6 million were received.\nIn December 2017, tZERO launched an offering (the \"security token offering\") of the right to acquire, if issued by tZERO in the future, tZERO Preferred Equity Tokens (the \"tZERO Security Token\") through a Simple Agreement for Future Equity (\"SAFE\"). The security token offering is expected to run through May 14, 2018 but may be extended or shortened and is subject to withdrawal rights under certain circumstances. As of March 14, 2018, tZERO has received $91.4 million in proceeds, net of requested withdrawals.\nOur principal sources of liquidity are cash flows generated from operations, and our existing cash and cash equivalents. At December 31, 2017, we had cash and cash equivalents of $203.2 million.\nCash flow information is as follows (in thousands):\nTable 249: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Year ended\nDecember 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cash provided by (used in):\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(35,321\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>39,564\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Investing activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(17,960\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(79,447\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Financing activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>73,398\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>52,719\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nFree cash flow\n\"Free Cash Flow\" (a non-GAAP measure) for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, was $(58.9) million and $(32.7) million, respectively. See Non-GAAP Financial Measures below for a reconciliation of Free Cash Flow to net cash provided by (used in) operating activities.\nCash flows from operating activities\nFor the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, our operating activities resulted in net cash outflow of $35.3 million and net cash inflow of $39.6 million, respectively.\nCash received from customers generally corresponds to our net revenues as our customers primarily use credit cards to buy from us causing our receivables from these sales transactions to settle quickly. We have payment terms with our partners that generally extend beyond the amount of time necessary to collect proceeds from our customers. As a result, following our typically seasonally strong fourth quarter sales, at December 31 of each year, our cash, cash equivalents and accounts payable balances normally reach their highest level (other than as a result of cash flows provided by or used in investing and financing activities). However, our accounts payable balance normally declines during the first three months following year-end, which normally results in a decline in our cash and cash equivalents balances from the year-end balance. The seasonality of our business normally causes payables and accruals to grow significantly in the fourth quarter, and then decrease in the first quarter when they are typically paid.\nThe $35.3 million of net cash used in operating activities during the year ended December 31, 2017 was primarily from a consolidated net loss of $111.9 million, and a decrease in accounts payable of $21.0 million. These were partially offset\nby non-cash deferred income taxes of $65.2 million, and depreciation of $28.8 million. The change in accounts payable was primarily due to lower sales volume in December 2017 compared to the same period in 2016. We recorded a significant amount of deferred income taxes in 2017 attributable to our decision to establish a valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets, net of deferred tax liabilities, as well as the impact of the TCJA. Depreciation expense incurred is primarily due to depreciation of web development projects and our new corporate headquarters.\nThe $39.6 million of net cash provided by operating activities during the year ended December 31, 2016 was primarily from non-cash depreciation of $27.3 million, an increase in accrued expenses of $16.9 million, and consolidated net income of $11.2 million. These were offset by a decrease in accounts payable of $18.8 million. Depreciation expense incurred is primarily due to the depreciation of web development projects and our new corporate headquarters which was completed in Q3 2016. The change in accounts payable was primarily due to timing of payments to suppliers. In 2016, some holiday sales occurred earlier than in 2015 (including sales on Black Friday and Cyber Monday) which resulted in earlier payments to our suppliers resulting in lower operating cash flow than in 2015. Changes in accrued liabilities were also due to timing of invoice approval.\nCash flows from investing activities\nFor the year ended December 31, 2017, investing activities resulted in net cash outflows of $18.0 million, primarily from expenditures for fixed assets of $23.6 million, equity method investments of $3.0 million, and cost method investments of $2.2 million, offset by proceeds from sale of precious metals of $11.9 million.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2016, investing activities resulted in net cash outflows of $79.4 million, primarily from expenditures for fixed assets of $72.3 million, cost method investments of $4.8 million and disbursements for loans made of $3.7 million.\nCash flows from financing activities\nFor the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, financing activities resulted in net cash inflows of $73.4 million and $52.7 million, respectively.\nThe $73.4 million provided by financing activities during the year ended December 31, 2017 resulted primarily from $100.0 million of proceeds from exercise of a stock warrant, $40.0 million of proceeds from our PCL term loan, offset by $45.8 million of repayments on our U.S. Bank term loan, $15.3 million of repayments on lease finance obligations with U.S. Bank and $11.2 million of purchases of treasury stock.\nThe $52.7 million provided by financing activities during the year ended December 31, 2016 resulted primarily from $36.3 million of proceeds from our U.S. Bank term loan, $11.4 million of proceeds from lease finance obligations with U.S. Bank and $7.6 million of proceeds, net of offering costs, from our preferred stock offering in Q4 2016, partially offset by $1.9 million for payments on finance obligations.\nContractual Obligations and Commitments\nThe following table summarizes our contractual obligations as of December 31, 2017 and the effect such obligations and commitments are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flow in future periods (in thousands):\nTable 250: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Payments Due by Period\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Contractual Obligations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2020\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2021\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2022\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Thereafter\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Total\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>PCL term loan payments\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,200\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>41,052\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>44,252\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating leases\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6,962\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6,733\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,292\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,335\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,439\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>16,356\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>43,117\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Purchase obligations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5,487\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5,487\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Technology services\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,369\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,901\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,584\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,854\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total contractual cash obligations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>17,018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>49,686\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>5,876\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>4,335\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>4,439\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>16,356\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>97,710\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nPCL term loan payments\nWe are party to a financing agreement related to our corporate headquarters (see Borrowings below). The amounts presented reflect our related principal and interest payments.\nOperating leases\nFrom time to time we enter into operating leases for facilities and equipment for use in our operations.\nPurchase obligations\nThe amount of purchase obligations shown above is based on assumptions regarding the legal enforceability against us of inventory purchase orders we had outstanding at December 31, 2017. Under different assumptions regarding our rights to cancel our purchase orders or different assumptions regarding the enforceability of the purchase orders under applicable law, the amount of purchase obligations shown in the table above would be less.\nTechnology services\nFrom time to time we enter into long-term contractual agreements for technology services and capital leases for equipment included in such service agreements.\nTax contingencies\nWe are involved in various tax matters, the outcomes of which are uncertain. As of December 31, 2017 and 2016, tax contingencies were $1.7 million and $1.5 million, respectively, which are included in our reconciliation of unrecognized tax benefits (see Item 15 of Part IV, \"Financial Statements\"-Note 18. Income Taxes, contained in the \"Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\" of this Annual Report on Form 10-K). We expect the total amount of tax contingencies to increase in the future. In addition, changes in state, federal, and foreign tax laws may increase our tax contingencies. The timing of the resolution of income tax contingencies is highly uncertain, and the amounts ultimately paid, if any, upon resolution of issues raised by the taxing authorities may differ from the amounts accrued. It is reasonably possible that within the next 12 months we will receive additional assessments by various tax authorities. These assessments may or may not result in changes to our contingencies related to positions on prior years' tax filings.\nBorrowings\nPCL L.L.C. term loan agreement\nOn November 6, 2017, we entered into a loan agreement with PCL L.L.C., an entity directly or indirectly wholly owned by the mother and brother of our Chief Executive Officer, Dr. Patrick Byrne. The agreement provides for a $40.0 million term loan (the \"PCL Loan\") which carries an annual interest rate of 8.0% and a default rate of 18.0%. The PCL Loan is for a term of 18 months, subject to mandatory prepayment under certain circumstances, and is prepayable at our election at any time without penalty or premium. Interest only is due monthly.\nThe principal amount and any then unpaid interest will be due and payable on May 1, 2019 subject to mandatory prepayment in the event of a sale or encumbrance of the headquarters building or a change of ownership of Overstock or the occurrence of certain other events, including material changes to Overstock's business, the loss of management control of Overstock by Dr. Patrick Byrne and other events. The PCL Loan is secured by our corporate headquarters and the related land, fixtures and certain related personal property. We incurred insignificant debt issuance costs with the new loan agreement. The $40.0 million proceeds from this loan together with our cash resources were used to repay the remaining outstanding balances and terminate the U.S. Bank Term Loan, Revolving Loan, Master Lease Agreement, and associated derivative instruments.\nAt December 31, 2017, our outstanding balance on the PCL Loan was $40.0 million. Amounts outstanding under the Term Loan are presented net of discount and issuance costs in our consolidated balance sheets.\nU.S. Bank letters of credit\nAt December 31, 2017 and 2016, letters of credit totaling $355,000, were issued on our behalf collateralized by compensating cash balances held at U.S. Bank, which are included in Restricted cash in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.\nU.S. Bank commercial purchasing card agreement\nWe have a commercial purchasing card (the \"Purchasing Card\") agreement with U.S. Bank. We use the Purchasing Card for business purpose purchasing and must pay it in full each month. At December 31, 2017, $822,000 was outstanding and $4.2 million was available under the Purchasing Card. At December 31, 2016, $811,000 was outstanding and $4.2 million was available under the Purchasing Card.\nOther Factors that May Affect Future Results\nWe believe that our cash and cash equivalents currently on hand and expected cash flows from future operations will be sufficient to continue operations for at least the next twelve months. Any projections of future cash needs and cash flows are subject to substantial uncertainty. See Item 1A of Part I, \"Risk Factors.\"\nWe periodically evaluate opportunities to repurchase our equity securities, obtain credit facilities, or issue additional debt or equity securities. In addition, we may, from time to time, consider the investment in, or acquisition of, complementary businesses, products, services, or technologies, any of which might affect our liquidity requirements or cause us to issue additional debt or equity securities. There can be no assurance that financing arrangements will be available in amounts or on terms acceptable to us, if at all. Our future results may be significantly different from our historical results for several other reasons as well, including the possibility discussed in this Annual Report on Form 10-K that we may sell our retail business, which would have a dramatic effect on our future results. Other reasons that our future results may be significantly different from our historical results include the potential effects on us of the accounting and tax changes discussed in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, the security token offering being conducted by our majority-owned subsidiary tZERO, and other reasons described in Item 1. Business\u201d under Our Retail Business,\u201d Medici,\u201d and Potential Strategic Initiatives,\u201d as well as the risk factors described in Item 1A. Risk Factors.\u201d\nAny investment in our securities involves a high degree of risk. Investors should consider carefully the risks and uncertainties described in this Form 10-K, including the risks described in Item 1A of Part I, \"Risk Factors\", and all other information in this Form 10-K and in our other filings with the SEC including those we file after we file this Form 10-K, before deciding whether to purchase or hold our securities. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also become important factors that may harm our business. The occurrence of any of the risks described under \"Risk Factors\" in this report could harm our business. The trading price of our securities could decline due to any of these risks and uncertainties, and investors may lose part or all of their investment.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that would be material to investors.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nRegulation G, Conditions for Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures, and other SEC regulations regulate the disclosure of certain non-GAAP financial information.\nContribution and contribution margin\nContribution and contribution margin (non-GAAP financial measures - which we reconcile to \"Gross Profit\" in our consolidated statement of operations) consist of gross profit less sales and marketing expense plus Club O Rewards and gift card breakage and reflects an additional way of viewing our results. Contribution margin is contribution as a percentage of total net revenue. We believe contribution and contribution margin provide management and users of the financial statements information about our ability to cover our operating costs, such as technology and general and administrative expenses, while reflecting the selling costs we incurred to generate our revenues and adding back the reductions in revenue that we recognized for Club O Rewards that have subsequently expired and for gift cards whose redemption is remote. Contribution and contribution margin are used in addition to and in conjunction with results presented in accordance with GAAP and should not be relied upon to the exclusion of GAAP financial measures. The material limitation associated with the use of contribution is that it is an incomplete measure of profitability as it does not include all operating expenses or all non-operating income and expenses. Management compensates for these limitations when using this measure by looking at other GAAP measures, such as operating income and net income. You should review our financial statements and publicly-filed reports in their entirety and not rely on any single financial measure.

Business Segments, contained in the \"Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\" of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nFree cash flow\nFree cash flow (a non-GAAP financial measure) reflects an additional way of viewing our cash flows and liquidity that, when viewed with our GAAP results, provides a more complete understanding of factors and trends affecting our cash flows and liquidity. Free cash flow, which we reconcile below to \"Net cash provided by (used in) operating activities,\" the nearest GAAP financial measure, is net cash provided by operating activities reduced by \"Expenditures for fixed assets, including internal-use software and website development.\" We believe that net cash provided by operating activities is an important measure, since it includes both the cash impact of the continuing operations of the business and changes in the balance sheet that impact cash. We believe free cash flow is a useful measure to evaluate our business since purchases of fixed assets are a necessary component of ongoing operations and free cash flow measures the amount of cash we have available for mandatory debt service and financing obligations, changes in our capital structure, and future investments after purchases of fixed assets. Free cash flow measures have limitations as they omit certain components of the overall consolidated statement of cash flows and do not represent the residual cash flow available for discretionary expenditures. Free cash flow should not be considered a substitute for net income or cash flow data prepared in accordance with GAAP and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies. Therefore, we believe it is important to view free cash flow as a complement to our entire consolidated statements of cash flows as reconciled below (in thousands):\nTable 253: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Year ended\nDecember 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash provided by operating activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(35,321\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>39,564\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>54,516\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Expenditures for fixed assets, including internal-use software and website development\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(23,586\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(72,281\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(59,513\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Free cash flow\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(58,907\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(32,717\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(4,997\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n</table>", "item_7_text": "ITEM 7.

Through our online retail business, we offer a broad range of price-competitive products, including furniture, home decor, bedding and bath, housewares, jewelry and watches,\namong other products. We sell our products and services through our Internet websites located at www.overstock.com, www.o.co and www.o.biz (referred to collectively as the \"Website\"). Although our three websites are located at different domain addresses, the technology and equipment and processes supporting the Website and the process of order fulfillment described herein are the same for all three websites.\nIn late 2014, we began working on initiatives to develop and advance blockchain technology, which we refer to collectively as Medici. As part of our Medici initiatives, we have formed a wholly-owned subsidiary Medici Ventures, Inc. (\"Medici Ventures\") and acquired a majority interest in a financial technology company and two related registered broker dealers which are owned by our majority-owned subsidiary t\u00d8.com, Inc. (\"tZERO\"). Medici Ventures has also purchased interests in several blockchain technology companies. In 2015, we were the first public company to issue a private security using blockchain technology and in December 2016, as a demonstration of our technology, we issued publicly traded blockchain preferred shares of Overstock.com, Inc.\nWe have engaged Guggenheim Securities, LLC to help us identify and evaluate certain strategic initiatives. We are considering a range of potential transactions, including a sale of our e-commerce business and additional equity or debt financings. Our Board continually discusses a variety of potential strategic and financial options and other changes to our business, but has not made any determination to undertake any strategic transaction, and may not do so in the foreseeable future or at all. See Item 1 of Part I, \"Business-Potential Strategic Initiatives,\" and Item 1A, \"Risk Factors-Risks Relating to Our Current Review of Strategic Initiatives.\"\nOur company, based near Salt Lake City, Utah, was founded in 1997. We launched our initial website in March 1999 and were re-incorporated in Delaware in 2002. As used herein, \"Overstock,\" \"Overstock.com,\", \"O.co,\" \"we,\" \"our\" and similar terms include Overstock.com, Inc. and our majority-owned subsidiaries, unless the context indicates otherwise.\nOur Retail Business\nOur retail business constitutes the vast majority of our business and, through December 31, 2017, generated nearly all of our net revenues. In our retail business, our goal is to provide goods to furnish and accessorize \"dream homes\" for our target customers-consumers who seek quality, stylish merchandise at bargain prices. At December 31, 2017, we offered 2.8 million products (6.0 million SKUs), of which over 99% were in-line products (products in active production). At December 31, 2017, we were offering three private label brands - Porch & Den, Carson Carrington and OSleep - and had more than 1,000 private label products available on our Website and intend to add additional private label brands, including home products brands, using our strength in home products to help build our private label brands. We regularly change our product assortment to meet the evolving preferences of our customers and current trends. Our products include, among others, furniture, home d\u00e9cor including rugs, bedding and bath, home improvement and kitchen items, and, to a lesser extent, jewelry and watches. We compete primarily based on:\n \u2022 Quality customer experience with an emphasis on price, value, and a wide assortment of products delivered in a personalized format with the convenience of our mobile app, and with the benefits of our award-winning customer care; \n \u2022 Proprietary technologies which we believe help us provide our customers with a quality shopping experience; \n \u2022 Logistics capabilities tailored to the furniture and home goods category and developed over our many years of e-commerce experience; \n \u2022 Long-term mutually beneficial relationships with our partners, which currently number approximately 4,100; and \n \u2022 Our Club O Loyalty Program, which we believe increases customer engagement and retention. \nWe have organized our retail business (sales of product offered through the Shopping Section of our Website) into two principal segments - a \"direct\" business and a \"partner\" business. For 2017, approximately 95% of our net sales were from transactions in which we fulfilled orders from manufacturers, distributors and other suppliers (\"partners\") selling on our website, who we generally direct to ship goods sold from their own warehouses, while we generally handle returns and customer service (our \"partner\" business). The remaining 5% of our net sales came from direct sales of our own inventory shipped from our warehouse, including some customer returns of partner products (our \"direct\" business). We provide our partners with access to a large customer base and convenient services for order fulfillment, customer service, returns handling, and other services. Our team of customer service representatives assists customers by telephone, instant online chat and e-mail. We also derive revenue from other businesses advertising products or services on our Website. Our sales are primarily to customers located in the United States. During the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015 no single customer accounted for more than 1% of our total net revenue.\nRetail direct business\nOur retail direct business includes sales made to individual consumers and businesses from our owned inventory which are fulfilled primarily from our warehouse in Salt Lake City, Utah. Our warehouses primarily fulfill orders from our retail direct business. Our warehouses generally ship between 2,000 and 5,000 packages per day and up to approximately 6,000 packages per day during peak periods.\nRetail partner business\nIn our retail partner business, we sell merchandise from our partners primarily through our Website. We are the primary obligor for the majority of these sales transactions and we record revenue from the majority of these sales transactions on a gross basis. We generally have the ability to set pricing and source merchandise from our partners based on our discretion. Our use of the term \"partner\" does not mean that we have formed any legal partnerships with any of our partners. We currently have relationships with approximately 4,100 third parties who supply the vast majority of products on our Website. These partners generally perform the same fulfillment operations as our warehouses, such as order picking and shipping. We retain the right to re-direct and control the products during shipment and we handle returns and customer service related to substantially all orders placed through our Website. Revenue generated from sales on our Shopping site from both the direct and partner businesses is recorded net of returns, coupons and other discounts.\nBoth direct and partner revenues are seasonal, with revenues historically being the highest in the fourth quarter, which ends December 31, reflecting higher consumer holiday spending. We anticipate this will continue for the foreseeable future. To the extent possible we maintain supplier relationships, and seek new supplier relationships, for both our direct and partner businesses, and also use our working capital, to ensure a continuous allotment of product offerings for our customers. Because some (less than 1%) of our product offerings are closeout merchandise, some of our suppliers cannot supply products to us on a continuous basis.\nGenerally, we require authorization from credit card or other payment vendors whose services we offer to our customers (such as PayPal) or verification of receipt of payment, before we ship products to consumers or business purchasers. From time to time we grant credit to our business purchasers with normal credit terms (typically 30 days). For sales in our partner business, we generally receive payments from our customers before our payments to our suppliers are due.\nGrowth Strategies for Our E-Commerce Business\nWe believe that some of our direct competitors spend significantly higher percentages of their revenue on marketing than we do, and that we need to increase our branding and marketing expenditures in order to increase our market share in the e-commerce home goods market and educate consumers about our current position as an online retailer offering a wide assortment of quality home goods and other products at low prices and with a high level of customer service. We have developed and implemented marketing and branding initiatives to address this, and believe that additional marketing and branding efforts will have significant long-term positive results. However, a significant increase in our branding and marketing expenditures or other expenses would be likely to adversely affect our short-term results.\nWe also want to invest in additional distribution facilities to speed shipping and improve our customer service; in additional automation, technology and engineering resources because we believe they can improve our customers' shopping experience and increase our sales; in our Club O rewards program, primarily to increase member benefits and to develop additional personalization programs; and in expansion of our private label initiative because we believe that private label brands can generate significant brand equity and customer loyalty. However, our ability to pursue some or all of these plans, and the extent to which we would be able to pursue some or all of them, will depend on the resources we have available, and may require significantly more capital than we currently have. See \"Liquidity and Capital Resources.\"\nMedici Business Initiatives\nOur Medici business initiatives seek to leverage the security, transparency and immutability of cryptographically protected, distributed ledgers, such as blockchains, and are focused on solving important problems, including financial transaction issues, particularly in the area of securities settlement. Our wholly-owned subsidiary, Medici Ventures, conducts its primary business through its majority-owned subsidiary tZERO, which includes a financial technology company and two related registered broker dealers. Medici Ventures also holds interests in several technology companies whose focuses include commercial blockchain applications, digital currency solutions, compliance, identity, voting, and land.\nAs described further in Item 15 of Part IV, \"Financial Statements\"-Note 21. Business Segments, contained in the \"Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\" of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we determined our segments based on how\nwe manage our business, which, in our view, consists primarily of our Retail and Medici businesses. As described above, our Retail business consists of our Direct and Partner reportable segments. We use gross profit as the measure to determine our reportable segments because there is not discrete financial information available below gross profit for our Direct and Partner segments. As a result, our Medici business is not significant as compared to our Direct and Partner segments and is included in Other. Our Other segment consists of Medici.\nOther Offerings\nWe offer additional products or services that may complement our primary offerings, but are not significant to our revenues. These include:\n \u2022 Worldstock Fair Trade, a store within our Website that offers handcrafted products made by artisans all over the world to help improve the lives of people in emerging economies; \n \u2022 Supplier Oasis, a single integration point through which our partners can manage their products, inventory and sales channels, and also obtain multi-channel fulfillment services through our distribution network; \n \u2022 Our international business where we offer products to customers outside the United States using third party logistics providers; \n \u2022 Cars by Overstock, a portal within our Website where our customers can search millions of new, used and certified pre-owned cars from dealers and private parties - all in one place with convenient financing and warranty options; \n \u2022 FinanceHub, a portal within our Website where our customers can shop for loans, credit cards, and insurance, and can now also access links to automated financial advisory services and discounted stock brokerage services; and \n \u2022 Pet Adoptions, a free service and portal within our Website that leverages our technology to display pets available for adoption from shelters across the United States. \nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (\"GAAP\") requires estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. The Securities and Exchange Commission (\"SEC\") has defined a company's critical accounting policies as the ones that are most important to the portrayal of the company's financial condition and results of operations, and which require the company to make its most difficult and subjective judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates of matters that are inherently uncertain. Based on this definition, we have identified the critical accounting policies, estimates and judgments addressed below. We also have other key accounting policies, which involve the use of estimates, judgments, and assumptions that are significant to understanding our results. For additional information, see Item 15 of Part IV, \"Financial Statements\"-Note 2. Accounting Policies. Although we believe that our estimates, assumptions, and judgments are reasonable, they are based upon information presently available. Actual results may differ significantly from these estimates. Our critical accounting policies are as follows:\n \u2022 revenue recognition; \n \u2022 accounting for income taxes; and \n \u2022 accounting for intangible assets other than goodwill in business combination. \nRevenue recognition\nWe derive our revenue primarily from retail merchandise sales on our Website.\nRevenue is recognized when the following revenue recognition criteria are met: (1) persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists; (2) delivery has occurred or the service has been provided; (3) the selling price or fee revenue earned is fixed or determinable; and (4) collection of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured. Revenue related to merchandise sales is recognized upon delivery to our customers. As we ship high volumes of packages through multiple carriers, it is not practical for us to track the actual delivery date of each shipment. Therefore, we use estimates to determine which shipments are delivered and, therefore, recognized as revenue at the end of the period. Our delivery date estimates are based on average shipping transit times, which are calculated using the following factors: (i) the type of shipping carrier (as carriers have different in-transit times); (ii) the fulfillment source (either our warehouses, those warehouses we control, or those of our partners); (iii) the delivery destination; and (iv) actual transit time experience, which shows that delivery date is typically one to eight business days from the date of shipment. We review and update our estimates on a quarterly basis based on our actual transit time experience. However, actual shipping times may differ from our estimates.\nWe evaluate the criteria outlined in ASC Topic 605-45, Principal Agent Considerations, in determining whether it is appropriate to record the gross amount of product sales and related costs or the net amount earned as commissions. When we are the primary obligor in a transaction, are subject to inventory risk, have latitude in establishing prices and selecting suppliers, or have several but not all of these indicators, revenue is recorded gross. If we are not the primary obligor in the transaction and amounts earned are determined using a fixed percentage, revenue is recorded on a net basis. Currently, the majority of both direct revenue and partner revenue is recorded on a gross basis, as we are the primary obligor. We present revenue net of sales taxes. We periodically provide incentive offers to our customers to encourage purchases. Such offers include current discount offers, such as percentage discounts off current purchases and other similar offers, which, when used by customers, are treated as a reduction of revenue.\nThe following table shows the effect that hypothetical changes in the estimate of average shipping transit times would have had on the reported amount of revenue and income before taxes for the year ended December 31, 2017 (in thousands):\n\nThe Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB), which sets accounting standards for U.S. public companies, has issued new standards relating to revenue recognition, which became effective on January 1, 2018, and which will apply to our interim financial statements for the quarter ending March 31, 2018. We are in the process of analyzing the new standards and their application to our processes, accounting, financial reporting presentation, disclosures, and controls. Under previous FASB standards, we recognized revenue from the majority of these sales transactions on a gross basis. We have not reached a definite conclusion, but we believe we will continue to recognize revenue from the majority of our retail business on a gross basis. If our adoption of the new standards requires us to recognize these revenues on a net basis, our future revenue will be substantially less than it was under the previous standards despite having no impact on gross profits. This could have a material adverse effect on the market price of our common stock.\nAccounting for income taxes\nWe are subject to taxation from federal, state and international jurisdictions. A significant amount of judgment is involved in preparing our provision for income taxes and the calculation of resulting deferred tax assets and liabilities.\nWe account for income taxes in accordance with ASC Topic 740, Income Taxes (\"ASC 740\"), which requires the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between tax and financial reporting. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the currently enacted tax rates that apply to taxable income in effect for the years in which those tax assets are expected to be realized or settled. The effect of a change in tax rates on deferred tax assets and liabilities is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date.\nTax laws and regulations themselves are subject to change as a result of changes in fiscal policy, changes in legislation, the evolution of regulations, and court rulings. On December 22, 2017, the President signed into law Public Law No. 115-97, commonly referred to as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (\"TCJA\"), following its passage by the United States Congress. The TCJA will make significant changes to U.S. federal income tax laws, mostly effective for tax years beginning after December 31, 2017. Among many other changes, the new law lowers the corporate tax rate from 35% to 21% for tax years beginning in 2018, transitions U.S international taxation from a worldwide tax system to a territorial system, and includes a one-time transition tax on the mandatory deemed repatriation of cumulative foreign earnings as of December 31, 2017. Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118 (\"SAB 118\") was issued to address the application of US GAAP in situations when a registrant does not have the necessary information available, prepared, or analyzed (including computations) in reasonable detail to complete the accounting for certain income tax effects of the TCJA. As of the date of this filing, we have not completed our accounting for the tax effects of the TCJA. In accordance with SAB 118, we have calculated our best estimate of the impact of the TCJA in our year end income tax provision in accordance with our understanding of the law and guidance available as of the date of this filing and as a result\nhave recorded $25.3 million as additional income tax expense in the fourth quarter of 2017. The amount related to the remeasurement of certain deferred tax assets and liabilities, based on the rates at which they are expected to reverse in the future, was $25.2 million. Although the tax rate reduction is known, our analysis may also be affected by other analyses related to the TCJA, including, but not limited to, our calculation of the mandatory deemed repatriation of cumulative foreign earnings and the state tax effect of adjustments made to federal temporary differences, which are uncertain at this time. The provisional amount related to the one-time transition tax on the mandatory deemed repatriation of cumulative foreign earnings was $41,000. The net charge is subject to revisions as we complete our analysis of the TCJA, collect and prepare necessary data, and interpret any additional guidance issued by the U.S. Treasury Department, Internal Revenue Service (\"IRS\"), FASB, and other standard-setting and regulatory bodies. Any subsequent adjustment to these amounts will be recorded to tax expense in the quarter when the analysis is complete. Our accounting for the tax effects of the TCJA will be completed during the measurement period, which should not extend beyond one year from the enactment date.\nThe TCJA includes a provision to tax global intangible low-taxed income (\"GILTI\") of foreign subsidiaries in excess of a deemed return on tangible assets of foreign corporations beginning in 2018. Under GAAP, we can make an accounting policy election to either treat taxes due on the GILTI inclusion as a current period expense, or factor such amounts into our measurement of deferred taxes. Due to the complexity of the new GILTI tax rules, we are continuing to evaluate this provision of the TCJA and the application of GAAP and we have not yet elected an accounting policy.\nWe assess available positive and negative evidence to estimate whether we will generate sufficient future taxable income to use our existing deferred tax assets. We have no carryback ability and do not expect significant future reversals of taxable temporary differences to recover our existing deferred tax assets, therefore we must rely on future taxable income, including tax planning strategies, to support their realizability. We have concluded based on all available evidence that it is more likely than not that our deferred tax assets as of December 31, 2017 will not be realized in the future. Therefore, it is appropriate to record a valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets, net of deferred tax liabilities related to assets with a definite reversal period. In reaching these conclusions we considered, among other things, three significant pieces of negative evidence that occurred during the quarter ended December 31, 2017. First, a significant piece of objective negative evidence evaluated was the cumulative loss incurred over the three-year period ended December 31, 2017. We expect the trends that contributed to the loss to continue. Such objective evidence limits the ability to consider other subjective evidence, such as projections for future taxable income, if any. Second, during the quarter ended December 31, 2017, forecasts for future years were significantly revised. We are projecting significant pretax operating losses over the next several years and it is uncertain when we will return to profitability. While forecasts of future years are a more subjective piece of evidence, these forecasted losses in the near-term are further negative evidence that we will not have sufficient future taxable income to use our existing deferred tax assets. Third, we have certain tax planning strategies that we intended to implement to accelerate taxable income into earlier periods in order to utilize loss carryforwards and tax credits prior to expiration. While these tax planning strategies previously would have been sufficient to utilize most of our deferred tax assets in periods of low pretax income, these tax planning strategies will not be sufficient to utilize deferred tax assets in periods where we generate significant pretax losses, such as our current year operating results or our newly revised projections for future years. Additionally, one of our tax planning strategies was significantly impacted and reduced in application due to the TCJA, enacted on December 22, 2017. Therefore, we no longer have prudent and feasible tax planning strategies to support the realizability of deferred tax assets. We intend to continue maintaining a valuation allowance on our net deferred tax assets until there is sufficient evidence to support the reversal of all or some portion of these allowances. The amount of the deferred tax asset considered realizable could be adjusted if objective negative evidence in the form of cumulative losses is no longer present and additional weight may be given to subjective evidence such as long-term projections for growth.\nASC 740 clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprise's financial statements in accordance with GAAP. ASC 740 prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. This statement also provides guidance on de-recognition, classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods, and disclosure.\nThe calculation of our tax liabilities is subject to legal and factual interpretation, judgment, and uncertainty in a multitude of jurisdictions. This includes addressing uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations. We recognize liabilities for uncertain tax positions in the U.S. and other tax jurisdictions based on recognition and measurement criteria prescribed by ASC 740. We record an amount as an estimate of probable additional income tax liability at the largest amount that we determine is more likely than not, based upon the technical merits of the position, to be sustained upon audit by the relevant tax authority. The liabilities are periodically reviewed for their adequacy and appropriateness. Changes to our assumptions could cause us to find a revision of estimates appropriate. Such a change in measurement would result in the recognition of a tax benefit or an additional charge to the tax provision.\nWe are currently under audit in Ireland for the 2016 tax year. The IRS concluded an audit of our 2015 federal income tax return in 2017 with no changes to the return. Tax periods within the statutory period of limitations not previously audited are potentially open for examination by the tax authorities. Potential liabilities associated with these years will be resolved when an event occurs to warrant closure, primarily through the completion of audits by the tax jurisdictions and/or the expiration of the statutes of limitation. To the extent audits or other events result in a material adjustment to the accrued estimates, the effect would be recognized during the period of the event. We believe that an appropriate estimated liability has been established for potential exposures.\nOur uncertain tax positions related to state income taxes represent a cash settlement contingency and are recorded as a liability in our consolidated balance sheets. To the extent interest and penalties would be assessed by taxing authorities on any underpayment of income taxes, such amounts are accrued and classified as a component of income tax expense on our consolidated statements of income and comprehensive income. Realization of the unrecognized tax benefits results in a favorable impact to the effective tax rate.\nAccounting for intangible assets other than goodwill in business combination\nIntangible assets other than goodwill acquired as part of a business combination are capitalized at their acquisition-date fair value. We amortize intangible assets other than goodwill over their estimated useful lives unless such lives are indefinite. Intangible assets other than goodwill are amortized using the straight-line method of amortization over their useful lives, with the exception of certain intangibles (such as acquired technology, customer relationships, and trade names) which are amortized using an accelerated method of amortization based on cash flows. These assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying amount may not be recoverable.\nThe following table details the identifiable intangible assets acquired at their fair value and remaining useful lives as of December 31, 2017 (amounts in thousands):\n\nRecently issued accounting standards\nFor information about recent accounting pronouncements, see Item 15 of Part IV, \"Financial Statements\"-Note 2. Accounting Policies.\nPreliminary Estimates for the Quarter ending March 31, 2018\nWe have determined to switch to a growth strategy in our ecommerce business, which we believe will lead to higher revenue growth, but also incur significant losses in the process. In pursuit of this growth strategy, in Q1 2018 we have increased our sales and marketing expenditures substantially to increase revenue growth and to test new marketing initiatives. Largely as a result of this new strategy, we expect to incur a total pre-tax loss of approximately $50 million in Q1 2018 ($35 million ecommerce, $15 million Medici).\nOur estimated results for the quarter ended March 31, 2018 are preliminary and subject to substantial uncertainty and numerous risks including those outlined in Item 1A of Part I, \"Risk Factors\". We caution you that our estimates are forward-looking statements and are not guarantees of future performance or outcomes and that actual results may differ materially.\nComparison of Years Ended December 31, 2017 and 2016\nExecutive Commentary\nThis executive commentary is intended to provide investors with a view of our business through the eyes of our management. As an executive commentary, it necessarily focuses on selected aspects of our business. This executive commentary is intended as a supplement to, but not a substitute for, the more detailed discussion of our business included elsewhere herein. Investors are cautioned to read our entire \"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,\" as well as our interim and audited financial statements, and the discussion of our business and risk factors and other information included elsewhere or incorporated in this report. This executive commentary includes forward-looking statements, and investors are cautioned to read \"Special Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements.\"\nOur $111.9 million consolidated net loss in 2017 was the result primarily of our $46.6 million operating loss in 2017 and our $64.2 million income tax expense in 2017. The operating loss was caused primarily by changes that Google made in its natural search engine algorithms and an increasingly competitive digital marketing landscape. The income tax expense included $25.3 million of expense caused by the enactment in late December 2017 of the TCJA and $59.0 million of expense caused by our establishment of a valuation allowance against our net deferred tax assets at December 31, 2017. These matters are discussed in more detail below.\nRevenues in 2017 decreased 3% compared to 2016. Beginning in mid-2017 and continuing in the fourth quarter of 2017, we experienced difficulties which we believe were due in part to changes that Google, Inc. (\"Google\") has made in its natural search engine algorithms. It has taken us longer to analyze and to seek to adapt to the 2017 algorithm adjustments than it took us to respond to Google's changes in previous years. We have reorganized a large number of resources around addressing this challenge, as well as seeking to prevent it from occurring again. We have implemented a variety of innovations and technical improvements in this area and expect to continue to do so. However, we cannot offer any assurance that we will be able to fully adapt to the 2017 algorithm adjustments or will be able to rely in the future on natural search results as we have in the past. This decrease to revenue was partially offset by efforts to increase revenue in other marketing channels such as sponsored search and email.\nGross profit in 2017 increased 3% compared to 2016 primarily as a result of increased gross margin. Gross margin increased to 19.5% in 2017 compared to 18.4% in 2016. The increase in gross margin was primarily due to a continued shift in sales mix into higher margin home and garden products and an increase in marketplace sales (which we recognize on a net basis), partially offset by increased promotional activities, including coupons and site sales due to our driving a higher proportion of our sales using such promotions.\nSales and marketing expenses as a percentage of revenue increased from 8.2% to 10.4% in 2017 as compared to 2016, primarily due to increased spending in the sponsored search and display ads on social media marketing channels, due in part to our seeking to increase revenue in these channels to partially offset the effects of the Google algorithm changes described above.\nWhile we work to adapt to Google's changes, we have increased our emphasis on other marketing channels, such as sponsored search, which has generated revenue growth but with higher associated marketing expenses than natural search. We expect this trend to continue while we work to adapt to these changes.\nWe are also experiencing an increasingly competitive digital marketing landscape. We have competitors who are spending significant amounts on advertising bidding up the cost of certain marketing channels, such as paid keywords. While we may not choose to match their levels of spending, this has increased our marketing costs in recent quarters. We expect this trend to continue. However, we do have a number of important digital marketing initiatives that we are testing and implementing that we believe will improve our competitive position in this area.\nAs a result of these factors, our contribution decreased 19% in 2017 compared to 2016 (see Non-GAAP Financial Measures below for a reconciliation of Contribution to Gross Profit). Contribution margin was 9.3% in 2017 compared to 11.1% in 2016.\nWe believe that to build market share in the e-commerce home goods market, we will need to significantly increase our marketing and branding expenditures, which we expect would lead to increased revenues but also lead to future net losses in the near-term.\nTechnology expenses in 2017 increased $9.1 million compared to 2016 primarily due to an increase in staff related costs of $4.9 million, and an increase in technology licenses and maintenance costs of $4.0 million.\nGeneral and administrative expenses in 2017 increased $1.4 million compared to 2016, primarily due to an increase in staff related costs of $4.9 million, partially offset by a decrease in legal fees of $3.0 million, and a decrease in bad debt expense of $1.1 million.\nOur provision for income taxes totaled $64.2 million and $9.3 million for 2017 and 2016, respectively. The increase in 2017 expense compared to 2016 is primarily attributable to our decision to establish a valuation allowance against our net deferred tax assets, as well as the impact of the TCJA. On December 22, 2017, the President signed into law the TCJA. Among many other changes, the new law lowers the corporate tax rate from 35% to 21% for tax years beginning in 2018. Therefore, we re-valued our deferred tax assets in 2017 due to the federal rate reduction, which resulted in an increase in our 2017 income tax expense of $25.3 million. Additionally, each quarter we assess available positive and negative evidence to estimate whether we will generate sufficient future taxable income to use our existing deferred tax assets. Due to losses incurred in 2017 and the potential for future losses, we have recorded a valuation allowance on our deferred tax assets, net of deferred tax liabilities, which further increased our 2017 income tax expense by $59.0 million.\nWe continue to seek opportunities for growth, in our retail business and through our Medici blockchain and financial technology initiatives and through other means. As a result of these initiatives, we will continue to incur additional expenses and may purchase interests in, or make acquisitions of, other technologies or businesses. We anticipate that our initiatives may cause us to incur losses in the foreseeable future. These losses, additional expenses, acquisitions or purchases may be material, and, coupled with existing marketing expense trends, our plans to increase our marketing and branding expenditures, and strategic changes in our retail business, may lead to increased consolidated losses in some periods, and to reduced liquidity. Additionally, we may recognize additional impairment charges from our ownership interest in other entities.\nThe balance of our Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations provides further information about the matters discussed above and other important matters affecting our business.\nResults of Operations\nThe following table sets forth our results of operations expressed as a percentage of total net revenue for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015:\n\nRevenue\nThe following table reflects our net revenue for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 (in thousands):\n\nThe decrease in total net revenue for the year ended December 31, 2017, as compared to the same period in 2016, was due in part to changes that we believe Google has made in its natural search engine algorithms. In addition, we had an increase in product sales for which we record only our commission as revenue, and an increase in promotional activities, including coupons and site sales due to our driving a higher proportion of our sales using such promotions.\nThe decrease in direct revenue for the year ended December 31, 2017, as compared to the same period in 2016, was due in part to the changes that Google has made in its natural search engine algorithms. The decrease to revenue can also be explained by a decrease in sales of direct home and garden, clothing, and jewelry products, and increased promotional activities, including coupons and site sales due to our driving a higher proportion of our sales using such promotions. These were partially offset by\ndeferring a lower number of orders taken but not delivered due to decreased direct revenue, and a decrease in Club O Rewards earned due to discontinuing rewards on the Club O Silver program in Q4 2016.\nThe decrease in partner revenue for the year ended December 31, 2017, as compared to the same period in 2016, was due in part to the changes that Google has made in its natural search engine algorithms. The decrease to revenue can also be explained by an increase in product sales for which we record only our commission as revenue, and an increase in promotional activities, including coupons and site sales due to our driving a higher proportion of our sales using such promotions. We also had a decrease in sales in categories on which we placed a reduced emphasis, which was partially offset by an increase in sales of home and garden products which we have emphasized.\nWe continue to seek increased participation in our Club O loyalty program, including, in certain instances, by increasing Club O Rewards to our Club O members in lieu of coupons we offer to all customers. For additional information regarding our Club O loyalty program see Item 15 of Part IV, \"Financial Statements\"-Note 2. Accounting Policies, Club O loyalty program.\nThe shift of business from direct to partner (or vice versa) is an economic result based on the economics of each particular product offering at the time and we generally do not have particular goals for an \"appropriate\" mix or percentage for the size of either. Although we have experienced a trend from direct revenue to partner revenue in recent years, we believe that the mix of the business between direct and partner remains consistent with our strategic objectives for our business model in the current economic environment and we do not currently foresee any material shifts in this trend.\nThe products and product lines we offer, and their respective percentages of our revenue, are based on many factors including customer demand, our marketing efforts, promotional pricing, joint-marketing offered by our suppliers, the types of inventory we are able to obtain and the number of SKUs we offer. These factors change frequently and can affect the mix of the product lines we sell. We have experienced a trend toward our home and garden category in recent years and we have recently focused our marketing and branding efforts towards our home and garden product line. We are also working to increase the number of SKUs we offer. While we do not currently expect any material shifts in our product line mix, the relative amounts of the product lines we sell, and the revenue we earn from those product lines, is generally an economic result of the factors described above, which may change from time to time.\nInternational sales were less than 3% of total net revenues for 2017 and 2016.\nGross profit and gross margin\nOur overall gross margins fluctuate based on our sales volume mix between our direct business and partner business; changes in supplier cost and / or sales price, including competitive pricing; inventory management decisions within the direct business; sales coupons and promotions; product mix of sales; and operational and fulfillment costs.\nThe following table reflects our net revenues, cost of goods sold and gross profit for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 (in thousands):\n\nGross margins for the past eight quarterly periods and years ending December 31, 2017 and 2016 were:\n\n\nGross profit for the year ended December 31, 2017 increased 3% compared to the same period in 2016 primarily as a result of increased gross margin. Gross margin increased to 19.5% for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to 18.4% for the same period in 2016. This increase in gross margin was primarily due to a continued shift in sales mix into higher margin home and garden products and an increase in marketplace sales (which we recognize on a net basis), partially offset by increased promotional activities, including coupons and site sales due to our driving a higher proportion of our sales using such promotions.\nThe 225 basis point decrease in direct gross margin for the year ended December 31, 2017, as compared to the same period in 2016, was primarily due to increased promotional activities, including coupons and site sales due to our driving a higher proportion of our sales using such promotions, and increased freight costs primarily in the fourth quarter, partially offset by a shift in sales mix into higher margin home and garden products.\nThe 115 basis point increase in partner gross margin for the year ended December 31, 2017, as compared to the same period in 2016 was primarily due to a continued shift in sales mix into higher margin home and garden products, partially offset by increased promotional activities, including coupons and site sales due to our driving a higher proportion of our sales using such promotions.\nCost of goods sold includes stock-based compensation expense of $183,000 and $266,000 for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.\nFulfillment costs\nFulfillment costs include all warehousing costs, including fixed overhead and variable handling costs (excluding packaging costs), as well as credit card fees and customer service costs, all of which we include as costs in calculating gross margin. We believe that some companies in our industry, including some of our competitors, account for fulfillment costs within operating expenses, and therefore exclude fulfillment costs from gross margin. As a result, our gross margin may not be directly comparable to others in our industry.\nThe following table has been included to provide investors additional information regarding our classification of fulfillment costs, gross profit and margin, thus enabling investors to better compare our gross margin with others in our industry (in thousands): \nFulfillment costs as a percentage of sales may vary due to several factors, such as our ability to manage costs at our warehouses, significant changes in the number of units received and fulfilled, the extent to which we use third party fulfillment services and warehouses, and our ability to effectively manage customer service costs and credit card fees. Fulfillment and related costs remained relatively flat during the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to 2016.\nSee Gross profit and gross margin above for additional discussion.\nOperating expenses\nSales and marketing expenses\nWe use a variety of methods to target our consumer audience, including online campaigns, such as advertising through keywords, product listing ads, display ads, search engines, affiliate marketing programs, social coupon websites, portals, banners, e-mail, direct mail and viral and social media campaigns. We also do brand advertising through television, radio, print ads, and event sponsorships.\nThe following table reflects our sales and marketing expenses for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 (in thousands):\n\nThe 220 basis point increase in sales and marketing expenses as a percentage of revenue for the year ended December 31, 2017, as compared to the same period in 2016, was primarily due to increased spending in sponsored search and display ads on social media, and television marketing channels, and increased staff related costs.\nWhile we work to adapt to Google's changes in its natural search engine algorithms as noted above, we have increased our emphasis on other marketing channels, such as sponsored search, which has generated revenue growth but with higher associated marketing expenses than natural search. We expect this trend to continue while we work to adapt to these changes.\nWe are also experiencing an increasingly competitive digital marketing landscape. We have competitors who are spending significant amounts on advertising bidding up the cost of certain marketing channels, such as paid keywords. While we may not choose to match their levels of spending, this has increased our marketing costs in recent quarters. We expect this trend to continue. However, we do have a number of important digital marketing initiatives that we are testing and implementing that we believe will improve our competitive position in this area.\nSales and marketing expenses include stock-based compensation expense of $415,000 and $249,000 for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.\nWe do not include costs associated with our discounted shipping and other promotions, such as coupons in sales and marketing expense. Rather, we account for them as a reduction of revenue and therefore affect sales and gross margin. We consider discounted shipping and other promotions, such as our policy of free shipping on orders over $45, as an effective marketing tool, and intend to continue to offer them as we deem appropriate as part of our overall marketing plan.\nTechnology expenses\nWe seek to invest efficiently in technology, including web services, customer support solutions, website search, expansion of new and existing product categories, and in technology to enhance the customer experience, improve our process efficiency and support and expand our logistics infrastructure. We may increase our technology expenses to support these initiatives and these increases may be material.\nThe frequency and variety of cyber-attacks on our Website, our corporate systems, and on third parties we use to support our technology continue to increase. The impact of these attacks, their costs, and the costs we incur to protect ourselves against future attacks have not been material. However, we consider the threat from cyber-attacks to be serious and will continue to incur costs related to protecting ourselves against them.\nThe following table reflects our technology expenses for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 (in thousands):\n\nThe $9.1 million increase in technology costs for the year ended December 31, 2017, as compared to the same period in 2016, was primarily due to an increase in staff related costs of $4.9 million, and an increase in technology licenses and maintenance of $4.0 million.\nTechnology expenses include stock-based compensation expense of $649,000 and $777,000 for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.\nGeneral and administrative expenses\nThe following table reflects our general and administrative expenses (\"G&A\") for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 (in thousands):\n\nThe $1.4 million increase in general and administrative expenses (\"G&A\") for the year ended December 31, 2017, as compared to the same period in 2016, was primarily due to an increase in staff related costs of $4.9 million, partially offset by a decrease in legal fees of $3.0 million, and a decrease in bad debt expense of $1.1 million.\nG&A expenses include stock-based compensation expense of approximately $2.8 million and $3.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.\nWe continue to seek opportunities for growth, in our retail business and through our Medici blockchain and financial technology initiatives and through other means. As a result of these initiatives, we will continue to incur additional expenses and may purchase interests in, or make acquisitions of, other technologies or businesses. We anticipate that our initiatives may cause us to incur losses in the foreseeable future. These losses, additional expenses, acquisitions or purchases may be material, and, coupled with existing marketing expense trends, our plans to increase our marketing and branding expenditures, and strategic changes in our retail business, may lead to increased consolidated losses in some periods, and to reduced liquidity. Additionally, we may recognize additional impairment charges from our ownership interest in other entities.\nLitigation settlement\nIn Q1 2016, we entered into a settlement agreement in our prime broker litigation which concluded the litigation in its entirety and we recognized settlement proceeds of $19.5 million. Related costs associated with the litigation and settlement of approximately $1.0 million were included in G&A expenses during Q1 2016.\nDepreciation and amortization expense\nDepreciation expense is classified within the corresponding operating expense categories in the consolidated statements of operations as follows (in thousands):\n\nAmortization of intangible assets other than goodwill is classified within the corresponding operating expense categories in the consolidated statements of operations as follows (in thousands):\n\nNon-operating income (expense)\nInterest expense\nTotal interest expense increased $2.1 million, from $877,000 for the year ended December 31, 2016 to $2.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. The increase in interest expense is primarily due to no longer capitalizing interest on our headquarters loan due to construction completion.\nOther income, net\nOther income, net for the year ended December 31, 2017 was $1.2 million as compared to $14.2 million in 2016. The decrease is primarily due to a decrease in Club O Rewards breakage of $14.2 million due to discontinuing our Club O Silver rewards program in Q4 2016, an increase in impairment charges of $2.6 million related to cost method investments, and an increase in debt extinguishment costs of $2.5 million. These decreases were partially offset by an increase in realized gains on sales of cryptocurrencies and precious metals of $6.6 million.\nIncome taxes\nOur effective tax rate for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 was (134.5)% and 45.3%, respectively. Our effective tax rate is affected by recurring items such as research tax credits and non-recurring items such as changes in valuation allowances. It is also affected to a lesser extent by tax rates in foreign jurisdictions and the relative amount of income we earn in those jurisdictions, which we expect to be fairly consistent in the near term. The decrease in the 2017 effective tax rate relative to the 2016 effective tax rate is primarily attributable to our decision to establish a valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets, net of deferred tax liabilities, as well as the impact of the TCJA. In our decision to establish a valuation allowance, we concluded that the negative evidence outweighed the positive evidence and that it was not more likely than not that all our federal and state deferred tax assets will be realized (see Item 15 of Part IV, \"Financial Statements\"-Note 18. Income Taxes, contained in the \"Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\" of this Annual Report on Form 10-K).\nWe have indefinitely reinvested foreign earnings of $1.3 million at December 31, 2017. The TCJA includes a mandatory deemed repatriation of cumulative foreign earnings for the year ended December 31, 2017, for which we accrued provisional tax expense. However, we would still need to accrue and pay various other taxes on this amount if repatriated. We are currently analyzing our global working capital and cash requirements and the potential tax liabilities attributable to a\nrepatriation, including calculating any excess of the amount for financial reporting over the tax basis in our foreign subsidiaries, but we have yet to determine whether we plan to change our prior assertion and repatriate earnings. Accordingly, we have not recorded any deferred taxes attributable to our investments in our foreign subsidiaries. We will record the tax effects of any change in our prior assertion in the period that we complete our analysis and are able to make a reasonable estimate, and disclose any unrecognized deferred tax liability for temporary differences related to our foreign investments, if practicable, in the period that we are first able to make a reasonable estimate, no later than December 2018.\nSeasonality\nBased upon our historical experience, revenue typically increases during the fourth quarter because of the holiday retail season and gross margin decreases due to increased sales of certain lower margin products, such as electronics. Revenue typically decreases in the following quarter(s), as shown in the table below. The actual quarterly results for each quarter could differ materially depending upon consumer preferences, availability of product and competition, among other risks and uncertainties. Accordingly, there can be no assurances that seasonal variations will not materially affect our results of operations in the future.\nThe following table reflects our total net revenues for each of the quarters in 2017, 2016 and 2015 (in thousands):\n\nComparison of Years Ended December 31, 2016 and 2015\nExecutive Commentary\nThis executive commentary is intended to provide investors with a view of our business through the eyes of our management. As an executive commentary, it necessarily focuses on selected aspects of our business. This executive commentary is intended as a supplement to, but not a substitute for, the more detailed discussion of our business included elsewhere herein. Investors are cautioned to read our entire \"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,\" as well as our interim and audited financial statements, and the discussion of our business and risk factors and other information included elsewhere or incorporated in this report. This executive commentary includes forward-looking statements, and investors are cautioned to read \"Special Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements.\"\nRevenues in 2016 increased 9% compared to 2015. The growth in revenue was primarily due to a 6% increase in average order size, coupled with a 4% increase in orders. These increases were partially offset by increased promotional activities, including coupons and site sales (which we recognize as a reduction of revenue) due to our driving a higher proportion of our sales using such promotions. Our average order size has increased in recent years due primarily to a sales mix shift into home and garden products. We are uncertain how long this trend will continue.\nGross profit in 2016 increased 9% compared to 2015 primarily as a result of revenue growth. Gross margin was flat at 18.4% in 2016 compared to 2015. Gross margin increased due to a continued shift in sales mix into higher margin home and garden products, but that increase was offset by increased promotional activities.\nSales and marketing expenses as a percentage of revenue increased from 7.5% to 8.2% during 2016 as compared to 2015, primarily due to increased spending in the sponsored search marketing channels and increased staff related costs.\nAs a result of these factors, our Contribution increased 8% in 2016 compared to 2015 (see Non-GAAP Financial Measures below for a reconciliation of Contribution to Gross Profit). Contribution margin was 11.1% in 2016 compared to 11.2% in 2015.\nTechnology expenses in 2016 increased $8.2 million compared to 2015, primarily due to an increase in depreciation of $5.9 million, an increase in staff-related costs of $2.5 million, and an increase of $1.6 million in technology licenses and maintenance. These increases were partially offset by a $1.3 million decrease in outside consulting services.\nGeneral and administrative expenses in 2016 increased $7.1 million compared to 2015, primarily due to an increase of $7.6 million in staff related costs and $1.1 million in bad debt expense for accounts receivable due from a marketplace in which we also have a minority interest. These increases were partially offset by a $1.9 million decrease in legal fees and a $1.3 million decrease in consulting and outside services.\nDuring Q3 2016, we recognized an impairment charge of $2.9 million in Other income, net related to an international marketplace company in which we hold a minority interest that has historically been recorded at cost.\nIn Q1 2016, we entered into a settlement agreement in our prime broker litigation which concluded the litigation in its entirety and we recognized settlement proceeds of $19.5 million. Related costs associated with the litigation and settlement of approximately $1.0 million were included in G&A expenses during Q1 2016.\nIn December 2016, as a demonstration of the platform and technology developed by our majority-owned subsidiary t\u00d8.com, Inc., we issued publicly traded preferred shares of Overstock.com, Inc. for proceeds of $7.6 million, net of offering costs. Additionally, as part of our Medici initiatives to develop this technology, in Q1 2016, we completed the acquisition of two registered broker-dealers. In 2015 we acquired a related financial technology company.\nThe balance of our Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations provides further information about the matters discussed above and other important matters affecting our business.\nResults of Operations\nThe following table sets forth our results of operations expressed as a percentage of total net revenue for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014:\n\nRevenue\nThe following table reflects our net revenue for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 (in thousands):\n\nThe primary reason for increased total net revenue for the year ended December 31, 2016, as compared to the same period in 2015, was a 6% increase in average order size, coupled with a 4% increase in orders. These increases were partially offset by increased promotional activities, including coupons and site sales (which we recognize as a reduction of revenue) due to our driving a higher proportion of our sales using such promotions. Our average order size has increased in recent years due primarily to a sales mix shift into home and garden products. We are uncertain how long this trend will continue.\nThe primary reason for decreased direct revenue for the year ended December 31, 2016, as compared to the same period in 2015, was a decrease in sales of home and garden products (primarily due to a shift from our direct segment to our partner segment) in addition to increased promotional activities, including coupons and site sales (which we recognize as a reduction of\nrevenue) due to our driving a higher proportion of our sales using such promotions. Also, the percentage of revenue we defer from orders taken but not delivered was higher due to the timing of year end.\nThe increase in partner revenue for the year ended December 31, 2016, as compared to the same period in 2015, was primarily due to an increase in sales of home and garden products. This increase was partially offset by increased promotional activities, including coupons and site sales (which we recognize as a reduction of revenue) due to our driving a higher proportion of our sales using such promotions.\nSince mid-2015 through the first half of 2016, we experienced some slowing of our overall revenue growth, which we believe was due in part to changes that Google made in its natural search engine algorithms. While we worked to adapt to Google's changes, we increased our emphasis on other marketing channels, such as sponsored search, which generated revenue growth but with higher associated marketing expenses than natural search.\nWe continue to seek increased participation in our Club O loyalty program, including, in certain instances, by increasing Club O Rewards to our Club O members in lieu of coupons we offer to all customers. For additional information regarding our Club O loyalty program see Item 15 of Part IV, \"Financial Statements\"-Note 2. Accounting Policies, Club O loyalty program.\nThe shift of business from direct to partner (or vice versa) is an economic result based on the economics of each particular product offering at the time and we generally do not have particular goals for an \"appropriate\" mix or percentage for the size of either. Although we have experienced a trend from direct revenue to partner revenue in recent years, we believe that the mix of the business between direct and partner remains consistent with our strategic objectives for our business model in the current economic environment and we do not currently foresee any material shifts in this trend.\nThe products and product lines we offer, and their respective percentages of our revenue, are based on many factors including customer demand, our marketing efforts, promotional pricing, joint-marketing offered by our suppliers, the types of inventory we are able to obtain and the number of SKUs we offer. These factors change frequently and can affect the mix of the product lines we sell. We have experienced a trend toward our home and garden category in recent years and we have recently focused our marketing and branding efforts towards our home and garden product line. We are also working to increase the number of SKUs we offer. While we do not currently expect any material shifts in our product line mix, the relative amounts of the product lines we sell, and the revenue we earn from those product lines, is generally an economic result of the factors described above, which may change from time to time.\nInternational sales were less than 2% of total net revenues for 2016 and 2015.\nGross profit and gross margin\nOur overall gross margins fluctuate based on our sales volume mix between our direct business and partner business; changes in supplier cost and / or sales price, including competitive pricing; inventory management decisions within the direct business; sales coupons and promotions; product mix of sales; and operational and fulfillment costs.\nThe following table reflects our net revenues, cost of goods sold and gross profit for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 (in thousands):\n\nGross margins for the past eight quarterly periods and years ending December 31, 2016 and 2015 were:\n\n\nGross profit in 2016 increased 9% compared to 2015 primarily as a result of revenue growth. Gross margin was flat at 18.4% in 2016 compared to 2015. Gross margin increased due to a continued shift in sales mix into higher margin home and garden products, but that increase was offset by increased promotional activities, including coupons and site sales (which we recognize as a reduction of revenue) due to our driving a higher proportion of our sales using such promotions.\nThe 182 basis point decrease in direct gross margin for the year ended December 31, 2016, as compared to the same period in 2015, was primarily due to increased promotional activities, including coupons and site sales (which we recognize as a reduction of revenue) due to our driving a higher proportion of our sales using such promotions, and increased warehousing costs as a percentage of revenue due to lower revenue, partially offset by a shift in sales mix into higher margin products.\nThe 21 basis point decrease in partner gross margin for the year ended December 31, 2016, as compared to the same period in 2015 was primarily due to increased promotional activities, including coupons and site sales (which we recognize as a reduction of revenue) due to our driving a higher proportion of our sales using such promotions, partially offset by a continued shift in sales mix into higher margin home and garden products.\nCost of goods sold includes stock-based compensation expense of $266,000 and $179,000 for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively.\nFulfillment costs\nFulfillment costs include all warehousing costs, including fixed overhead and variable handling costs (excluding packaging costs), as well as credit card fees and customer service costs, all of which we include as costs in calculating gross margin. We believe that some companies in our industry, including some of our competitors, account for fulfillment costs within operating expenses, and therefore exclude fulfillment costs from gross margin. As a result, our gross margin may not be directly comparable to others in our industry.\nThe following table has been included to provide investors additional information regarding our classification of fulfillment costs, gross profit and margin, thus enabling investors to better compare our gross margin with others in our industry (in thousands): \nFulfillment costs as a percentage of sales may vary due to several factors, such as our ability to manage costs at our warehouses, significant changes in the number of units received and fulfilled, the extent to which we use third party fulfillment services and warehouses, and our ability to effectively manage customer service costs and credit card fees. Fulfillment and related costs remained relatively flat during the year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to 2015.\nSee Gross profit and gross margin above for additional discussion.\nOperating expenses\nSales and marketing expenses\nWe use a variety of methods to target our consumer audience, including online campaigns, such as advertising through keywords, product listing ads, display ads, search engines, affiliate marketing programs, social coupon websites, portals, banners, e-mail, direct mail and viral and social media campaigns. We also do brand advertising through television, radio, print ads, and event sponsorships.\nThe following table reflects our sales and marketing expenses for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 (in thousands):\n\nThe 71 basis point increase in sales and marketing expenses as a percentage of revenue for the year ended December 31, 2016, as compared to the same period in 2015, was primarily due to increased spending in the sponsored search marketing channels and increased staff related costs.\nSales and marketing expenses include stock-based compensation expense of $249,000 and $217,000 for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively.\nCosts associated with our discounted shipping and other promotions, such as coupons, are not included in marketing expense. Rather, they are accounted for as a reduction of revenue and therefore affect sales and gross margin. We consider discounted shipping and other promotions, such as our policy of free shipping on orders over $45, as an effective marketing tool, and intend to continue to offer them as we deem appropriate as part of our overall marketing plan.\nWe constantly evaluate where we spend our sales and marketing dollars and have experienced a trend of increasing costs to acquire customers. From time to time, our competitors may bid up the cost of certain marketing channels, such as paid keywords. At such times, we may reduce the amounts we spend in those marketing channels, which may lead to decreased visitors to our site for a time. For example, during Q4 2016 and Q4 2015, the number of unique visitors to our site decreased by approximately 2% and 8%, respectively, as compared to the prior years, in part we believe as a result of such changes.\nTechnology expenses\nWe seek to invest efficiently in technology, including web services, customer support solutions, website search, expansion of new and existing product categories, and in technology to enhance the customer experience, improve our process efficiency and support and expand our logistics infrastructure. We may increase our technology expenses to support these initiatives and these increases may be material.\nThe frequency and variety of cyber-attacks on our Website, our corporate systems, and on third parties that we use to support our technology continue to increase, including an attack that took place in October 2016 which interrupted traffic for several major websites in the United States. The impact of these attacks, their costs, and the costs we incur to protect ourselves against future attacks have not been material. However, we consider the threat from cyber-attacks to be serious and will continue to incur costs related to protecting ourselves against them.\nThe following table reflects our technology expenses for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 (in thousands):\n\nThe $8.2 million increase in technology costs for the year ended December 31, 2016, as compared to the same period in 2015, was primarily due to an increase in depreciation and amortization of $5.9 million, an increase in staff-related costs of $2.5 million (net employee and contractor change), and an increase of $1.6 million in technology licenses and maintenance. These increases were partially offset by a $1.3 million decrease in outside consulting services.\nTechnology expenses include stock-based compensation expense of $777,000 and $646,000 for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively.\nGeneral and administrative expenses\nThe following table reflects our general and administrative expenses (\"G&A\") for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 (in thousands):\n\nThe $7.1 million increase in general and administrative expenses (\"G&A\") for the year ended December 31, 2016, as compared to the same period in 2015, was primarily due to an increase of $7.6 million in staff related costs and $1.1 million in bad debt expense for accounts receivable due from a marketplace in which also we have a minority interest. These increases were partially offset by a $1.9 million decrease in legal fees and a $1.3 million decrease in consulting and outside services.\nG&A expenses include stock-based compensation expense of approximately $3.6 million and $2.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively.\nDuring 2016, our Medici-related subsidiaries incurred a pre-tax loss of approximately $11.8 million, which includes $4.4 million of amortization and depreciation expense. During 2015, our Medici-related subsidiaries incurred a pre-tax loss of approximately $7.0 million, which includes $1.5 million of amortization and depreciation expense.\nLitigation settlement\nIn Q1 2016, we entered into a settlement agreement in our prime broker litigation which concluded the litigation in its entirety and we recognized settlement proceeds of $19.5 million. Related costs associated with the litigation and settlement of approximately $1.0 million were included in G&A expenses during Q1 2016.\nDepreciation and amortization expense\nDepreciation expense is classified within the corresponding operating expense categories in the consolidated statements of operations as follows (in thousands):\n\nAmortization of intangible assets other than goodwill is classified within the corresponding operating expense categories in the consolidated statements of operations as follows (in thousands):\n\nNon-operating income (expense)\nInterest expense\nTotal interest expense increased $737,000, or 526%, from $140,000 in 2015 to $877,000 in 2016. The increase in interest expense is primarily due to no longer capitalizing interest on our headquarters loan due to construction completion.\nOther income (expense), net\nOther income, net for the year ended December 31, 2016 was $14.2 million as compared to $3.6 million in 2015. The increase is primarily due to increased Club O Rewards breakage of $10.9 million due to growth in the Club O Rewards program, particularly our Club O Silver program, a $1.2 million decrease in unrealized losses on our precious metals (no losses incurred in 2016), and an $850,000 decrease in costs related to cryptobond transactions (none incurred in 2016). These increases were partially offset by an impairment charge of $2.9 million related to a company in which we hold a minority interest that has historically been recorded at cost.\nBeginning in 2015, we enrolled a significant number of members in Club O Silver, a newly introduced Club O membership tier for customers who agree to receive promotional emails. Club O Silver members earned Club O Rewards on qualifying purchases that expire after 90 days from a qualifying purchase. We discontinued Club O Silver in October 2016, and as a result we do not expect further Club O Silver rewards breakage in the future.\nIncome taxes\nOur effective tax rate for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 was 45.3% and 60.8%, respectively. Our effective tax rate is affected by recurring items such as research tax credits and non-recurring items such as changes in valuation allowances. It is also affected to a lesser extent by tax rates in foreign jurisdictions and the relative amount of income we earn in those jurisdictions, which we expect to be fairly consistent in the near term. The decrease in the 2016 effective tax rate relative to the 2015 effective tax rate is primarily attributable to our increased pre-tax income in 2016 over 2015 and increased ownership of our majority-owned subsidiary, tZERO. Prior to Q3 2015, we owned 75.1% of tZERO. Tax losses incurred while holding less than 80% of the business cannot offset our consolidated taxable income and are fully valued. The operating losses that tZERO incurred after we increased our ownership during Q3 2015 did not require a valuation allowance since the subsidiary now qualified for tax consolidation. The decrease in the effective tax rate was partially offset by an increase in our\nvaluation allowance for capital losses due to an impairment loss on a minority interest in an international marketplace and share-based compensation tax deficiencies due to a decline in our stock price. We expect volatility in our tax rate in future periods due to share-based compensation deductions that will result from our adoption of ASU No. 2016-09, Compensation-Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting.\nWe had indefinitely reinvested foreign earnings of $421,000 at December 31, 2016. We would need to accrue and pay U.S. income tax on this amount if repatriated. At the time, we did not intend to repatriate these earnings.\nSeasonality\nBased upon our historical experience, revenue typically increases during the fourth quarter because of the holiday retail season and gross margin decreases due to increased sales of certain lower margin products, such as electronics. Revenue typically decreases in the following quarter(s), as shown in the table below. The actual quarterly results for each quarter could differ materially depending upon consumer preferences, availability of product and competition, among other risks and uncertainties. Accordingly, there can be no assurances that seasonal variations will not materially affect our results of operations in the future.\nThe following table reflects our total net revenues for each of the quarters in 2016, 2015 and 2014 (in thousands):\n\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nOverview\nAlthough we believe that our cash and cash equivalents currently on hand and expected cash flows from future operations will be sufficient to continue operations for at least the next twelve months, we also believe that we will need to raise additional capital and/or obtain significant additional debt financing to be able to fully pursue our plans for increasing market share in our retail business while also funding the needs of our Medici initiatives.\nWe believe that some of our direct competitors spend significantly higher percentages of their revenue on marketing than we do, and that we need to increase our branding and marketing expenditures in order to increase our market share in the e-commerce home goods market and educate consumers about our current position as an online retailer offering a wide assortment of quality home goods and other products at low prices and with a high level of customer service. We have developed and implemented marketing and branding initiatives to address this, and believe that additional marketing and branding efforts will have significant long-term positive results. However, a significant increase in our branding and marketing expenditures or other expenses would be likely to adversely affect our short-term results.\nWe also want to invest in additional distribution facilities to speed shipping and improve our customer service; in additional automation, technology and engineering resources because we believe they can improve our customers' shopping experience and increase our sales; in our Club O rewards program, primarily to increase member benefits and to develop additional personalization programs; and in expansion of our private label initiative because we believe that private label brands can generate significant brand equity and customer loyalty. See Item 1 of Part I, \"Business\"-\"Our Retail Business\"-\"Growth Strategies for Our E-Commerce Business.\"\nOur Medici initiatives also require substantial funding. Medici Ventures and its majority-owned subsidiary, tZERO, continue to identify, evaluate and pursue various opportunities for strategic acquisitions or purchases of interests to add to the services and expertise they offer their customers. See Item 1 of Part I, \"Business\"-Medici for information regarding our recent and planned strategic acquisitions or purchases of interests.\nOur ability to pursue some or all of these plans, and the extent to which we would be able to pursue some or all of them, will depend on the resources we have available, and will require significantly more capital than we currently have.\nCurrent sources of liquidity\nWe believe that our cash and cash equivalents currently on hand and expected cash flows from future operations will be sufficient to continue operations for at least the next twelve months. Our failure to generate sufficient revenues or profits or to obtain additional financing or raise additional capital could have a material adverse effect on our operations and on our ability to achieve our business objectives. Any projections of future cash needs and cash flows are subject to substantial uncertainty.\nIn November 2017, we entered into a $40.0 million loan agreement with PCL L.L.C., an entity directly or indirectly wholly owned by the mother and brother of our Chief Executive Officer, Dr. Patrick Byrne. For additional information, see Borrowings-PCL loan below.\nIn November 2017, we issued two warrants to purchase the company's common stock in privately negotiated transactions for an aggregate purchase price of $6.5 million. In December 2017, one warrant was exercised and we issued common shares of Overstock.com, Inc. for proceeds of $100.0 million before expenses. On January 17, 2018, the other warrant was exercised in full and proceeds of $50.6 million were received.\nIn December 2017, tZERO launched an offering (the \"security token offering\") of the right to acquire, if issued by tZERO in the future, tZERO Preferred Equity Tokens (the \"tZERO Security Token\") through a Simple Agreement for Future Equity (\"SAFE\"). The security token offering is expected to run through May 14, 2018 but may be extended or shortened and is subject to withdrawal rights under certain circumstances. As of March 14, 2018, tZERO has received $91.4 million in proceeds, net of requested withdrawals.\nOur principal sources of liquidity are cash flows generated from operations, and our existing cash and cash equivalents. At December 31, 2017, we had cash and cash equivalents of $203.2 million.\nCash flow information is as follows (in thousands):\n\nFree cash flow\n\"Free Cash Flow\" (a non-GAAP measure) for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, was $(58.9) million and $(32.7) million, respectively. See Non-GAAP Financial Measures below for a reconciliation of Free Cash Flow to net cash provided by (used in) operating activities.\nCash flows from operating activities\nFor the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, our operating activities resulted in net cash outflow of $35.3 million and net cash inflow of $39.6 million, respectively.\nCash received from customers generally corresponds to our net revenues as our customers primarily use credit cards to buy from us causing our receivables from these sales transactions to settle quickly. We have payment terms with our partners that generally extend beyond the amount of time necessary to collect proceeds from our customers. As a result, following our typically seasonally strong fourth quarter sales, at December 31 of each year, our cash, cash equivalents and accounts payable balances normally reach their highest level (other than as a result of cash flows provided by or used in investing and financing activities). However, our accounts payable balance normally declines during the first three months following year-end, which normally results in a decline in our cash and cash equivalents balances from the year-end balance. The seasonality of our business normally causes payables and accruals to grow significantly in the fourth quarter, and then decrease in the first quarter when they are typically paid.\nThe $35.3 million of net cash used in operating activities during the year ended December 31, 2017 was primarily from a consolidated net loss of $111.9 million, and a decrease in accounts payable of $21.0 million. These were partially offset\nby non-cash deferred income taxes of $65.2 million, and depreciation of $28.8 million. The change in accounts payable was primarily due to lower sales volume in December 2017 compared to the same period in 2016. We recorded a significant amount of deferred income taxes in 2017 attributable to our decision to establish a valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets, net of deferred tax liabilities, as well as the impact of the TCJA. Depreciation expense incurred is primarily due to depreciation of web development projects and our new corporate headquarters.\nThe $39.6 million of net cash provided by operating activities during the year ended December 31, 2016 was primarily from non-cash depreciation of $27.3 million, an increase in accrued expenses of $16.9 million, and consolidated net income of $11.2 million. These were offset by a decrease in accounts payable of $18.8 million. Depreciation expense incurred is primarily due to the depreciation of web development projects and our new corporate headquarters which was completed in Q3 2016. The change in accounts payable was primarily due to timing of payments to suppliers. In 2016, some holiday sales occurred earlier than in 2015 (including sales on Black Friday and Cyber Monday) which resulted in earlier payments to our suppliers resulting in lower operating cash flow than in 2015. Changes in accrued liabilities were also due to timing of invoice approval.\nCash flows from investing activities\nFor the year ended December 31, 2017, investing activities resulted in net cash outflows of $18.0 million, primarily from expenditures for fixed assets of $23.6 million, equity method investments of $3.0 million, and cost method investments of $2.2 million, offset by proceeds from sale of precious metals of $11.9 million.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2016, investing activities resulted in net cash outflows of $79.4 million, primarily from expenditures for fixed assets of $72.3 million, cost method investments of $4.8 million and disbursements for loans made of $3.7 million.\nCash flows from financing activities\nFor the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, financing activities resulted in net cash inflows of $73.4 million and $52.7 million, respectively.\nThe $73.4 million provided by financing activities during the year ended December 31, 2017 resulted primarily from $100.0 million of proceeds from exercise of a stock warrant, $40.0 million of proceeds from our PCL term loan, offset by $45.8 million of repayments on our U.S. Bank term loan, $15.3 million of repayments on lease finance obligations with U.S. Bank and $11.2 million of purchases of treasury stock.\nThe $52.7 million provided by financing activities during the year ended December 31, 2016 resulted primarily from $36.3 million of proceeds from our U.S. Bank term loan, $11.4 million of proceeds from lease finance obligations with U.S. Bank and $7.6 million of proceeds, net of offering costs, from our preferred stock offering in Q4 2016, partially offset by $1.9 million for payments on finance obligations.\nContractual Obligations and Commitments\nThe following table summarizes our contractual obligations as of December 31, 2017 and the effect such obligations and commitments are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flow in future periods (in thousands):\n\nPCL term loan payments\nWe are party to a financing agreement related to our corporate headquarters (see Borrowings below). The amounts presented reflect our related principal and interest payments.\nOperating leases\nFrom time to time we enter into operating leases for facilities and equipment for use in our operations.\nPurchase obligations\nThe amount of purchase obligations shown above is based on assumptions regarding the legal enforceability against us of inventory purchase orders we had outstanding at December 31, 2017. Under different assumptions regarding our rights to cancel our purchase orders or different assumptions regarding the enforceability of the purchase orders under applicable law, the amount of purchase obligations shown in the table above would be less.\nTechnology services\nFrom time to time we enter into long-term contractual agreements for technology services and capital leases for equipment included in such service agreements.\nTax contingencies\nWe are involved in various tax matters, the outcomes of which are uncertain. As of December 31, 2017 and 2016, tax contingencies were $1.7 million and $1.5 million, respectively, which are included in our reconciliation of unrecognized tax benefits (see Item 15 of Part IV, \"Financial Statements\"-Note 18. Income Taxes, contained in the \"Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\" of this Annual Report on Form 10-K). We expect the total amount of tax contingencies to increase in the future. In addition, changes in state, federal, and foreign tax laws may increase our tax contingencies. The timing of the resolution of income tax contingencies is highly uncertain, and the amounts ultimately paid, if any, upon resolution of issues raised by the taxing authorities may differ from the amounts accrued. It is reasonably possible that within the next 12 months we will receive additional assessments by various tax authorities. These assessments may or may not result in changes to our contingencies related to positions on prior years' tax filings.\nBorrowings\nPCL L.L.C. term loan agreement\nOn November 6, 2017, we entered into a loan agreement with PCL L.L.C., an entity directly or indirectly wholly owned by the mother and brother of our Chief Executive Officer, Dr. Patrick Byrne. The agreement provides for a $40.0 million term loan (the \"PCL Loan\") which carries an annual interest rate of 8.0% and a default rate of 18.0%. The PCL Loan is for a term of 18 months, subject to mandatory prepayment under certain circumstances, and is prepayable at our election at any time without penalty or premium. Interest only is due monthly.\nThe principal amount and any then unpaid interest will be due and payable on May 1, 2019 subject to mandatory prepayment in the event of a sale or encumbrance of the headquarters building or a change of ownership of Overstock or the occurrence of certain other events, including material changes to Overstock's business, the loss of management control of Overstock by Dr. Patrick Byrne and other events. The PCL Loan is secured by our corporate headquarters and the related land, fixtures and certain related personal property. We incurred insignificant debt issuance costs with the new loan agreement. The $40.0 million proceeds from this loan together with our cash resources were used to repay the remaining outstanding balances and terminate the U.S. Bank Term Loan, Revolving Loan, Master Lease Agreement, and associated derivative instruments.\nAt December 31, 2017, our outstanding balance on the PCL Loan was $40.0 million. Amounts outstanding under the Term Loan are presented net of discount and issuance costs in our consolidated balance sheets.\nU.S. Bank letters of credit\nAt December 31, 2017 and 2016, letters of credit totaling $355,000, were issued on our behalf collateralized by compensating cash balances held at U.S. Bank, which are included in Restricted cash in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.\nU.S. Bank commercial purchasing card agreement\nWe have a commercial purchasing card (the \"Purchasing Card\") agreement with U.S. Bank. We use the Purchasing Card for business purpose purchasing and must pay it in full each month. At December 31, 2017, $822,000 was outstanding and $4.2 million was available under the Purchasing Card. At December 31, 2016, $811,000 was outstanding and $4.2 million was available under the Purchasing Card.\nOther Factors that May Affect Future Results\nWe believe that our cash and cash equivalents currently on hand and expected cash flows from future operations will be sufficient to continue operations for at least the next twelve months. Any projections of future cash needs and cash flows are subject to substantial uncertainty. See Item 1A of Part I, \"Risk Factors.\"\nWe periodically evaluate opportunities to repurchase our equity securities, obtain credit facilities, or issue additional debt or equity securities. In addition, we may, from time to time, consider the investment in, or acquisition of, complementary businesses, products, services, or technologies, any of which might affect our liquidity requirements or cause us to issue additional debt or equity securities. There can be no assurance that financing arrangements will be available in amounts or on terms acceptable to us, if at all. Our future results may be significantly different from our historical results for several other reasons as well, including the possibility discussed in this Annual Report on Form 10-K that we may sell our retail business, which would have a dramatic effect on our future results. Other reasons that our future results may be significantly different from our historical results include the potential effects on us of the accounting and tax changes discussed in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, the security token offering being conducted by our majority-owned subsidiary tZERO, and other reasons described in Item 1. Business\u201d under Our Retail Business,\u201d Medici,\u201d and Potential Strategic Initiatives,\u201d as well as the risk factors described in Item 1A. Risk Factors.\u201d\nAny investment in our securities involves a high degree of risk. Investors should consider carefully the risks and uncertainties described in this Form 10-K, including the risks described in Item 1A of Part I, \"Risk Factors\", and all other information in this Form 10-K and in our other filings with the SEC including those we file after we file this Form 10-K, before deciding whether to purchase or hold our securities. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also become important factors that may harm our business. The occurrence of any of the risks described under \"Risk Factors\" in this report could harm our business. The trading price of our securities could decline due to any of these risks and uncertainties, and investors may lose part or all of their investment.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that would be material to investors.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nRegulation G, Conditions for Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures, and other SEC regulations regulate the disclosure of certain non-GAAP financial information.\nContribution and contribution margin\nContribution and contribution margin (non-GAAP financial measures - which we reconcile to \"Gross Profit\" in our consolidated statement of operations) consist of gross profit less sales and marketing expense plus Club O Rewards and gift card breakage and reflects an additional way of viewing our results. Contribution margin is contribution as a percentage of total net revenue. We believe contribution and contribution margin provide management and users of the financial statements information about our ability to cover our operating costs, such as technology and general and administrative expenses, while reflecting the selling costs we incurred to generate our revenues and adding back the reductions in revenue that we recognized for Club O Rewards that have subsequently expired and for gift cards whose redemption is remote. Contribution and contribution margin are used in addition to and in conjunction with results presented in accordance with GAAP and should not be relied upon to the exclusion of GAAP financial measures. The material limitation associated with the use of contribution is that it is an incomplete measure of profitability as it does not include all operating expenses or all non-operating income and expenses. Management compensates for these limitations when using this measure by looking at other GAAP measures, such as operating income and net income. You should review our financial statements and publicly-filed reports in their entirety and not rely on any single financial measure. For additional information regarding our segment reporting, see Item 15 of Part IV,\n\"Financial Statements\"-Note 21. Business Segments, contained in the \"Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\" of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nOur calculation of our consolidated contribution and contribution margin is set forth below (in thousands):\n\nOur calculation of our contribution and contribution margin by Retail Total (which consists of Direct and Partner) and Other (which consists of Medici) is set forth below (in thousands):\n\nFor additional information regarding our segment reporting, see Item 15 of Part IV, \"Financial Statements\"-Note 21. Business Segments, contained in the \"Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\" of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nFree cash flow\nFree cash flow (a non-GAAP financial measure) reflects an additional way of viewing our cash flows and liquidity that, when viewed with our GAAP results, provides a more complete understanding of factors and trends affecting our cash flows and liquidity. Free cash flow, which we reconcile below to \"Net cash provided by (used in) operating activities,\" the nearest GAAP financial measure, is net cash provided by operating activities reduced by \"Expenditures for fixed assets, including internal-use software and website development.\" We believe that net cash provided by operating activities is an important measure, since it includes both the cash impact of the continuing operations of the business and changes in the balance sheet that impact cash. We believe free cash flow is a useful measure to evaluate our business since purchases of fixed assets are a necessary component of ongoing operations and free cash flow measures the amount of cash we have available for mandatory debt service and financing obligations, changes in our capital structure, and future investments after purchases of fixed assets. Free cash flow measures have limitations as they omit certain components of the overall consolidated statement of cash flows and do not represent the residual cash flow available for discretionary expenditures. Free cash flow should not be considered a substitute for net income or cash flow data prepared in accordance with GAAP and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies. Therefore, we believe it is important to view free cash flow as a complement to our entire consolidated statements of cash flows as reconciled below (in thousands):\n", "item_7_tables": "Table 223:

algorithms. Gross profit increased 3% due to higher gross margins. \n\n- Operating expenses increased primarily due to higher sales and marketing costs from increased spending in sponsored search, display ads, and staff costs. This led to lower contribution and contribution margin.\n\n- Net loss in 2017 was $111.9 million, compared to net income of $11.2 million in 2016, primarily due to operating losses and a large income tax expense. The tax expense was high due to establishing a valuation allowance on deferred tax assets and the impact of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. \n\n- Cash from operations was negative $35.3 million in 2017 compared to positive $39.6 million in 2016, mainly due to the net loss and changes in accounts payable. Investing activities used cash for fixed asset expenditures. Financing activities provided cash mainly from debt and equity issuances.\n\n- The company believes it needs more capital to increase marketing/branding, expand facilities/automation, grow Club O rewards, and expand private labels in its retail business. It also needs funding for its Medici blockchain initiatives.\n\n- The company has uncertainty about the future due to potential changes in accounting standards, the tZERO security token offering, and strategic initiatives like potentially selling its retail business."}
