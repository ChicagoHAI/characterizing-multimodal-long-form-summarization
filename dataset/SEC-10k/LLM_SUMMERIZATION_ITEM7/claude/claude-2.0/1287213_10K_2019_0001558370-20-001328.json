Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThe following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2018 and 2019 should be read together with our audited consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Some of the information contained in this discussion and analysis or set forth elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including information with respect to our plans and strategies for our business, includes forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. You should review the Risk Factors\u201d section of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a discussion of important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the results described in, or implied by, the forward-looking statements contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nResults of Operations\nOperating Segments\nDuring the first quarter of 2019, the Company reorganized its business segments to reflect a new operating structure as a result of a change in how the Company's chief operating decision maker allocates resources, makes operating decisions and assesses the performance of the business. Under the revised reporting structure, the Company's two reportable business segments are as follows:\nWork Truck Attachments. The Work Truck Attachments segment includes our operations that manufacture and sell snow and ice control attachments and other products sold under the FISHER\u00ae, WESTERN\u00ae, and SNOWEX\u00ae brands. As described under Seasonality and Year-To- Year Variability,\u201d the Work Truck Attachments segment is seasonal and, as a result, its results of operations can vary from quarter-to-quarter and from year-to-year.\nWork Truck Solutions. The Work Truck Solutions segment includes manufactured municipal snow and ice control products under the HENDERSON\u00ae brand and the upfit of market leading attachments and storage solutions under the HENDERSON\u00ae brand, and the DEJANA\u00ae brand and its related sub-brands.\nSee Note 17 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for information concerning individual segment performance for the years ended December 31, 2019, December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017, respectively.\nOverview\nAlthough we diversified and expanded our portfolio with the acquisition of Dejana during the year ended December 31, 2016, snowfall is still the primary factor in evaluating our business results due to its significant impact on the results of operations of our Work Truck Attachments segment. We typically compare the snowfall level in a given period both to the snowfall level in the prior season and to those snowfall levels we consider to be average. References to average snowfall\u201d levels below refer to the aggregate average inches of snowfall recorded in 66 cities in 26 snow-belt states in the United States during the annual snow season, from October 1 through March 31, from 1980 to 2019. During this period, snowfall averaged 3,046 inches, with the low in such period being 1,794 inches and the high being 4,502 inches. Meanwhile, over the last 10 years, snowfall averaged 3,237 inches for the snow periods ending March 31, 2010 through 2019.\nDuring the six-month snow season ended March 31, 2019, snowfall was 3,154 inches, which was 3.5% higher than average. During the six-month snow season ended March 31, 2018, we experienced snowfall that was 9.6% higher than average. During the six-month snow season ended March 31, 2017, we experienced snowfall that was 5.4% lower than average. While snowfall trended above average the past two years based on historical averages from 1980 to 2019, snowfall was 2.6% below average compared to the average over the last 10 years. Additionally, the timing and location of snowfall can have an impact on our financial results. We believe the near-average snowfall in the year ended December 31, 2019 was the largest driver that positively impacted our business in 2019. We believe other factors had a positive impact, including positively trending light truck sales in 2019 and the continued successful integration of Dejana. In both 2018 and 2019, we encountered chassis availability issues\nwith certain of our OEM partners, which negatively impacted our business, although in 2019 chassis predictability has improved when compared to the prior year.\nThe following table sets forth, for the periods presented, the consolidated statements of income of the Company and its subsidiaries. All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. In the table below and throughout this Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,\u201d consolidated statements of income data for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2018 and 2019 have been derived from our audited consolidated financial statements.

Net sales were $571.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to $524.1 million in 2018, an increase of $47.6 million, or 9.1%. Net sales increased for the year ended December 31, 2019 primarily due to higher volumes driven by ongoing positive demand, price increases and improved chassis predictability. See below for a discussion of net sales for each of our segments.\nTable 74: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>For the year ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2019\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net sales\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Work Truck Attachments\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>238,889\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>275,244\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>293,630\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Work Truck Solutions\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>236,038\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>248,823\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>278,080\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>474,927\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>524,067\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>571,710\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table> Net sales at our Work Truck Attachment segment were $293.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to $275.2 million in the year ended December 31, 2018, an increase of $18.4 million primarily due to strong sales during our preseason period and increased parts and accessories sales, as well as price recovery on higher material costs.\nNet sales at our Work Truck Solutions segment were $278.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to $248.8 million in the year ended December 31, 2018, an increase of $29.3 million due primarily to increased demand, including certain large fleet orders, price recovery on higher material costs, as well as continued improvements in chassis supply predictability when compared to the prior year.\nCost of Sales. Cost of sales was $402.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to $369.2 million in 2018, an increase of $33.7 million, or 9.1%. Cost of sales as a percentage of net sales increased slightly from 70.4% for the year ended December 31, 2018 to 70.5% for the year ended December 31, 2019. The slight increase in cost of sales in the year ended December 31, 2019 when compared to the year ended December 31, 2018 was primarily due to increased healthcare and labor costs, as well as a higher cost of sales as a percentage of sales for Work Truck Solutions products, which historically has operated at lower margins than the Work Truck Attachments segment, offset by operating efficiencies in the Work Truck Solutions segment.\nGross Profit. Gross profit was $168.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to $154.9 million in 2018, an increase of $13.9 million, or 9.0%, due to the increase in net sales described above under -Net Sales.\u201d As a percentage of net sales, gross profit decreased slightly from 29.6% for the year ended December 31, 2018 to 29.5% for the corresponding period in 2019, as a result of the factors discussed above under -Cost of Sales.\u201d\nSelling, General and Administrative Expense. Selling, general and administrative expenses, including intangible asset amortization, were $82.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to $81.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, an increase of $0.8 million, or 1.0%. The increase compared to the year ended December 31, 2018 was primarily due to an increase in healthcare costs and an increase in variable compensation due to improved operating results, offset by a decrease in stock compensation expense related to plan design changes implemented in the prior year and planned management transitions that occurred in 2019, and a decrease in legal expenses related to a patent infringement case in the prior year. In addition, there were decreases in earnout expense of $0.4 million in the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to $0.9 million in the year ended December 31, 2018 driven by the earnout valuation adjustments in the respective periods. As a percentage of net sales, selling, general and administrative expenses, including intangibles amortization, decreased from 15.5% for the year ended December 31, 2018 to 14.4% for the corresponding period in 2019.\nInterest Expense. Interest expense was $16.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to $16.9 million in the corresponding period in 2018. The slight decrease in interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2019 was primarily due to the reduction to the principal balance of the Term Loan Credit Agreement due to a $30.0 million voluntary prepayment made in February 2019, offset by an increase in interest expense on revolver borrowings of $0.4 million when compared to the prior year.\nPension Termination. Pension termination costs were $6.6 million in the year ended December 31, 2019, as a result of the Company successfully terminating its pension plans during the period. See Note 13 for additional information on the termination of the pension plans.\nIncome Tax Expense. Our effective combined federal and state tax rate for 2019 was 21.5% compared to 21.3% for 2018. The effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2019 is slightly higher than 2018 primarily due to a decrease in the release of reserves for uncertain tax positions of $0.5 million; $0.8 million in the year ended December 31, 2019 versus $1.3 million in the year ended December 31, 2018. The Company also made a voluntary pension funding payment in the year ended December 31, 2018 of $7.0 million which was deducted in the Company's tax returns for the year ended December 31, 2017 reducing taxable income for that period. The increased pension funding deduction resulted in a tax benefit of $0.7 million, also decreasing the tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2018. The increase in effective tax rate was partially offset by decreases in the rate related to state rate changes driven by legislative changes in tax laws in one of the states in which we operate, and a benefit related to the increase in officer life insurance as a result of market performance.\nDeferred income taxes reflect the net tax effects of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes. The largest item affecting the deferred taxes is the difference between book and tax amortization of goodwill and other intangible amortization.\nNet Income. Net income for the year ended December 31, 2019 was $49.2 million compared to net income of $43.9 million for 2018, an increase of $5.3 million. This increase was driven by the factors described above.\nYear Ended December 31, 2018 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2017\nNet Sales. Net sales were $524.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to $474.9 million in 2017, an increase of $49.2 million, or 10.4%. Net sales increased for the year ended December 31, 2018 primarily due to snowfall levels near historical averages in the snow season ended March 31, 2018, an increase compared to below average snowfall levels during the prior snow season. Additionally, the increase in sales was due to increased volume at our Work Truck Solutions segment and higher pricing across both segments. This increase was partially offset by chassis supply availability issues in both segments. See below for a discussion of net sales for each of our segments.\nNet sales at our Work Truck Attachment segment were $275.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to $238.9 million in the year ended December 31, 2017, an increase of $36.3 million primarily due to higher levels of snowfall in the snow season ended March 31, 2018 compared to the snow season ended March 31, 2017. Snowfall during the snow season ended March 31, 2018 were near historical averages, an increase compared to the snow season ended March 31, 2017, which saw below average snowfall levels.\nNet sales at our Work Truck Solutions segment were $248.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to $236.0 million in the year ended December 31, 2017, an increase of $12.8 million due primarily to increased demand from generally favorable macro-economic conditions and the inclusion of incremental sales from additional facilities of $5.3 million in the year ended December 31, 2018 versus 2017. Strong sales for work truck upfits were slightly offset by sales decreases in our municipal products, due to ongoing chassis supply availability issues.\nCost of Sales. Cost of sales was $369.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to $331.8 million in 2017, an increase of $37.4 million, or 11.3%. Cost of sales as a percentage of net sales increased from 69.9% for the year ended December 31, 2017 to 70.4% for the year ended December 31, 2018. The increase in cost of sales in the year ended December 31, 2018 when compared to the year ended December 31, 2017 was primarily due to higher cost of sales as a percentage of sales for Work Truck Solutions products, growth in lower margin product lines, and inflation.\nGross Profit. Gross profit was $154.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to $143.1 million in 2017, an increase of $11.8 million, or 8.2%, due to the increase in net sales described above under -Net Sales.\u201d As a percentage of net sales, gross profit decreased from 30.1% for the year ended December 31,\n2017 to 29.6% for the corresponding period in 2018, as a result of the factors discussed above under -Cost of Sales.\u201d\nSelling, General and Administrative Expense. Selling, general and administrative expenses, including intangible asset amortization, were $81.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to $72.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, an increase of $9.1 million, or 12.6%. The increase compared to the year ended December 31, 2017 was primarily due to an increase in variable compensation of $3.5 million due to improved operating results, higher stock compensation expense of $1.1 million related to plan design changes, increased discretionary spending including $0.9 million related to advertising and promotions as a result of a return to average snowfall levels, as well as increased costs related to headcount and wages. In addition, there were decreases in earnout expense of $0.9 million in the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to $1.8 million in the year ended December 31, 2017 driven by the earnout valuation adjustments in the respective periods. As a percentage of net sales, selling, general and administrative expenses, including intangibles amortization, increased from 15.2% for the year ended December 31, 2017 to 15.5% for the corresponding period in 2018 due to the factors noted above.\nInterest Expense. Interest expense was $16.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to $18.3 million in the corresponding period in 2017. The decrease in interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2018 was due to $1.6 million of financing costs that were expensed in the year ended December 31, 2017 related to the amendments to its Term Loan Credit Agreement to decrease the interest rate margins that apply to the term loan facility, which were completed in February 2017 and August 2017. Additionally, the Company had a more favorable interest rate in 2018 due to the debt refinances, as well as a lower debt balance from repayments of $33.1 million in 2018. This decrease was partially offset by increased interest on higher revolver borrowings in 2018 compared to 2017.\nLitigation Proceeds. Litigation proceeds were $1.3 million year ended December 31, 2017 due to a settlement related to the successful conclusion of a patent infringement lawsuit against Meyer Products, LLC.\nIncome Tax Expense (Benefit). Deferred income taxes reflect the net tax effects of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes. The largest item affecting the deferred taxes is the difference between book and tax amortization of goodwill and other intangible amortization. Our effective combined federal and state tax rate for 2018 was 21.3% compared to (4.6%) for 2017. The effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2017 is significantly lower than 2018 primarily due to the revaluation of the deferred tax assets and liabilities in 2017 resulting from the passage of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act ( The Act\u201d). As a result of the reduction in the U.S. corporate income tax rate from 35.0% to 21.0% under the Act, the Company recorded a reduction to its net deferred tax liability of $22.5 million, and a corresponding decrease to income tax expense in the Company's Consolidated Statement of Operations for the year ended December 31, 2017. Contributing to the tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2018 was the release of reserves for uncertain tax positions of $1.3 million. The Company also made a voluntary pension funding payment in the year ended December 31, 2018 of $7.0 million which was deducted in the Company's tax returns for the year ended December 31, 2017 reducing taxable income for that period. The increased pension funding deduction resulted in a tax benefit of $0.7 million, also decreasing the tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2018 as this deduction was not included in the provision recorded at December 31, 2017. Without these items, the Company's tax rate would have been approximately 25.0% in the year ended December 31, 2018.\nOn December 22, 2017, the SEC staff issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118 ( SAB 118\u201d) to address the application of U.S. GAAP in situations when a registrant does not have the necessary information available, prepared, or analyzed (including computations) in reasonable detail to complete the accounting for certain income tax effects of The Tax Reform Act. As of the date of this Annual Report, we have recorded all known enactment-date income tax effects of the Act. These adjustments have been recorded as a component of income tax expense and include the revaluation of deferred tax assets and liabilities. In the year ended December 31, 2018, the Company did not have any material tax accounting adjustments to the provisional estimate recorded in the financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2017, the first measurement period under SAB 118 and amounts are now complete.\nNet Income. Net income for the year ended December 31, 2018 was $43.9 million compared to net income of $55.3 million for 2017, a decrease of $11.4 million. This decrease was driven by the factors described above.\nDiscussion of Critical Accounting Policies\nOur consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, costs and expenses, and related disclosures. These estimates and assumptions are often based on judgments that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances at the time made, but all such estimates and assumptions are inherently uncertain and unpredictable. Actual results may differ from those estimates and assumptions, and it is possible that other professionals, applying their own judgment to the same facts and circumstances, could develop and support alternative estimates and assumptions that would result in material changes to our operating results and financial condition. We evaluate our estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis. Our estimates are based on historical experience and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances.\nThe most significant accounting estimates inherent in the preparation of our financial statements include estimates used in the determination of liabilities related to pension obligations, revenue recognition, and impairment assessment of goodwill.\nWe believe the following are the critical accounting policies that affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nRevenue Recognition\nIn May 2014, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update ( ASU\u201d) No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606), which supersedes the revenue recognition requirements in ASC 605, Revenue Recognition. We adopted ASC 606 using the modified retrospective method as of January 1, 2018. This approach was applied to all contracts not completed as of the date of initial application. Upon adoption, we recognized the cumulative effect of adopting this guidance as an adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings of $0.4 million.\nWork Truck Attachments Segment Revenue Recognition\nWe recognize revenue upon shipment of equipment to the customer. Within the Work Truck Attachments segment, we offer a variety of discounts and sales incentives to our distributors. The estimated liability for sales discounts and allowances is recorded at the time of sale as a reduction of net sales using the expected value method. The liability is estimated based on the costs of the program, the planned duration of the program and historical experience.\nWork Truck Solutions Segment Revenue Recognition\nThe Work Truck Solutions segment primarily participates in the truck and vehicle upfitting industry in the United States. Customers are billed separately for the truck chassis by the chassis manufacturer. We only record sales for the amount of the upfit, excluding the truck chassis. Generally, we obtain the truck chassis from the truck chassis manufacturer through either our floor plan agreement with a financial institution or bailment pool agreement with the truck chassis manufacturer. Additionally, in some instances we upfit chassis which are owned by the end customer. For truck chassis acquired through the floor plan agreement, we hold title to the vehicle from the time the chassis is received by us until the completion of the up-fit. Under the bailment pool agreement, we do not take title to the truck chassis, but rather only hold the truck chassis on consignment. We pay interest on both of these arrangements. We record revenue in the same manner net of the value of the truck chassis in both our floor plan and bailment pool agreements. We do not set the price for the truck chassis, are not responsible for the billing of the chassis and do not have inventory risk in either the bailment pool or floor plan agreements. The Work Truck Solutions segment also has manufacturing operations of municipal snow and ice control equipment, where revenue is recognized upon shipment of equipment to the customer.\nRevenues from the sales of the Work Truck Solutions products are recognized net of the truck chassis with the selling price to the customer recorded as sales and the manufacturing and up-fit cost of the product recorded as cost of sales. In these cases, we act as an agent as it do not have inventory or pricing control over the truck chassis. Within the Work Truck Solutions segment, we also sell certain third-party products for which we act as an agent. These sales do not meet the criteria for gross sales recognition, and thus are recognized on a net basis at the time of sale. Under net sales recognition, the cost paid to the third-party service provider is recorded as a reduction to sales, resulting in net sales being equal to the gross profit on the transaction.\nSee Note 3 to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a more detailed description of our revenue recognition policies.\nGoodwill\nWe perform an annual impairment test for goodwill and more frequently if an event or circumstances indicate that an impairment loss has been incurred. Conditions that would trigger an impairment assessment include, but are not limited to, a significant adverse change in legal factors or business climate that could affect the value of an asset. The amount of goodwill impairment is determined by the amount the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value. We have determined we have three reporting units, and all significant decisions are made on a company-wide basis by our chief operating decision maker. The fair value of the reporting unit is estimated by using an income and market approach. The estimated fair value is compared with our aggregate carrying value. If our fair value is greater than the carrying amount, there is no impairment. If our carrying amount is greater than the fair value, an impairment loss is recognized equal to the difference. Annual impairment tests conducted by us on December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017 resulted in no adjustment to the carrying value of our goodwill.\nOur goodwill balances could be impaired in future periods. A number of factors, many of which we have no ability to control, could affect our financial condition, operating results and business prospects and could cause actual results to differ from the estimates and assumptions we employed. These factors include:\nTable 75: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>a prolonged global economic crisis; </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 76: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>a decrease in the demand for our products; </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 77: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>the inability to develop new and enhanced products and services in a timely manner; </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 78: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>a significant adverse change in legal factors or in the business climate; </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 79: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>delays by our supplier and OEM partners in the production and delivery of products and components; </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 80: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>an adverse action or assessment by a regulator; and </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 81: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>successful efforts by our competitors to gain market share in our markets. </td> </tr>\n</table>\nAt December 31, 2019, our Work Truck Solutions consists of two reporting units; Municipal and Dejana. The Municipal reporting unit had goodwill of $47.8 million, an estimated fair market value of $139.8 million and an estimated carrying value of $100.0 million. The Dejana reporting unit had goodwill of $80.1 million, an estimated fair market value of $298.1 million and an estimated carrying value of $200.4 million. If we are unable to attain the financial projections used in the income approach used in calculating the fair value, or if there are significant market conditions impacting the market approach, including the factors noted above, our Work Truck Solutions segment goodwill could be at risk of impairment. We have initiated a comprehensive strategic plan which is focused on reducing expenses and improving margins at Work Truck Solutions. If the cost savings and other initiatives in this plan do not materialize, or if we experience delays by our supplier and OEM partners in the production and delivery of chassis, which could negatively affect our financial results, the Work Truck Solutions segment goodwill may be impaired. There were no indicators of impairment subsequent to the December 31, 2019 impairment test.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nOur principal sources of cash have been and we expect will continue to be cash from operations and borrowings under our senior credit facilities.\nOur primary uses of cash are to provide working capital, meet debt service requirements, finance capital expenditures, pay dividends under our dividend policy and support our growth, including through potential acquisitions, and for other general corporate purposes. For a description of the seasonality of our working capital rates see -Seasonality and Year-To-Year Variability.\u201d\nOur Board of Directors has adopted a dividend policy that reflects an intention to distribute to our stockholders a regular quarterly cash dividend. The declaration and payment of these dividends to holders of our common stock is at the discretion of our Board of Directors and depends upon many factors, including our financial condition and earnings, legal requirements, taxes and other factors our Board of Directors may deem to be relevant. The terms of our indebtedness may also restrict us from paying cash dividends on our common stock under certain circumstances. As a result of this dividend policy, we may not have significant cash available to meet any large unanticipated liquidity requirements. As a result, we may not retain a sufficient amount of cash to fund our operations or to finance unanticipated capital expenditures or growth opportunities, including acquisitions. Our Board of Directors may, however, amend, revoke or suspend our dividend policy at any time and for any reason.\nAs of December 31, 2019, we had liquidity comprised of approximately $35.7 million in cash and cash equivalents and borrowing availability of approximately $99.4 million under our revolving credit facility. Borrowing availability under our revolving credit facility is governed by a borrowing base, the calculation of which includes cash on hand. Accordingly, use of cash on hand may also result in a reduction in the amount available for borrowing under our revolving credit facility. Furthermore, our revolving credit facility requires us to maintain at least $15.0 million of borrowing availability. We expect that cash on hand, cash generated from operations, as well as available credit under our senior credit facilities will provide adequate funds for the purposes described above for at least the next 12 months.\nCash Flow Analysis\nSet forth below is summary cash flow information for each of the years ended December 31, 2017, 2018 and 2019.\nTable 82: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cash Flows (in thousands)\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>2019\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash provided by operating activities\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 66,354\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 58,181\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 77,296\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash used in investing activities\n</td> <td> (14,948)\n</td> <td> (9,690)\n</td> <td> (11,533)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash used in financing activities\n</td> <td> (33,140)\n</td> <td> (57,546)\n</td> <td> (57,918)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Increase (Decrease) in cash\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 18,266\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> (9,055)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 7,845\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nSources and Uses of Cash\nDuring the three-year periods described above, net cash provided by operating activities was used for funding capital investment, paying dividends, paying interest on our senior credit facilities, and funding working capital requirements during our pre-season shipping period.\nThe following table shows our cash and cash equivalents and inventories at December 31, 2017, 2018 and 2019.\nTable 83: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>2019\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(in thousands)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cash and cash equivalents\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>36,875\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>27,820\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>35,665\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Inventories\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>71,524\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>81,996\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>77,942\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nYear Ended December 31, 2019 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2018\nWe had cash and cash equivalents of $35.7 million at December 31, 2019 compared to cash and cash equivalents of $27.8 million at December 31, 2018.

The increase in cash provided by operating activities was due to $25.6 million in favorable working capital changes offset by a $6.5 million decrease in net income adjusted for reconciling items. The largest driver positively impacting cash flows was a decrease in inventory levels, which had been built-up in 2018 in anticipation of tariffs and rising prices. Additionally, the Company made funding contributions of $7.0 million to its pension plans in 2018, compared to $0.5 million in 2019.\nNet cash used in investing activities increased $1.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to the corresponding period in 2018 due to the increase in capital expenditures.\nNet cash used in financing activities increased $0.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared to 2018. The increase in cash used in financing activities was primarily the result of an increase in dividends paid, where the cash dividend increased from $0.265 per share to $0.2725 per share in 2019. In addition, the Company made voluntary payments on its Term Loan Credit Agreement of $30.0 million in both 2018 and 2019.\nYear Ended December 31, 2018 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2017\nWe had cash and cash equivalents of $27.8 million at December 31, 2018 compared to cash and cash equivalents of $36.9 million at December 31, 2017.

The decrease in cash provided by operating activities was due to $23.2 million in unfavorable working capital changes offset by a $15.0 million increase in net income adjusted for reconciling items. The largest drivers negatively impacting cash flows was a $7.0 million contribution to our pension plans during the year ended December 31, 2018, a decrease in lawsuit proceeds of $1.3 million received in 2017, as well as the build-up of inventory in anticipation of tariffs and rising prices.\nNet cash used in investing activities decreased $5.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, compared to the corresponding period in 2017. This decrease was due to the $7.4 million cash outflow in 2017 for the Arrowhead acquisition. Slightly offsetting this decrease in cash used in investing activities was an increase in capital expenditures in 2018 as compared to 2017 by $2.1 million.\nNet cash used in financing activities increased $24.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 as compared to 2017. The increase in cash used in financing activities was primarily the result of $33.1 million of payments on our debt that occurred in the year ended December 31, 2018. This was partially offset by an earnout payment to the former owners of Dejana of $5.5 million in the year ended December 31, 2017 with no corresponding payment in 2018.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nThis Annual Report on Form 10-K contains financial information calculated other than in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ( GAAP\u201d).\nThese non-GAAP measures include:\nTable 86: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>Free cash flow; and </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 87: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>Adjusted EBITDA; and </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 88: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>Adjusted net income and earnings per share. </td> </tr>\n</table>\nThese non-GAAP disclosures should not be construed as an alternative to the reported results determined in accordance with GAAP.\nNet cash provided by operating activities was $77.3 million in the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared to $58.2 million in the year ended December 31, 2018. Free cash flow (as defined below) for the year ended December 31, 2019 was $65.8 million compared to $48.5 million in 2018, an increase in free cash flow of $17.3 million, or 35.7%. The increase in free cash flow is primarily a result of an increase in cash provided by operating activities of $19.1 million slightly offset by an increase in capital expenditures of $1.8 million, as discussed above under Liquidity and Capital Resources.\u201d Free cash flow for the year ended December 31, 2018 was $48.5 million compared to $58.8 million in 2017, a decrease in free cash flow of $10.3 million, or 17.5%. The\ndecrease in free cash flow is primarily a result of a decrease in cash provided by operating activities of $8.2 million and an increase in capital expenditures of $2.1 million.\nFree cash flow is a non-GAAP financial measure, which we define as net cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures. Free cash flow should be evaluated in addition to, and not considered a substitute for, other financial measures such as net income and cash flow provided by operations. We believe that free cash flow provides investors with a useful tool to evaluate our ability to generate additional cash flow from our business operations.\nThe following table reconciles net cash provided by operating activities, a GAAP measure, to free cash flow, a non-GAAP measure.\nTable 89: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>For the year ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2019\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(in thousands)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash provided by operating activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>66,354\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>58,181\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 77,296\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Acquisition of property and equipment\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (7,563)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (9,690)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (11,533)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Free cash flow\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 58,791\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 48,491\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 65,763\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nAdjusted EBITDA represents net income before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, as further adjusted for certain charges consisting of unrelated legal and consulting fees, pension termination costs, stock based compensation, severance, loss on extinguishment of debt, loss on disposal of fixed assets related to facility relocations, litigation proceeds and certain purchase accounting expenses. We use, and we believe our investors benefit from the presentation of Adjusted EBITDA in evaluating our operating performance because it provides us and our investors with additional tools to compare our operating performance on a consistent basis by removing the impact of certain items that management believes do not directly reflect our core operations. In addition, we believe that Adjusted EBITDA is useful to investors and other external users of our consolidated financial statements in evaluating our operating performance as compared to that of other companies, because it allows them to measure a company's operating performance without regard to items such as interest expense, taxes, depreciation and amortization, which can vary substantially from company to company depending upon accounting methods and book value of assets and liabilities, capital structure and the method by which assets were acquired. Our management also uses Adjusted EBITDA for planning purposes, including the preparation of our annual operating budget and financial projections. Management also uses Adjusted EBITDA to evaluate our ability to make certain payments, including dividends, in compliance with our senior credit facilities, which is determined based on a calculation of Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA\u201d that is substantially similar to Adjusted EBITDA.\nAdjusted EBITDA has limitations as an analytical tool. As a result, you should not consider it in isolation, or as a substitute for net income, operating income, cash flow from operating activities or any other measure of financial performance or liquidity presented in accordance with GAAP.

As we have previously acquired businesses possessing significant intangible assets and goodwill, we have created a favorable tax structure where income tax expense is greater than book amortization expense. We expect the deductibility of intangible assets and goodwill amortization expense to exceed book by approximately $4.1 million in the year ended December 31, 2020 if we have the taxable income to utilize such benefit.\nImpact of Inflation\nWe do not believe that inflation risk is material to our business or our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows at this time. Historically, we have experienced normal raw material, labor and fringe benefit inflation. To date we have been able to fully offset this inflation by providing higher value products, which command higher prices. In previous years, including in 2018 and 2019 as a result of inflationary pressures due to tariffs, we have experienced significant increases in steel costs, but have been able to mitigate the effects of these increases through both temporary and permanent steel surcharges. See Risk Factors- The price of steel, a commodity necessary to manufacture our products, is highly variable. If the price of steel increases, our gross margins could decline\u201d.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe are not party to any off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a material current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues, expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources.\nSeasonality and Year-To-Year Variability\nWhile our Work Truck Solutions segment has limited seasonality and variability, our Work Truck Attachments segment is seasonal and also varies from year-to-year. Consequently, our Work Truck Attachments segment results of operations and financial condition vary from quarter-to-quarter and from year-to-year as well. In addition, because of this seasonality and variability, our Work Truck Attachments segment results of operations for any quarter may not be indicative of results of operations that may be achieved for a subsequent quarter or the full year, and may not be similar to results of operations experienced in prior years.\nSales of our Work Truck Attachments segment products are significantly impacted by the level, timing and location of snowfall, with sales in any given year and region most heavily influenced by snowfall levels in the prior snow season (which we consider to begin in October and end in March) in that region. This is due to the fact that end-user demand for our Work Truck Attachments products is driven primarily by the condition of their snow and ice control equipment, and in the case of professional snowplowers, by their financial ability to purchase new or replacement snow and ice control equipment, both of which are significantly affected by snowfall levels. Heavy snowfall during a given winter causes usage of our Work Truck Attachments products to increase, resulting in greater wear and tear to our products and a shortening of their life cycles, thereby creating a need for replacement snow and ice control equipment and related parts and accessories. In addition, when there is a heavy snowfall in a given winter, the increased income our professional snowplowers generate from their professional snowplow activities provides them with increased purchasing power to purchase replacement snow and ice control equipment prior to the following winter. To a lesser extent, sales of our Work Truck Attachments products are influenced by the timing of snowfall in a given winter. Because an early snowfall can be viewed as a sign of a heavy upcoming snow season, our Work Truck Attachments segment's end-users may respond to an early snowfall by purchasing replacement snow and ice control equipment during the current season rather than delaying purchases until after the season is over when most purchases are typically made by end-users.\nWe attempt to manage the seasonal impact of snowfall on our Work Truck Attachments segment revenues in part through our pre-season sales program, which involves actively soliciting and encouraging pre-season distributor orders in the second and third quarters by offering our distributors a combination of pricing, payment and freight incentives during this period. These pre-season sales incentives encourage our distributors to re-stock their inventory during the second and third quarters in anticipation of the peak fourth quarter retail sales period by offering favorable pre-season pricing and payment deferral until the fourth quarter. As a result, we tend to generate our greatest volume of sales (an average of over two-thirds over the last ten years) during the second and third quarters, providing us with manufacturing visibility for the remainder of the year. By contrast, our revenue and operating results tend to be lowest during the first quarter as management believes our end-users prefer to wait until the beginning of a snow season to purchase new equipment and as our distributors sell off inventory and wait for our pre-season sales incentive period to re-stock inventory. Fourth quarter sales vary from year-to-year as they are primarily driven by the level, timing and location of snowfall during the quarter. This is because most of our fourth\nquarter sales and shipments consist of re-orders by distributors seeking to restock inventory to meet immediate customer needs caused by snowfall during the winter months.\nOur Work Truck Attachments segment revenue and operating results tend to be lowest during the first quarter, during which period we typically experience negative earnings as the snow season draws to a close. Our Work Truck Attachments segment first quarter revenue has varied from approximately $18.0 million to approximately $33.9 million between 2015 and 2019. During the last five-year period, net income (loss) during the first quarter has varied from a net income of approximately $3.9 million to a net loss of approximately $0.9 million, with an average net income of $1.3 million.\nWhile our Work Truck Attachments monthly working capital has averaged approximately $73.1 million from 2017 to 2019, because of the seasonality of our sales, we experience seasonality in our working capital needs as well. In the first quarter we require capital as we are generally required to build our inventory in anticipation of our second and third quarter sales seasons. During the second and third quarters, our working capital requirements rise as our accounts receivables increase as a result of the sale and shipment of products ordered through our pre-season sales program and we continue to build inventory. Working capital requirements peak towards the end of the third quarter (reaching an average peak of approximately $97.1 million over the prior three years) and then begin to decline through the fourth quarter through a reduction in accounts receivables (as it is in the fourth quarter that we receive a majority of the payments for previously shipped products).\nWe also attempt to manage the impact of seasonality and year-to-year variability on our business costs through the effective management of our assets. See Business-Our Business Strategy-Aggressive Asset Management and Profit Focus.\u201d Our asset management and profit focus strategies include:\nTable 110: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>the employment of a highly variable cost structure facilitated by a core group of workers that we supplement with a temporary workforce as sales volumes dictate, which allows us to adjust costs on an as-needed basis in response to changing demand; </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 111: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>our enterprise-wide lean concept, which allows us to adjust production levels up or down to meet demand; </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 112: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>the pre-season order program described above, which incentivizes distributors to place orders prior to the retail selling season; and </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 113: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>a vertically integrated business model. </td> </tr>\n</table>\nThese asset management and profit focus strategies, among other management tools, allow us to adjust fixed overhead and selling, general and administrative expenditures to account for the year-to-year variability of our sales volumes. Management currently estimates that consolidated annual fixed overhead expenses generally range from approximately $50.0 million in low sales volume years to approximately $70.0 million in high sales volume years. Further, management currently estimates that consolidated annual sales, general and administrative expenses other than amortization generally approximate $75.0 million, but can be reduced to approximately $65.0 million to maximize cash flow in low sales volume years, and can increase to approximately $85.0 million to maintain customer service and responsiveness in high sales volume years.\nAdditionally, although modest, our annual capital expenditure requirements, which are normally budgeted around 2-3% of net sales, can be temporarily reduced by up to approximately 40% in response to actual or anticipated decreases in sales volumes. If we are unsuccessful in our asset management initiatives, the seasonality and year-to-year variability effects on our business may be compounded and in turn our results of operations and financial condition may suffer.", "item_7_truncated": "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThe following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2018 and 2019 should be read together with our audited consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Some of the information contained in this discussion and analysis or set forth elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including information with respect to our plans and strategies for our business, includes forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. You should review the Risk Factors\u201d section of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a discussion of important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the results described in, or implied by, the forward-looking statements contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nResults of Operations\nOperating Segments\nDuring the first quarter of 2019, the Company reorganized its business segments to reflect a new operating structure as a result of a change in how the Company's chief operating decision maker allocates resources, makes operating decisions and assesses the performance of the business. Under the revised reporting structure, the Company's two reportable business segments are as follows:\nWork Truck Attachments. The Work Truck Attachments segment includes our operations that manufacture and sell snow and ice control attachments and other products sold under the FISHER\u00ae, WESTERN\u00ae, and SNOWEX\u00ae brands. As described under Seasonality and Year-To- Year Variability,\u201d the Work Truck Attachments segment is seasonal and, as a result, its results of operations can vary from quarter-to-quarter and from year-to-year.\nWork Truck Solutions. The Work Truck Solutions segment includes manufactured municipal snow and ice control products under the HENDERSON\u00ae brand and the upfit of market leading attachments and storage solutions under the HENDERSON\u00ae brand, and the DEJANA\u00ae brand and its related sub-brands.\nSee Note 17 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for information concerning individual segment performance for the years ended December 31, 2019, December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017, respectively.\nOverview\nAlthough we diversified and expanded our portfolio with the acquisition of Dejana during the year ended December 31, 2016, snowfall is still the primary factor in evaluating our business results due to its significant impact on the results of operations of our Work Truck Attachments segment. We typically compare the snowfall level in a given period both to the snowfall level in the prior season and to those snowfall levels we consider to be average. References to average snowfall\u201d levels below refer to the aggregate average inches of snowfall recorded in 66 cities in 26 snow-belt states in the United States during the annual snow season, from October 1 through March 31, from 1980 to 2019. During this period, snowfall averaged 3,046 inches, with the low in such period being 1,794 inches and the high being 4,502 inches. Meanwhile, over the last 10 years, snowfall averaged 3,237 inches for the snow periods ending March 31, 2010 through 2019.\nDuring the six-month snow season ended March 31, 2019, snowfall was 3,154 inches, which was 3.5% higher than average. During the six-month snow season ended March 31, 2018, we experienced snowfall that was 9.6% higher than average. During the six-month snow season ended March 31, 2017, we experienced snowfall that was 5.4% lower than average. While snowfall trended above average the past two years based on historical averages from 1980 to 2019, snowfall was 2.6% below average compared to the average over the last 10 years. Additionally, the timing and location of snowfall can have an impact on our financial results. We believe the near-average snowfall in the year ended December 31, 2019 was the largest driver that positively impacted our business in 2019. We believe other factors had a positive impact, including positively trending light truck sales in 2019 and the continued successful integration of Dejana. In both 2018 and 2019, we encountered chassis availability issues\nwith certain of our OEM partners, which negatively impacted our business, although in 2019 chassis predictability has improved when compared to the prior year.\nThe following table sets forth, for the periods presented, the consolidated statements of income of the Company and its subsidiaries. All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. In the table below and throughout this Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,\u201d consolidated statements of income data for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2018 and 2019 have been derived from our audited consolidated financial statements.

The slight increase in cost of sales in the year ended December 31, 2019 when compared to the year ended December 31, 2018 was primarily due to increased healthcare and labor costs, as well as a higher cost of sales as a percentage of sales for Work Truck Solutions products, which historically has operated at lower margins than the Work Truck Attachments segment, offset by operating efficiencies in the Work Truck Solutions segment.\nGross Profit. Gross profit was $168.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to $154.9 million in 2018, an increase of $13.9 million, or 9.0%, due to the increase in net sales described above under -Net Sales.\u201d As a percentage of net sales, gross profit decreased slightly from 29.6% for the year ended December 31, 2018 to 29.5% for the corresponding period in 2019, as a result of the factors discussed above under -Cost of Sales.\u201d\nSelling, General and Administrative Expense. Selling, general and administrative expenses, including intangible asset amortization, were $82.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to $81.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, an increase of $0.8 million, or 1.0%. The increase compared to the year ended December 31, 2018 was primarily due to an increase in healthcare costs and an increase in variable compensation due to improved operating results, offset by a decrease in stock compensation expense related to plan design changes implemented in the prior year and planned management transitions that occurred in 2019, and a decrease in legal expenses related to a patent infringement case in the prior year. In addition, there were decreases in earnout expense of $0.4 million in the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to $0.9 million in the year ended December 31, 2018 driven by the earnout valuation adjustments in the respective periods. As a percentage of net sales, selling, general and administrative expenses, including intangibles amortization, decreased from 15.5% for the year ended December 31, 2018 to 14.4% for the corresponding period in 2019.\nInterest Expense. Interest expense was $16.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to $16.9 million in the corresponding period in 2018. The slight decrease in interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2019 was primarily due to the reduction to the principal balance of the Term Loan Credit Agreement due to a $30.0 million voluntary prepayment made in February 2019, offset by an increase in interest expense on revolver borrowings of $0.4 million when compared to the prior year.\nPension Termination. Pension termination costs were $6.6 million in the year ended December 31, 2019, as a result of the Company successfully terminating its pension plans during the period. See Note 13 for additional information on the termination of the pension plans.\nIncome Tax Expense. Our effective combined federal and state tax rate for 2019 was 21.5% compared to 21.3% for 2018. The effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2019 is slightly higher than 2018 primarily due to a decrease in the release of reserves for uncertain tax positions of $0.5 million; $0.8 million in the year ended December 31, 2019 versus $1.3 million in the year ended December 31, 2018. The Company also made a voluntary pension funding payment in the year ended December 31, 2018 of $7.0 million which was deducted in the Company's tax returns for the year ended December 31, 2017 reducing taxable income for that period. The increased pension funding deduction resulted in a tax benefit of $0.7 million, also decreasing the tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2018. The increase in effective tax rate was partially offset by decreases in the rate related to state rate changes driven by legislative changes in tax laws in one of the states in which we operate, and a benefit related to the increase in officer life insurance as a result of market performance.\nDeferred income taxes reflect the net tax effects of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes. The largest item affecting the deferred taxes is the difference between book and tax amortization of goodwill and other intangible amortization.\nNet Income. Net income for the year ended December 31, 2019 was $49.2 million compared to net income of $43.9 million for 2018, an increase of $5.3 million. This increase was driven by the factors described above.\nYear Ended December 31, 2018 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2017\nNet Sales. Net sales were $524.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to $474.9 million in 2017, an increase of $49.2 million, or 10.4%. Net sales increased for the year ended December 31, 2018 primarily due to snowfall levels near historical averages in the snow season ended March 31, 2018, an increase compared to below average snowfall levels during the prior snow season. Additionally, the increase in sales was due to increased volume at our Work Truck Solutions segment and higher pricing across both segments. This increase was partially offset by chassis supply availability issues in both segments. See below for a discussion of net sales for each of our segments.\nNet sales at our Work Truck Attachment segment were $275.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to $238.9 million in the year ended December 31, 2017, an increase of $36.3 million primarily due to higher levels of snowfall in the snow season ended March 31, 2018 compared to the snow season ended March 31, 2017. Snowfall during the snow season ended March 31, 2018 were near historical averages, an increase compared to the snow season ended March 31, 2017, which saw below average snowfall levels.\nNet sales at our Work Truck Solutions segment were $248.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to $236.0 million in the year ended December 31, 2017, an increase of $12.8 million due primarily to increased demand from generally favorable macro-economic conditions and the inclusion of incremental sales from additional facilities of $5.3 million in the year ended December 31, 2018 versus 2017. Strong sales for work truck upfits were slightly offset by sales decreases in our municipal products, due to ongoing chassis supply availability issues.\nCost of Sales. Cost of sales was $369.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to $331.8 million in 2017, an increase of $37.4 million, or 11.3%. Cost of sales as a percentage of net sales increased from 69.9% for the year ended December 31, 2017 to 70.4% for the year ended December 31, 2018. The increase in cost of sales in the year ended December 31, 2018 when compared to the year ended December 31, 2017 was primarily due to higher cost of sales as a percentage of sales for Work Truck Solutions products, growth in lower margin product lines, and inflation.\nGross Profit. Gross profit was $154.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to $143.1 million in 2017, an increase of $11.8 million, or 8.2%, due to the increase in net sales described above under -Net Sales.\u201d As a percentage of net sales, gross profit decreased from 30.1% for the year ended December 31,\n2017 to 29.6% for the corresponding period in 2018, as a result of the factors discussed above under -Cost of Sales.\u201d\nSelling, General and Administrative Expense. Selling, general and administrative expenses, including intangible asset amortization, were $81.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to $72.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, an increase of $9.1 million, or 12.6%. The increase compared to the year ended December 31, 2017 was primarily due to an increase in variable compensation of $3.5 million due to improved operating results, higher stock compensation expense of $1.1 million related to plan design changes, increased discretionary spending including $0.9 million related to advertising and promotions as a result of a return to average snowfall levels, as well as increased costs related to headcount and wages. In addition, there were decreases in earnout expense of $0.9 million in the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to $1.8 million in the year ended December 31, 2017 driven by the earnout valuation adjustments in the respective periods. As a percentage of net sales, selling, general and administrative expenses, including intangibles amortization, increased from 15.2% for the year ended December 31, 2017 to 15.5% for the corresponding period in 2018 due to the factors noted above.\nInterest Expense. Interest expense was $16.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to $18.3 million in the corresponding period in 2017. The decrease in interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2018 was due to $1.6 million of financing costs that were expensed in the year ended December 31, 2017 related to the amendments to its Term Loan Credit Agreement to decrease the interest rate margins that apply to the term loan facility, which were completed in February 2017 and August 2017. Additionally, the Company had a more favorable interest rate in 2018 due to the debt refinances, as well as a lower debt balance from repayments of $33.1 million in 2018. This decrease was partially offset by increased interest on higher revolver borrowings in 2018 compared to 2017.\nLitigation Proceeds. Litigation proceeds were $1.3 million year ended December 31, 2017 due to a settlement related to the successful conclusion of a patent infringement lawsuit against Meyer Products, LLC.\nIncome Tax Expense (Benefit). Deferred income taxes reflect the net tax effects of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes. The largest item affecting the deferred taxes is the difference between book and tax amortization of goodwill and other intangible amortization. Our effective combined federal and state tax rate for 2018 was 21.3% compared to (4.6%) for 2017. The effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2017 is significantly lower than 2018 primarily due to the revaluation of the deferred tax assets and liabilities in 2017 resulting from the passage of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act ( The Act\u201d). As a result of the reduction in the U.S. corporate income tax rate from 35.0% to 21.0% under the Act, the Company recorded a reduction to its net deferred tax liability of $22.5 million, and a corresponding decrease to income tax expense in the Company's Consolidated Statement of Operations for the year ended December 31, 2017. Contributing to the tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2018 was the release of reserves for uncertain tax positions of $1.3 million. The Company also made a voluntary pension funding payment in the year ended December 31, 2018 of $7.0 million which was deducted in the Company's tax returns for the year ended December 31, 2017 reducing taxable income for that period. The increased pension funding deduction resulted in a tax benefit of $0.7 million, also decreasing the tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2018 as this deduction was not included in the provision recorded at December 31, 2017. Without these items, the Company's tax rate would have been approximately 25.0% in the year ended December 31, 2018.\nOn December 22, 2017, the SEC staff issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118 ( SAB 118\u201d) to address the application of U.S. GAAP in situations when a registrant does not have the necessary information available, prepared, or analyzed (including computations) in reasonable detail to complete the accounting for certain income tax effects of The Tax Reform Act. As of the date of this Annual Report, we have recorded all known enactment-date income tax effects of the Act. These adjustments have been recorded as a component of income tax expense and include the revaluation of deferred tax assets and liabilities. In the year ended December 31, 2018, the Company did not have any material tax accounting adjustments to the provisional estimate recorded in the financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2017, the first measurement period under SAB 118 and amounts are now complete.\nNet Income. Net income for the year ended December 31, 2018 was $43.9 million compared to net income of $55.3 million for 2017, a decrease of $11.4 million. This decrease was driven by the factors described above.\nDiscussion of Critical Accounting Policies\nOur consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, costs and expenses, and related disclosures. These estimates and assumptions are often based on judgments that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances at the time made, but all such estimates and assumptions are inherently uncertain and unpredictable. Actual results may differ from those estimates and assumptions, and it is possible that other professionals, applying their own judgment to the same facts and circumstances, could develop and support alternative estimates and assumptions that would result in material changes to our operating results and financial condition. We evaluate our estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis. Our estimates are based on historical experience and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances.\nThe most significant accounting estimates inherent in the preparation of our financial statements include estimates used in the determination of liabilities related to pension obligations, revenue recognition, and impairment assessment of goodwill.\nWe believe the following are the critical accounting policies that affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nRevenue Recognition\nIn May 2014, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update ( ASU\u201d) No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606), which supersedes the revenue recognition requirements in ASC 605, Revenue Recognition. We adopted ASC 606 using the modified retrospective method as of January 1, 2018. This approach was applied to all contracts not completed as of the date of initial application. Upon adoption, we recognized the cumulative effect of adopting this guidance as an adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings of $0.4 million.\nWork Truck Attachments Segment Revenue Recognition\nWe recognize revenue upon shipment of equipment to the customer. Within the Work Truck Attachments segment, we offer a variety of discounts and sales incentives to our distributors. The estimated liability for sales discounts and allowances is recorded at the time of sale as a reduction of net sales using the expected value method. The liability is estimated based on the costs of the program, the planned duration of the program and historical experience.\nWork Truck Solutions Segment Revenue Recognition\nThe Work Truck Solutions segment primarily participates in the truck and vehicle upfitting industry in the United States. Customers are billed separately for the truck chassis by the chassis manufacturer. We only record sales for the amount of the upfit, excluding the truck chassis. Generally, we obtain the truck chassis from the truck chassis manufacturer through either our floor plan agreement with a financial institution or bailment pool agreement with the truck chassis manufacturer. Additionally, in some instances we upfit chassis which are owned by the end customer. For truck chassis acquired through the floor plan agreement, we hold title to the vehicle from the time the chassis is received by us until the completion of the up-fit. Under the bailment pool agreement, we do not take title to the truck chassis, but rather only hold the truck chassis on consignment. We pay interest on both of these arrangements. We record revenue in the same manner net of the value of the truck chassis in both our floor plan and bailment pool agreements. We do not set the price for the truck chassis, are not responsible for the billing of the chassis and do not have inventory risk in either the bailment pool or floor plan agreements. The Work Truck Solutions segment also has manufacturing operations of municipal snow and ice control equipment, where revenue is recognized upon shipment of equipment to the customer.\nRevenues from the sales of the Work Truck Solutions products are recognized net of the truck chassis with the selling price to the customer recorded as sales and the manufacturing and up-fit cost of the product recorded as cost of sales. In these cases, we act as an agent as it do not have inventory or pricing control over the truck chassis. Within the Work Truck Solutions segment, we also sell certain third-party products for which we act as an agent. These sales do not meet the criteria for gross sales recognition, and thus are recognized on a net basis at the time of sale. Under net sales recognition, the cost paid to the third-party service provider is recorded as a reduction to sales, resulting in net sales being equal to the gross profit on the transaction.\nSee Note 3 to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a more detailed description of our revenue recognition policies.\nGoodwill\nWe perform an annual impairment test for goodwill and more frequently if an event or circumstances indicate that an impairment loss has been incurred. Conditions that would trigger an impairment assessment include, but are not limited to, a significant adverse change in legal factors or business climate that could affect the value of an asset. The amount of goodwill impairment is determined by the amount the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value. We have determined we have three reporting units, and all significant decisions are made on a company-wide basis by our chief operating decision maker. The fair value of the reporting unit is estimated by using an income and market approach. The estimated fair value is compared with our aggregate carrying value. If our fair value is greater than the carrying amount, there is no impairment. If our carrying amount is greater than the fair value, an impairment loss is recognized equal to the difference. Annual impairment tests conducted by us on December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017 resulted in no adjustment to the carrying value of our goodwill.\nOur goodwill balances could be impaired in future periods. A number of factors, many of which we have no ability to control, could affect our financial condition, operating results and business prospects and could cause actual results to differ from the estimates and assumptions we employed. These factors include:\n \u25cf a prolonged global economic crisis; \n \u25cf a decrease in the demand for our products; \n \u25cf the inability to develop new and enhanced products and services in a timely manner; \n \u25cf a significant adverse change in legal factors or in the business climate; \n \u25cf delays by our supplier and OEM partners in the production and delivery of products and components; \n \u25cf an adverse action or assessment by a regulator; and \n \u25cf successful efforts by our competitors to gain market share in our markets. \nAt December 31, 2019, our Work Truck Solutions consists of two reporting units; Municipal and Dejana. The Municipal reporting unit had goodwill of $47.8 million, an estimated fair market value of $139.8 million and an estimated carrying value of $100.0 million. The Dejana reporting unit had goodwill of $80.1 million, an estimated fair market value of $298.1 million and an estimated carrying value of $200.4 million. If we are unable to attain the financial projections used in the income approach used in calculating the fair value, or if there are significant market conditions impacting the market approach, including the factors noted above, our Work Truck Solutions segment goodwill could be at risk of impairment. We have initiated a comprehensive strategic plan which is focused on reducing expenses and improving margins at Work Truck Solutions. If the cost savings and other initiatives in this plan do not materialize, or if we experience delays by our supplier and OEM partners in the production and delivery of chassis, which could negatively affect our financial results, the Work Truck Solutions segment goodwill may be impaired. There were no indicators of impairment subsequent to the December 31, 2019 impairment test.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nOur principal sources of cash have been and we expect will continue to be cash from operations and borrowings under our senior credit facilities.\nOur primary uses of cash are to provide working capital, meet debt service requirements, finance capital expenditures, pay dividends under our dividend policy and support our growth, including through potential acquisitions, and for other general corporate purposes. For a description of the seasonality of our working capital rates see -Seasonality and Year-To-Year Variability.\u201d\nOur Board of Directors has adopted a dividend policy that reflects an intention to distribute to our stockholders a regular quarterly cash dividend. The declaration and payment of these dividends to holders of our common stock is at the discretion of our Board of Directors and depends upon many factors, including our financial condition and earnings, legal requirements, taxes and other factors our Board of Directors may deem to be relevant. The terms of our indebtedness may also restrict us from paying cash dividends on our common stock under certain circumstances. As a result of this dividend policy, we may not have significant cash available to meet any large unanticipated liquidity requirements. As a result, we may not retain a sufficient amount of cash to fund our operations or to finance unanticipated capital expenditures or growth opportunities, including acquisitions. Our Board of Directors may, however, amend, revoke or suspend our dividend policy at any time and for any reason.\nAs of December 31, 2019, we had liquidity comprised of approximately $35.7 million in cash and cash equivalents and borrowing availability of approximately $99.4 million under our revolving credit facility. Borrowing availability under our revolving credit facility is governed by a borrowing base, the calculation of which includes cash on hand. Accordingly, use of cash on hand may also result in a reduction in the amount available for borrowing under our revolving credit facility. Furthermore, our revolving credit facility requires us to maintain at least $15.0 million of borrowing availability. We expect that cash on hand, cash generated from operations, as well as available credit under our senior credit facilities will provide adequate funds for the purposes described above for at least the next 12 months.\nCash Flow Analysis\nSet forth below is summary cash flow information for each of the years ended December 31, 2017, 2018 and 2019.\nTable 82: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cash Flows (in thousands)\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>2019\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash provided by operating activities\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 66,354\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 58,181\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 77,296\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash used in investing activities\n</td> <td> (14,948)\n</td> <td> (9,690)\n</td> <td> (11,533)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash used in financing activities\n</td> <td> (33,140)\n</td> <td> (57,546)\n</td> <td> (57,918)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Increase (Decrease) in cash\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 18,266\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> (9,055)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 7,845\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nSources and Uses of Cash\nDuring the three-year periods described above, net cash provided by operating activities was used for funding capital investment, paying dividends, paying interest on our senior credit facilities, and funding working capital requirements during our pre-season shipping period.\nThe following table shows our cash and cash equivalents and inventories at December 31, 2017, 2018 and 2019.\nTable 83: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>2019\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(in thousands)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cash and cash equivalents\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>36,875\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>27,820\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>35,665\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Inventories\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>71,524\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>81,996\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>77,942\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nYear Ended December 31, 2019 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2018\nWe had cash and cash equivalents of $35.7 million at December 31, 2019 compared to cash and cash equivalents of $27.8 million at December 31, 2018.

The increase in cash provided by operating activities was due to $25.6 million in favorable working capital changes offset by a $6.5 million decrease in net income adjusted for reconciling items. The largest driver positively impacting cash flows was a decrease in inventory levels, which had been built-up in 2018 in anticipation of tariffs and rising prices. Additionally, the Company made funding contributions of $7.0 million to its pension plans in 2018, compared to $0.5 million in 2019.\nNet cash used in investing activities increased $1.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to the corresponding period in 2018 due to the increase in capital expenditures.\nNet cash used in financing activities increased $0.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared to 2018. The increase in cash used in financing activities was primarily the result of an increase in dividends paid, where the cash dividend increased from $0.265 per share to $0.2725 per share in 2019. In addition, the Company made voluntary payments on its Term Loan Credit Agreement of $30.0 million in both 2018 and 2019.\nYear Ended December 31, 2018 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2017\nWe had cash and cash equivalents of $27.8 million at December 31, 2018 compared to cash and cash equivalents of $36.9 million at December 31, 2017. The table below sets forth a summary of the significant sources and uses of cash for the periods presented.\nTable 85: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cash Flows (in thousands)\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash provided by operating activities\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 66,354\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 58,181\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> (8,173)\n</td> <td>(12.3%)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash used in investing activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (14,948)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (9,690)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 5,258\n</td> <td>35.2%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash used in financing activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (33,140)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (57,546)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (24,406)\n</td> <td>(73.6%)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Increase (Decrease) in cash\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 18,266\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> (9,055)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> (27,321)\n</td> <td>149.6%\n</td> </tr>\n</table> Net cash provided by operating activities decreased $8.2 million from the year ended December 31, 2017 to the year ended December 31, 2018. The decrease in cash provided by operating activities was due to $23.2 million in unfavorable working capital changes offset by a $15.0 million increase in net income adjusted for reconciling items. The largest drivers negatively impacting cash flows was a $7.0 million contribution to our pension plans during the year ended December 31, 2018, a decrease in lawsuit proceeds of $1.3 million received in 2017, as well as the build-up of inventory in anticipation of tariffs and rising prices.\nNet cash used in investing activities decreased $5.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, compared to the corresponding period in 2017. This decrease was due to the $7.4 million cash outflow in 2017 for the Arrowhead acquisition. Slightly offsetting this decrease in cash used in investing activities was an increase in capital expenditures in 2018 as compared to 2017 by $2.1 million.\nNet cash used in financing activities increased $24.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 as compared to 2017. The increase in cash used in financing activities was primarily the result of $33.1 million of payments on our debt that occurred in the year ended December 31, 2018. This was partially offset by an earnout payment to the former owners of Dejana of $5.5 million in the year ended December 31, 2017 with no corresponding payment in 2018.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nThis Annual Report on Form 10-K contains financial information calculated other than in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ( GAAP\u201d).\nThese non-GAAP measures include:\n \u25cf Free cash flow; and \n \u25cf Adjusted EBITDA; and \n \u25cf Adjusted net income and earnings per share. \nThese non-GAAP disclosures should not be construed as an alternative to the reported results determined in accordance with GAAP.\nNet cash provided by operating activities was $77.3 million in the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared to $58.2 million in the year ended December 31, 2018. Free cash flow (as defined below) for the year ended December 31, 2019 was $65.8 million compared to $48.5 million in 2018, an increase in free cash flow of $17.3 million, or 35.7%. The increase in free cash flow is primarily a result of an increase in cash provided by operating activities of $19.1 million slightly offset by an increase in capital expenditures of $1.8 million, as discussed above under Liquidity and Capital Resources.\u201d Free cash flow for the year ended December 31, 2018 was $48.5 million compared to $58.8 million in 2017, a decrease in free cash flow of $10.3 million, or 17.5%. The\ndecrease in free cash flow is primarily a result of a decrease in cash provided by operating activities of $8.2 million and an increase in capital expenditures of $2.1 million.\nFree cash flow is a non-GAAP financial measure, which we define as net cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures. Free cash flow should be evaluated in addition to, and not considered a substitute for, other financial measures such as net income and cash flow provided by operations. We believe that free cash flow provides investors with a useful tool to evaluate our ability to generate additional cash flow from our business operations.\nThe following table reconciles net cash provided by operating activities, a GAAP measure, to free cash flow, a non-GAAP measure.\nTable 89: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>For the year ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2019\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(in thousands)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash provided by operating activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>66,354\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>58,181\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 77,296\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Acquisition of property and equipment\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (7,563)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (9,690)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (11,533)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Free cash flow\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 58,791\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 48,491\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 65,763\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nAdjusted EBITDA represents net income before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, as further adjusted for certain charges consisting of unrelated legal and consulting fees, pension termination costs, stock based compensation, severance, loss on extinguishment of debt, loss on disposal of fixed assets related to facility relocations, litigation proceeds and certain purchase accounting expenses. We use, and we believe our investors benefit from the presentation of Adjusted EBITDA in evaluating our operating performance because it provides us and our investors with additional tools to compare our operating performance on a consistent basis by removing the impact of certain items that management believes do not directly reflect our core operations. In addition, we believe that Adjusted EBITDA is useful to investors and other external users of our consolidated financial statements in evaluating our operating performance as compared to that of other companies, because it allows them to measure a company's operating performance without regard to items such as interest expense, taxes, depreciation and amortization, which can vary substantially from company to company depending upon accounting methods and book value of assets and liabilities, capital structure and the method by which assets were acquired. Our management also uses Adjusted EBITDA for planning purposes, including the preparation of our annual operating budget and financial projections. Management also uses Adjusted EBITDA to evaluate our ability to make certain payments, including dividends, in compliance with our senior credit facilities, which is determined based on a calculation of Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA\u201d that is substantially similar to Adjusted EBITDA.\nAdjusted EBITDA has limitations as an analytical tool. As a result, you should not consider it in isolation, or as a substitute for net income, operating income, cash flow from operating activities or any other measure of financial performance or liquidity presented in accordance with GAAP. Some of these limitations are:\n \u25cf Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect our cash expenditures or future requirements for capital expenditures or contractual commitments; \n \u25cf Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, our working capital needs; \n \u25cf Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect the interest expense, or the cash requirements necessary to service interest or principal payments, on our indebtedness; \n \u25cf Although depreciation and amortization are non-cash charges, the assets being depreciated and amortized will often have to be replaced in the future, and Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect any cash requirements for such replacements; \n \u25cf Other companies, including other companies in our industry, may calculate Adjusted EBITDA differently than we do, limiting its usefulness as a comparative measure; and \n \u25cf Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect tax obligations whether current or deferred. \nAdjusted EBITDA for the year ended December 31, 2019 was $108.1 million compared to $96.4 million in 2018, an increase of $11.7 million, or 12.1%. Adjusted EBITDA for the year ended December 31, 2018 was $96.4 million compared to $90.9 million in 2017, an increase of $5.5 million, or 6.1%. In addition to the specific changes resulting from the adjustments, the changes to Adjusted EBITDA for the periods discussed resulted from factors discussed above under -Results of Operations.\u201d\nThe following table presents a reconciliation of net income, the most comparable GAAP financial measure, to Adjusted EBITDA, for each of the periods indicated.\nTable 96: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>For the year ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2019\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(in thousands)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>44,176\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>39,009\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>55,324\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>43,905\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 49,166\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest expense-net\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10,895\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>15,195\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>18,336\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>16,943\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>16,782\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Income tax expense (benefit)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>22,087\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>24,687\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (2,409)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 11,854\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 13,451\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Depreciation expense\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,919\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6,146\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7,183\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7,613\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8,256\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Amortization\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7,362\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10,596\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11,401\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11,472\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10,956\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>EBITDA\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>89,439\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>95,633\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>89,835\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>91,787\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>98,611\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Purchase accounting (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,613\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (1,003)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (1,786)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (900)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (417)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Stock based compensation\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3,275\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,898\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3,500\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 4,550\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3,239\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Litigation proceeds\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (10,050)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (1,275)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (200)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Pension termination\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 6,609\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other charges (2)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,212\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,969\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>653\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,006\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 263\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Adjusted EBITDA\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>96,539\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>91,447\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>90,927\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>96,443\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>108,105\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n (1) Reflects $335 in earn out compensation expense related to TrynEx in the year ended December 31, 2015.

We have net unrecognized tax benefits of $1.6 million as of December 31, 2019. However, we cannot make a reasonably reliable estimate of the period of potential cash settlement of the underlying liabilities; therefore, we have not included unrecognized tax benefits in calculating the obligations set forth in the following table of significant contractual obligations as of December 31, 2019.\nTable 105: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(Dollars in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Less than 1 year\n</td> <td>1 - 3 years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3 - 5 years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>More than 5 years\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Long-term debt (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>245,787\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 22,143\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>223,644\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating leases - related parties (2)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>16,679\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,280\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,597\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 4,651\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 5,151\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating leases - third parties (3)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10,176\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,636\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,235\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,310\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 995\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest on long-term debt (4)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>23,077\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 11,598\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 11,479\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total contracted cash obligations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>295,719\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>38,657\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>243,955\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>6,961\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>6,146\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n (1) Long-term debt obligation is presented net of discount of $0.8 million at December 31, 2019. \n (2) Relates to nine operating leases at Dejana upfitting and manufacturing facilities with related party affiliates. \n (3) Relates to real estate and equipment operating leases with third parties, including five operating leases for Henderson installation and distribution locations and two operating leases for Dejana locations. \n (4) Assumes all debt will remain outstanding until maturity. Interest payments were calculated using interest rates in effect as of December 31, 2019. \nSenior Credit Facilities\nSee Note 9 for a description of our senior credit facilities and other debt.\nDeductibility of Intangible and Goodwill Expense\nWe possess a favorable tax structure where annual tax-deductible intangible and goodwill amortization expense may be utilized in the event we have sufficient taxable income to utilize such benefit. As we have previously acquired businesses possessing significant intangible assets and goodwill, we have created a favorable tax structure where income tax expense is greater than book amortization expense. We expect the deductibility of intangible assets and goodwill amortization expense to exceed book by approximately $4.1 million in the year ended December 31, 2020 if we have the taxable income to utilize such benefit.\nImpact of Inflation\nWe do not believe that inflation risk is material to our business or our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows at this time. Historically, we have experienced normal raw material, labor and fringe benefit inflation. To date we have been able to fully offset this inflation by providing higher value products, which command higher prices. In previous years, including in 2018 and 2019 as a result of inflationary pressures due to tariffs, we have experienced significant increases in steel costs, but have been able to mitigate the effects of these increases through both temporary and permanent steel surcharges. See Risk Factors- The price of steel, a commodity necessary to manufacture our products, is highly variable. If the price of steel increases, our gross margins could decline\u201d.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe are not party to any off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a material current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues, expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources.\nSeasonality and Year-To-Year Variability\nWhile our Work Truck Solutions segment has limited seasonality and variability, our Work Truck Attachments segment is seasonal and also varies from year-to-year. Consequently, our Work Truck Attachments segment results of operations and financial condition vary from quarter-to-quarter and from year-to-year as well. In addition, because of this seasonality and variability, our Work Truck Attachments segment results of operations for any quarter may not be indicative of results of operations that may be achieved for a subsequent quarter or the full year, and may not be similar to results of operations experienced in prior years.\nSales of our Work Truck Attachments segment products are significantly impacted by the level, timing and location of snowfall, with sales in any given year and region most heavily influenced by snowfall levels in the prior snow season (which we consider to begin in October and end in March) in that region. This is due to the fact that end-user demand for our Work Truck Attachments products is driven primarily by the condition of their snow and ice control equipment, and in the case of professional snowplowers, by their financial ability to purchase new or replacement snow and ice control equipment, both of which are significantly affected by snowfall levels. Heavy snowfall during a given winter causes usage of our Work Truck Attachments products to increase, resulting in greater wear and tear to our products and a shortening of their life cycles, thereby creating a need for replacement snow and ice control equipment and related parts and accessories. In addition, when there is a heavy snowfall in a given winter, the increased income our professional snowplowers generate from their professional snowplow activities provides them with increased purchasing power to purchase replacement snow and ice control equipment prior to the following winter. To a lesser extent, sales of our Work Truck Attachments products are influenced by the timing of snowfall in a given winter. Because an early snowfall can be viewed as a sign of a heavy upcoming snow season, our Work Truck Attachments segment's end-users may respond to an early snowfall by purchasing replacement snow and ice control equipment during the current season rather than delaying purchases until after the season is over when most purchases are typically made by end-users.\nWe attempt to manage the seasonal impact of snowfall on our Work Truck Attachments segment revenues in part through our pre-season sales program, which involves actively soliciting and encouraging pre-season distributor orders in the second and third quarters by offering our distributors a combination of pricing, payment and freight incentives during this period. These pre-season sales incentives encourage our distributors to re-stock their inventory during the second and third quarters in anticipation of the peak fourth quarter retail sales period by offering favorable pre-season pricing and payment deferral until the fourth quarter. As a result, we tend to generate our greatest volume of sales (an average of over two-thirds over the last ten years) during the second and third quarters, providing us with manufacturing visibility for the remainder of the year. By contrast, our revenue and operating results tend to be lowest during the first quarter as management believes our end-users prefer to wait until the beginning of a snow season to purchase new equipment and as our distributors sell off inventory and wait for our pre-season sales incentive period to re-stock inventory. Fourth quarter sales vary from year-to-year as they are primarily driven by the level, timing and location of snowfall during the quarter. This is because most of our fourth\nquarter sales and shipments consist of re-orders by distributors seeking to restock inventory to meet immediate customer needs caused by snowfall during the winter months.\nOur Work Truck Attachments segment revenue and operating results tend to be lowest during the first quarter, during which period we typically experience negative earnings as the snow season draws to a close. Our Work Truck Attachments segment first quarter revenue has varied from approximately $18.0 million to approximately $33.9 million between 2015 and 2019. During the last five-year period, net income (loss) during the first quarter has varied from a net income of approximately $3.9 million to a net loss of approximately $0.9 million, with an average net income of $1.3 million.\nWhile our Work Truck Attachments monthly working capital has averaged approximately $73.1 million from 2017 to 2019, because of the seasonality of our sales, we experience seasonality in our working capital needs as well. In the first quarter we require capital as we are generally required to build our inventory in anticipation of our second and third quarter sales seasons. During the second and third quarters, our working capital requirements rise as our accounts receivables increase as a result of the sale and shipment of products ordered through our pre-season sales program and we continue to build inventory. Working capital requirements peak towards the end of the third quarter (reaching an average peak of approximately $97.1 million over the prior three years) and then begin to decline through the fourth quarter through a reduction in accounts receivables (as it is in the fourth quarter that we receive a majority of the payments for previously shipped products).\nWe also attempt to manage the impact of seasonality and year-to-year variability on our business costs through the effective management of our assets. See Business-Our Business Strategy-Aggressive Asset Management and Profit Focus.\u201d Our asset management and profit focus strategies include:\n \u25cf the employment of a highly variable cost structure facilitated by a core group of workers that we supplement with a temporary workforce as sales volumes dictate, which allows us to adjust costs on an as-needed basis in response to changing demand; \n \u25cf our enterprise-wide lean concept, which allows us to adjust production levels up or down to meet demand; \n \u25cf the pre-season order program described above, which incentivizes distributors to place orders prior to the retail selling season; and \n \u25cf a vertically integrated business model. \nThese asset management and profit focus strategies, among other management tools, allow us to adjust fixed overhead and selling, general and administrative expenditures to account for the year-to-year variability of our sales volumes. Management currently estimates that consolidated annual fixed overhead expenses generally range from approximately $50.0 million in low sales volume years to approximately $70.0 million in high sales volume years. Further, management currently estimates that consolidated annual sales, general and administrative expenses other than amortization generally approximate $75.0 million, but can be reduced to approximately $65.0 million to maximize cash flow in low sales volume years, and can increase to approximately $85.0 million to maintain customer service and responsiveness in high sales volume years.\nAdditionally, although modest, our annual capital expenditure requirements, which are normally budgeted around 2-3% of net sales, can be temporarily reduced by up to approximately 40% in response to actual or anticipated decreases in sales volumes. If we are unsuccessful in our asset management initiatives, the seasonality and year-to-year variability effects on our business may be compounded and in turn our results of operations and financial condition may suffer.", "item_7_text": "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThe following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2018 and 2019 should be read together with our audited consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Some of the information contained in this discussion and analysis or set forth elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including information with respect to our plans and strategies for our business, includes forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. You should review the Risk Factors\u201d section of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a discussion of important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the results described in, or implied by, the forward-looking statements contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nResults of Operations\nOperating Segments\nDuring the first quarter of 2019, the Company reorganized its business segments to reflect a new operating structure as a result of a change in how the Company's chief operating decision maker allocates resources, makes operating decisions and assesses the performance of the business. Under the revised reporting structure, the Company's two reportable business segments are as follows:\nWork Truck Attachments. The Work Truck Attachments segment includes our operations that manufacture and sell snow and ice control attachments and other products sold under the FISHER\u00ae, WESTERN\u00ae, and SNOWEX\u00ae brands. As described under Seasonality and Year-To- Year Variability,\u201d the Work Truck Attachments segment is seasonal and, as a result, its results of operations can vary from quarter-to-quarter and from year-to-year.\nWork Truck Solutions. The Work Truck Solutions segment includes manufactured municipal snow and ice control products under the HENDERSON\u00ae brand and the upfit of market leading attachments and storage solutions under the HENDERSON\u00ae brand, and the DEJANA\u00ae brand and its related sub-brands.\nSee Note 17 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for information concerning individual segment performance for the years ended December 31, 2019, December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017, respectively.\nOverview\nAlthough we diversified and expanded our portfolio with the acquisition of Dejana during the year ended December 31, 2016, snowfall is still the primary factor in evaluating our business results due to its significant impact on the results of operations of our Work Truck Attachments segment. We typically compare the snowfall level in a given period both to the snowfall level in the prior season and to those snowfall levels we consider to be average. References to average snowfall\u201d levels below refer to the aggregate average inches of snowfall recorded in 66 cities in 26 snow-belt states in the United States during the annual snow season, from October 1 through March 31, from 1980 to 2019. During this period, snowfall averaged 3,046 inches, with the low in such period being 1,794 inches and the high being 4,502 inches. Meanwhile, over the last 10 years, snowfall averaged 3,237 inches for the snow periods ending March 31, 2010 through 2019.\nDuring the six-month snow season ended March 31, 2019, snowfall was 3,154 inches, which was 3.5% higher than average. During the six-month snow season ended March 31, 2018, we experienced snowfall that was 9.6% higher than average. During the six-month snow season ended March 31, 2017, we experienced snowfall that was 5.4% lower than average. While snowfall trended above average the past two years based on historical averages from 1980 to 2019, snowfall was 2.6% below average compared to the average over the last 10 years. Additionally, the timing and location of snowfall can have an impact on our financial results. We believe the near-average snowfall in the year ended December 31, 2019 was the largest driver that positively impacted our business in 2019. We believe other factors had a positive impact, including positively trending light truck sales in 2019 and the continued successful integration of Dejana. In both 2018 and 2019, we encountered chassis availability issues\nwith certain of our OEM partners, which negatively impacted our business, although in 2019 chassis predictability has improved when compared to the prior year.\nThe following table sets forth, for the periods presented, the consolidated statements of income of the Company and its subsidiaries. All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. In the table below and throughout this Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,\u201d consolidated statements of income data for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2018 and 2019 have been derived from our audited consolidated financial statements. The information contained in the table below should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\n\nThe following table sets forth, for the periods indicated, the percentage of certain items in our consolidated statement of income data, relative to net sales:\n\nYear Ended December 31, 2019 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2018\nNet Sales. Net sales were $571.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to $524.1 million in 2018, an increase of $47.6 million, or 9.1%. Net sales increased for the year ended December 31, 2019 primarily due to higher volumes driven by ongoing positive demand, price increases and improved chassis predictability. See below for a discussion of net sales for each of our segments.\n Net sales at our Work Truck Attachment segment were $293.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to $275.2 million in the year ended December 31, 2018, an increase of $18.4 million primarily due to strong sales during our preseason period and increased parts and accessories sales, as well as price recovery on higher material costs.\nNet sales at our Work Truck Solutions segment were $278.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to $248.8 million in the year ended December 31, 2018, an increase of $29.3 million due primarily to increased demand, including certain large fleet orders, price recovery on higher material costs, as well as continued improvements in chassis supply predictability when compared to the prior year.\nCost of Sales. Cost of sales was $402.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to $369.2 million in 2018, an increase of $33.7 million, or 9.1%. Cost of sales as a percentage of net sales increased slightly from 70.4% for the year ended December 31, 2018 to 70.5% for the year ended December 31, 2019. The slight increase in cost of sales in the year ended December 31, 2019 when compared to the year ended December 31, 2018 was primarily due to increased healthcare and labor costs, as well as a higher cost of sales as a percentage of sales for Work Truck Solutions products, which historically has operated at lower margins than the Work Truck Attachments segment, offset by operating efficiencies in the Work Truck Solutions segment.\nGross Profit. Gross profit was $168.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to $154.9 million in 2018, an increase of $13.9 million, or 9.0%, due to the increase in net sales described above under -Net Sales.\u201d As a percentage of net sales, gross profit decreased slightly from 29.6% for the year ended December 31, 2018 to 29.5% for the corresponding period in 2019, as a result of the factors discussed above under -Cost of Sales.\u201d\nSelling, General and Administrative Expense. Selling, general and administrative expenses, including intangible asset amortization, were $82.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to $81.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, an increase of $0.8 million, or 1.0%. The increase compared to the year ended December 31, 2018 was primarily due to an increase in healthcare costs and an increase in variable compensation due to improved operating results, offset by a decrease in stock compensation expense related to plan design changes implemented in the prior year and planned management transitions that occurred in 2019, and a decrease in legal expenses related to a patent infringement case in the prior year. In addition, there were decreases in earnout expense of $0.4 million in the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to $0.9 million in the year ended December 31, 2018 driven by the earnout valuation adjustments in the respective periods. As a percentage of net sales, selling, general and administrative expenses, including intangibles amortization, decreased from 15.5% for the year ended December 31, 2018 to 14.4% for the corresponding period in 2019.\nInterest Expense. Interest expense was $16.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to $16.9 million in the corresponding period in 2018. The slight decrease in interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2019 was primarily due to the reduction to the principal balance of the Term Loan Credit Agreement due to a $30.0 million voluntary prepayment made in February 2019, offset by an increase in interest expense on revolver borrowings of $0.4 million when compared to the prior year.\nPension Termination. Pension termination costs were $6.6 million in the year ended December 31, 2019, as a result of the Company successfully terminating its pension plans during the period. See Note 13 for additional information on the termination of the pension plans.\nIncome Tax Expense. Our effective combined federal and state tax rate for 2019 was 21.5% compared to 21.3% for 2018. The effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2019 is slightly higher than 2018 primarily due to a decrease in the release of reserves for uncertain tax positions of $0.5 million; $0.8 million in the year ended December 31, 2019 versus $1.3 million in the year ended December 31, 2018. The Company also made a voluntary pension funding payment in the year ended December 31, 2018 of $7.0 million which was deducted in the Company's tax returns for the year ended December 31, 2017 reducing taxable income for that period. The increased pension funding deduction resulted in a tax benefit of $0.7 million, also decreasing the tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2018. The increase in effective tax rate was partially offset by decreases in the rate related to state rate changes driven by legislative changes in tax laws in one of the states in which we operate, and a benefit related to the increase in officer life insurance as a result of market performance.\nDeferred income taxes reflect the net tax effects of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes. The largest item affecting the deferred taxes is the difference between book and tax amortization of goodwill and other intangible amortization.\nNet Income. Net income for the year ended December 31, 2019 was $49.2 million compared to net income of $43.9 million for 2018, an increase of $5.3 million. This increase was driven by the factors described above.\nYear Ended December 31, 2018 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2017\nNet Sales. Net sales were $524.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to $474.9 million in 2017, an increase of $49.2 million, or 10.4%. Net sales increased for the year ended December 31, 2018 primarily due to snowfall levels near historical averages in the snow season ended March 31, 2018, an increase compared to below average snowfall levels during the prior snow season. Additionally, the increase in sales was due to increased volume at our Work Truck Solutions segment and higher pricing across both segments. This increase was partially offset by chassis supply availability issues in both segments. See below for a discussion of net sales for each of our segments.\nNet sales at our Work Truck Attachment segment were $275.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to $238.9 million in the year ended December 31, 2017, an increase of $36.3 million primarily due to higher levels of snowfall in the snow season ended March 31, 2018 compared to the snow season ended March 31, 2017. Snowfall during the snow season ended March 31, 2018 were near historical averages, an increase compared to the snow season ended March 31, 2017, which saw below average snowfall levels.\nNet sales at our Work Truck Solutions segment were $248.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to $236.0 million in the year ended December 31, 2017, an increase of $12.8 million due primarily to increased demand from generally favorable macro-economic conditions and the inclusion of incremental sales from additional facilities of $5.3 million in the year ended December 31, 2018 versus 2017. Strong sales for work truck upfits were slightly offset by sales decreases in our municipal products, due to ongoing chassis supply availability issues.\nCost of Sales. Cost of sales was $369.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to $331.8 million in 2017, an increase of $37.4 million, or 11.3%. Cost of sales as a percentage of net sales increased from 69.9% for the year ended December 31, 2017 to 70.4% for the year ended December 31, 2018. The increase in cost of sales in the year ended December 31, 2018 when compared to the year ended December 31, 2017 was primarily due to higher cost of sales as a percentage of sales for Work Truck Solutions products, growth in lower margin product lines, and inflation.\nGross Profit. Gross profit was $154.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to $143.1 million in 2017, an increase of $11.8 million, or 8.2%, due to the increase in net sales described above under -Net Sales.\u201d As a percentage of net sales, gross profit decreased from 30.1% for the year ended December 31,\n2017 to 29.6% for the corresponding period in 2018, as a result of the factors discussed above under -Cost of Sales.\u201d\nSelling, General and Administrative Expense. Selling, general and administrative expenses, including intangible asset amortization, were $81.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to $72.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, an increase of $9.1 million, or 12.6%. The increase compared to the year ended December 31, 2017 was primarily due to an increase in variable compensation of $3.5 million due to improved operating results, higher stock compensation expense of $1.1 million related to plan design changes, increased discretionary spending including $0.9 million related to advertising and promotions as a result of a return to average snowfall levels, as well as increased costs related to headcount and wages. In addition, there were decreases in earnout expense of $0.9 million in the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to $1.8 million in the year ended December 31, 2017 driven by the earnout valuation adjustments in the respective periods. As a percentage of net sales, selling, general and administrative expenses, including intangibles amortization, increased from 15.2% for the year ended December 31, 2017 to 15.5% for the corresponding period in 2018 due to the factors noted above.\nInterest Expense. Interest expense was $16.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to $18.3 million in the corresponding period in 2017. The decrease in interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2018 was due to $1.6 million of financing costs that were expensed in the year ended December 31, 2017 related to the amendments to its Term Loan Credit Agreement to decrease the interest rate margins that apply to the term loan facility, which were completed in February 2017 and August 2017. Additionally, the Company had a more favorable interest rate in 2018 due to the debt refinances, as well as a lower debt balance from repayments of $33.1 million in 2018. This decrease was partially offset by increased interest on higher revolver borrowings in 2018 compared to 2017.\nLitigation Proceeds. Litigation proceeds were $1.3 million year ended December 31, 2017 due to a settlement related to the successful conclusion of a patent infringement lawsuit against Meyer Products, LLC.\nIncome Tax Expense (Benefit). Deferred income taxes reflect the net tax effects of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes. The largest item affecting the deferred taxes is the difference between book and tax amortization of goodwill and other intangible amortization. Our effective combined federal and state tax rate for 2018 was 21.3% compared to (4.6%) for 2017. The effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2017 is significantly lower than 2018 primarily due to the revaluation of the deferred tax assets and liabilities in 2017 resulting from the passage of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act ( The Act\u201d). As a result of the reduction in the U.S. corporate income tax rate from 35.0% to 21.0% under the Act, the Company recorded a reduction to its net deferred tax liability of $22.5 million, and a corresponding decrease to income tax expense in the Company's Consolidated Statement of Operations for the year ended December 31, 2017. Contributing to the tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2018 was the release of reserves for uncertain tax positions of $1.3 million. The Company also made a voluntary pension funding payment in the year ended December 31, 2018 of $7.0 million which was deducted in the Company's tax returns for the year ended December 31, 2017 reducing taxable income for that period. The increased pension funding deduction resulted in a tax benefit of $0.7 million, also decreasing the tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2018 as this deduction was not included in the provision recorded at December 31, 2017. Without these items, the Company's tax rate would have been approximately 25.0% in the year ended December 31, 2018.\nOn December 22, 2017, the SEC staff issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118 ( SAB 118\u201d) to address the application of U.S. GAAP in situations when a registrant does not have the necessary information available, prepared, or analyzed (including computations) in reasonable detail to complete the accounting for certain income tax effects of The Tax Reform Act. As of the date of this Annual Report, we have recorded all known enactment-date income tax effects of the Act. These adjustments have been recorded as a component of income tax expense and include the revaluation of deferred tax assets and liabilities. In the year ended December 31, 2018, the Company did not have any material tax accounting adjustments to the provisional estimate recorded in the financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2017, the first measurement period under SAB 118 and amounts are now complete.\nNet Income. Net income for the year ended December 31, 2018 was $43.9 million compared to net income of $55.3 million for 2017, a decrease of $11.4 million. This decrease was driven by the factors described above.\nDiscussion of Critical Accounting Policies\nOur consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, costs and expenses, and related disclosures. These estimates and assumptions are often based on judgments that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances at the time made, but all such estimates and assumptions are inherently uncertain and unpredictable. Actual results may differ from those estimates and assumptions, and it is possible that other professionals, applying their own judgment to the same facts and circumstances, could develop and support alternative estimates and assumptions that would result in material changes to our operating results and financial condition. We evaluate our estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis. Our estimates are based on historical experience and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances.\nThe most significant accounting estimates inherent in the preparation of our financial statements include estimates used in the determination of liabilities related to pension obligations, revenue recognition, and impairment assessment of goodwill.\nWe believe the following are the critical accounting policies that affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nRevenue Recognition\nIn May 2014, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update ( ASU\u201d) No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606), which supersedes the revenue recognition requirements in ASC 605, Revenue Recognition. We adopted ASC 606 using the modified retrospective method as of January 1, 2018. This approach was applied to all contracts not completed as of the date of initial application. Upon adoption, we recognized the cumulative effect of adopting this guidance as an adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings of $0.4 million.\nWork Truck Attachments Segment Revenue Recognition\nWe recognize revenue upon shipment of equipment to the customer. Within the Work Truck Attachments segment, we offer a variety of discounts and sales incentives to our distributors. The estimated liability for sales discounts and allowances is recorded at the time of sale as a reduction of net sales using the expected value method. The liability is estimated based on the costs of the program, the planned duration of the program and historical experience.\nWork Truck Solutions Segment Revenue Recognition\nThe Work Truck Solutions segment primarily participates in the truck and vehicle upfitting industry in the United States. Customers are billed separately for the truck chassis by the chassis manufacturer. We only record sales for the amount of the upfit, excluding the truck chassis. Generally, we obtain the truck chassis from the truck chassis manufacturer through either our floor plan agreement with a financial institution or bailment pool agreement with the truck chassis manufacturer. Additionally, in some instances we upfit chassis which are owned by the end customer. For truck chassis acquired through the floor plan agreement, we hold title to the vehicle from the time the chassis is received by us until the completion of the up-fit. Under the bailment pool agreement, we do not take title to the truck chassis, but rather only hold the truck chassis on consignment. We pay interest on both of these arrangements. We record revenue in the same manner net of the value of the truck chassis in both our floor plan and bailment pool agreements. We do not set the price for the truck chassis, are not responsible for the billing of the chassis and do not have inventory risk in either the bailment pool or floor plan agreements. The Work Truck Solutions segment also has manufacturing operations of municipal snow and ice control equipment, where revenue is recognized upon shipment of equipment to the customer.\nRevenues from the sales of the Work Truck Solutions products are recognized net of the truck chassis with the selling price to the customer recorded as sales and the manufacturing and up-fit cost of the product recorded as cost of sales. In these cases, we act as an agent as it do not have inventory or pricing control over the truck chassis. Within the Work Truck Solutions segment, we also sell certain third-party products for which we act as an agent. These sales do not meet the criteria for gross sales recognition, and thus are recognized on a net basis at the time of sale. Under net sales recognition, the cost paid to the third-party service provider is recorded as a reduction to sales, resulting in net sales being equal to the gross profit on the transaction.\nSee Note 3 to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a more detailed description of our revenue recognition policies.\nGoodwill\nWe perform an annual impairment test for goodwill and more frequently if an event or circumstances indicate that an impairment loss has been incurred. Conditions that would trigger an impairment assessment include, but are not limited to, a significant adverse change in legal factors or business climate that could affect the value of an asset. The amount of goodwill impairment is determined by the amount the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value. We have determined we have three reporting units, and all significant decisions are made on a company-wide basis by our chief operating decision maker. The fair value of the reporting unit is estimated by using an income and market approach. The estimated fair value is compared with our aggregate carrying value. If our fair value is greater than the carrying amount, there is no impairment. If our carrying amount is greater than the fair value, an impairment loss is recognized equal to the difference. Annual impairment tests conducted by us on December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017 resulted in no adjustment to the carrying value of our goodwill.\nOur goodwill balances could be impaired in future periods. A number of factors, many of which we have no ability to control, could affect our financial condition, operating results and business prospects and could cause actual results to differ from the estimates and assumptions we employed. These factors include:\n \u25cf a prolonged global economic crisis; \n \u25cf a decrease in the demand for our products; \n \u25cf the inability to develop new and enhanced products and services in a timely manner; \n \u25cf a significant adverse change in legal factors or in the business climate; \n \u25cf delays by our supplier and OEM partners in the production and delivery of products and components; \n \u25cf an adverse action or assessment by a regulator; and \n \u25cf successful efforts by our competitors to gain market share in our markets. \nAt December 31, 2019, our Work Truck Solutions consists of two reporting units; Municipal and Dejana. The Municipal reporting unit had goodwill of $47.8 million, an estimated fair market value of $139.8 million and an estimated carrying value of $100.0 million. The Dejana reporting unit had goodwill of $80.1 million, an estimated fair market value of $298.1 million and an estimated carrying value of $200.4 million. If we are unable to attain the financial projections used in the income approach used in calculating the fair value, or if there are significant market conditions impacting the market approach, including the factors noted above, our Work Truck Solutions segment goodwill could be at risk of impairment. We have initiated a comprehensive strategic plan which is focused on reducing expenses and improving margins at Work Truck Solutions. If the cost savings and other initiatives in this plan do not materialize, or if we experience delays by our supplier and OEM partners in the production and delivery of chassis, which could negatively affect our financial results, the Work Truck Solutions segment goodwill may be impaired. There were no indicators of impairment subsequent to the December 31, 2019 impairment test.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nOur principal sources of cash have been and we expect will continue to be cash from operations and borrowings under our senior credit facilities.\nOur primary uses of cash are to provide working capital, meet debt service requirements, finance capital expenditures, pay dividends under our dividend policy and support our growth, including through potential acquisitions, and for other general corporate purposes. For a description of the seasonality of our working capital rates see -Seasonality and Year-To-Year Variability.\u201d\nOur Board of Directors has adopted a dividend policy that reflects an intention to distribute to our stockholders a regular quarterly cash dividend. The declaration and payment of these dividends to holders of our common stock is at the discretion of our Board of Directors and depends upon many factors, including our financial condition and earnings, legal requirements, taxes and other factors our Board of Directors may deem to be relevant. The terms of our indebtedness may also restrict us from paying cash dividends on our common stock under certain circumstances. As a result of this dividend policy, we may not have significant cash available to meet any large unanticipated liquidity requirements. As a result, we may not retain a sufficient amount of cash to fund our operations or to finance unanticipated capital expenditures or growth opportunities, including acquisitions. Our Board of Directors may, however, amend, revoke or suspend our dividend policy at any time and for any reason.\nAs of December 31, 2019, we had liquidity comprised of approximately $35.7 million in cash and cash equivalents and borrowing availability of approximately $99.4 million under our revolving credit facility. Borrowing availability under our revolving credit facility is governed by a borrowing base, the calculation of which includes cash on hand. Accordingly, use of cash on hand may also result in a reduction in the amount available for borrowing under our revolving credit facility. Furthermore, our revolving credit facility requires us to maintain at least $15.0 million of borrowing availability. We expect that cash on hand, cash generated from operations, as well as available credit under our senior credit facilities will provide adequate funds for the purposes described above for at least the next 12 months.\nCash Flow Analysis\nSet forth below is summary cash flow information for each of the years ended December 31, 2017, 2018 and 2019.\n\nSources and Uses of Cash\nDuring the three-year periods described above, net cash provided by operating activities was used for funding capital investment, paying dividends, paying interest on our senior credit facilities, and funding working capital requirements during our pre-season shipping period.\nThe following table shows our cash and cash equivalents and inventories at December 31, 2017, 2018 and 2019.\n\nYear Ended December 31, 2019 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2018\nWe had cash and cash equivalents of $35.7 million at December 31, 2019 compared to cash and cash equivalents of $27.8 million at December 31, 2018. The table below sets forth a summary of the significant sources and uses of cash for the periods presented.\n Net cash provided by operating activities increased $19.1 million from the year ended December 31, 2018 to the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase in cash provided by operating activities was due to $25.6 million in favorable working capital changes offset by a $6.5 million decrease in net income adjusted for reconciling items. The largest driver positively impacting cash flows was a decrease in inventory levels, which had been built-up in 2018 in anticipation of tariffs and rising prices. Additionally, the Company made funding contributions of $7.0 million to its pension plans in 2018, compared to $0.5 million in 2019.\nNet cash used in investing activities increased $1.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to the corresponding period in 2018 due to the increase in capital expenditures.\nNet cash used in financing activities increased $0.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared to 2018. The increase in cash used in financing activities was primarily the result of an increase in dividends paid, where the cash dividend increased from $0.265 per share to $0.2725 per share in 2019. In addition, the Company made voluntary payments on its Term Loan Credit Agreement of $30.0 million in both 2018 and 2019.\nYear Ended December 31, 2018 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2017\nWe had cash and cash equivalents of $27.8 million at December 31, 2018 compared to cash and cash equivalents of $36.9 million at December 31, 2017. The table below sets forth a summary of the significant sources and uses of cash for the periods presented.\n Net cash provided by operating activities decreased $8.2 million from the year ended December 31, 2017 to the year ended December 31, 2018. The decrease in cash provided by operating activities was due to $23.2 million in unfavorable working capital changes offset by a $15.0 million increase in net income adjusted for reconciling items. The largest drivers negatively impacting cash flows was a $7.0 million contribution to our pension plans during the year ended December 31, 2018, a decrease in lawsuit proceeds of $1.3 million received in 2017, as well as the build-up of inventory in anticipation of tariffs and rising prices.\nNet cash used in investing activities decreased $5.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, compared to the corresponding period in 2017. This decrease was due to the $7.4 million cash outflow in 2017 for the Arrowhead acquisition. Slightly offsetting this decrease in cash used in investing activities was an increase in capital expenditures in 2018 as compared to 2017 by $2.1 million.\nNet cash used in financing activities increased $24.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 as compared to 2017. The increase in cash used in financing activities was primarily the result of $33.1 million of payments on our debt that occurred in the year ended December 31, 2018. This was partially offset by an earnout payment to the former owners of Dejana of $5.5 million in the year ended December 31, 2017 with no corresponding payment in 2018.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nThis Annual Report on Form 10-K contains financial information calculated other than in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ( GAAP\u201d).\nThese non-GAAP measures include:\n \u25cf Free cash flow; and \n \u25cf Adjusted EBITDA; and \n \u25cf Adjusted net income and earnings per share. \nThese non-GAAP disclosures should not be construed as an alternative to the reported results determined in accordance with GAAP.\nNet cash provided by operating activities was $77.3 million in the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared to $58.2 million in the year ended December 31, 2018. Free cash flow (as defined below) for the year ended December 31, 2019 was $65.8 million compared to $48.5 million in 2018, an increase in free cash flow of $17.3 million, or 35.7%. The increase in free cash flow is primarily a result of an increase in cash provided by operating activities of $19.1 million slightly offset by an increase in capital expenditures of $1.8 million, as discussed above under Liquidity and Capital Resources.\u201d Free cash flow for the year ended December 31, 2018 was $48.5 million compared to $58.8 million in 2017, a decrease in free cash flow of $10.3 million, or 17.5%. The\ndecrease in free cash flow is primarily a result of a decrease in cash provided by operating activities of $8.2 million and an increase in capital expenditures of $2.1 million.\nFree cash flow is a non-GAAP financial measure, which we define as net cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures. Free cash flow should be evaluated in addition to, and not considered a substitute for, other financial measures such as net income and cash flow provided by operations. We believe that free cash flow provides investors with a useful tool to evaluate our ability to generate additional cash flow from our business operations.\nThe following table reconciles net cash provided by operating activities, a GAAP measure, to free cash flow, a non-GAAP measure.\n\nAdjusted EBITDA represents net income before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, as further adjusted for certain charges consisting of unrelated legal and consulting fees, pension termination costs, stock based compensation, severance, loss on extinguishment of debt, loss on disposal of fixed assets related to facility relocations, litigation proceeds and certain purchase accounting expenses. We use, and we believe our investors benefit from the presentation of Adjusted EBITDA in evaluating our operating performance because it provides us and our investors with additional tools to compare our operating performance on a consistent basis by removing the impact of certain items that management believes do not directly reflect our core operations. In addition, we believe that Adjusted EBITDA is useful to investors and other external users of our consolidated financial statements in evaluating our operating performance as compared to that of other companies, because it allows them to measure a company's operating performance without regard to items such as interest expense, taxes, depreciation and amortization, which can vary substantially from company to company depending upon accounting methods and book value of assets and liabilities, capital structure and the method by which assets were acquired. Our management also uses Adjusted EBITDA for planning purposes, including the preparation of our annual operating budget and financial projections. Management also uses Adjusted EBITDA to evaluate our ability to make certain payments, including dividends, in compliance with our senior credit facilities, which is determined based on a calculation of Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA\u201d that is substantially similar to Adjusted EBITDA.\nAdjusted EBITDA has limitations as an analytical tool. As a result, you should not consider it in isolation, or as a substitute for net income, operating income, cash flow from operating activities or any other measure of financial performance or liquidity presented in accordance with GAAP. Some of these limitations are:\n \u25cf Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect our cash expenditures or future requirements for capital expenditures or contractual commitments; \n \u25cf Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, our working capital needs; \n \u25cf Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect the interest expense, or the cash requirements necessary to service interest or principal payments, on our indebtedness; \n \u25cf Although depreciation and amortization are non-cash charges, the assets being depreciated and amortized will often have to be replaced in the future, and Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect any cash requirements for such replacements; \n \u25cf Other companies, including other companies in our industry, may calculate Adjusted EBITDA differently than we do, limiting its usefulness as a comparative measure; and \n \u25cf Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect tax obligations whether current or deferred. \nAdjusted EBITDA for the year ended December 31, 2019 was $108.1 million compared to $96.4 million in 2018, an increase of $11.7 million, or 12.1%. Adjusted EBITDA for the year ended December 31, 2018 was $96.4 million compared to $90.9 million in 2017, an increase of $5.5 million, or 6.1%. In addition to the specific changes resulting from the adjustments, the changes to Adjusted EBITDA for the periods discussed resulted from factors discussed above under -Results of Operations.\u201d\nThe following table presents a reconciliation of net income, the most comparable GAAP financial measure, to Adjusted EBITDA, for each of the periods indicated.\n\n (1) Reflects $335 in earn out compensation expense related to TrynEx in the year ended December 31, 2015. Reflects $322 and $1,956 in earn out compensation expense related to Henderson and inventory step up related to Henderson included in cost of sales in the year ended December 31, 2015. Reflects ($1,301) and $173 in earn out compensation expense (benefit) related to TrynEx and Dejana, respectively in the year ended December 31, 2016. Reflects $125 in inventory step up related to Dejana included in cost of sales in the year ended December 31, 2016. Reflects $1,786 in reversal of earn-out compensation related to Dejana in the year ended December 31, 2017. Reflects $900 in reversal of earn-out compensation related to Dejana in the year ended December 31, 2018. Reflects $217 in reversal of earn-out compensation related to Henderson, and $200 in reversal of earn-out compensation related to Dejana in the year ended December 31, 2019. \n (2) Reflects expenses and accrual reversals for one time, unrelated legal, severance and consulting fees and loss on disposal of fixed assets related to facility relocation for the periods presented. \nThe following table presents Adjusted EBITDA by segment for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018.\n Adjusted EBITDA at our Work Truck Attachment segment were $80.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to $80.4 million in the year ended December 31, 2018, an increase of $0.3 million primarily due to increases in volume and price, somewhat offset by planned unfavorable pricing reductions on sales to the Work Truck Solutions segment in the year ended December 31, 2019.\nAdjusted EBITDA at our Work Truck Solutions segment were $27.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to $16.0 million in the year ended December 31, 2018, an increase of $11.4 million due to higher volumes from improved chassis predictability, operational efficiencies, and lower spending, as well as planned favorable pricing reductions on purchases from Work Truck Attachments in the year ended December 31, 2019.\nAdjusted Net Income and Adjusted Earnings Per Share (calculated on a diluted basis) represents net income and earnings per share (as defined by GAAP), excluding the impact of stock based compensation, pension termination costs, severance, litigation proceeds, non-cash purchase accounting adjustments, tax reform and certain charges related to certain unrelated legal fees and consulting fees, net of their income tax impact. Management believes that Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted Earnings Per Share are useful in assessing our financial performance by eliminating expenses and income that are not reflective of the underlying business performance. We believe that the presentation of adjusted net income for the periods presented allows investors to make meaningful comparisons of our operating performance between periods and to view our business from the same perspective as our management. Because the excluded items are not predictable or consistent, management does not consider them when evaluating our performance or when making decisions regarding allocation of resources.\n\n (1) Reflects $335 in earn out compensation expense related to TrynEx in the year ended December 31, 2015. Reflects $322 and $1,956 in earn out compensation expense related to Henderson and inventory step up related to Henderson included in cost of sales in the year ended December 31, 2015. Reflects ($1,301) and $173 in earn out compensation expense (benefit) related to TrynEx and Dejana, respectively in the year ended December 31, 2016. Reflects $125 in inventory step up related to Dejana included in cost of sales in the year ended December 31, 2016. Reflects $1,786 in reversal of earn-out compensation related to Dejana in the year ended December 31, 2017. Reflects $900 in reversal of earn-out compensation related to Dejana in the year ended December 31, \n 2018. Reflects $217 in reversal of earn-out compensation related to Henderson, and $200 in reversal of earn-out compensation related to Dejana in the year ended December 31, 2019. \n (2) Reflects expenses and accrual reversals for one time, unrelated legal and consulting fees and loss on disposal of fixed assets related to facility relocation for the periods presented. \n (3) Reflects one-time benefit associated with U.S. tax reform. \nFuture Obligations and Commitments\nContractual Obligations\nWe are subject to certain contractual obligations, including long-term debt and related interest. We have net unrecognized tax benefits of $1.6 million as of December 31, 2019. However, we cannot make a reasonably reliable estimate of the period of potential cash settlement of the underlying liabilities; therefore, we have not included unrecognized tax benefits in calculating the obligations set forth in the following table of significant contractual obligations as of December 31, 2019.\n\n (1) Long-term debt obligation is presented net of discount of $0.8 million at December 31, 2019. \n (2) Relates to nine operating leases at Dejana upfitting and manufacturing facilities with related party affiliates. \n (3) Relates to real estate and equipment operating leases with third parties, including five operating leases for Henderson installation and distribution locations and two operating leases for Dejana locations. \n (4) Assumes all debt will remain outstanding until maturity. Interest payments were calculated using interest rates in effect as of December 31, 2019. \nSenior Credit Facilities\nSee Note 9 for a description of our senior credit facilities and other debt.\nDeductibility of Intangible and Goodwill Expense\nWe possess a favorable tax structure where annual tax-deductible intangible and goodwill amortization expense may be utilized in the event we have sufficient taxable income to utilize such benefit. As we have previously acquired businesses possessing significant intangible assets and goodwill, we have created a favorable tax structure where income tax expense is greater than book amortization expense. We expect the deductibility of intangible assets and goodwill amortization expense to exceed book by approximately $4.1 million in the year ended December 31, 2020 if we have the taxable income to utilize such benefit.\nImpact of Inflation\nWe do not believe that inflation risk is material to our business or our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows at this time. Historically, we have experienced normal raw material, labor and fringe benefit inflation. To date we have been able to fully offset this inflation by providing higher value products, which command higher prices. In previous years, including in 2018 and 2019 as a result of inflationary pressures due to tariffs, we have experienced significant increases in steel costs, but have been able to mitigate the effects of these increases through both temporary and permanent steel surcharges. See Risk Factors- The price of steel, a commodity necessary to manufacture our products, is highly variable. If the price of steel increases, our gross margins could decline\u201d.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe are not party to any off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a material current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues, expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources.\nSeasonality and Year-To-Year Variability\nWhile our Work Truck Solutions segment has limited seasonality and variability, our Work Truck Attachments segment is seasonal and also varies from year-to-year. Consequently, our Work Truck Attachments segment results of operations and financial condition vary from quarter-to-quarter and from year-to-year as well. In addition, because of this seasonality and variability, our Work Truck Attachments segment results of operations for any quarter may not be indicative of results of operations that may be achieved for a subsequent quarter or the full year, and may not be similar to results of operations experienced in prior years.\nSales of our Work Truck Attachments segment products are significantly impacted by the level, timing and location of snowfall, with sales in any given year and region most heavily influenced by snowfall levels in the prior snow season (which we consider to begin in October and end in March) in that region. This is due to the fact that end-user demand for our Work Truck Attachments products is driven primarily by the condition of their snow and ice control equipment, and in the case of professional snowplowers, by their financial ability to purchase new or replacement snow and ice control equipment, both of which are significantly affected by snowfall levels. Heavy snowfall during a given winter causes usage of our Work Truck Attachments products to increase, resulting in greater wear and tear to our products and a shortening of their life cycles, thereby creating a need for replacement snow and ice control equipment and related parts and accessories. In addition, when there is a heavy snowfall in a given winter, the increased income our professional snowplowers generate from their professional snowplow activities provides them with increased purchasing power to purchase replacement snow and ice control equipment prior to the following winter. To a lesser extent, sales of our Work Truck Attachments products are influenced by the timing of snowfall in a given winter. Because an early snowfall can be viewed as a sign of a heavy upcoming snow season, our Work Truck Attachments segment's end-users may respond to an early snowfall by purchasing replacement snow and ice control equipment during the current season rather than delaying purchases until after the season is over when most purchases are typically made by end-users.\nWe attempt to manage the seasonal impact of snowfall on our Work Truck Attachments segment revenues in part through our pre-season sales program, which involves actively soliciting and encouraging pre-season distributor orders in the second and third quarters by offering our distributors a combination of pricing, payment and freight incentives during this period. These pre-season sales incentives encourage our distributors to re-stock their inventory during the second and third quarters in anticipation of the peak fourth quarter retail sales period by offering favorable pre-season pricing and payment deferral until the fourth quarter. As a result, we tend to generate our greatest volume of sales (an average of over two-thirds over the last ten years) during the second and third quarters, providing us with manufacturing visibility for the remainder of the year. By contrast, our revenue and operating results tend to be lowest during the first quarter as management believes our end-users prefer to wait until the beginning of a snow season to purchase new equipment and as our distributors sell off inventory and wait for our pre-season sales incentive period to re-stock inventory. Fourth quarter sales vary from year-to-year as they are primarily driven by the level, timing and location of snowfall during the quarter. This is because most of our fourth\nquarter sales and shipments consist of re-orders by distributors seeking to restock inventory to meet immediate customer needs caused by snowfall during the winter months.\nOur Work Truck Attachments segment revenue and operating results tend to be lowest during the first quarter, during which period we typically experience negative earnings as the snow season draws to a close. Our Work Truck Attachments segment first quarter revenue has varied from approximately $18.0 million to approximately $33.9 million between 2015 and 2019. During the last five-year period, net income (loss) during the first quarter has varied from a net income of approximately $3.9 million to a net loss of approximately $0.9 million, with an average net income of $1.3 million.\nWhile our Work Truck Attachments monthly working capital has averaged approximately $73.1 million from 2017 to 2019, because of the seasonality of our sales, we experience seasonality in our working capital needs as well. In the first quarter we require capital as we are generally required to build our inventory in anticipation of our second and third quarter sales seasons. During the second and third quarters, our working capital requirements rise as our accounts receivables increase as a result of the sale and shipment of products ordered through our pre-season sales program and we continue to build inventory. Working capital requirements peak towards the end of the third quarter (reaching an average peak of approximately $97.1 million over the prior three years) and then begin to decline through the fourth quarter through a reduction in accounts receivables (as it is in the fourth quarter that we receive a majority of the payments for previously shipped products).\nWe also attempt to manage the impact of seasonality and year-to-year variability on our business costs through the effective management of our assets. See Business-Our Business Strategy-Aggressive Asset Management and Profit Focus.\u201d Our asset management and profit focus strategies include:\n \u25cf the employment of a highly variable cost structure facilitated by a core group of workers that we supplement with a temporary workforce as sales volumes dictate, which allows us to adjust costs on an as-needed basis in response to changing demand; \n \u25cf our enterprise-wide lean concept, which allows us to adjust production levels up or down to meet demand; \n \u25cf the pre-season order program described above, which incentivizes distributors to place orders prior to the retail selling season; and \n \u25cf a vertically integrated business model. \nThese asset management and profit focus strategies, among other management tools, allow us to adjust fixed overhead and selling, general and administrative expenditures to account for the year-to-year variability of our sales volumes. Management currently estimates that consolidated annual fixed overhead expenses generally range from approximately $50.0 million in low sales volume years to approximately $70.0 million in high sales volume years. Further, management currently estimates that consolidated annual sales, general and administrative expenses other than amortization generally approximate $75.0 million, but can be reduced to approximately $65.0 million to maximize cash flow in low sales volume years, and can increase to approximately $85.0 million to maintain customer service and responsiveness in high sales volume years.\nAdditionally, although modest, our annual capital expenditure requirements, which are normally budgeted around 2-3% of net sales, can be temporarily reduced by up to approximately 40% in response to actual or anticipated decreases in sales volumes.

main business segments: Work Truck Attachments and Work Truck Solutions. Work Truck Attachments is seasonal and heavily impacted by snowfall levels each year. \n\n- Net sales increased 9.1% in 2019 compared to 2018, driven by higher volumes and improved chassis predictability. Net sales increased 10.4% in 2018 compared to 2017 due to snowfall levels near historical averages and higher pricing.\n\n- Gross margins decreased slightly in 2019 vs 2018 due to higher healthcare and labor costs. Gross margins decreased in 2018 vs 2017 due to growth in lower margin product lines and inflation. \n\n- Net income increased in 2019 compared to 2018 due to higher sales volumes but decreased in 2018 compared to 2017 primarily due to higher operating expenses.\n\n- The company manages seasonality and variability through pre-season sales programs, a variable cost structure, lean production, and vertical integration. This allows overhead costs and SG&A to fluctuate with sales volumes.\n\n- The company has significant intangible assets and goodwill from acquisitions. This provides a tax benefit as amortization expenses are tax deductible. \n\n- The company has long-term debt obligations of $245.8 million and operating lease commitments of $26.9 million. Interest expense was $16.8 million in 2019.\n\nIn summary, the company is managing seasonality and growth reasonably well but faces some margin pressures from inflation and product mix shifts. The MD&A provides good insight into the company's operating segments, cost structure, and financial obligations."}
