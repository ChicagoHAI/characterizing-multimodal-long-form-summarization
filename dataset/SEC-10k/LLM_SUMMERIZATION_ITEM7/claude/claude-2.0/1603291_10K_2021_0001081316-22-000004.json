meaningful.\nEarnings on common shares decreased $1,248 million for 2021 compared to 2020. Included in these results was a pre-tax unrealized gain in 2021 of $1,796 million ($1,777 million after-tax) compared to a pre-tax unrealized gain in 2020 of $4,774 million ($3,470 million after-tax) on the Company's investment in BYD Company Limited. Excluding the impact of this item, adjusted earnings on common shares in 2021 was $3,892 million, an increase of $445 million, or 13%, compared to adjusted earnings on common shares in 2020 of $3,447 million.\nThe decrease in net income attributable to BHE shareholders for 2021 compared to 2020 was primarily due to:\n\u2022The Utilities' earnings increased $242 million reflecting higher electric utility margin, favorable income tax expense, from higher PTCs recognized of $139 million and the impacts of ratemaking, and lower operations and maintenance expense, partially offset by higher depreciation and amortization expense. Electric retail customer volumes increased 3.8% for 2021 compared to 2020, primarily due to higher customer usage, an increase in the average number of customers and the favorable impact of weather;\n\u2022Northern Powergrid's earnings increased $46 million, primarily due to higher distribution performance, lower write-offs of gas exploration costs and $16 million from the weaker United States dollar, partially offset by the comparative unfavorable impact of deferred income tax charges ($109 million in second quarter 2021 and $35 million in third quarter 2020) related to enacted increases in the United Kingdom corporate income tax rate;\n\u2022BHE Pipeline Group's earnings increased $279 million, primarily due to $244 million of incremental earnings at BHE GT&S;\n\u2022BHE Renewables' earnings decreased $70 million, primarily due to lower tax equity investment earnings from the February 2021 polar vortex weather event, partially offset by earnings from tax equity investment projects reaching commercial operation and higher operating performance from owned renewable energy projects; and\n\u2022BHE and Other's earnings decreased $1,773 million, primarily due to the $1,693 million change in the after-tax unrealized position of the Company's investment in BYD Company Limited and $95 million of higher dividends on BHE's 4.00% Perpetual Preferred Stock issued in October 2020, partially offset by favorable comparative consolidated state income tax benefits.\nEarnings on common shares increased $3,967 million for 2020 compared to 2019. Included in these results was a pre-tax unrealized gain in 2020 of $4,774 million ($3,470 million after-tax) compared to a pre-tax unrealized loss in 2019 of $313 million ($227 million after-tax) on the Company's investment in BYD Company Limited. Excluding the impact of this item, adjusted earnings on common shares in 2020 was $3,447 million, an increase of $270 million, or 9%, compared to adjusted earnings on common shares in 2019 of $3,177 million.\nThe increase in earnings on common shares for 2020 compared to 2019 was primarily due to:\n\u2022The Utilities' earnings increased $50 million with favorable performance at all four utilities (electric retail customer volumes increased 0.1%), including $193 million of higher PTCs recognized, offset by a comparative increase in wildfire and other storm restoration costs, primarily at PacifiCorp;\n\u2022Northern Powergrid's earnings decreased $55 million, mainly due to a deferred income tax charge in 2020 from an enacted increase in the United Kingdom corporate income tax rate;\n\u2022BHE Pipeline Group's earnings increased $106 million, primarily due to $73 million of incremental earnings at BHE GT&S and a favorable rate case settlement at Northern Natural Gas;\n\u2022BHE Renewables' earnings increased $90 million, primarily due to increased income tax benefits from renewable wind tax equity investments, largely from projects reaching commercial operation, offset by lower earnings from geothermal and natural gas facilities;\n\u2022HomeServices' earnings increased $215 million, primarily due to higher earnings from mortgage services (71% increase in funded mortgage volume) and brokerage services (13% increase in closed transaction volume) largely attributable to the favorable interest rate environment; and\n\u2022BHE and Other's earnings increased $3,559 million, primarily due to the $3,697 million change in the after-tax unrealized position of the Company's investment in BYD Company Limited offset by higher BHE corporate interest expense and unfavorable comparative consolidated state income tax benefits.\nReportable Segment Results\nPacifiCorp\nOperating revenue decreased $45 million for 2021 compared to 2020, primarily due to lower retail revenue of $98 million, partially offset by higher wholesale and other revenue of $53 million. Retail revenue decreased mainly due to $234 million from the Utah and Oregon general rate case orders issued in 2020 (fully offset in expense, primarily depreciation) and price impacts of $41 million from lower rates primarily due to certain general rate case orders, partially offset by higher customer volumes of $177 million. Retail customer volumes increased 3.1%, primarily due to higher customer usage, an increase in the average number of customers and the favorable impact of weather. Wholesale and other revenue increased mainly due to higher wheeling revenue, average wholesale prices and REC sales, partially offset by $34 million from the Oregon RAC settlement (fully offset in depreciation expense) recognized in 2020.\nEarnings increased $148 million for 2021 compared to 2020, primarily due to favorable income tax expense from higher PTCs recognized of $75 million from new wind-powered generating facilities placed in-service, and the impacts of ratemaking, lower operations and maintenance expense of $178 million and higher utility margin of $145 million, partially offset by higher depreciation and amortization expense of $255 million and lower allowances for equity and borrowed funds used during construction of $72 million. Operations and maintenance expense decreased primarily due to lower costs associated with wildfires and the Klamath Hydroelectric Settlement Agreement and lower thermal plant maintenance expense, partially offset by higher costs associated with additional wind-powered generating facilities placed in-service as well as higher distribution maintenance costs. Utility margin increased primarily due to the higher retail customer volumes, higher wheeling and wholesale revenue and higher deferred net power costs in accordance with established adjustment mechanisms, partially offset by higher purchased power and thermal generation costs, the price impacts from lower retail rates and higher wheeling expenses. The increase in depreciation and amortization expense was primarily due to the impacts of a depreciation study effective January 1, 2021, as well as additional assets placed in-service.\nOperating revenue increased $273 million for 2020 compared to 2019, primarily due to higher retail revenue of $250 million and higher wholesale and other revenue of $23 million. Retail revenue increased primarily due to $234 million from the amortization of certain existing regulatory balances to offset the accelerated depreciation of certain property, plant and equipment and the accelerated amortization of certain regulatory asset balances in relation to Utah and Oregon general rate case orders issued in December 2020. The increase in retail revenue was also due to price impacts of $49 million from changes in sales mix, partially offset by lower customer volumes of $34 million. The increase in wholesale and other revenue was mainly due to $34 million from the amortization of certain existing regulatory balances in Oregon to offset the accelerated depreciation of certain retired wind equipment, partially offset by lower wholesale volumes. Retail customer volumes decreased 1.4% primarily due to the impacts of COVID-19, which resulted in lower industrial and commercial customer usage and higher residential customer usage, partially offset by an increase in the average number of residential and commercial customers and the favorable impact of weather.\nEarnings decreased $32 million for 2020 compared to 2019, primarily due to an increase in operations and maintenance expense due to higher costs associated with wildfires and the Klamath Hydroelectric Settlement Agreement of $169 million, higher interest expense of $25 million from higher long-term debt balances, higher pension and other postretirement costs of $13 million, lower interest income from lower average interest rates and higher property taxes of $10 million, partially offset by lower tax expense from higher PTCs recognized of $62 million from repowered and new wind-powered generating facilities, higher utility margin of $47 million and higher allowances for equity and borrowed funds used during construction of $38 million. Utility margin increased primarily due to lower coal-fueled and natural gas-fueled generation costs, lower purchased power costs and price impacts from changes in sales mix, partially offset by lower net deferrals of incurred net power costs in accordance with established adjustment mechanisms and lower retail customer volumes.\nMidAmerican Funding\nOperating revenue increased $819 million for 2021 compared to 2020, primarily due to higher natural gas operating revenue of $430 million and higher electric operating revenue of $390 million. Natural gas operating revenue increased due to a higher average per-unit cost of natural gas sold resulting in higher purchased gas adjustment recoveries of $440 million (fully offset in cost of sales), largely due to the February 2021 polar vortex weather event. Electric operating revenue increased due to higher retail revenue of $198 million and higher wholesale and other revenue of $192 million. Electric retail revenue increased primarily due to higher recoveries through adjustment clauses of $116 million (fully offset in expense, primarily cost of sales), higher customer volumes of $63 million and price impacts of $19 million from changes in sales mix. Electric retail customer volumes increased 5.8% due to increased usage of certain industrial customers and the favorable impact of weather. Electric wholesale and other revenue increased primarily due to higher average wholesale prices of $116 million and higher wholesale volumes of $71 million.\nEarnings increased $65 million for 2021 compared to 2020, primarily due to higher electric utility margin of $190 million and a favorable income tax benefit, partially offset by higher depreciation and amortization expense of $198 million, higher operations and maintenance expense of $20 million and lower allowances for equity and borrowed funds of $8 million. Electric utility margin increased primarily due to the higher retail and wholesale revenues, partially offset by higher thermal generation and purchased power costs. The favorable income tax benefit was largely due to higher PTCs recognized of $64 million, from new wind-powered generating facilities placed in-service, partially offset by state income tax impacts. The increase in depreciation and amortization expense was primarily due to the impacts of certain regulatory mechanisms and additional assets placed in-service. Operations and maintenance expense increased primarily due to higher costs associated with additional wind-powered generating facilities placed in-service and higher natural gas distribution costs, partially offset by 2020 costs associated with storm restoration activities.\nOperating revenue decreased $199 million for 2020 compared to 2019, primarily due to lower natural gas operating revenue of $77 million, lower electric operating revenue of $70 million, lower electric and natural gas energy efficiency program revenue of $38 million (fully offset in operations and maintenance expense) and lower other revenue of $14 million, primarily from nonregulated utility construction services. Natural gas operating revenue decreased primarily due to lower volumes and a lower average per-unit cost of natural gas sold resulting in lower purchased gas adjustment recoveries of $68 million (fully offset in cost of sales) and a 10.2% decrease in retail customer volumes, primarily due to the unfavorable impact of weather. Electric operating revenue decreased due to lower wholesale and other revenue of $88 million, partially offset by higher retail revenue of $18 million. Electric wholesale and other revenue decreased mainly due to lower average wholesale prices of $115 million, partially offset by higher wholesale volumes of $28 million. Electric retail revenue increased primarily due to higher customer usage of $38 million, partially offset by price impacts of $18 million from changes in sales mix. Electric retail customer volumes increased 1.2% due to increased usage for certain industrial customers, partially offset by the impacts of COVID-19, which resulted in lower commercial and industrial customer usage and higher residential customer usage.\nEarnings increased $37 million for 2020 compared to 2019, primarily due to higher income tax benefit of $197 million from higher PTCs recognized of $132 million and the favorable impacts of ratemaking, partially offset by higher depreciation and amortization expense of $77 million due to additional assets placed in-service (offset by $23 million of lower Iowa revenue sharing accruals), lower allowances for equity and borrowed funds used during construction of $45 million, higher interest expense of $20 million and lower electric and natural gas utility margins. PTCs recognized increased due to higher wind-powered generation driven primarily by repowering and new wind projects placed in-service. Electric utility margin decreased due to lower wholesale revenue and the price impacts from changes in sales mix, partially offset by lower generation costs from higher wind generation and higher retail customer volumes. Natural gas utility margin decreased primarily due to lower retail customer volumes primarily due to the unfavorable impact of weather.\nNV Energy\nOperating revenue increased $253 million for 2021 compared to 2020, primarily due to higher electric operating revenue of $252 million. Electric operating revenue increased primarily due to higher fully-bundled energy rates (fully offset in cost of sales) of $229 million, a $120 million one-time bill credit in the fourth quarter of 2020 resulting from a regulatory rate review decision (fully offset in operations and maintenance and income tax expenses) and higher retail customer volumes of $10 million, partially offset by lower base tariff general rates of $71 million at Nevada Power and a favorable regulatory decision in 2020. Electric retail customer volumes increased 3.3%, primarily due to an increase in the average number of customers, higher customer usage and the favorable impact of weather.\nEarnings increased $29 million for 2021 compared to 2020, primarily due to lower operations and maintenance expense of $90 million, lower income tax expense mainly from the impacts of ratemaking, lower interest expense of $21 million, higher interest and dividend income of $16 million and lower pension expense of $10 million, partially offset by lower electric utility margin of $97 million and higher depreciation and amortization expense of $47 million. Operations and maintenance expense decreased primarily due to lower regulatory deferrals and amortizations and lower earnings sharing at the Nevada Utilities. Electric utility margin decreased primarily due to lower base tariff general rates at Nevada Power and a favorable regulatory decision in 2020, partially offset by higher retail customer volumes. The increase in depreciation and amortization expense was mainly due to the regulatory amortization of decommissioning costs and additional assets placed in-service.\nOperating revenue decreased $183 million for 2020 compared to 2019, primarily due to lower electric operating revenue. Electric operating revenue decreased primarily due to lower fully-bundled energy rates (fully offset in cost of sales) of $164 million and a $120 million one-time bill credit in the fourth quarter of 2020 resulting from a regulatory rate review decision (fully offset in operations and maintenance and income tax expenses), partially offset by higher retail customer volumes, price impacts from changes in sales mix and a favorable regulatory decision. Electric retail customer volumes, including distribution only service customers, increased 1.5%, primarily due to the favorable impact of weather, largely offset by the impacts of COVID-19, which resulted in lower industrial, distribution only service and commercial customer usage and higher residential customer usage.\nEarnings increased $45 million for 2020 compared to 2019, primarily due to higher electric utility margin of $100 million, lower pension and post-retirement costs of $9 million and lower income tax expense mainly from the favorable impacts of ratemaking, partially offset by an increase in operations and maintenance expense, mainly from higher earnings sharing accruals at the Nevada Utilities, and higher depreciation and amortization expense of $20 million, mainly from higher plant placed in-service. Electric utility margin increased primarily due to higher retail customer volumes, price impacts from changes in sales mix and a favorable regulatory decision.\nNorthern Powergrid\nOperating revenue increased $166 million for 2021 compared to 2020, primarily due to higher distribution revenue of $80 million, mainly from increased tariff rates of $40 million and a 3.2% increase in units distributed totaling $26 million, and $77 million from the weaker United States dollar.\nEarnings increased $46 million for 2021 compared to 2020, primarily due to the higher distribution revenue, lower write-offs of gas exploration costs of $36 million, $16 million from the weaker United States dollar, favorable pension expense of $14 million and lower interest expense of $8 million, partially offset by higher income tax expense and higher distribution-related operating and depreciation expenses of $29 million. Earnings in 2021 included a deferred income tax charge of $109 million related to a June 2021 enacted increase in the United Kingdom corporate income tax rate from 19% to 25% effective April 1, 2023, while earnings in 2020 included a deferred income tax charge of $35 million related to a July 2020 enacted increase in the United Kingdom corporate income tax rate from 17% to 19% effective April 1, 2020.\nOperating revenue increased $9 million for 2020 compared to 2019, primarily due to higher distribution revenue of $10 million from increased tariff rates of $40 million, partially offset by a 5.4% decrease in units distributed totaling $30 million largely due to the impacts of COVID-19.\nEarnings decreased $55 million for 2020 compared to 2019, primarily due to write-offs of gas exploration costs of $44 million, higher income tax expense of $37 million and higher distribution-related operating and depreciation expenses of $18 million, partially offset by higher distribution revenue, lower pension expense of $22 million, including lower pension settlement losses recognized in 2020 compared to 2019, and lower interest expense of $9 million. The increase in income tax expense is due to a change in the United Kingdom corporate income tax rate that resulted in a deferred income tax charge of $35 million.\nBHE Pipeline Group\nOperating revenue increased $1,966 million for 2021 compared to 2020, primarily due to $1,828 million of incremental revenue at BHE GT&S, acquired in November 2020, higher gas sales of $115 million ($38 million largely offset in costs of sales) at Northern Natural Gas and higher transportation revenue of $29 million at Kern River largely due to higher rates and volumes, partially offset by lower transportation revenue of $24 million at Northern Natural Gas primarily due to lower volumes. The variances in gas sales and transportation revenue at Northern Natural Gas included favorable impacts of $77 million and $49 million, respectively, from the February 2021 polar vortex weather event.\nEarnings increased $279 million for 2021 compared to 2020, primarily due to $244 million of incremental earnings at BHE GT&S, favorable earnings of $19 million at Kern River from the higher transportation revenue and higher earnings of $15 million at Northern Natural Gas, primarily due to higher gross margin on gas sales and higher transportation revenue, each due to the favorable impacts of the February 2021 polar vortex weather event, offset by the lower transportation revenue.\nOperating revenue increased $447 million for 2020 compared to 2019, primarily due to $331 million of incremental revenue at BHE GT&S, a favorable rate case settlement at Northern Natural Gas of $101 million and higher transportation revenue of $43 million, partially offset by lower gas sales at Northern Natural Gas of $23 million related to system balancing activities (largely offset in cost of sales).\nEarnings increased $106 million for 2020 compared to 2019, primarily due to $73 million of incremental earnings BHE GT&S, the higher transportation revenue, and a favorable after-tax, rate case settlement at Northern Natural Gas of $32 million, partially offset by higher property and other tax expense of $17 million, including a non-recurring property tax refund in 2019, higher depreciation and amortization expense of $13 million due to increased spending on capital projects and lower interest income of $9 million.\nBHE Transmission\nOperating revenue increased $72 million for 2021 compared to 2020, primarily due to $47 million from the stronger United States dollar, a regulatory decision received in November 2020 at AltaLink and higher revenue from the Montana-Alberta Tie Line of $11 million.\nEarnings increased $16 million for 2021 compared to 2020, primarily due to $12 million from the stronger United States dollar, higher earnings from the Montana-Alberta Tie Line and lower non-regulated interest expense at BHE Canada, partially offset by the impact of a regulatory decision received in April 2020 at AltaLink.\nOperating revenue decreased $48 million for 2020 compared to 2019, primarily due to a regulatory decision received in November 2020 at AltaLink and the stronger United States dollar of $7 million.\nEarnings increased $2 million for 2020 compared to 2019, primarily due to lower non-regulated interest expense at BHE Canada and higher net income at BHE U.S. Transmission of $6 million mainly due to improved equity earnings from ETT, partially offset by the impacts of regulatory decisions received in 2020 and 2019 at AltaLink.\nBHE Renewables\nOperating revenue increased $45 million for 2021 compared to 2020, primarily due to higher natural gas, solar, wind and hydro revenues from favorable market conditions and higher generation, partially offset by an unfavorable change in the valuation of a power purchase agreement of $30 million.\nEarnings decreased $70 million for 2021 compared to 2020, primarily due to lower wind earnings of $83 million, largely from lower tax equity investment earnings of $90 million, and lower hydro earnings of $10 million, mainly due to lower income from a declining financial asset balance, partially offset by higher solar earnings of $22 million, mainly due to the higher operating revenue and lower depreciation expense. Tax equity investment earnings decreased due to unfavorable results from existing tax equity investments of $165 million, primarily due to the February 2021 polar vortex weather event, and lower commitment fee income, partially offset by $87 million of earnings from projects reaching commercial operation.\nOperating revenue increased $4 million for 2020 compared to 2019, primarily due to higher natural gas, solar and hydro revenues of $21 million due to favorable generation, partially offset by an unfavorable change in the valuation of a power purchase agreement of $14 million and lower geothermal revenues of $4 million from lower pricing.\nEarnings increased $90 million for 2020 compared to 2019, primarily due to favorable wind tax equity investment earnings of $129 million, partially offset by lower geothermal earnings of $22 million, due to higher operations and maintenance expense and lower pricing, and lower natural gas earnings of $17 million, due to lower margins. Wind tax equity investment earnings improved due to $147 million of earnings from projects reaching commercial operation, partially offset by lower commitment fee income and lower earnings from existing tax equity investments of $6 million.\nHomeServices\nOperating revenue increased $819 million for 2021 compared to 2020, primarily due to higher brokerage revenue of $951 million, partially offset by lower mortgage revenue of $169 million from an 8% decrease in funded volume due to a decrease in refinance activity. The increase in brokerage revenue was due to a 21% increase in closed transaction volume at existing companies resulting from increases in average sales price and closed units.\nEarnings increased $12 million for 2021 compared to 2020, primarily due to higher earnings from brokerage and franchise services of $81 million, largely attributable to the increase in closed transaction volume at existing companies, partially offset by lower earnings from mortgage services of $68 million from the decrease in refinance activity.\nOperating revenue increased $923 million for 2020 compared to 2019, primarily due to higher brokerage revenue of $440 million from a 13% increase in closed transaction volume and higher mortgage revenue of $423 million from a 71% increase in funded mortgage volume due to an increase in refinance activity.\nEarnings increased $215 million for 2020 compared to 2019, primarily due to higher earnings at mortgage services of $138 million and higher earnings at brokerage services largely attributable to the favorable interest rate environment.\nBHE and Other\nOperating revenue increased $103 million for 2021 compared to 2020, primarily due to higher electricity and natural gas sales revenue at MES, from favorable pricing offset by lower volumes.\nEarnings decreased $1,773 million for 2021 compared to 2020, primarily due to the $1,693 million change in the after-tax unrealized position of the Company's investment in BYD Company Limited, $95 million of higher dividends on BHE's 4.00% Perpetual Preferred Stock issued in October 2020, higher corporate costs and higher BHE corporate interest expense from debt issuances in March and October 2020, partially offset by favorable comparative consolidated state income tax benefits and higher earnings of $17 million at MES.\nOperating revenue decreased $118 million for 2020 compared to 2019, primarily due to lower electricity and natural gas sales revenue at MES, from lower volumes.\nEarnings increased $3,559 million for 2020 compared to 2019, primarily due to the $3,697 million change in the after-tax unrealized position of the Company's investment in BYD Company Limited, partially offset by higher BHE corporate interest expense from debt issuances in March and October 2020 and unfavorable comparative consolidated state income tax benefits.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nEach of BHE's direct and indirect subsidiaries is organized as a legal entity separate and apart from BHE and its other subsidiaries. It should not be assumed that the assets of any subsidiary will be available to satisfy BHE's obligations or the obligations of its other subsidiaries. However, unrestricted cash or other assets that are available for distribution may, subject to applicable law, regulatory commitments and the terms of financing and ring-fencing arrangements for such parties, be advanced, loaned, paid as dividends or otherwise distributed or contributed to BHE or affiliates thereof. The Company's long-term debt may include provisions that allow BHE or its subsidiaries to redeem such debt in whole or in part at any time. These provisions generally include make-whole premiums.

the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Form 10-K for further discussion regarding the Company's credit facilities, letters of credit, equity commitments and other related items.\nOperating Activities\nNet cash flows from operating activities for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 were $8.7 billion and $6.2 billion, respectively. The increase was primarily due to $970 million of incremental net cash flows from operating activities at BHE GT&S, improved operating results and changes in working capital.\nNet cash flows from operating activities for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 were $6,224 million and $6,206 million, respectively. The increase was primarily due to an increase in income tax receipts and improved operating results, partially offset by changes in working capital.\nThe timing of the Company's income tax cash flows from period to period can be significantly affected by the estimated federal income tax payment methods selected and assumptions made for each payment date.\nInvesting Activities\nNet cash flows from investing activities for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 were $(5.8) billion and $(13.2) billion, respectively. The change was primarily due to lower funding of tax equity investments, lower cash paid for acquisitions and the July 2021 receipt of $1.3 billion due to the termination of the Q-Pipe Purchase Agreement. Refer to \"Future Uses of Cash\" for further discussion of capital expenditures.\nNet cash flows from investing activities for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 were $(13.2) billion and $(9.0) billion, respectively. The change was primarily due to higher cash paid for acquisitions and higher funding of tax equity investments, partially offset by lower capital expenditures of $599 million. Refer to \"Future Uses of Cash\" for further discussion of capital expenditures.\nNatural Gas Transmission and Storage Business Acquisition\nOn November 1, 2020, BHE completed its acquisition of substantially all of the natural gas transmission and storage business of DEI and Dominion Questar, exclusive of the Questar Pipeline Group (the \"GT&S Transaction\"). Under the terms of the Purchase and Sale Agreement, dated July 3, 2020 (the \"GT&S Purchase Agreement\"), BHE paid approximately $2.5 billion in cash, after post-closing adjustments (the \"GT&S Cash Consideration\"), and assumed approximately $5.6 billion of existing indebtedness for borrowed money, including fair value adjustments.\nOn October 5, 2020, DEI and Dominion Questar, as permitted under the terms of the GT&S Purchase Agreement, delivered notice to BHE of their election to terminate the GT&S Transaction with respect to the Questar Pipeline Group and, in connection with the execution of the Q-Pipe Purchase Agreement referenced below, to waive the related termination fee under the GT&S Purchase Agreement. Also on October 5, 2020, BHE entered into a second Purchase and Sale Agreement (the \"Q-Pipe Purchase Agreement\") with Dominion Questar providing for BHE's purchase of the Questar Pipeline Group from Dominion Questar (the \"Q-Pipe Transaction\") after receipt of HSR Approval for a cash purchase price of approximately $1.3 billion (the \"Q-Pipe Cash Consideration\"), subject to adjustment for cash and indebtedness as of the closing, and the assumption of approximately $430 million of existing indebtedness for borrowed money. Under the Q-Pipe Purchase Agreement, BHE delivered the Q-Pipe Cash Consideration of approximately $1.3 billion to Dominion Questar on November 2, 2020.\nOn July 9, 2021, Dominion Questar and DEI delivered a written notice to BHE stating that BHE and Dominion Questar have mutually elected to terminate the Q-Pipe Purchase Agreement.

Sources of cash totaled $11.7 billion and consisted of proceeds from BHE senior debt issuances of $5.2 billion, proceeds from preferred stock issuances of $3.8 billion and proceeds from subsidiary debt issuances totaling $2.7 billion. Uses of cash totaled $4.5 billion and consisted mainly of $2.8 billion for repayments of subsidiary debt, net repayments of short-term debt of $939 million and $350 million for repayments of BHE senior debt.\nNet cash flows from financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2019 were $3.1 billion. Sources of cash totaled $5.4 billion and consisted of proceeds from subsidiary debt issuances totaling $4.7 billion and net proceeds from short-term debt of $684 million. Uses of cash totaled $2.3 billion and consisted mainly of $1.9 billion for repayments of subsidiary debt and repurchases of common stock of $293 million.\nDebt Repurchases\nThe Company may from time to time seek to acquire its outstanding debt securities through cash purchases in the open market, privately negotiated transactions or otherwise. Any debt securities repurchased by the Company may be reissued or resold by the Company from time to time and will depend on prevailing market conditions, the Company's liquidity requirements, contractual restrictions and other factors. The amounts involved may be material.\nPreferred Stock Issuance\nOn October 29, 2020, BHE issued $3.75 billion of its 4.00% Perpetual Preferred Stock to certain subsidiaries of Berkshire Hathaway Inc. in order to fund the GT&S Cash Consideration and the Q-Pipe Cash Consideration.\nPreferred Stock Redemptions\nFor the year ended December 31, 2021, BHE redeemed at par 2,100,012 shares of its 4.00% Perpetual Preferred Stock from certain subsidiaries of Berkshire Hathaway Inc. for $2.1 billion.\nCommon Stock Transactions\nFor the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, BHE repurchased 180,358 shares of its common stock for $126 million and 447,712 shares of its common stock for $293 million, respectively.\nFuture Uses of Cash\nThe Company has available a variety of sources of liquidity and capital resources, both internal and external, including net cash flows from operating activities, public and private debt offerings, the issuance of commercial paper, the use of unsecured revolving credit facilities, the issuance of equity and other sources. These sources are expected to provide funds required for current operations, capital expenditures, acquisitions, investments, debt retirements and other capital requirements. The availability and terms under which BHE and each subsidiary has access to external financing depends on a variety of factors, including regulatory approvals, its credit ratings, investors' judgment of risk and conditions in the overall capital markets, including the condition of the utility industry and project finance markets, among other items.\nCapital Expenditures\nThe Company has significant future capital requirements. Capital expenditure needs are reviewed regularly by management and may change significantly as a result of these reviews, which may consider, among other factors, impacts to customers' rates; changes in environmental and other rules and regulations; outcomes of regulatory proceedings; changes in income tax laws; general business conditions; load projections; system reliability standards; the cost and efficiency of construction labor, equipment and materials; commodity prices; and the cost and availability of capital. Expenditures for certain assets may ultimately include acquisitions of existing assets.\nThe Company's historical and forecast capital expenditures, each of which exclude amounts for non-cash equity AFUDC and other non-cash items, by reportable segment for the years ended December 31 are as follows (in millions):\nTable 45: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>

following:\n\u2022Wind generation includes both growth and operating expenditures. Growth expenditures include spending for the following:\n\u25e6Construction and acquisition of wind-powered generating facilities at MidAmerican Energy totaling $540 million for 2021, $848 million for 2020 and $1,486 million for 2019. MidAmerican Energy placed in-service 294 MWs during 2021, 729 MWs during 2020, including the acquisition of an existing 80-MW wind farm and 1,019 MWs during 2019. All of these wind-powered generating facilities placed in-service in 2021, 2020 and 2019 qualify for 100% of PTCs available. PTCs from these projects are excluded from MidAmerican Energy's Iowa EAC until these generation assets are reflected in base rates. Planned spending for the construction of wind-powered generating facilities totals $190 million in 2022, $1,744 million in 2023 and $1,678 million in 2024.\n\u25e6Repowering of wind-powered generating facilities at MidAmerican Energy totaling $354 million for 2021, $37 million for 2020 and $369 million for 2019. Planned spending for repowering totals $509 million in 2022. MidAmerican Energy expects its repowered facilities to meet IRS guidelines for the re-establishment of PTCs for 10 years from the date the facilities are placed in-service. The rate at which PTCs are re-established for a facility depends upon the date construction begins. Of the 865 MWs of current repowering projects not in-service as of December 31, 2021, 564 MWs are currently expected to qualify for 80% of the PTCs available for 10 years following each facility's return to service and 301 MWs are expected to qualify for 60% of such credits.\n\u25e6Construction of wind-powered generating facilities at PacifiCorp totaling $107 million for 2021, $1,148 million for 2020 and $338 million for 2019. Construction includes 674 MWs of new wind-powered generating facilities that were placed in-service in 2020 and 516 MWs that were placed in-service in 2021. Planned spending for the construction of additional wind-powered generating facilities totals $131 million in 2022, $405 million in 2023 and $373 million in 2024. The energy production from the new wind-powered generating facilities placed in-service by the end of 2024 is expected to qualify for 60% of the federal PTCs available for 10 years once the equipment is placed in-service.\n\u25e6Repowering of existing wind-powered generating facilities at PacifiCorp totaling $9 million for 2021, $125 million for 2020 and $585 million for 2019. All existing wind-powered generating facilities at PacifiCorp have been repowered as of December 31, 2021.\n\u25e6The 2021 IRP also included PacifiCorp's planned acquisition and repowering of two wind-powered generating facilities. The repowered facilities are expected to be placed in-service in 2023 and 2024. PacifiCorp spent $11 million in 2021 and planned spending for acquiring and repowering generating facilities totals $60 million in 2022, $36 million in 2023 and $34 million in 2024.\n\u25e6Construction of wind-powered generating facilities at BHE Renewables totaling $155 million for 2021 and $15 million for 2019. In May 2021, BHE Renewables completed the asset acquisition of a 54-MW wind-powered generating facility located in Iowa. In December 2021, BHE Renewables completed asset acquisitions of 158-MW and 200-MW wind-powered generating facilities located in Texas. Planned spending for future wind generation totals $306 million in 2023 and $102 million in 2024.\n\u2022Electric distribution includes both growth and operating expenditures. Growth expenditures include spending for new customer connections and enhancements to existing customer connections. Operating expenditures include spending for ongoing distribution systems infrastructure needed at the Utilities and Northern Powergrid, wildfire mitigation, storm damage restoration and repairs and investments in routine expenditures for distribution needed to serve existing and expected demand.\n\u2022Electric transmission includes both growth and operating expenditures. Growth expenditures include spending for the following:\n\u25e6PacifiCorp's transmission investment in 2021 through 2024 primarily reflecting planned costs for the 416-mile, 500-kV high-voltage transmission line between the Aeolus substation near Medicine Bow in Wyoming and the Clover substation near Mona, Utah; the 59-mile, 230-kV high-voltage transmission line between the Windstar substation near Glenrock, Wyoming and the Aeolus substation; the 290-mile, 500-kV high-voltage transmission line from the Longhorn substation near Boardman, Oregon to the Hemingway substation near Boise, Idaho. PacifiCorp is advancing permitting and regulatory approvals related to the projects. Planned spending for these Energy Gateway Transmission segments to be placed in-service in 2024-2026 totals $565 million in 2022, $1,143 million in 2023 and $437 million in 2024.\n\u25e6Nevada Utilities' Greenlink Nevada transmission expansion program. In this project, the company has received approval from the PUCN to build a 350-mile, 525-kV transmission line, known as Greenlink West, connecting the Ft. Churchill substation to the Northwest substation to the Harry Allen substation; a 235-mile, 525-kV transmission line, known as Greenlink North, connecting the new Ft. Churchill substation to the Robinson Summit substation; a 46-mile, 345-kV transmission line from the new Ft. Churchill substation to the Mira Loma substations; and a 38-mile, 345-kV transmission line from the new Ft. Churchill substation to the Robinson Summit substations. Planned spending for the expansion programs estimated to be placed in-service in 2026-2028 totals $61 million in 2022, $148 million in 2023 and $498 million in 2024.\n\u25e6Operating expenditures include spending for system reinforcement, upgrades and replacements of facilities to maintain system reliability and investments in routine expenditures for transmission needed to serve existing and expected demand.\n\u2022Natural gas transmission and storage includes both growth and operating expenditures. Growth expenditures include, among other items, spending for the Northern Natural Gas Twin Cities Area Expansion and Spraberry Compression projects. Operating expenditures include, among other items, spending for asset modernization, pipeline integrity projects and natural gas transmission, storage and LNG terminalling infrastructure needs to serve existing and expected demand.\n\u2022Solar generation includes growth expenditures, including spending for the following:\n\u25e6Construction of solar-powered generating facilities at MidAmerican Energy totaling 141 MWs of small- and utility-scale solar generation, with total spend of $132 million in 2021 and planned spending of $93 million in 2022 and $58 million in 2023.\n\u25e6Construction of solar-powered generating facilities at the Nevada Utilities' includes expenditures for three solar photovoltaic facilities, including a 150-MW solar photovoltaic facility with an additional 100 MWs of co-located battery storage that will be developed in Clark County, Nevada, with commercial operation expected by the end of 2023; a 250 MW solar photovoltaic facility with an additional 200 MWs of co-located battery storage that will be developed in Humboldt County, Nevada, with commercial operation expected by the end of 2023; and a 350 MW solar photovoltaic facility with an additional 280 MWs of co-located battery storage that will be developed in Humboldt County, Nevada, with commercial operation expected by the end of 2024. The facilities located in Humboldt County will be jointly owned and operated by Nevada Power and Sierra Pacific. Planned spending totals $702 million in 2023 and $799 million in 2024.\n\u25e6Construction of solar-powered generating facilities at BHE Renewables' includes expenditures for a 48-MW solar photovoltaic facility with an additional 52 MWs of capacity of co-located battery storage in Kern County, California, with commercial operation expected by November 30, 2024. Planned spending totals $150 million in 2024.\n\u2022Other capital expenditures includes both growth and operating expenditures, including spending for routine expenditures for generation and other infrastructure needed to serve existing and expected demand, natural gas distribution, technology, and environmental spending relating to emissions control equipment and the management of CCR.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nThe Company has certain investments that are accounted for under the equity method in accordance with GAAP. Accordingly, an amount is recorded on the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheets as an equity investment and is increased or decreased for the Company's pro-rata share of earnings or losses, respectively, less any dividends from such investments. Certain equity investments are presented on the Consolidated Balance Sheets net of investment tax credits.\nAs of December 31, 2021, the Company's investments that are accounted for under the equity method had short- and long-term debt of $2.7 billion, unused revolving credit facilities of $200 million and letters of credit outstanding of $88 million. As of December 31, 2021, the Company's pro-rata share of such short- and long-term debt was $1.3 billion, unused revolving credit facilities was $100 million and outstanding letters of credit was $43 million. The entire amount of the Company's pro-rata share of the outstanding short- and long-term debt and unused revolving credit facilities is non-recourse to the Company. The entire amount of the Company's pro-rata share of the outstanding letters of credit is recourse to the Company. Although the Company is generally not required to support debt service obligations of its equity investees, default with respect to this non-recourse short- and long-term debt could result in a loss of invested equity.\nMaterial Cash Requirements\nThe Company has cash requirements that may affect its consolidated financial condition that arise primarily from long- and short-term debt (refer to Note 9, 10 and 11), operating and financing leases (refer to Note 6), firm commitments (refer to Note 16), letters of credit (refer to Note 9), construction and other development costs (refer to Liquidity and Capital Resources included within this Item 7), uncertain tax positions (refer to Note 12) and AROs (refer to Note 14). Refer, where applicable, to the respective referenced note in Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Form 10-K for additional information.\nThe Company has cash requirements relating to interest payments of $32.4 billion on long-term debt, including $2.1 billion due in 2022.\nAdditionally, the Company has invested in wind projects sponsored by third parties, commonly referred to as tax equity investments. Under the terms of these tax equity investments, the Company has entered into equity capital contribution agreements with the project sponsors that require contributions. The Company has made contributions of $- million, $2,736 million and $1,619 million in 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively, and has commitments as of December 31, 2021, subject to satisfaction of certain specified conditions, to provide equity contributions of $356 million in 2022 pursuant to these equity capital contribution agreements as the various projects achieve commercial operation. However, the Company expects to assign its rights and obligations under these equity capital contribution agreements, including any related funding commitments, to an entity affiliated through common ownership. Once a project achieves commercial operation, the Company enters into a partnership agreement with the project sponsor that directs and allocates the operating profits and tax benefits from the project.\nRegulatory Matters\nThe Company is subject to comprehensive regulation. Refer to the discussion contained in Item 1 of this Form 10-K for further information regarding the Company's general regulatory framework and current regulatory matters.\nQuad Cities Generating Station Operating Status\nConstellation Energy Corp. (\"Constellation Energy,\" previously Exelon Generation Company, LLC, which was a subsidiary of Exelon Corporation prior to February 1, 2022), the operator of Quad Cities Generating Station Units 1 and 2 (\"Quad Cities Station\") of which MidAmerican Energy has a 25% ownership interest, announced on June 2, 2016, its intention to shut down Quad Cities Station on June 1, 2018. In December 2016, Illinois passed legislation creating a zero emission standard, which went into effect June 1, 2017. The zero emission standard requires the Illinois Power Agency to purchase ZECs and recover the costs from certain ratepayers in Illinois, subject to certain limitations. The proceeds from the ZECs will provide Constellation Energy additional revenue through 2027 as an incentive for continued operation of Quad Cities Station. MidAmerican Energy will not receive additional revenue from the subsidy.\nThe PJM Interconnection, L.L.C. (\"PJM\") capacity market includes a Minimum Offer Price Rule (\"MOPR\"). If a generation resource is subjected to a MOPR, its offer price in the market is adjusted to effectively remove the revenues it receives through a state government-provided financial support program, resulting in a higher offer that may not clear the capacity market. Prior to December 19, 2019, the PJM MOPR applied only to certain new gas-fired resources. An expanded PJM MOPR to include existing resources would require exclusion of ZEC compensation when bidding into future capacity auctions, resulting in an increased risk of Quad Cities Station not receiving capacity revenues in future auctions.\nOn December 19, 2019, the FERC issued an order requiring the PJM to broadly apply the MOPR to all new and existing resources, including nuclear. This greatly expanded the breadth and scope of the PJM's MOPR, which became effective as of the PJM's capacity auction for the 2022-2023 planning year in May 2021. While the FERC included some limited exemptions, no exemptions were available to state-supported nuclear resources, such as Quad Cities Station. The FERC provided no new mechanism for accommodating state-supported resources other than the existing Fixed Resource Requirement (\"FRR\") mechanism under which an entire utility zone would be removed from PJM's capacity auction along with sufficient resources to support the load in such zone. In response to the FERC's order, the PJM submitted a compliance filing on March 18, 2020, wherein the PJM proposed tariff language reflecting the FERC's directives and a schedule for resuming capacity auctions. On April 16, 2020, the FERC issued an order largely denying requests for rehearing of the FERC's December 2019 order but granting a few clarifications that required an additional PJM compliance filing, which the PJM submitted on June 1, 2020. A number of parties, including Constellation Energy, have filed petitions for review of the FERC's orders in this proceeding, which remain pending before the D.C. Circuit.\nAs a result, the MOPR applied to Quad Cities Station in the capacity auction for the 2022-2023 planning year, which prevented Quad Cities Station from clearing in that capacity auction.\nAt the direction of the PJM Board of Managers, the PJM and its stakeholders developed further MOPR reforms to ensure that the capacity market rules respect and accommodate state resource preferences such as the ZEC programs. The PJM filed related tariff revisions at the FERC on July 30, 2021, and, on September 29, 2021, the PJM's proposed MOPR reforms became effective by operation of law. Under the new tariff provisions, the MOPR will no longer apply to Quad Cities Station. Requests for rehearing of the FERC's notice establishing the effective date for the PJM's proposed market reforms were filed in October 2021 and denied by operation of law on November 4, 2021. Several parties have filed petitions for review of the FERC's orders in this proceeding, which remain pending before the Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit. Constellation Energy is strenuously opposing these appeals.\nAssuming the continued effectiveness of the Illinois zero emission standard, Constellation Energy no longer considers Quad Cities Station to be at heightened risk for early retirement. However, to the extent the Illinois zero emission standard does not operate as expected over its full term, Quad Cities Station would be at heightened risk for early retirement. The FERC's December 19, 2019 order on the PJM MOPR may undermine the continued effectiveness of the Illinois zero emission standard unless the PJM adopts further changes to the MOPR or Illinois implements an FRR mechanism, under which Quad Cities Station would be removed from the PJM's capacity auction.\nEnvironmental Laws and Regulations\nThe Company is subject to federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations regarding climate change, RPS, air and water quality, emissions performance standards, coal combustion byproduct disposal, hazardous and solid waste disposal, protected species and other environmental matters that have the potential to impact its current and future operations. In addition to imposing continuing compliance obligations and capital expenditure requirements, these laws and regulations provide regulators with the authority to levy substantial penalties for noncompliance, including fines, injunctive relief and other sanctions. These laws and regulations are administered by various federal, state, local and international agencies. The Company believes it is in material compliance with all applicable laws and regulations, although many laws and regulations are subject to interpretation that may ultimately be resolved by the courts. Refer to \"Environmental Laws and Regulations\" in Item 1 of this Form 10-K for further discussion regarding environmental laws and regulations.\nCollateral and Contingent Features\nDebt of BHE and debt and preferred securities of certain of its subsidiaries are rated by credit rating agencies. Assigned credit ratings are based on each rating agency's assessment of the rated company's ability to, in general, meet the obligations of its issued debt or preferred securities. The credit ratings are not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold securities, and there is no assurance that a particular credit rating will continue for any given period of time.\nBHE and its subsidiaries have no credit rating downgrade triggers that would accelerate the maturity dates of outstanding debt, and a change in ratings is not an event of default under the applicable debt instruments. The Company's unsecured revolving credit facilities do not require the maintenance of a minimum credit rating level in order to draw upon their availability. However, commitment fees and interest rates under the credit facilities are tied to credit ratings and increase or decrease when the ratings change. A ratings downgrade could also increase the future cost of commercial paper, short- and long-term debt issuances or new credit facilities.\nIn accordance with industry practice, certain wholesale agreements, including derivative contracts, contain credit support provisions that in part base certain collateral requirements on credit ratings for senior unsecured debt as reported by one or more of the recognized credit rating agencies. These agreements may either specifically provide bilateral rights to demand cash or other security if credit exposures on a net basis exceed specified rating-dependent threshold levels (\"credit-risk-related contingent features\") or provide the right for counterparties to demand \"adequate assurance,\" or in some cases terminate the contract, in the event of a material adverse change in creditworthiness. These rights can vary by contract and by counterparty. As of December 31, 2021, the applicable entities' credit ratings from the recognized credit rating agencies were investment grade. If all credit-risk-related contingent features or adequate assurance provisions for these agreements had been triggered as of December 31, 2021, the Company would have been required to post $460 million of additional collateral. The Company's collateral requirements could fluctuate considerably due to market price volatility, changes in credit ratings, changes in legislation or regulation, or other factors.\nInflation\nHistorically, overall inflation and changing prices in the economies where BHE's subsidiaries operate have not had a significant impact on the Company's consolidated financial results. In the United States and Canada, the Regulated Businesses operate under cost-of-service based rate structures administered by various state and provincial commissions and the FERC. Under these rate structures, the Regulated Businesses are allowed to include prudent costs in their rates, including the impact of inflation. The price control formula used by the Northern Powergrid Distribution Companies incorporates the rate of inflation in determining rates charged to customers. BHE's subsidiaries attempt to minimize the potential impact of inflation on their operations through the use of fuel, energy and other cost adjustment clauses and bill riders, by employing prudent risk management and hedging strategies and by considering, among other areas, its impact on purchases of energy, operating expenses, materials and equipment costs, contract negotiations, future capital spending programs and long-term debt issuances. There can be no assurance that such actions will be successful.\nCritical Accounting Estimates\nCertain accounting measurements require management to make estimates and judgments concerning transactions that will be settled several years in the future. Amounts recognized on the Consolidated Financial Statements based on such estimates involve numerous assumptions subject to varying and potentially significant degrees of judgment and uncertainty and will likely change in the future as additional information becomes available. The following critical accounting estimates are impacted significantly by the Company's methods, judgments and assumptions used in the preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements and should be read in conjunction with the Company's Summary of Significant Accounting Policies included in Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Form 10-K.\nAccounting for the Effects of Certain Types of Regulation\nThe Regulated Businesses prepare their financial statements in accordance with authoritative guidance for regulated operations, which recognizes the economic effects of regulation. Accordingly, the Regulated Businesses defer the recognition of certain costs or income if it is probable that, through the ratemaking process, there will be a corresponding increase or decrease in future regulated rates. Regulatory assets and liabilities are established to reflect the impacts of these deferrals, which will be recognized in earnings in the periods the corresponding changes in regulated rates occur.\nThe Company continually evaluates the applicability of the guidance for regulated operations and whether its regulatory assets and liabilities are probable of inclusion in future regulated rates by considering factors such as a change in the regulator's approach to setting rates from cost-based ratemaking to another form of regulation, other regulatory actions or the impact of competition that could limit the Regulated Businesses' ability to recover their costs. The Company believes the application of the guidance for regulated operations is appropriate and its existing regulatory assets and liabilities are probable of inclusion in future regulated rates. The evaluation reflects the current political and regulatory climate at the federal, state and provincial levels. If it becomes no longer probable that the deferred costs or income will be included in future regulated rates, the related regulatory assets and liabilities will be recognized in net income, returned to customers or re-established as AOCI. Total regulatory assets were $4.0 billion and total regulatory liabilities were $7.2 billion as of December 31, 2021. Refer to Note 7 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Form 10-K for additional information regarding the Regulated Businesses' regulatory assets and liabilities.\nImpairment of Goodwill and Long-Lived Assets\nThe Company's Consolidated Balance Sheet as of December 31, 2021 includes goodwill of acquired businesses of $11.7 billion. The Company evaluates goodwill for impairment at least annually and completed its annual review as of October 31. Additionally, no indicators of impairment were identified as of December 31, 2021. Significant judgment is required in estimating the fair value of the reporting unit and performing goodwill impairment tests. The Company uses a variety of methods to estimate a reporting unit's fair value, principally discounted projected future net cash flows. Key assumptions used include, but are not limited to, the use of estimated future cash flows; multiples of earnings or rate base; and an appropriate discount rate. Estimated future cash flows are impacted by, among other factors, growth rates, changes in regulations and rates, ability to renew contracts and estimates of future commodity prices. In estimating future cash flows, the Company incorporates current market information, as well as historical factors.\nThe Company evaluates long-lived assets for impairment, including property, plant and equipment, when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of such assets may not be recoverable or when the assets are being held for sale. Upon the occurrence of a triggering event, the asset is reviewed to assess whether the estimated undiscounted cash flows expected from the use of the asset plus the residual value from the ultimate disposal exceeds the carrying value of the asset. If the carrying value exceeds the estimated recoverable amounts, the asset is written down to the estimated fair value and any resulting impairment loss is reflected on the Consolidated Statements of Operations. As substantially all property, plant and equipment is used in regulated businesses, the impacts of regulation are considered when evaluating the carrying value of regulated assets.\nThe estimate of cash flows arising from the future use of the asset that are used in the impairment analysis requires judgment regarding what the Company would expect to recover from the future use of the asset. Changes in judgment that could significantly alter the calculation of the fair value or the recoverable amount of the asset may result from significant changes in the regulatory environment, the business climate, management's plans, legal factors, market price of the asset, the use of the asset or the physical condition of the asset, future market prices, load growth, competition and many other factors over the life of the asset. Any resulting impairment loss is highly dependent on the underlying assumptions and could significantly affect the Company's results of operations.\nPension and Other Postretirement Benefits\nCertain of the Company's subsidiaries sponsor defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans that cover the majority of employees. The Company recognizes the funded status of the defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Funded status is the fair value of plan assets minus the benefit obligation as of the measurement date. As of December 31, 2021, the Company recognized a net asset totaling $433 million for the funded status of the defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans. As of December 31, 2021, amounts not yet recognized as a component of net periodic benefit cost that were included in net regulatory assets totaled $297 million and in AOCI totaled $428 million.\nThe expense and benefit obligations relating to these defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans are based on actuarial valuations. Inherent in these valuations are key assumptions, including discount rates, expected long-term rate of return on plan assets and healthcare cost trend rates. These key assumptions are reviewed annually and modified as appropriate. The Company believes that the assumptions utilized in recording obligations under the plans are reasonable based on prior plan experience and current market and economic conditions. Refer to Note 13 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Form 10-K for disclosures about the defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans, including the key assumptions used to calculate the funded status and net periodic benefit cost for these plans as of and for the year ended December 31, 2021.\nThe Company chooses a discount rate based upon high quality debt security investment yields in effect as of the measurement date that corresponds to the expected benefit period. The pension and other postretirement benefit liabilities increase as the discount rate is reduced.\nIn establishing its assumption as to the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets, the Company utilizes the expected asset allocation and return assumptions for each asset class based on historical performance and forward-looking views of the financial markets. Pension and other postretirement benefits expense increases as the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets decreases. The Company regularly reviews its actual asset allocations and rebalances its investments to its targeted allocations when considered appropriate.\nThe Company chooses a healthcare cost trend rate that reflects the near and long-term expectations of increases in medical costs and corresponds to the expected benefit payment periods. The healthcare cost trend rate is assumed to gradually decline to 5.00% by 2025, at which point the rate of increase is assumed to remain constant.\nThe key assumptions used may differ materially from period to period due to changing market and economic conditions. These differences may result in a significant impact to pension and other postretirement benefits expense and the funded status. If changes were to occur for the following key assumptions, the approximate effect on the Consolidated Financial Statements would be as follows (dollars in millions):\nTable 47: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Domestic Plans </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Other Postretirement </td> <td> </td> <td>United Kingdom </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Pension Plans </td> <td> </td> <td>Benefit Plans </td> <td> </td> <td>Pension Plan </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>+0.5% </td> <td> </td> <td>-0.5% </td> <td> </td> <td>+0.5% </td> <td> </td> <td>-0.5% </td> <td> </td> <td>+0.5% </td> <td> </td> <td>-0.5% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Effect on December 31, 2021 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Benefit Obligations: </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Discount rate </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(136) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>153 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(33) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>37 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(162) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>189 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Effect on 2021 Periodic Cost: </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Discount rate </td> <td>$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>5 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(20) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>23 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Expected rate of return on plan assets </td> <td>(13) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>13 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(4) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(12) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>12 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nA variety of factors affect the funded status of the plans, including asset returns, discount rates, mortality assumptions, plan changes and the Company's funding policy for each plan.\nIncome Taxes\nIn determining the Company's income taxes, management is required to interpret complex income tax laws and regulations, which includes consideration of regulatory implications imposed by the Company's various regulatory commissions. The Company's income tax returns are subject to continuous examinations by federal, state, local and foreign income tax authorities that may give rise to different interpretations of these complex laws and regulations. Due to the nature of the examination process, it generally takes years before these examinations are completed and these matters are resolved. The Company recognizes the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more-likely-than-not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. The tax benefits recognized in the Consolidated Financial Statements from such a position are measured based on the largest benefit that is more-likely-than-not to be realized upon ultimate settlement. Although the ultimate resolution of the Company's federal, state, local and foreign income tax examinations is uncertain, the Company believes it has made adequate provisions for these income tax positions. The aggregate amount of any additional income tax liabilities that may result from these examinations, if any, is not expected to have a material impact on the Company's consolidated financial results. Refer to Note 12 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Form 10-K for additional information regarding the Company's income taxes.\nIt is probable the Company's regulated businesses will continue to pass income tax benefits and expense related to the federal tax rate change from 35% to 21% as a result of 2017 Tax Reform, certain property-related basis differences and other various differences on to their customers. As of December 31, 2021, these amounts were recognized as a net regulatory liability of $2.8 billion and will be included in regulated rates when the temporary differences reverse.\nThe Company has not established deferred income taxes on its undistributed foreign earnings that have been determined by management to be reinvested indefinitely; however, the Company periodically evaluates its capital requirements. If circumstances change in the future and a portion of the Company's undistributed foreign earnings were repatriated, the dividends may be subject to taxation in the United States but the tax is not expected to be material.\nRevenue Recognition - Unbilled Revenue\nRevenue recognized is equal to what the Company has the right to invoice as it corresponds directly with the value to the customer of the Company's performance to date and includes billed and unbilled amounts. The determination of customer invoices is based on a systematic reading of meters, fixed reservation charges based on contractual quantities and rates or, in the case of the Great Britain distribution businesses, when information is received from the national settlement system. At the end of each month, energy provided to customers since the date of the last meter reading is estimated, and the corresponding unbilled revenue is recorded. Unbilled revenue was $718 million as of December 31, 2021. Factors that can impact the estimate of unbilled energy include, but are not limited to, seasonal weather patterns, total volumes supplied to the system, line losses, economic impacts and composition of sales among customer classes. Unbilled revenue is reversed in the following month and billed revenue is recorded based on the subsequent meter readings.", "item_7_truncated": "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThe following is management's discussion and analysis of certain significant factors that have affected the consolidated financial condition and results of operations of the Company during the periods included herein. Explanations include management's best estimate of the impact of weather, customer growth, usage trends and other factors. This discussion should be read in conjunction with the Company's historical Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Form 10-K. The Company's actual results in the future could differ significantly from the historical results.\nThe reportable segment financial information includes all necessary adjustments and eliminations needed to conform to the Company's significant accounting policies. The differences between the reportable segment amounts and the consolidated amounts, described as BHE and Other, relate principally to other entities, including MES, corporate functions and intersegment eliminations.\nResults of Operations\nOverview\nOperating revenue and earnings on common shares for the Company's reportable segments for the years ended December 31 are summarized as

meaningful.\nEarnings on common shares decreased $1,248 million for 2021 compared to 2020. Included in these results was a pre-tax unrealized gain in 2021 of $1,796 million ($1,777 million after-tax) compared to a pre-tax unrealized gain in 2020 of $4,774 million ($3,470 million after-tax) on the Company's investment in BYD Company Limited. Excluding the impact of this item, adjusted earnings on common shares in 2021 was $3,892 million, an increase of $445 million, or 13%, compared to adjusted earnings on common shares in 2020 of $3,447 million.\nThe decrease in net income attributable to BHE shareholders for 2021 compared to 2020 was primarily due to:\n\u2022The Utilities' earnings increased $242 million reflecting higher electric utility margin, favorable income tax expense, from higher PTCs recognized of $139 million and the impacts of ratemaking, and lower operations and maintenance expense, partially offset by higher depreciation and amortization expense. Electric retail customer volumes increased 3.8% for 2021 compared to 2020, primarily due to higher customer usage, an increase in the average number of customers and the favorable impact of weather;\n\u2022Northern Powergrid's earnings increased $46 million, primarily due to higher distribution performance, lower write-offs of gas exploration costs and $16 million from the weaker United States dollar, partially offset by the comparative unfavorable impact of deferred income tax charges ($109 million in second quarter 2021 and $35 million in third quarter 2020) related to enacted increases in the United Kingdom corporate income tax rate;\n\u2022BHE Pipeline Group's earnings increased $279 million, primarily due to $244 million of incremental earnings at BHE GT&S;\n\u2022BHE Renewables' earnings decreased $70 million, primarily due to lower tax equity investment earnings from the February 2021 polar vortex weather event, partially offset by earnings from tax equity investment projects reaching commercial operation and higher operating performance from owned renewable energy projects; and\n\u2022BHE and Other's earnings decreased $1,773 million, primarily due to the $1,693 million change in the after-tax unrealized position of the Company's investment in BYD Company Limited and $95 million of higher dividends on BHE's 4.00% Perpetual Preferred Stock issued in October 2020, partially offset by favorable comparative consolidated state income tax benefits.\nEarnings on common shares increased $3,967 million for 2020 compared to 2019. Included in these results was a pre-tax unrealized gain in 2020 of $4,774 million ($3,470 million after-tax) compared to a pre-tax unrealized loss in 2019 of $313 million ($227 million after-tax) on the Company's investment in BYD Company Limited. Excluding the impact of this item, adjusted earnings on common shares in 2020 was $3,447 million, an increase of $270 million, or 9%, compared to adjusted earnings on common shares in 2019 of $3,177 million.\nThe increase in earnings on common shares for 2020 compared to 2019 was primarily due to:\n\u2022The Utilities' earnings increased $50 million with favorable performance at all four utilities (electric retail customer volumes increased 0.1%), including $193 million of higher PTCs recognized, offset by a comparative increase in wildfire and other storm restoration costs, primarily at PacifiCorp;\n\u2022Northern Powergrid's earnings decreased $55 million, mainly due to a deferred income tax charge in 2020 from an enacted increase in the United Kingdom corporate income tax rate;\n\u2022BHE Pipeline Group's earnings increased $106 million, primarily due to $73 million of incremental earnings at BHE GT&S and a favorable rate case settlement at Northern Natural Gas;\n\u2022BHE Renewables' earnings increased $90 million, primarily due to increased income tax benefits from renewable wind tax equity investments, largely from projects reaching commercial operation, offset by lower earnings from geothermal and natural gas facilities;\n\u2022HomeServices' earnings increased $215 million, primarily due to higher earnings from mortgage services (71% increase in funded mortgage volume) and brokerage services (13% increase in closed transaction volume) largely attributable to the favorable interest rate environment; and\n\u2022BHE and Other's earnings increased $3,559 million, primarily due to the $3,697 million change in the after-tax unrealized position of the Company's investment in BYD Company Limited offset by higher BHE corporate interest expense and unfavorable comparative consolidated state income tax benefits.\nReportable Segment Results\nPacifiCorp\nOperating revenue decreased $45 million for 2021 compared to 2020, primarily due to lower retail revenue of $98 million, partially offset by higher wholesale and other revenue of $53 million. Retail revenue decreased mainly due to $234 million from the Utah and Oregon general rate case orders issued in 2020 (fully offset in expense, primarily depreciation) and price impacts of $41 million from lower rates primarily due to certain general rate case orders, partially offset by higher customer volumes of $177 million. Retail customer volumes increased 3.1%, primarily due to higher customer usage, an increase in the average number of customers and the favorable impact of weather. Wholesale and other revenue increased mainly due to higher wheeling revenue, average wholesale prices and REC sales, partially offset by $34 million from the Oregon RAC settlement (fully offset in depreciation expense) recognized in 2020.\nEarnings increased $148 million for 2021 compared to 2020, primarily due to favorable income tax expense from higher PTCs recognized of $75 million from new wind-powered generating facilities placed in-service, and the impacts of ratemaking, lower operations and maintenance expense of $178 million and higher utility margin of $145 million, partially offset by higher depreciation and amortization expense of $255 million and lower allowances for equity and borrowed funds used during construction of $72 million. Operations and maintenance expense decreased primarily due to lower costs associated with wildfires and the Klamath Hydroelectric Settlement Agreement and lower thermal plant maintenance expense, partially offset by higher costs associated with additional wind-powered generating facilities placed in-service as well as higher distribution maintenance costs. Utility margin increased primarily due to the higher retail customer volumes, higher wheeling and wholesale revenue and higher deferred net power costs in accordance with established adjustment mechanisms, partially offset by higher purchased power and thermal generation costs, the price impacts from lower retail rates and higher wheeling expenses. The increase in depreciation and amortization expense was primarily due to the impacts of a depreciation study effective January 1, 2021, as well as additional assets placed in-service.\nOperating revenue increased $273 million for 2020 compared to 2019, primarily due to higher retail revenue of $250 million and higher wholesale and other revenue of $23 million. Retail revenue increased primarily due to $234 million from the amortization of certain existing regulatory balances to offset the accelerated depreciation of certain property, plant and equipment and the accelerated amortization of certain regulatory asset balances in relation to Utah and Oregon general rate case orders issued in December 2020. The increase in retail revenue was also due to price impacts of $49 million from changes in sales mix, partially offset by lower customer volumes of $34 million. The increase in wholesale and other revenue was mainly due to $34 million from the amortization of certain existing regulatory balances in Oregon to offset the accelerated depreciation of certain retired wind equipment, partially offset by lower wholesale volumes. Retail customer volumes decreased 1.4% primarily due to the impacts of COVID-19, which resulted in lower industrial and commercial customer usage and higher residential customer usage, partially offset by an increase in the average number of residential and commercial customers and the favorable impact of weather.\nEarnings decreased $32 million for 2020 compared to 2019, primarily due to an increase in operations and maintenance expense due to higher costs associated with wildfires and the Klamath Hydroelectric Settlement Agreement of $169 million, higher interest expense of $25 million from higher long-term debt balances, higher pension and other postretirement costs of $13 million, lower interest income from lower average interest rates and higher property taxes of $10 million, partially offset by lower tax expense from higher PTCs recognized of $62 million from repowered and new wind-powered generating facilities, higher utility margin of $47 million and higher allowances for equity and borrowed funds used during construction of $38 million. Utility margin increased primarily due to lower coal-fueled and natural gas-fueled generation costs, lower purchased power costs and price impacts from changes in sales mix, partially offset by lower net deferrals of incurred net power costs in accordance with established adjustment mechanisms and lower retail customer volumes.\nMidAmerican Funding\nOperating revenue increased $819 million for 2021 compared to 2020, primarily due to higher natural gas operating revenue of $430 million and higher electric operating revenue of $390 million. Natural gas operating revenue increased due to a higher average per-unit cost of natural gas sold resulting in higher purchased gas adjustment recoveries of $440 million (fully offset in cost of sales), largely due to the February 2021 polar vortex weather event. Electric operating revenue increased due to higher retail revenue of $198 million and higher wholesale and other revenue of $192 million. Electric retail revenue increased primarily due to higher recoveries through adjustment clauses of $116 million (fully offset in expense, primarily cost of sales), higher customer volumes of $63 million and price impacts of $19 million from changes in sales mix. Electric retail customer volumes increased 5.8% due to increased usage of certain industrial customers and the favorable impact of weather. Electric wholesale and other revenue increased primarily due to higher average wholesale prices of $116 million and higher wholesale volumes of $71 million.\nEarnings increased $65 million for 2021 compared to 2020, primarily due to higher electric utility margin of $190 million and a favorable income tax benefit, partially offset by higher depreciation and amortization expense of $198 million, higher operations and maintenance expense of $20 million and lower allowances for equity and borrowed funds of $8 million. Electric utility margin increased primarily due to the higher retail and wholesale revenues, partially offset by higher thermal generation and purchased power costs. The favorable income tax benefit was largely due to higher PTCs recognized of $64 million, from new wind-powered generating facilities placed in-service, partially offset by state income tax impacts. The increase in depreciation and amortization expense was primarily due to the impacts of certain regulatory mechanisms and additional assets placed in-service. Operations and maintenance expense increased primarily due to higher costs associated with additional wind-powered generating facilities placed in-service and higher natural gas distribution costs, partially offset by 2020 costs associated with storm restoration activities.\nOperating revenue decreased $199 million for 2020 compared to 2019, primarily due to lower natural gas operating revenue of $77 million, lower electric operating revenue of $70 million, lower electric and natural gas energy efficiency program revenue of $38 million (fully offset in operations and maintenance expense) and lower other revenue of $14 million, primarily from nonregulated utility construction services. Natural gas operating revenue decreased primarily due to lower volumes and a lower average per-unit cost of natural gas sold resulting in lower purchased gas adjustment recoveries of $68 million (fully offset in cost of sales) and a 10.2% decrease in retail customer volumes, primarily due to the unfavorable impact of weather. Electric operating revenue decreased due to lower wholesale and other revenue of $88 million, partially offset by higher retail revenue of $18 million. Electric wholesale and other revenue decreased mainly due to lower average wholesale prices of $115 million, partially offset by higher wholesale volumes of $28 million. Electric retail revenue increased primarily due to higher customer usage of $38 million, partially offset by price impacts of $18 million from changes in sales mix. Electric retail customer volumes increased 1.2% due to increased usage for certain industrial customers, partially offset by the impacts of COVID-19, which resulted in lower commercial and industrial customer usage and higher residential customer usage.\nEarnings increased $37 million for 2020 compared to 2019, primarily due to higher income tax benefit of $197 million from higher PTCs recognized of $132 million and the favorable impacts of ratemaking, partially offset by higher depreciation and amortization expense of $77 million due to additional assets placed in-service (offset by $23 million of lower Iowa revenue sharing accruals), lower allowances for equity and borrowed funds used during construction of $45 million, higher interest expense of $20 million and lower electric and natural gas utility margins. PTCs recognized increased due to higher wind-powered generation driven primarily by repowering and new wind projects placed in-service. Electric utility margin decreased due to lower wholesale revenue and the price impacts from changes in sales mix, partially offset by lower generation costs from higher wind generation and higher retail customer volumes. Natural gas utility margin decreased primarily due to lower retail customer volumes primarily due to the unfavorable impact of weather.\nNV Energy\nOperating revenue increased $253 million for 2021 compared to 2020, primarily due to higher electric operating revenue of $252 million. Electric operating revenue increased primarily due to higher fully-bundled energy rates (fully offset in cost of sales) of $229 million, a $120 million one-time bill credit in the fourth quarter of 2020 resulting from a regulatory rate review decision (fully offset in operations and maintenance and income tax expenses) and higher retail customer volumes of $10 million, partially offset by lower base tariff general rates of $71 million at Nevada Power and a favorable regulatory decision in 2020. Electric retail customer volumes increased 3.3%, primarily due to an increase in the average number of customers, higher customer usage and the favorable impact of weather.\nEarnings increased $29 million for 2021 compared to 2020, primarily due to lower operations and maintenance expense of $90 million, lower income tax expense mainly from the impacts of ratemaking, lower interest expense of $21 million, higher interest and dividend income of $16 million and lower pension expense of $10 million, partially offset by lower electric utility margin of $97 million and higher depreciation and amortization expense of $47 million. Operations and maintenance expense decreased primarily due to lower regulatory deferrals and amortizations and lower earnings sharing at the Nevada Utilities. Electric utility margin decreased primarily due to lower base tariff general rates at Nevada Power and a favorable regulatory decision in 2020, partially offset by higher retail customer volumes. The increase in depreciation and amortization expense was mainly due to the regulatory amortization of decommissioning costs and additional assets placed in-service.\nOperating revenue decreased $183 million for 2020 compared to 2019, primarily due to lower electric operating revenue. Electric operating revenue decreased primarily due to lower fully-bundled energy rates (fully offset in cost of sales) of $164 million and a $120 million one-time bill credit in the fourth quarter of 2020 resulting from a regulatory rate review decision (fully offset in operations and maintenance and income tax expenses), partially offset by higher retail customer volumes, price impacts from changes in sales mix and a favorable regulatory decision. Electric retail customer volumes, including distribution only service customers, increased 1.5%, primarily due to the favorable impact of weather, largely offset by the impacts of COVID-19, which resulted in lower industrial, distribution only service and commercial customer usage and higher residential customer usage.\nEarnings increased $45 million for 2020 compared to 2019, primarily due to higher electric utility margin of $100 million, lower pension and post-retirement costs of $9 million and lower income tax expense mainly from the favorable impacts of ratemaking, partially offset by an increase in operations and maintenance expense, mainly from higher earnings sharing accruals at the Nevada Utilities, and higher depreciation and amortization expense of $20 million, mainly from higher plant placed in-service. Electric utility margin increased primarily due to higher retail customer volumes, price impacts from changes in sales mix and a favorable regulatory decision.\nNorthern Powergrid\nOperating revenue increased $166 million for 2021 compared to 2020, primarily due to higher distribution revenue of $80 million, mainly from increased tariff rates of $40 million and a 3.2% increase in units distributed totaling $26 million, and $77 million from the weaker United States dollar.\nEarnings increased $46 million for 2021 compared to 2020, primarily due to the higher distribution revenue, lower write-offs of gas exploration costs of $36 million, $16 million from the weaker United States dollar, favorable pension expense of $14 million and lower interest expense of $8 million, partially offset by higher income tax expense and higher distribution-related operating and depreciation expenses of $29 million. Earnings in 2021 included a deferred income tax charge of $109 million related to a June 2021 enacted increase in the United Kingdom corporate income tax rate from 19% to 25% effective April 1, 2023, while earnings in 2020 included a deferred income tax charge of $35 million related to a July 2020 enacted increase in the United Kingdom corporate income tax rate from 17% to 19% effective April 1, 2020.\nOperating revenue increased $9 million for 2020 compared to 2019, primarily due to higher distribution revenue of $10 million from increased tariff rates of $40 million, partially offset by a 5.4% decrease in units distributed totaling $30 million largely due to the impacts of COVID-19.\nEarnings decreased $55 million for 2020 compared to 2019, primarily due to write-offs of gas exploration costs of $44 million, higher income tax expense of $37 million and higher distribution-related operating and depreciation expenses of $18 million, partially offset by higher distribution revenue, lower pension expense of $22 million, including lower pension settlement losses recognized in 2020 compared to 2019, and lower interest expense of $9 million. The increase in income tax expense is due to a change in the United Kingdom corporate income tax rate that resulted in a deferred income tax charge of $35 million.\nBHE Pipeline Group\nOperating revenue increased $1,966 million for 2021 compared to 2020, primarily due to $1,828 million of incremental revenue at BHE GT&S, acquired in November 2020, higher gas sales of $115 million ($38 million largely offset in costs of sales) at Northern Natural Gas and higher transportation revenue of $29 million at Kern River largely due to higher rates and volumes, partially offset by lower transportation revenue of $24 million at Northern Natural Gas primarily due to lower volumes. The variances in gas sales and transportation revenue at Northern Natural Gas included favorable impacts of $77 million and $49 million, respectively, from the February 2021 polar vortex weather event.\nEarnings increased $279 million for 2021 compared to 2020, primarily due to $244 million of incremental earnings at BHE GT&S, favorable earnings of $19 million at Kern River from the higher transportation revenue and higher earnings of $15 million at Northern Natural Gas, primarily due to higher gross margin on gas sales and higher transportation revenue, each due to the favorable impacts of the February 2021 polar vortex weather event, offset by the lower transportation revenue.\nOperating revenue increased $447 million for 2020 compared to 2019, primarily due to $331 million of incremental revenue at BHE GT&S, a favorable rate case settlement at Northern Natural Gas of $101 million and higher transportation revenue of $43 million, partially offset by lower gas sales at Northern Natural Gas of $23 million related to system balancing activities (largely offset in cost of sales).\nEarnings increased $106 million for 2020 compared to 2019, primarily due to $73 million of incremental earnings BHE GT&S, the higher transportation revenue, and a favorable after-tax, rate case settlement at Northern Natural Gas of $32 million, partially offset by higher property and other tax expense of $17 million, including a non-recurring property tax refund in 2019, higher depreciation and amortization expense of $13 million due to increased spending on capital projects and lower interest income of $9 million.\nBHE Transmission\nOperating revenue increased $72 million for 2021 compared to 2020, primarily due to $47 million from the stronger United States dollar, a regulatory decision received in November 2020 at AltaLink and higher revenue from the Montana-Alberta Tie Line of $11 million.\nEarnings increased $16 million for 2021 compared to 2020, primarily due to $12 million from the stronger United States dollar, higher earnings from the Montana-Alberta Tie Line and lower non-regulated interest expense at BHE Canada, partially offset by the impact of a regulatory decision received in April 2020 at AltaLink.\nOperating revenue decreased $48 million for 2020 compared to 2019, primarily due to a regulatory decision received in November 2020 at AltaLink and the stronger United States dollar of $7 million.\nEarnings increased $2 million for 2020 compared to 2019, primarily due to lower non-regulated interest expense at BHE Canada and higher net income at BHE U.S. Transmission of $6 million mainly due to improved equity earnings from ETT, partially offset by the impacts of regulatory decisions received in 2020 and 2019 at AltaLink.\nBHE Renewables\nOperating revenue increased $45 million for 2021 compared to 2020, primarily due to higher natural gas, solar, wind and hydro revenues from favorable market conditions and higher generation, partially offset by an unfavorable change in the valuation of a power purchase agreement of $30 million.\nEarnings decreased $70 million for 2021 compared to 2020, primarily due to lower wind earnings of $83 million, largely from lower tax equity investment earnings of $90 million, and lower hydro earnings of $10 million, mainly due to lower income from a declining financial asset balance, partially offset by higher solar earnings of $22 million, mainly due to the higher operating revenue and lower depreciation expense. Tax equity investment earnings decreased due to unfavorable results from existing tax equity investments of $165 million, primarily due to the February 2021 polar vortex weather event, and lower commitment fee income, partially offset by $87 million of earnings from projects reaching commercial operation.\nOperating revenue increased $4 million for 2020 compared to 2019, primarily due to higher natural gas, solar and hydro revenues of $21 million due to favorable generation, partially offset by an unfavorable change in the valuation of a power purchase agreement of $14 million and lower geothermal revenues of $4 million from lower pricing.\nEarnings increased $90 million for 2020 compared to 2019, primarily due to favorable wind tax equity investment earnings of $129 million, partially offset by lower geothermal earnings of $22 million, due to higher operations and maintenance expense and lower pricing, and lower natural gas earnings of $17 million, due to lower margins. Wind tax equity investment earnings improved due to $147 million of earnings from projects reaching commercial operation, partially offset by lower commitment fee income and lower earnings from existing tax equity investments of $6 million.\nHomeServices\nOperating revenue increased $819 million for 2021 compared to 2020, primarily due to higher brokerage revenue of $951 million, partially offset by lower mortgage revenue of $169 million from an 8% decrease in funded volume due to a decrease in refinance activity. The increase in brokerage revenue was due to a 21% increase in closed transaction volume at existing companies resulting from increases in average sales price and closed units.\nEarnings increased $12 million for 2021 compared to 2020, primarily due to higher earnings from brokerage and franchise services of $81 million, largely attributable to the increase in closed transaction volume at existing companies, partially offset by lower earnings from mortgage services of $68 million from the decrease in refinance activity.\nOperating revenue increased $923 million for 2020 compared to 2019, primarily due to higher brokerage revenue of $440 million from a 13% increase in closed transaction volume and higher mortgage revenue of $423 million from a 71% increase in funded mortgage volume due to an increase in refinance activity.\nEarnings increased $215 million for 2020 compared to 2019, primarily due to higher earnings at mortgage services of $138 million and higher earnings at brokerage services largely attributable to the favorable interest rate environment.\nBHE and Other\nOperating revenue increased $103 million for 2021 compared to 2020, primarily due to higher electricity and natural gas sales revenue at MES, from favorable pricing offset by lower volumes.\nEarnings decreased $1,773 million for 2021 compared to 2020, primarily due to the $1,693 million change in the after-tax unrealized position of the Company's investment in BYD Company Limited, $95 million of higher dividends on BHE's 4.00% Perpetual Preferred Stock issued in October 2020, higher corporate costs and higher BHE corporate interest expense from debt issuances in March and October 2020, partially offset by favorable comparative consolidated state income tax benefits and higher earnings of $17 million at MES.\nOperating revenue decreased $118 million for 2020 compared to 2019, primarily due to lower electricity and natural gas sales revenue at MES, from lower volumes.\nEarnings increased $3,559 million for 2020 compared to 2019, primarily due to the $3,697 million change in the after-tax unrealized position of the Company's investment in BYD Company Limited, partially offset by higher BHE corporate interest expense from debt issuances in March and October 2020 and unfavorable comparative consolidated state income tax benefits.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nEach of BHE's direct and indirect subsidiaries is organized as a legal entity separate and apart from BHE and its other subsidiaries.

items.\nOperating Activities\nNet cash flows from operating activities for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 were $8.7 billion and $6.2 billion, respectively. The increase was primarily due to $970 million of incremental net cash flows from operating activities at BHE GT&S, improved operating results and changes in working capital.\nNet cash flows from operating activities for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 were $6,224 million and $6,206 million, respectively. The increase was primarily due to an increase in income tax receipts and improved operating results, partially offset by changes in working capital.\nThe timing of the Company's income tax cash flows from period to period can be significantly affected by the estimated federal income tax payment methods selected and assumptions made for each payment date.\nInvesting Activities\nNet cash flows from investing activities for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 were $(5.8) billion and $(13.2) billion, respectively. The change was primarily due to lower funding of tax equity investments, lower cash paid for acquisitions and the July 2021 receipt of $1.3 billion due to the termination of the Q-Pipe Purchase Agreement. Refer to \"Future Uses of Cash\" for further discussion of capital expenditures.\nNet cash flows from investing activities for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 were $(13.2) billion and $(9.0) billion, respectively.

Uses of cash totaled $2.3 billion and consisted mainly of $1.9 billion for repayments of subsidiary debt and repurchases of common stock of $293 million.\nDebt Repurchases\nThe Company may from time to time seek to acquire its outstanding debt securities through cash purchases in the open market, privately negotiated transactions or otherwise. Any debt securities repurchased by the Company may be reissued or resold by the Company from time to time and will depend on prevailing market conditions, the Company's liquidity requirements, contractual restrictions and other factors. The amounts involved may be material.\nPreferred Stock Issuance\nOn October 29, 2020, BHE issued $3.75 billion of its 4.00% Perpetual Preferred Stock to certain subsidiaries of Berkshire Hathaway Inc. in order to fund the GT&S Cash Consideration and the Q-Pipe Cash Consideration.\nPreferred Stock Redemptions\nFor the year ended December 31, 2021, BHE redeemed at par 2,100,012 shares of its 4.00% Perpetual Preferred Stock from certain subsidiaries of Berkshire Hathaway Inc. for $2.1 billion.\nCommon Stock Transactions\nFor the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, BHE repurchased 180,358 shares of its common stock for $126 million and 447,712 shares of its common stock for $293 million, respectively.\nFuture Uses of Cash\nThe Company has available a variety of sources of liquidity and capital resources, both internal and external, including net cash flows from operating activities, public and private debt offerings, the issuance of commercial paper, the use of unsecured revolving credit facilities, the issuance of equity and other sources. These sources are expected to provide funds required for current operations, capital expenditures, acquisitions, investments, debt retirements and other capital requirements. The availability and terms under which BHE and each subsidiary has access to external financing depends on a variety of factors, including regulatory approvals, its credit ratings, investors' judgment of risk and conditions in the overall capital markets, including the condition of the utility industry and project finance markets, among other items.\nCapital Expenditures\nThe Company has significant future capital requirements. Capital expenditure needs are reviewed regularly by management and may change significantly as a result of these reviews, which may consider, among other factors, impacts to customers' rates; changes in environmental and other rules and regulations; outcomes of regulatory proceedings; changes in income tax laws; general business conditions; load projections; system reliability standards; the cost and efficiency of construction labor, equipment and materials; commodity prices; and the cost and availability of capital. Expenditures for certain assets may ultimately include acquisitions of existing assets.\nThe Company's historical and forecast capital expenditures, each of which exclude amounts for non-cash equity AFUDC and other non-cash items, by reportable segment for the years ended December 31 are as follows (in millions):\nTable 45: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>

following:\n\u2022Wind generation includes both growth and operating expenditures. Growth expenditures include spending for the following:\n\u25e6Construction and acquisition of wind-powered generating facilities at MidAmerican Energy totaling $540 million for 2021, $848 million for 2020 and $1,486 million for 2019. MidAmerican Energy placed in-service 294 MWs during 2021, 729 MWs during 2020, including the acquisition of an existing 80-MW wind farm and 1,019 MWs during 2019. All of these wind-powered generating facilities placed in-service in 2021, 2020 and 2019 qualify for 100% of PTCs available. PTCs from these projects are excluded from MidAmerican Energy's Iowa EAC until these generation assets are reflected in base rates. Planned spending for the construction of wind-powered generating facilities totals $190 million in 2022, $1,744 million in 2023 and $1,678 million in 2024.\n\u25e6Repowering of wind-powered generating facilities at MidAmerican Energy totaling $354 million for 2021, $37 million for 2020 and $369 million for 2019. Planned spending for repowering totals $509 million in 2022. MidAmerican Energy expects its repowered facilities to meet IRS guidelines for the re-establishment of PTCs for 10 years from the date the facilities are placed in-service. The rate at which PTCs are re-established for a facility depends upon the date construction begins. Of the 865 MWs of current repowering projects not in-service as of December 31, 2021, 564 MWs are currently expected to qualify for 80% of the PTCs available for 10 years following each facility's return to service and 301 MWs are expected to qualify for 60% of such credits.\n\u25e6Construction of wind-powered generating facilities at PacifiCorp totaling $107 million for 2021, $1,148 million for 2020 and $338 million for 2019. Construction includes 674 MWs of new wind-powered generating facilities that were placed in-service in 2020 and 516 MWs that were placed in-service in 2021. Planned spending for the construction of additional wind-powered generating facilities totals $131 million in 2022, $405 million in 2023 and $373 million in 2024. The energy production from the new wind-powered generating facilities placed in-service by the end of 2024 is expected to qualify for 60% of the federal PTCs available for 10 years once the equipment is placed in-service.\n\u25e6Repowering of existing wind-powered generating facilities at PacifiCorp totaling $9 million for 2021, $125 million for 2020 and $585 million for 2019. All existing wind-powered generating facilities at PacifiCorp have been repowered as of December 31, 2021.\n\u25e6The 2021 IRP also included PacifiCorp's planned acquisition and repowering of two wind-powered generating facilities. The repowered facilities are expected to be placed in-service in 2023 and 2024. PacifiCorp spent $11 million in 2021 and planned spending for acquiring and repowering generating facilities totals $60 million in 2022, $36 million in 2023 and $34 million in 2024.\n\u25e6Construction of wind-powered generating facilities at BHE Renewables totaling $155 million for 2021 and $15 million for 2019. In May 2021, BHE Renewables completed the asset acquisition of a 54-MW wind-powered generating facility located in Iowa. In December 2021, BHE Renewables completed asset acquisitions of 158-MW and 200-MW wind-powered generating facilities located in Texas. Planned spending for future wind generation totals $306 million in 2023 and $102 million in 2024.\n\u2022Electric distribution includes both growth and operating expenditures. Growth expenditures include spending for new customer connections and enhancements to existing customer connections. Operating expenditures include spending for ongoing distribution systems infrastructure needed at the Utilities and Northern Powergrid, wildfire mitigation, storm damage restoration and repairs and investments in routine expenditures for distribution needed to serve existing and expected demand.\n\u2022Electric transmission includes both growth and operating expenditures. Growth expenditures include spending for the following:\n\u25e6PacifiCorp's transmission investment in 2021 through 2024 primarily reflecting planned costs for the 416-mile, 500-kV high-voltage transmission line between the Aeolus substation near Medicine Bow in Wyoming and the Clover substation near Mona, Utah; the 59-mile, 230-kV high-voltage transmission line between the Windstar substation near Glenrock, Wyoming and the Aeolus substation; the 290-mile, 500-kV high-voltage transmission line from the Longhorn substation near Boardman, Oregon to the Hemingway substation near Boise, Idaho. PacifiCorp is advancing permitting and regulatory approvals related to the projects. Planned spending for these Energy Gateway Transmission segments to be placed in-service in 2024-2026 totals $565 million in 2022, $1,143 million in 2023 and $437 million in 2024.\n\u25e6Nevada Utilities' Greenlink Nevada transmission expansion program. In this project, the company has received approval from the PUCN to build a 350-mile, 525-kV transmission line, known as Greenlink West, connecting the Ft. Churchill substation to the Northwest substation to the Harry Allen substation; a 235-mile, 525-kV transmission line, known as Greenlink North, connecting the new Ft. Churchill substation to the Robinson Summit substation; a 46-mile, 345-kV transmission line from the new Ft. Churchill substation to the Mira Loma substations; and a 38-mile, 345-kV transmission line from the new Ft. Churchill substation to the Robinson Summit substations. Planned spending for the expansion programs estimated to be placed in-service in 2026-2028 totals $61 million in 2022, $148 million in 2023 and $498 million in 2024.\n\u25e6Operating expenditures include spending for system reinforcement, upgrades and replacements of facilities to maintain system reliability and investments in routine expenditures for transmission needed to serve existing and expected demand.\n\u2022Natural gas transmission and storage includes both growth and operating expenditures. Growth expenditures include, among other items, spending for the Northern Natural Gas Twin Cities Area Expansion and Spraberry Compression projects. Operating expenditures include, among other items, spending for asset modernization, pipeline integrity projects and natural gas transmission, storage and LNG terminalling infrastructure needs to serve existing and expected demand.\n\u2022Solar generation includes growth expenditures, including spending for the following:\n\u25e6Construction of solar-powered generating facilities at MidAmerican Energy totaling 141 MWs of small- and utility-scale solar generation, with total spend of $132 million in 2021 and planned spending of $93 million in 2022 and $58 million in 2023.\n\u25e6Construction of solar-powered generating facilities at the Nevada Utilities' includes expenditures for three solar photovoltaic facilities, including a 150-MW solar photovoltaic facility with an additional 100 MWs of co-located battery storage that will be developed in Clark County, Nevada, with commercial operation expected by the end of 2023; a 250 MW solar photovoltaic facility with an additional 200 MWs of co-located battery storage that will be developed in Humboldt County, Nevada, with commercial operation expected by the end of 2023; and a 350 MW solar photovoltaic facility with an additional 280 MWs of co-located battery storage that will be developed in Humboldt County, Nevada, with commercial operation expected by the end of 2024. The facilities located in Humboldt County will be jointly owned and operated by Nevada Power and Sierra Pacific. Planned spending totals $702 million in 2023 and $799 million in 2024.\n\u25e6Construction of solar-powered generating facilities at BHE Renewables' includes expenditures for a 48-MW solar photovoltaic facility with an additional 52 MWs of capacity of co-located battery storage in Kern County, California, with commercial operation expected by November 30, 2024. Planned spending totals $150 million in 2024.\n\u2022Other capital expenditures includes both growth and operating expenditures, including spending for routine expenditures for generation and other infrastructure needed to serve existing and expected demand, natural gas distribution, technology, and environmental spending relating to emissions control equipment and the management of CCR.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nThe Company has certain investments that are accounted for under the equity method in accordance with GAAP. Accordingly, an amount is recorded on the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheets as an equity investment and is increased or decreased for the Company's pro-rata share of earnings or losses, respectively, less any dividends from such investments. Certain equity investments are presented on the Consolidated Balance Sheets net of investment tax credits.\nAs of December 31, 2021, the Company's investments that are accounted for under the equity method had short- and long-term debt of $2.7 billion, unused revolving credit facilities of $200 million and letters of credit outstanding of $88 million. As of December 31, 2021, the Company's pro-rata share of such short- and long-term debt was $1.3 billion, unused revolving credit facilities was $100 million and outstanding letters of credit was $43 million. The entire amount of the Company's pro-rata share of the outstanding short- and long-term debt and unused revolving credit facilities is non-recourse to the Company. The entire amount of the Company's pro-rata share of the outstanding letters of credit is recourse to the Company. Although the Company is generally not required to support debt service obligations of its equity investees, default with respect to this non-recourse short- and long-term debt could result in a loss of invested equity.\nMaterial Cash Requirements\nThe Company has cash requirements that may affect its consolidated financial condition that arise primarily from long- and short-term debt (refer to Note 9, 10 and 11), operating and financing leases (refer to Note 6), firm commitments (refer to Note 16), letters of credit (refer to Note 9), construction and other development costs (refer to Liquidity and Capital Resources included within this Item 7), uncertain tax positions (refer to Note 12) and AROs (refer to Note 14). Refer, where applicable, to the respective referenced note in Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Form 10-K for additional information.\nThe Company has cash requirements relating to interest payments of $32.4 billion on long-term debt, including $2.1 billion due in 2022.\nAdditionally, the Company has invested in wind projects sponsored by third parties, commonly referred to as tax equity investments. Under the terms of these tax equity investments, the Company has entered into equity capital contribution agreements with the project sponsors that require contributions. The Company has made contributions of $- million, $2,736 million and $1,619 million in 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively, and has commitments as of December 31, 2021, subject to satisfaction of certain specified conditions, to provide equity contributions of $356 million in 2022 pursuant to these equity capital contribution agreements as the various projects achieve commercial operation. However, the Company expects to assign its rights and obligations under these equity capital contribution agreements, including any related funding commitments, to an entity affiliated through common ownership. Once a project achieves commercial operation, the Company enters into a partnership agreement with the project sponsor that directs and allocates the operating profits and tax benefits from the project.\nRegulatory Matters\nThe Company is subject to comprehensive regulation. Refer to the discussion contained in Item 1 of this Form 10-K for further information regarding the Company's general regulatory framework and current regulatory matters.\nQuad Cities Generating Station Operating Status\nConstellation Energy Corp. (\"Constellation Energy,\" previously Exelon Generation Company, LLC, which was a subsidiary of Exelon Corporation prior to February 1, 2022), the operator of Quad Cities Generating Station Units 1 and 2 (\"Quad Cities Station\") of which MidAmerican Energy has a 25% ownership interest, announced on June 2, 2016, its intention to shut down Quad Cities Station on June 1, 2018. In December 2016, Illinois passed legislation creating a zero emission standard, which went into effect June 1, 2017. The zero emission standard requires the Illinois Power Agency to purchase ZECs and recover the costs from certain ratepayers in Illinois, subject to certain limitations. The proceeds from the ZECs will provide Constellation Energy additional revenue through 2027 as an incentive for continued operation of Quad Cities Station. MidAmerican Energy will not receive additional revenue from the subsidy.\nThe PJM Interconnection, L.L.C. (\"PJM\") capacity market includes a Minimum Offer Price Rule (\"MOPR\"). If a generation resource is subjected to a MOPR, its offer price in the market is adjusted to effectively remove the revenues it receives through a state government-provided financial support program, resulting in a higher offer that may not clear the capacity market. Prior to December 19, 2019, the PJM MOPR applied only to certain new gas-fired resources. An expanded PJM MOPR to include existing resources would require exclusion of ZEC compensation when bidding into future capacity auctions, resulting in an increased risk of Quad Cities Station not receiving capacity revenues in future auctions.\nOn December 19, 2019, the FERC issued an order requiring the PJM to broadly apply the MOPR to all new and existing resources, including nuclear. This greatly expanded the breadth and scope of the PJM's MOPR, which became effective as of the PJM's capacity auction for the 2022-2023 planning year in May 2021. While the FERC included some limited exemptions, no exemptions were available to state-supported nuclear resources, such as Quad Cities Station. The FERC provided no new mechanism for accommodating state-supported resources other than the existing Fixed Resource Requirement (\"FRR\") mechanism under which an entire utility zone would be removed from PJM's capacity auction along with sufficient resources to support the load in such zone. In response to the FERC's order, the PJM submitted a compliance filing on March 18, 2020, wherein the PJM proposed tariff language reflecting the FERC's directives and a schedule for resuming capacity auctions. On April 16, 2020, the FERC issued an order largely denying requests for rehearing of the FERC's December 2019 order but granting a few clarifications that required an additional PJM compliance filing, which the PJM submitted on June 1, 2020. A number of parties, including Constellation Energy, have filed petitions for review of the FERC's orders in this proceeding, which remain pending before the D.C. Circuit.\nAs a result, the MOPR applied to Quad Cities Station in the capacity auction for the 2022-2023 planning year, which prevented Quad Cities Station from clearing in that capacity auction.\nAt the direction of the PJM Board of Managers, the PJM and its stakeholders developed further MOPR reforms to ensure that the capacity market rules respect and accommodate state resource preferences such as the ZEC programs. The PJM filed related tariff revisions at the FERC on July 30, 2021, and, on September 29, 2021, the PJM's proposed MOPR reforms became effective by operation of law. Under the new tariff provisions, the MOPR will no longer apply to Quad Cities Station. Requests for rehearing of the FERC's notice establishing the effective date for the PJM's proposed market reforms were filed in October 2021 and denied by operation of law on November 4, 2021. Several parties have filed petitions for review of the FERC's orders in this proceeding, which remain pending before the Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit. Constellation Energy is strenuously opposing these appeals.\nAssuming the continued effectiveness of the Illinois zero emission standard, Constellation Energy no longer considers Quad Cities Station to be at heightened risk for early retirement. However, to the extent the Illinois zero emission standard does not operate as expected over its full term, Quad Cities Station would be at heightened risk for early retirement. The FERC's December 19, 2019 order on the PJM MOPR may undermine the continued effectiveness of the Illinois zero emission standard unless the PJM adopts further changes to the MOPR or Illinois implements an FRR mechanism, under which Quad Cities Station would be removed from the PJM's capacity auction.\nEnvironmental Laws and Regulations\nThe Company is subject to federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations regarding climate change, RPS, air and water quality, emissions performance standards, coal combustion byproduct disposal, hazardous and solid waste disposal, protected species and other environmental matters that have the potential to impact its current and future operations. In addition to imposing continuing compliance obligations and capital expenditure requirements, these laws and regulations provide regulators with the authority to levy substantial penalties for noncompliance, including fines, injunctive relief and other sanctions. These laws and regulations are administered by various federal, state, local and international agencies. The Company believes it is in material compliance with all applicable laws and regulations, although many laws and regulations are subject to interpretation that may ultimately be resolved by the courts. Refer to \"Environmental Laws and Regulations\" in Item 1 of this Form 10-K for further discussion regarding environmental laws and regulations.\nCollateral and Contingent Features\nDebt of BHE and debt and preferred securities of certain of its subsidiaries are rated by credit rating agencies. Assigned credit ratings are based on each rating agency's assessment of the rated company's ability to, in general, meet the obligations of its issued debt or preferred securities. The credit ratings are not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold securities, and there is no assurance that a particular credit rating will continue for any given period of time.\nBHE and its subsidiaries have no credit rating downgrade triggers that would accelerate the maturity dates of outstanding debt, and a change in ratings is not an event of default under the applicable debt instruments. The Company's unsecured revolving credit facilities do not require the maintenance of a minimum credit rating level in order to draw upon their availability. However, commitment fees and interest rates under the credit facilities are tied to credit ratings and increase or decrease when the ratings change. A ratings downgrade could also increase the future cost of commercial paper, short- and long-term debt issuances or new credit facilities.\nIn accordance with industry practice, certain wholesale agreements, including derivative contracts, contain credit support provisions that in part base certain collateral requirements on credit ratings for senior unsecured debt as reported by one or more of the recognized credit rating agencies. These agreements may either specifically provide bilateral rights to demand cash or other security if credit exposures on a net basis exceed specified rating-dependent threshold levels (\"credit-risk-related contingent features\") or provide the right for counterparties to demand \"adequate assurance,\" or in some cases terminate the contract, in the event of a material adverse change in creditworthiness. These rights can vary by contract and by counterparty. As of December 31, 2021, the applicable entities' credit ratings from the recognized credit rating agencies were investment grade. If all credit-risk-related contingent features or adequate assurance provisions for these agreements had been triggered as of December 31, 2021, the Company would have been required to post $460 million of additional collateral. The Company's collateral requirements could fluctuate considerably due to market price volatility, changes in credit ratings, changes in legislation or regulation, or other factors.\nInflation\nHistorically, overall inflation and changing prices in the economies where BHE's subsidiaries operate have not had a significant impact on the Company's consolidated financial results. In the United States and Canada, the Regulated Businesses operate under cost-of-service based rate structures administered by various state and provincial commissions and the FERC. Under these rate structures, the Regulated Businesses are allowed to include prudent costs in their rates, including the impact of inflation. The price control formula used by the Northern Powergrid Distribution Companies incorporates the rate of inflation in determining rates charged to customers. BHE's subsidiaries attempt to minimize the potential impact of inflation on their operations through the use of fuel, energy and other cost adjustment clauses and bill riders, by employing prudent risk management and hedging strategies and by considering, among other areas, its impact on purchases of energy, operating expenses, materials and equipment costs, contract negotiations, future capital spending programs and long-term debt issuances. There can be no assurance that such actions will be successful.\nCritical Accounting Estimates\nCertain accounting measurements require management to make estimates and judgments concerning transactions that will be settled several years in the future. Amounts recognized on the Consolidated Financial Statements based on such estimates involve numerous assumptions subject to varying and potentially significant degrees of judgment and uncertainty and will likely change in the future as additional information becomes available. The following critical accounting estimates are impacted significantly by the Company's methods, judgments and assumptions used in the preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements and should be read in conjunction with the Company's Summary of Significant Accounting Policies included in Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Form 10-K.\nAccounting for the Effects of Certain Types of Regulation\nThe Regulated Businesses prepare their financial statements in accordance with authoritative guidance for regulated operations, which recognizes the economic effects of regulation. Accordingly, the Regulated Businesses defer the recognition of certain costs or income if it is probable that, through the ratemaking process, there will be a corresponding increase or decrease in future regulated rates. Regulatory assets and liabilities are established to reflect the impacts of these deferrals, which will be recognized in earnings in the periods the corresponding changes in regulated rates occur.\nThe Company continually evaluates the applicability of the guidance for regulated operations and whether its regulatory assets and liabilities are probable of inclusion in future regulated rates by considering factors such as a change in the regulator's approach to setting rates from cost-based ratemaking to another form of regulation, other regulatory actions or the impact of competition that could limit the Regulated Businesses' ability to recover their costs. The Company believes the application of the guidance for regulated operations is appropriate and its existing regulatory assets and liabilities are probable of inclusion in future regulated rates. The evaluation reflects the current political and regulatory climate at the federal, state and provincial levels. If it becomes no longer probable that the deferred costs or income will be included in future regulated rates, the related regulatory assets and liabilities will be recognized in net income, returned to customers or re-established as AOCI. Total regulatory assets were $4.0 billion and total regulatory liabilities were $7.2 billion as of December 31, 2021. Refer to Note 7 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Form 10-K for additional information regarding the Regulated Businesses' regulatory assets and liabilities.\nImpairment of Goodwill and Long-Lived Assets\nThe Company's Consolidated Balance Sheet as of December 31, 2021 includes goodwill of acquired businesses of $11.7 billion. The Company evaluates goodwill for impairment at least annually and completed its annual review as of October 31. Additionally, no indicators of impairment were identified as of December 31, 2021. Significant judgment is required in estimating the fair value of the reporting unit and performing goodwill impairment tests. The Company uses a variety of methods to estimate a reporting unit's fair value, principally discounted projected future net cash flows. Key assumptions used include, but are not limited to, the use of estimated future cash flows; multiples of earnings or rate base; and an appropriate discount rate. Estimated future cash flows are impacted by, among other factors, growth rates, changes in regulations and rates, ability to renew contracts and estimates of future commodity prices. In estimating future cash flows, the Company incorporates current market information, as well as historical factors.\nThe Company evaluates long-lived assets for impairment, including property, plant and equipment, when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of such assets may not be recoverable or when the assets are being held for sale. Upon the occurrence of a triggering event, the asset is reviewed to assess whether the estimated undiscounted cash flows expected from the use of the asset plus the residual value from the ultimate disposal exceeds the carrying value of the asset. If the carrying value exceeds the estimated recoverable amounts, the asset is written down to the estimated fair value and any resulting impairment loss is reflected on the Consolidated Statements of Operations. As substantially all property, plant and equipment is used in regulated businesses, the impacts of regulation are considered when evaluating the carrying value of regulated assets.\nThe estimate of cash flows arising from the future use of the asset that are used in the impairment analysis requires judgment regarding what the Company would expect to recover from the future use of the asset. Changes in judgment that could significantly alter the calculation of the fair value or the recoverable amount of the asset may result from significant changes in the regulatory environment, the business climate, management's plans, legal factors, market price of the asset, the use of the asset or the physical condition of the asset, future market prices, load growth, competition and many other factors over the life of the asset. Any resulting impairment loss is highly dependent on the underlying assumptions and could significantly affect the Company's results of operations.\nPension and Other Postretirement Benefits\nCertain of the Company's subsidiaries sponsor defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans that cover the majority of employees. The Company recognizes the funded status of the defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Funded status is the fair value of plan assets minus the benefit obligation as of the measurement date. As of December 31, 2021, the Company recognized a net asset totaling $433 million for the funded status of the defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans. As of December 31, 2021, amounts not yet recognized as a component of net periodic benefit cost that were included in net regulatory assets totaled $297 million and in AOCI totaled $428 million.\nThe expense and benefit obligations relating to these defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans are based on actuarial valuations. Inherent in these valuations are key assumptions, including discount rates, expected long-term rate of return on plan assets and healthcare cost trend rates. These key assumptions are reviewed annually and modified as appropriate. The Company believes that the assumptions utilized in recording obligations under the plans are reasonable based on prior plan experience and current market and economic conditions. Refer to Note 13 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Form 10-K for disclosures about the defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans, including the key assumptions used to calculate the funded status and net periodic benefit cost for these plans as of and for the year ended December 31, 2021.\nThe Company chooses a discount rate based upon high quality debt security investment yields in effect as of the measurement date that corresponds to the expected benefit period. The pension and other postretirement benefit liabilities increase as the discount rate is reduced.\nIn establishing its assumption as to the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets, the Company utilizes the expected asset allocation and return assumptions for each asset class based on historical performance and forward-looking views of the financial markets. Pension and other postretirement benefits expense increases as the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets decreases. The Company regularly reviews its actual asset allocations and rebalances its investments to its targeted allocations when considered appropriate.\nThe Company chooses a healthcare cost trend rate that reflects the near and long-term expectations of increases in medical costs and corresponds to the expected benefit payment periods. The healthcare cost trend rate is assumed to gradually decline to 5.00% by 2025, at which point the rate of increase is assumed to remain constant.\nThe key assumptions used may differ materially from period to period due to changing market and economic conditions. These differences may result in a significant impact to pension and other postretirement benefits expense and the funded status. If changes were to occur for the following key assumptions, the approximate effect on the Consolidated Financial Statements would be as follows (dollars in millions):\nTable 47: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Domestic Plans </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Other Postretirement </td> <td> </td> <td>United Kingdom </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Pension Plans </td> <td> </td> <td>Benefit Plans </td> <td> </td> <td>Pension Plan </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>+0.5% </td> <td> </td> <td>-0.5% </td> <td> </td> <td>+0.5% </td> <td> </td> <td>-0.5% </td> <td> </td> <td>+0.5% </td> <td> </td> <td>-0.5% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Effect on December 31, 2021 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Benefit Obligations: </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Discount rate </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(136) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>153 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(33) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>37 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(162) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>189 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Effect on 2021 Periodic Cost: </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Discount rate </td> <td>$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>5 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(20) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>23 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Expected rate of return on plan assets </td> <td>(13) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>13 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(4) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(12) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>12 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nA variety of factors affect the funded status of the plans, including asset returns, discount rates, mortality assumptions, plan changes and the Company's funding policy for each plan.\nIncome Taxes\nIn determining the Company's income taxes, management is required to interpret complex income tax laws and regulations, which includes consideration of regulatory implications imposed by the Company's various regulatory commissions. The Company's income tax returns are subject to continuous examinations by federal, state, local and foreign income tax authorities that may give rise to different interpretations of these complex laws and regulations. Due to the nature of the examination process, it generally takes years before these examinations are completed and these matters are resolved. The Company recognizes the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more-likely-than-not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. The tax benefits recognized in the Consolidated Financial Statements from such a position are measured based on the largest benefit that is more-likely-than-not to be realized upon ultimate settlement. Although the ultimate resolution of the Company's federal, state, local and foreign income tax examinations is uncertain, the Company believes it has made adequate provisions for these income tax positions. The aggregate amount of any additional income tax liabilities that may result from these examinations, if any, is not expected to have a material impact on the Company's consolidated financial results. Refer to Note 12 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Form 10-K for additional information regarding the Company's income taxes.\nIt is probable the Company's regulated businesses will continue to pass income tax benefits and expense related to the federal tax rate change from 35% to 21% as a result of 2017 Tax Reform, certain property-related basis differences and other various differences on to their customers. As of December 31, 2021, these amounts were recognized as a net regulatory liability of $2.8 billion and will be included in regulated rates when the temporary differences reverse.\nThe Company has not established deferred income taxes on its undistributed foreign earnings that have been determined by management to be reinvested indefinitely; however, the Company periodically evaluates its capital requirements. If circumstances change in the future and a portion of the Company's undistributed foreign earnings were repatriated, the dividends may be subject to taxation in the United States but the tax is not expected to be material.\nRevenue Recognition - Unbilled Revenue\nRevenue recognized is equal to what the Company has the right to invoice as it corresponds directly with the value to the customer of the Company's performance to date and includes billed and unbilled amounts. The determination of customer invoices is based on a systematic reading of meters, fixed reservation charges based on contractual quantities and rates or, in the case of the Great Britain distribution businesses, when information is received from the national settlement system. At the end of each month, energy provided to customers since the date of the last meter reading is estimated, and the corresponding unbilled revenue is recorded. Unbilled revenue was $718 million as of December 31, 2021. Factors that can impact the estimate of unbilled energy include, but are not limited to, seasonal weather patterns, total volumes supplied to the system, line losses, economic impacts and composition of sales among customer classes. Unbilled revenue is reversed in the following month and billed revenue is recorded based on the subsequent meter readings.", "item_7_text": "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThe following is management's discussion and analysis of certain significant factors that have affected the consolidated financial condition and results of operations of the Company during the periods included herein. Explanations include management's best estimate of the impact of weather, customer growth, usage trends and other factors. This discussion should be read in conjunction with the Company's historical Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Form 10-K. The Company's actual results in the future could differ significantly from the historical results.\nThe reportable segment financial information includes all necessary adjustments and eliminations needed to conform to the Company's significant accounting policies. The differences between the reportable segment amounts and the consolidated amounts, described as BHE and Other, relate principally to other entities, including MES, corporate functions and intersegment eliminations.\nResults of Operations\nOverview\nOperating revenue and earnings on common shares for the Company's reportable segments for the years ended December 31 are summarized as follows (in millions):\n\n(1)Includes the tax attributes of disregarded entities that are not required to pay income taxes and the earnings of which are taxable directly to BHE.\n* Not meaningful.\nEarnings on common shares decreased $1,248 million for 2021 compared to 2020. Included in these results was a pre-tax unrealized gain in 2021 of $1,796 million ($1,777 million after-tax) compared to a pre-tax unrealized gain in 2020 of $4,774 million ($3,470 million after-tax) on the Company's investment in BYD Company Limited. Excluding the impact of this item, adjusted earnings on common shares in 2021 was $3,892 million, an increase of $445 million, or 13%, compared to adjusted earnings on common shares in 2020 of $3,447 million.\nThe decrease in net income attributable to BHE shareholders for 2021 compared to 2020 was primarily due to:\n\u2022The Utilities' earnings increased $242 million reflecting higher electric utility margin, favorable income tax expense, from higher PTCs recognized of $139 million and the impacts of ratemaking, and lower operations and maintenance expense, partially offset by higher depreciation and amortization expense. Electric retail customer volumes increased 3.8% for 2021 compared to 2020, primarily due to higher customer usage, an increase in the average number of customers and the favorable impact of weather;\n\u2022Northern Powergrid's earnings increased $46 million, primarily due to higher distribution performance, lower write-offs of gas exploration costs and $16 million from the weaker United States dollar, partially offset by the comparative unfavorable impact of deferred income tax charges ($109 million in second quarter 2021 and $35 million in third quarter 2020) related to enacted increases in the United Kingdom corporate income tax rate;\n\u2022BHE Pipeline Group's earnings increased $279 million, primarily due to $244 million of incremental earnings at BHE GT&S;\n\u2022BHE Renewables' earnings decreased $70 million, primarily due to lower tax equity investment earnings from the February 2021 polar vortex weather event, partially offset by earnings from tax equity investment projects reaching commercial operation and higher operating performance from owned renewable energy projects; and\n\u2022BHE and Other's earnings decreased $1,773 million, primarily due to the $1,693 million change in the after-tax unrealized position of the Company's investment in BYD Company Limited and $95 million of higher dividends on BHE's 4.00% Perpetual Preferred Stock issued in October 2020, partially offset by favorable comparative consolidated state income tax benefits.\nEarnings on common shares increased $3,967 million for 2020 compared to 2019. Included in these results was a pre-tax unrealized gain in 2020 of $4,774 million ($3,470 million after-tax) compared to a pre-tax unrealized loss in 2019 of $313 million ($227 million after-tax) on the Company's investment in BYD Company Limited. Excluding the impact of this item, adjusted earnings on common shares in 2020 was $3,447 million, an increase of $270 million, or 9%, compared to adjusted earnings on common shares in 2019 of $3,177 million.\nThe increase in earnings on common shares for 2020 compared to 2019 was primarily due to:\n\u2022The Utilities' earnings increased $50 million with favorable performance at all four utilities (electric retail customer volumes increased 0.1%), including $193 million of higher PTCs recognized, offset by a comparative increase in wildfire and other storm restoration costs, primarily at PacifiCorp;\n\u2022Northern Powergrid's earnings decreased $55 million, mainly due to a deferred income tax charge in 2020 from an enacted increase in the United Kingdom corporate income tax rate;\n\u2022BHE Pipeline Group's earnings increased $106 million, primarily due to $73 million of incremental earnings at BHE GT&S and a favorable rate case settlement at Northern Natural Gas;\n\u2022BHE Renewables' earnings increased $90 million, primarily due to increased income tax benefits from renewable wind tax equity investments, largely from projects reaching commercial operation, offset by lower earnings from geothermal and natural gas facilities;\n\u2022HomeServices' earnings increased $215 million, primarily due to higher earnings from mortgage services (71% increase in funded mortgage volume) and brokerage services (13% increase in closed transaction volume) largely attributable to the favorable interest rate environment; and\n\u2022BHE and Other's earnings increased $3,559 million, primarily due to the $3,697 million change in the after-tax unrealized position of the Company's investment in BYD Company Limited offset by higher BHE corporate interest expense and unfavorable comparative consolidated state income tax benefits.\nReportable Segment Results\nPacifiCorp\nOperating revenue decreased $45 million for 2021 compared to 2020, primarily due to lower retail revenue of $98 million, partially offset by higher wholesale and other revenue of $53 million. Retail revenue decreased mainly due to $234 million from the Utah and Oregon general rate case orders issued in 2020 (fully offset in expense, primarily depreciation) and price impacts of $41 million from lower rates primarily due to certain general rate case orders, partially offset by higher customer volumes of $177 million. Retail customer volumes increased 3.1%, primarily due to higher customer usage, an increase in the average number of customers and the favorable impact of weather. Wholesale and other revenue increased mainly due to higher wheeling revenue, average wholesale prices and REC sales, partially offset by $34 million from the Oregon RAC settlement (fully offset in depreciation expense) recognized in 2020.\nEarnings increased $148 million for 2021 compared to 2020, primarily due to favorable income tax expense from higher PTCs recognized of $75 million from new wind-powered generating facilities placed in-service, and the impacts of ratemaking, lower operations and maintenance expense of $178 million and higher utility margin of $145 million, partially offset by higher depreciation and amortization expense of $255 million and lower allowances for equity and borrowed funds used during construction of $72 million. Operations and maintenance expense decreased primarily due to lower costs associated with wildfires and the Klamath Hydroelectric Settlement Agreement and lower thermal plant maintenance expense, partially offset by higher costs associated with additional wind-powered generating facilities placed in-service as well as higher distribution maintenance costs. Utility margin increased primarily due to the higher retail customer volumes, higher wheeling and wholesale revenue and higher deferred net power costs in accordance with established adjustment mechanisms, partially offset by higher purchased power and thermal generation costs, the price impacts from lower retail rates and higher wheeling expenses. The increase in depreciation and amortization expense was primarily due to the impacts of a depreciation study effective January 1, 2021, as well as additional assets placed in-service.\nOperating revenue increased $273 million for 2020 compared to 2019, primarily due to higher retail revenue of $250 million and higher wholesale and other revenue of $23 million. Retail revenue increased primarily due to $234 million from the amortization of certain existing regulatory balances to offset the accelerated depreciation of certain property, plant and equipment and the accelerated amortization of certain regulatory asset balances in relation to Utah and Oregon general rate case orders issued in December 2020. The increase in retail revenue was also due to price impacts of $49 million from changes in sales mix, partially offset by lower customer volumes of $34 million. The increase in wholesale and other revenue was mainly due to $34 million from the amortization of certain existing regulatory balances in Oregon to offset the accelerated depreciation of certain retired wind equipment, partially offset by lower wholesale volumes. Retail customer volumes decreased 1.4% primarily due to the impacts of COVID-19, which resulted in lower industrial and commercial customer usage and higher residential customer usage, partially offset by an increase in the average number of residential and commercial customers and the favorable impact of weather.\nEarnings decreased $32 million for 2020 compared to 2019, primarily due to an increase in operations and maintenance expense due to higher costs associated with wildfires and the Klamath Hydroelectric Settlement Agreement of $169 million, higher interest expense of $25 million from higher long-term debt balances, higher pension and other postretirement costs of $13 million, lower interest income from lower average interest rates and higher property taxes of $10 million, partially offset by lower tax expense from higher PTCs recognized of $62 million from repowered and new wind-powered generating facilities, higher utility margin of $47 million and higher allowances for equity and borrowed funds used during construction of $38 million. Utility margin increased primarily due to lower coal-fueled and natural gas-fueled generation costs, lower purchased power costs and price impacts from changes in sales mix, partially offset by lower net deferrals of incurred net power costs in accordance with established adjustment mechanisms and lower retail customer volumes.\nMidAmerican Funding\nOperating revenue increased $819 million for 2021 compared to 2020, primarily due to higher natural gas operating revenue of $430 million and higher electric operating revenue of $390 million. Natural gas operating revenue increased due to a higher average per-unit cost of natural gas sold resulting in higher purchased gas adjustment recoveries of $440 million (fully offset in cost of sales), largely due to the February 2021 polar vortex weather event. Electric operating revenue increased due to higher retail revenue of $198 million and higher wholesale and other revenue of $192 million. Electric retail revenue increased primarily due to higher recoveries through adjustment clauses of $116 million (fully offset in expense, primarily cost of sales), higher customer volumes of $63 million and price impacts of $19 million from changes in sales mix. Electric retail customer volumes increased 5.8% due to increased usage of certain industrial customers and the favorable impact of weather. Electric wholesale and other revenue increased primarily due to higher average wholesale prices of $116 million and higher wholesale volumes of $71 million.\nEarnings increased $65 million for 2021 compared to 2020, primarily due to higher electric utility margin of $190 million and a favorable income tax benefit, partially offset by higher depreciation and amortization expense of $198 million, higher operations and maintenance expense of $20 million and lower allowances for equity and borrowed funds of $8 million. Electric utility margin increased primarily due to the higher retail and wholesale revenues, partially offset by higher thermal generation and purchased power costs. The favorable income tax benefit was largely due to higher PTCs recognized of $64 million, from new wind-powered generating facilities placed in-service, partially offset by state income tax impacts. The increase in depreciation and amortization expense was primarily due to the impacts of certain regulatory mechanisms and additional assets placed in-service. Operations and maintenance expense increased primarily due to higher costs associated with additional wind-powered generating facilities placed in-service and higher natural gas distribution costs, partially offset by 2020 costs associated with storm restoration activities.\nOperating revenue decreased $199 million for 2020 compared to 2019, primarily due to lower natural gas operating revenue of $77 million, lower electric operating revenue of $70 million, lower electric and natural gas energy efficiency program revenue of $38 million (fully offset in operations and maintenance expense) and lower other revenue of $14 million, primarily from nonregulated utility construction services. Natural gas operating revenue decreased primarily due to lower volumes and a lower average per-unit cost of natural gas sold resulting in lower purchased gas adjustment recoveries of $68 million (fully offset in cost of sales) and a 10.2% decrease in retail customer volumes, primarily due to the unfavorable impact of weather. Electric operating revenue decreased due to lower wholesale and other revenue of $88 million, partially offset by higher retail revenue of $18 million. Electric wholesale and other revenue decreased mainly due to lower average wholesale prices of $115 million, partially offset by higher wholesale volumes of $28 million. Electric retail revenue increased primarily due to higher customer usage of $38 million, partially offset by price impacts of $18 million from changes in sales mix. Electric retail customer volumes increased 1.2% due to increased usage for certain industrial customers, partially offset by the impacts of COVID-19, which resulted in lower commercial and industrial customer usage and higher residential customer usage.\nEarnings increased $37 million for 2020 compared to 2019, primarily due to higher income tax benefit of $197 million from higher PTCs recognized of $132 million and the favorable impacts of ratemaking, partially offset by higher depreciation and amortization expense of $77 million due to additional assets placed in-service (offset by $23 million of lower Iowa revenue sharing accruals), lower allowances for equity and borrowed funds used during construction of $45 million, higher interest expense of $20 million and lower electric and natural gas utility margins. PTCs recognized increased due to higher wind-powered generation driven primarily by repowering and new wind projects placed in-service. Electric utility margin decreased due to lower wholesale revenue and the price impacts from changes in sales mix, partially offset by lower generation costs from higher wind generation and higher retail customer volumes. Natural gas utility margin decreased primarily due to lower retail customer volumes primarily due to the unfavorable impact of weather.\nNV Energy\nOperating revenue increased $253 million for 2021 compared to 2020, primarily due to higher electric operating revenue of $252 million. Electric operating revenue increased primarily due to higher fully-bundled energy rates (fully offset in cost of sales) of $229 million, a $120 million one-time bill credit in the fourth quarter of 2020 resulting from a regulatory rate review decision (fully offset in operations and maintenance and income tax expenses) and higher retail customer volumes of $10 million, partially offset by lower base tariff general rates of $71 million at Nevada Power and a favorable regulatory decision in 2020. Electric retail customer volumes increased 3.3%, primarily due to an increase in the average number of customers, higher customer usage and the favorable impact of weather.\nEarnings increased $29 million for 2021 compared to 2020, primarily due to lower operations and maintenance expense of $90 million, lower income tax expense mainly from the impacts of ratemaking, lower interest expense of $21 million, higher interest and dividend income of $16 million and lower pension expense of $10 million, partially offset by lower electric utility margin of $97 million and higher depreciation and amortization expense of $47 million. Operations and maintenance expense decreased primarily due to lower regulatory deferrals and amortizations and lower earnings sharing at the Nevada Utilities. Electric utility margin decreased primarily due to lower base tariff general rates at Nevada Power and a favorable regulatory decision in 2020, partially offset by higher retail customer volumes. The increase in depreciation and amortization expense was mainly due to the regulatory amortization of decommissioning costs and additional assets placed in-service.\nOperating revenue decreased $183 million for 2020 compared to 2019, primarily due to lower electric operating revenue. Electric operating revenue decreased primarily due to lower fully-bundled energy rates (fully offset in cost of sales) of $164 million and a $120 million one-time bill credit in the fourth quarter of 2020 resulting from a regulatory rate review decision (fully offset in operations and maintenance and income tax expenses), partially offset by higher retail customer volumes, price impacts from changes in sales mix and a favorable regulatory decision. Electric retail customer volumes, including distribution only service customers, increased 1.5%, primarily due to the favorable impact of weather, largely offset by the impacts of COVID-19, which resulted in lower industrial, distribution only service and commercial customer usage and higher residential customer usage.\nEarnings increased $45 million for 2020 compared to 2019, primarily due to higher electric utility margin of $100 million, lower pension and post-retirement costs of $9 million and lower income tax expense mainly from the favorable impacts of ratemaking, partially offset by an increase in operations and maintenance expense, mainly from higher earnings sharing accruals at the Nevada Utilities, and higher depreciation and amortization expense of $20 million, mainly from higher plant placed in-service. Electric utility margin increased primarily due to higher retail customer volumes, price impacts from changes in sales mix and a favorable regulatory decision.\nNorthern Powergrid\nOperating revenue increased $166 million for 2021 compared to 2020, primarily due to higher distribution revenue of $80 million, mainly from increased tariff rates of $40 million and a 3.2% increase in units distributed totaling $26 million, and $77 million from the weaker United States dollar.\nEarnings increased $46 million for 2021 compared to 2020, primarily due to the higher distribution revenue, lower write-offs of gas exploration costs of $36 million, $16 million from the weaker United States dollar, favorable pension expense of $14 million and lower interest expense of $8 million, partially offset by higher income tax expense and higher distribution-related operating and depreciation expenses of $29 million. Earnings in 2021 included a deferred income tax charge of $109 million related to a June 2021 enacted increase in the United Kingdom corporate income tax rate from 19% to 25% effective April 1, 2023, while earnings in 2020 included a deferred income tax charge of $35 million related to a July 2020 enacted increase in the United Kingdom corporate income tax rate from 17% to 19% effective April 1, 2020.\nOperating revenue increased $9 million for 2020 compared to 2019, primarily due to higher distribution revenue of $10 million from increased tariff rates of $40 million, partially offset by a 5.4% decrease in units distributed totaling $30 million largely due to the impacts of COVID-19.\nEarnings decreased $55 million for 2020 compared to 2019, primarily due to write-offs of gas exploration costs of $44 million, higher income tax expense of $37 million and higher distribution-related operating and depreciation expenses of $18 million, partially offset by higher distribution revenue, lower pension expense of $22 million, including lower pension settlement losses recognized in 2020 compared to 2019, and lower interest expense of $9 million. The increase in income tax expense is due to a change in the United Kingdom corporate income tax rate that resulted in a deferred income tax charge of $35 million.\nBHE Pipeline Group\nOperating revenue increased $1,966 million for 2021 compared to 2020, primarily due to $1,828 million of incremental revenue at BHE GT&S, acquired in November 2020, higher gas sales of $115 million ($38 million largely offset in costs of sales) at Northern Natural Gas and higher transportation revenue of $29 million at Kern River largely due to higher rates and volumes, partially offset by lower transportation revenue of $24 million at Northern Natural Gas primarily due to lower volumes. The variances in gas sales and transportation revenue at Northern Natural Gas included favorable impacts of $77 million and $49 million, respectively, from the February 2021 polar vortex weather event.\nEarnings increased $279 million for 2021 compared to 2020, primarily due to $244 million of incremental earnings at BHE GT&S, favorable earnings of $19 million at Kern River from the higher transportation revenue and higher earnings of $15 million at Northern Natural Gas, primarily due to higher gross margin on gas sales and higher transportation revenue, each due to the favorable impacts of the February 2021 polar vortex weather event, offset by the lower transportation revenue.\nOperating revenue increased $447 million for 2020 compared to 2019, primarily due to $331 million of incremental revenue at BHE GT&S, a favorable rate case settlement at Northern Natural Gas of $101 million and higher transportation revenue of $43 million, partially offset by lower gas sales at Northern Natural Gas of $23 million related to system balancing activities (largely offset in cost of sales).\nEarnings increased $106 million for 2020 compared to 2019, primarily due to $73 million of incremental earnings BHE GT&S, the higher transportation revenue, and a favorable after-tax, rate case settlement at Northern Natural Gas of $32 million, partially offset by higher property and other tax expense of $17 million, including a non-recurring property tax refund in 2019, higher depreciation and amortization expense of $13 million due to increased spending on capital projects and lower interest income of $9 million.\nBHE Transmission\nOperating revenue increased $72 million for 2021 compared to 2020, primarily due to $47 million from the stronger United States dollar, a regulatory decision received in November 2020 at AltaLink and higher revenue from the Montana-Alberta Tie Line of $11 million.\nEarnings increased $16 million for 2021 compared to 2020, primarily due to $12 million from the stronger United States dollar, higher earnings from the Montana-Alberta Tie Line and lower non-regulated interest expense at BHE Canada, partially offset by the impact of a regulatory decision received in April 2020 at AltaLink.\nOperating revenue decreased $48 million for 2020 compared to 2019, primarily due to a regulatory decision received in November 2020 at AltaLink and the stronger United States dollar of $7 million.\nEarnings increased $2 million for 2020 compared to 2019, primarily due to lower non-regulated interest expense at BHE Canada and higher net income at BHE U.S. Transmission of $6 million mainly due to improved equity earnings from ETT, partially offset by the impacts of regulatory decisions received in 2020 and 2019 at AltaLink.\nBHE Renewables\nOperating revenue increased $45 million for 2021 compared to 2020, primarily due to higher natural gas, solar, wind and hydro revenues from favorable market conditions and higher generation, partially offset by an unfavorable change in the valuation of a power purchase agreement of $30 million.\nEarnings decreased $70 million for 2021 compared to 2020, primarily due to lower wind earnings of $83 million, largely from lower tax equity investment earnings of $90 million, and lower hydro earnings of $10 million, mainly due to lower income from a declining financial asset balance, partially offset by higher solar earnings of $22 million, mainly due to the higher operating revenue and lower depreciation expense. Tax equity investment earnings decreased due to unfavorable results from existing tax equity investments of $165 million, primarily due to the February 2021 polar vortex weather event, and lower commitment fee income, partially offset by $87 million of earnings from projects reaching commercial operation.\nOperating revenue increased $4 million for 2020 compared to 2019, primarily due to higher natural gas, solar and hydro revenues of $21 million due to favorable generation, partially offset by an unfavorable change in the valuation of a power purchase agreement of $14 million and lower geothermal revenues of $4 million from lower pricing.\nEarnings increased $90 million for 2020 compared to 2019, primarily due to favorable wind tax equity investment earnings of $129 million, partially offset by lower geothermal earnings of $22 million, due to higher operations and maintenance expense and lower pricing, and lower natural gas earnings of $17 million, due to lower margins. Wind tax equity investment earnings improved due to $147 million of earnings from projects reaching commercial operation, partially offset by lower commitment fee income and lower earnings from existing tax equity investments of $6 million.\nHomeServices\nOperating revenue increased $819 million for 2021 compared to 2020, primarily due to higher brokerage revenue of $951 million, partially offset by lower mortgage revenue of $169 million from an 8% decrease in funded volume due to a decrease in refinance activity. The increase in brokerage revenue was due to a 21% increase in closed transaction volume at existing companies resulting from increases in average sales price and closed units.\nEarnings increased $12 million for 2021 compared to 2020, primarily due to higher earnings from brokerage and franchise services of $81 million, largely attributable to the increase in closed transaction volume at existing companies, partially offset by lower earnings from mortgage services of $68 million from the decrease in refinance activity.\nOperating revenue increased $923 million for 2020 compared to 2019, primarily due to higher brokerage revenue of $440 million from a 13% increase in closed transaction volume and higher mortgage revenue of $423 million from a 71% increase in funded mortgage volume due to an increase in refinance activity.\nEarnings increased $215 million for 2020 compared to 2019, primarily due to higher earnings at mortgage services of $138 million and higher earnings at brokerage services largely attributable to the favorable interest rate environment.\nBHE and Other\nOperating revenue increased $103 million for 2021 compared to 2020, primarily due to higher electricity and natural gas sales revenue at MES, from favorable pricing offset by lower volumes.\nEarnings decreased $1,773 million for 2021 compared to 2020, primarily due to the $1,693 million change in the after-tax unrealized position of the Company's investment in BYD Company Limited, $95 million of higher dividends on BHE's 4.00% Perpetual Preferred Stock issued in October 2020, higher corporate costs and higher BHE corporate interest expense from debt issuances in March and October 2020, partially offset by favorable comparative consolidated state income tax benefits and higher earnings of $17 million at MES.\nOperating revenue decreased $118 million for 2020 compared to 2019, primarily due to lower electricity and natural gas sales revenue at MES, from lower volumes.\nEarnings increased $3,559 million for 2020 compared to 2019, primarily due to the $3,697 million change in the after-tax unrealized position of the Company's investment in BYD Company Limited, partially offset by higher BHE corporate interest expense from debt issuances in March and October 2020 and unfavorable comparative consolidated state income tax benefits.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nEach of BHE's direct and indirect subsidiaries is organized as a legal entity separate and apart from BHE and its other subsidiaries. It should not be assumed that the assets of any subsidiary will be available to satisfy BHE's obligations or the obligations of its other subsidiaries. However, unrestricted cash or other assets that are available for distribution may, subject to applicable law, regulatory commitments and the terms of financing and ring-fencing arrangements for such parties, be advanced, loaned, paid as dividends or otherwise distributed or contributed to BHE or affiliates thereof. The Company's long-term debt may include provisions that allow BHE or its subsidiaries to redeem such debt in whole or in part at any time. These provisions generally include make-whole premiums. Refer to Note 18 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Form 10-K for further discussion regarding the limitation of distributions from BHE's subsidiaries.\nAs of December 31, 2021, the Company's total net liquidity was as follows (in millions):\n\n(1) Includes drawn uncommitted credit facilities totaling $1 million at Northern Powergrid.\nRefer to Note 9 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Form 10-K for further discussion regarding the Company's credit facilities, letters of credit, equity commitments and other related items.\nOperating Activities\nNet cash flows from operating activities for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 were $8.7 billion and $6.2 billion, respectively. The increase was primarily due to $970 million of incremental net cash flows from operating activities at BHE GT&S, improved operating results and changes in working capital.\nNet cash flows from operating activities for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 were $6,224 million and $6,206 million, respectively. The increase was primarily due to an increase in income tax receipts and improved operating results, partially offset by changes in working capital.\nThe timing of the Company's income tax cash flows from period to period can be significantly affected by the estimated federal income tax payment methods selected and assumptions made for each payment date.\nInvesting Activities\nNet cash flows from investing activities for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 were $(5.8) billion and $(13.2) billion, respectively. The change was primarily due to lower funding of tax equity investments, lower cash paid for acquisitions and the July 2021 receipt of $1.3 billion due to the termination of the Q-Pipe Purchase Agreement. Refer to \"Future Uses of Cash\" for further discussion of capital expenditures.\nNet cash flows from investing activities for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 were $(13.2) billion and $(9.0) billion, respectively. The change was primarily due to higher cash paid for acquisitions and higher funding of tax equity investments, partially offset by lower capital expenditures of $599 million. Refer to \"Future Uses of Cash\" for further discussion of capital expenditures.\nNatural Gas Transmission and Storage Business Acquisition\nOn November 1, 2020, BHE completed its acquisition of substantially all of the natural gas transmission and storage business of DEI and Dominion Questar, exclusive of the Questar Pipeline Group (the \"GT&S Transaction\").

Accordingly, an amount is recorded on the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheets as an equity investment and is increased or decreased for the Company's pro-rata share of earnings or losses, respectively, less any dividends from such investments. Certain equity investments are presented on the Consolidated Balance Sheets net of investment tax credits.\nAs of December 31, 2021, the Company's investments that are accounted for under the equity method had short- and long-term debt of $2.7 billion, unused revolving credit facilities of $200 million and letters of credit outstanding of $88 million. As of December 31, 2021, the Company's pro-rata share of such short- and long-term debt was $1.3 billion, unused revolving credit facilities was $100 million and outstanding letters of credit was $43 million. The entire amount of the Company's pro-rata share of the outstanding short- and long-term debt and unused revolving credit facilities is non-recourse to the Company. The entire amount of the Company's pro-rata share of the outstanding letters of credit is recourse to the Company. Although the Company is generally not required to support debt service obligations of its equity investees, default with respect to this non-recourse short- and long-term debt could result in a loss of invested equity.\nMaterial Cash Requirements\nThe Company has cash requirements that may affect its consolidated financial condition that arise primarily from long- and short-term debt (refer to Note 9, 10 and 11), operating and financing leases (refer to Note 6), firm commitments (refer to Note 16), letters of credit (refer to Note 9), construction and other development costs (refer to Liquidity and Capital Resources included within this Item 7), uncertain tax positions (refer to Note 12) and AROs (refer to Note 14). Refer, where applicable, to the respective referenced note in Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Form 10-K for additional information.\nThe Company has cash requirements relating to interest payments of $32.4 billion on long-term debt, including $2.1 billion due in 2022.\nAdditionally, the Company has invested in wind projects sponsored by third parties, commonly referred to as tax equity investments. Under the terms of these tax equity investments, the Company has entered into equity capital contribution agreements with the project sponsors that require contributions. The Company has made contributions of $- million, $2,736 million and $1,619 million in 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively, and has commitments as of December 31, 2021, subject to satisfaction of certain specified conditions, to provide equity contributions of $356 million in 2022 pursuant to these equity capital contribution agreements as the various projects achieve commercial operation. However, the Company expects to assign its rights and obligations under these equity capital contribution agreements, including any related funding commitments, to an entity affiliated through common ownership. Once a project achieves commercial operation, the Company enters into a partnership agreement with the project sponsor that directs and allocates the operating profits and tax benefits from the project.\nRegulatory Matters\nThe Company is subject to comprehensive regulation. Refer to the discussion contained in Item 1 of this Form 10-K for further information regarding the Company's general regulatory framework and current regulatory matters.\nQuad Cities Generating Station Operating Status\nConstellation Energy Corp. (\"Constellation Energy,\" previously Exelon Generation Company, LLC, which was a subsidiary of Exelon Corporation prior to February 1, 2022), the operator of Quad Cities Generating Station Units 1 and 2 (\"Quad Cities Station\") of which MidAmerican Energy has a 25% ownership interest, announced on June 2, 2016, its intention to shut down Quad Cities Station on June 1, 2018. In December 2016, Illinois passed legislation creating a zero emission standard, which went into effect June 1, 2017. The zero emission standard requires the Illinois Power Agency to purchase ZECs and recover the costs from certain ratepayers in Illinois, subject to certain limitations. The proceeds from the ZECs will provide Constellation Energy additional revenue through 2027 as an incentive for continued operation of Quad Cities Station. MidAmerican Energy will not receive additional revenue from the subsidy.\nThe PJM Interconnection, L.L.C. (\"PJM\") capacity market includes a Minimum Offer Price Rule (\"MOPR\"). If a generation resource is subjected to a MOPR, its offer price in the market is adjusted to effectively remove the revenues it receives through a state government-provided financial support program, resulting in a higher offer that may not clear the capacity market. Prior to December 19, 2019, the PJM MOPR applied only to certain new gas-fired resources. An expanded PJM MOPR to include existing resources would require exclusion of ZEC compensation when bidding into future capacity auctions, resulting in an increased risk of Quad Cities Station not receiving capacity revenues in future auctions.\nOn December 19, 2019, the FERC issued an order requiring the PJM to broadly apply the MOPR to all new and existing resources, including nuclear. This greatly expanded the breadth and scope of the PJM's MOPR, which became effective as of the PJM's capacity auction for the 2022-2023 planning year in May 2021. While the FERC included some limited exemptions, no exemptions were available to state-supported nuclear resources, such as Quad Cities Station. The FERC provided no new mechanism for accommodating state-supported resources other than the existing Fixed Resource Requirement (\"FRR\") mechanism under which an entire utility zone would be removed from PJM's capacity auction along with sufficient resources to support the load in such zone. In response to the FERC's order, the PJM submitted a compliance filing on March 18, 2020, wherein the PJM proposed tariff language reflecting the FERC's directives and a schedule for resuming capacity auctions. On April 16, 2020, the FERC issued an order largely denying requests for rehearing of the FERC's December 2019 order but granting a few clarifications that required an additional PJM compliance filing, which the PJM submitted on June 1, 2020. A number of parties, including Constellation Energy, have filed petitions for review of the FERC's orders in this proceeding, which remain pending before the D.C. Circuit.\nAs a result, the MOPR applied to Quad Cities Station in the capacity auction for the 2022-2023 planning year, which prevented Quad Cities Station from clearing in that capacity auction.\nAt the direction of the PJM Board of Managers, the PJM and its stakeholders developed further MOPR reforms to ensure that the capacity market rules respect and accommodate state resource preferences such as the ZEC programs. The PJM filed related tariff revisions at the FERC on July 30, 2021, and, on September 29, 2021, the PJM's proposed MOPR reforms became effective by operation of law. Under the new tariff provisions, the MOPR will no longer apply to Quad Cities Station. Requests for rehearing of the FERC's notice establishing the effective date for the PJM's proposed market reforms were filed in October 2021 and denied by operation of law on November 4, 2021. Several parties have filed petitions for review of the FERC's orders in this proceeding, which remain pending before the Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit. Constellation Energy is strenuously opposing these appeals.\nAssuming the continued effectiveness of the Illinois zero emission standard, Constellation Energy no longer considers Quad Cities Station to be at heightened risk for early retirement. However, to the extent the Illinois zero emission standard does not operate as expected over its full term, Quad Cities Station would be at heightened risk for early retirement. The FERC's December 19, 2019 order on the PJM MOPR may undermine the continued effectiveness of the Illinois zero emission standard unless the PJM adopts further changes to the MOPR or Illinois implements an FRR mechanism, under which Quad Cities Station would be removed from the PJM's capacity auction.\nEnvironmental Laws and Regulations\nThe Company is subject to federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations regarding climate change, RPS, air and water quality, emissions performance standards, coal combustion byproduct disposal, hazardous and solid waste disposal, protected species and other environmental matters that have the potential to impact its current and future operations. In addition to imposing continuing compliance obligations and capital expenditure requirements, these laws and regulations provide regulators with the authority to levy substantial penalties for noncompliance, including fines, injunctive relief and other sanctions. These laws and regulations are administered by various federal, state, local and international agencies. The Company believes it is in material compliance with all applicable laws and regulations, although many laws and regulations are subject to interpretation that may ultimately be resolved by the courts. Refer to \"Environmental Laws and Regulations\" in Item 1 of this Form 10-K for further discussion regarding environmental laws and regulations.\nCollateral and Contingent Features\nDebt of BHE and debt and preferred securities of certain of its subsidiaries are rated by credit rating agencies. Assigned credit ratings are based on each rating agency's assessment of the rated company's ability to, in general, meet the obligations of its issued debt or preferred securities. The credit ratings are not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold securities, and there is no assurance that a particular credit rating will continue for any given period of time.\nBHE and its subsidiaries have no credit rating downgrade triggers that would accelerate the maturity dates of outstanding debt, and a change in ratings is not an event of default under the applicable debt instruments. The Company's unsecured revolving credit facilities do not require the maintenance of a minimum credit rating level in order to draw upon their availability. However, commitment fees and interest rates under the credit facilities are tied to credit ratings and increase or decrease when the ratings change. A ratings downgrade could also increase the future cost of commercial paper, short- and long-term debt issuances or new credit facilities.\nIn accordance with industry practice, certain wholesale agreements, including derivative contracts, contain credit support provisions that in part base certain collateral requirements on credit ratings for senior unsecured debt as reported by one or more of the recognized credit rating agencies. These agreements may either specifically provide bilateral rights to demand cash or other security if credit exposures on a net basis exceed specified rating-dependent threshold levels (\"credit-risk-related contingent features\") or provide the right for counterparties to demand \"adequate assurance,\" or in some cases terminate the contract, in the event of a material adverse change in creditworthiness. These rights can vary by contract and by counterparty. As of December 31, 2021, the applicable entities' credit ratings from the recognized credit rating agencies were investment grade. If all credit-risk-related contingent features or adequate assurance provisions for these agreements had been triggered as of December 31, 2021, the Company would have been required to post $460 million of additional collateral. The Company's collateral requirements could fluctuate considerably due to market price volatility, changes in credit ratings, changes in legislation or regulation, or other factors.\nInflation\nHistorically, overall inflation and changing prices in the economies where BHE's subsidiaries operate have not had a significant impact on the Company's consolidated financial results. In the United States and Canada, the Regulated Businesses operate under cost-of-service based rate structures administered by various state and provincial commissions and the FERC. Under these rate structures, the Regulated Businesses are allowed to include prudent costs in their rates, including the impact of inflation. The price control formula used by the Northern Powergrid Distribution Companies incorporates the rate of inflation in determining rates charged to customers. BHE's subsidiaries attempt to minimize the potential impact of inflation on their operations through the use of fuel, energy and other cost adjustment clauses and bill riders, by employing prudent risk management and hedging strategies and by considering, among other areas, its impact on purchases of energy, operating expenses, materials and equipment costs, contract negotiations, future capital spending programs and long-term debt issuances. There can be no assurance that such actions will be successful.\nCritical Accounting Estimates\nCertain accounting measurements require management to make estimates and judgments concerning transactions that will be settled several years in the future. Amounts recognized on the Consolidated Financial Statements based on such estimates involve numerous assumptions subject to varying and potentially significant degrees of judgment and uncertainty and will likely change in the future as additional information becomes available. The following critical accounting estimates are impacted significantly by the Company's methods, judgments and assumptions used in the preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements and should be read in conjunction with the Company's Summary of Significant Accounting Policies included in Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Form 10-K.\nAccounting for the Effects of Certain Types of Regulation\nThe Regulated Businesses prepare their financial statements in accordance with authoritative guidance for regulated operations, which recognizes the economic effects of regulation. Accordingly, the Regulated Businesses defer the recognition of certain costs or income if it is probable that, through the ratemaking process, there will be a corresponding increase or decrease in future regulated rates. Regulatory assets and liabilities are established to reflect the impacts of these deferrals, which will be recognized in earnings in the periods the corresponding changes in regulated rates occur.\nThe Company continually evaluates the applicability of the guidance for regulated operations and whether its regulatory assets and liabilities are probable of inclusion in future regulated rates by considering factors such as a change in the regulator's approach to setting rates from cost-based ratemaking to another form of regulation, other regulatory actions or the impact of competition that could limit the Regulated Businesses' ability to recover their costs. The Company believes the application of the guidance for regulated operations is appropriate and its existing regulatory assets and liabilities are probable of inclusion in future regulated rates. The evaluation reflects the current political and regulatory climate at the federal, state and provincial levels. If it becomes no longer probable that the deferred costs or income will be included in future regulated rates, the related regulatory assets and liabilities will be recognized in net income, returned to customers or re-established as AOCI. Total regulatory assets were $4.0 billion and total regulatory liabilities were $7.2 billion as of December 31, 2021. Refer to Note 7 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Form 10-K for additional information regarding the Regulated Businesses' regulatory assets and liabilities.\nImpairment of Goodwill and Long-Lived Assets\nThe Company's Consolidated Balance Sheet as of December 31, 2021 includes goodwill of acquired businesses of $11.7 billion. The Company evaluates goodwill for impairment at least annually and completed its annual review as of October 31. Additionally, no indicators of impairment were identified as of December 31, 2021. Significant judgment is required in estimating the fair value of the reporting unit and performing goodwill impairment tests. The Company uses a variety of methods to estimate a reporting unit's fair value, principally discounted projected future net cash flows. Key assumptions used include, but are not limited to, the use of estimated future cash flows; multiples of earnings or rate base; and an appropriate discount rate. Estimated future cash flows are impacted by, among other factors, growth rates, changes in regulations and rates, ability to renew contracts and estimates of future commodity prices. In estimating future cash flows, the Company incorporates current market information, as well as historical factors.\nThe Company evaluates long-lived assets for impairment, including property, plant and equipment, when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of such assets may not be recoverable or when the assets are being held for sale. Upon the occurrence of a triggering event, the asset is reviewed to assess whether the estimated undiscounted cash flows expected from the use of the asset plus the residual value from the ultimate disposal exceeds the carrying value of the asset. If the carrying value exceeds the estimated recoverable amounts, the asset is written down to the estimated fair value and any resulting impairment loss is reflected on the Consolidated Statements of Operations. As substantially all property, plant and equipment is used in regulated businesses, the impacts of regulation are considered when evaluating the carrying value of regulated assets.\nThe estimate of cash flows arising from the future use of the asset that are used in the impairment analysis requires judgment regarding what the Company would expect to recover from the future use of the asset. Changes in judgment that could significantly alter the calculation of the fair value or the recoverable amount of the asset may result from significant changes in the regulatory environment, the business climate, management's plans, legal factors, market price of the asset, the use of the asset or the physical condition of the asset, future market prices, load growth, competition and many other factors over the life of the asset. Any resulting impairment loss is highly dependent on the underlying assumptions and could significantly affect the Company's results of operations.\nPension and Other Postretirement Benefits\nCertain of the Company's subsidiaries sponsor defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans that cover the majority of employees. The Company recognizes the funded status of the defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Funded status is the fair value of plan assets minus the benefit obligation as of the measurement date. As of December 31, 2021, the Company recognized a net asset totaling $433 million for the funded status of the defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans. As of December 31, 2021, amounts not yet recognized as a component of net periodic benefit cost that were included in net regulatory assets totaled $297 million and in AOCI totaled $428 million.\nThe expense and benefit obligations relating to these defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans are based on actuarial valuations. Inherent in these valuations are key assumptions, including discount rates, expected long-term rate of return on plan assets and healthcare cost trend rates. These key assumptions are reviewed annually and modified as appropriate. The Company believes that the assumptions utilized in recording obligations under the plans are reasonable based on prior plan experience and current market and economic conditions. Refer to Note 13 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Form 10-K for disclosures about the defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans, including the key assumptions used to calculate the funded status and net periodic benefit cost for these plans as of and for the year ended December 31, 2021.\nThe Company chooses a discount rate based upon high quality debt security investment yields in effect as of the measurement date that corresponds to the expected benefit period. The pension and other postretirement benefit liabilities increase as the discount rate is reduced.\nIn establishing its assumption as to the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets, the Company utilizes the expected asset allocation and return assumptions for each asset class based on historical performance and forward-looking views of the financial markets. Pension and other postretirement benefits expense increases as the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets decreases. The Company regularly reviews its actual asset allocations and rebalances its investments to its targeted allocations when considered appropriate.\nThe Company chooses a healthcare cost trend rate that reflects the near and long-term expectations of increases in medical costs and corresponds to the expected benefit payment periods. The healthcare cost trend rate is assumed to gradually decline to 5.00% by 2025, at which point the rate of increase is assumed to remain constant.\nThe key assumptions used may differ materially from period to period due to changing market and economic conditions. These differences may result in a significant impact to pension and other postretirement benefits expense and the funded status. If changes were to occur for the following key assumptions, the approximate effect on the Consolidated Financial Statements would be as follows (dollars in millions):\n\nA variety of factors affect the funded status of the plans, including asset returns, discount rates, mortality assumptions, plan changes and the Company's funding policy for each plan.\nIncome Taxes\nIn determining the Company's income taxes, management is required to interpret complex income tax laws and regulations, which includes consideration of regulatory implications imposed by the Company's various regulatory commissions. The Company's income tax returns are subject to continuous examinations by federal, state, local and foreign income tax authorities that may give rise to different interpretations of these complex laws and regulations. Due to the nature of the examination process, it generally takes years before these examinations are completed and these matters are resolved. The Company recognizes the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more-likely-than-not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. The tax benefits recognized in the Consolidated Financial Statements from such a position are measured based on the largest benefit that is more-likely-than-not to be realized upon ultimate settlement. Although the ultimate resolution of the Company's federal, state, local and foreign income tax examinations is uncertain, the Company believes it has made adequate provisions for these income tax positions. The aggregate amount of any additional income tax liabilities that may result from these examinations, if any, is not expected to have a material impact on the Company's consolidated financial results. Refer to Note 12 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Form 10-K for additional information regarding the Company's income taxes.\nIt is probable the Company's regulated businesses will continue to pass income tax benefits and expense related to the federal tax rate change from 35% to 21% as a result of 2017 Tax Reform, certain property-related basis differences and other various differences on to their customers. As of December 31, 2021, these amounts were recognized as a net regulatory liability of $2.8 billion and will be included in regulated rates when the temporary differences reverse.\nThe Company has not established deferred income taxes on its undistributed foreign earnings that have been determined by management to be reinvested indefinitely; however, the Company periodically evaluates its capital requirements. If circumstances change in the future and a portion of the Company's undistributed foreign earnings were repatriated, the dividends may be subject to taxation in the United States but the tax is not expected to be material.\nRevenue Recognition - Unbilled Revenue\nRevenue recognized is equal to what the Company has the right to invoice as it corresponds directly with the value to the customer of the Company's performance to date and includes billed and unbilled amounts. The determination of customer invoices is based on a systematic reading of meters, fixed reservation charges based on contractual quantities and rates or, in the case of the Great Britain distribution businesses, when information is received from the national settlement system. At the end of each month, energy provided to customers since the date of the last meter reading is estimated, and the corresponding unbilled revenue is recorded. Unbilled revenue was $718 million as of December 31, 2021. Factors that can impact the estimate of unbilled energy include, but are not limited to, seasonal weather patterns, total volumes supplied to the system, line losses, economic impacts and composition of sales among customer classes. Unbilled revenue is reversed in the following month and billed revenue is recorded based on the subsequent meter readings.", "item_7_tables": "Table 43: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td>

" Here are the key points from the MD&A report:\n\n- Operating revenue for 2021 was $25.1 billion, up 20% from 2020. The increase was driven primarily by higher revenue at BHE Pipeline Group from the acquisition of BHE GT&S and higher revenue at HomeServices from higher brokerage volumes.\n\n- Earnings on common shares for 2021 were $5.7 billion, down 18% from 2020. The decrease was mainly due to a lower unrealized gain on the Company's investment in BYD compared to 2020. Excluding this, adjusted earnings were up 13%.\n\n- The Company has significant capital expenditure plans, focused on areas like wind generation, electric distribution and transmission, and natural gas transmission. Total capital expenditures are forecast to be $7.6 billion in 2022 and $10.1 billion in 2023. \n\n- Key accounting estimates and judgments relate to regulatory accounting, impairment testing of goodwill and long-lived assets, assumptions used for pension and other postretirement benefits, income tax uncertainties, and unbilled revenue. \n\n- At December 31, 2021, the Company had $1.1 billion of cash and cash equivalents and $8.7 billion of available capacity on credit facilities, for total net liquidity of $9.8 billion.\n\nIn summary, the Company saw strong revenue growth in 2021 but earnings were impacted by lower gains on an investment. Looking ahead, the Company has sizable capital expenditure plans focused on key infrastructure."}
