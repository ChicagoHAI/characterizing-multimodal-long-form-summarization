Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nThe following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes appearing elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. As discussed in the section titled Note About Forward-Looking Statements,\u201d the following discussion and analysis contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties, as well as assumptions that, if they never materialize or prove incorrect, could cause our results to differ materially from those expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause or contribute to these differences include, but are not limited to, impacts on our business and general economic conditions due to the current COVID-19 pandemic, those identified below, those discussed in Note About Forward-Looking Statements\u201d and those discussed in the section titled Risk Factors\u201d under Part I, Item 1A in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nThis section of this Form 10-K generally discusses fiscal 2021 and 2020 items and year-to-year comparisons between fiscal 2021 and 2020. Discussions of fiscal 2019 items and year-to-year comparisons between fiscal 2020 and fiscal 2019 that are not included in this Form 10-K can be found in Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d in Part II, Item 7 of the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2020.\nOverview\nWe are a leading provider of Business Spend Management ( BSM\u201d) solutions. We offer a comprehensive, cloud-based BSM platform that has connected our customers with more than seven million suppliers globally. Our platform provides greater visibility into and control over how companies spend money, optimize supply chains, and manage liquidity. Using our platform, businesses are able to achieve real, measurable value and savings that drive their profitability.\nWe refer to the process companies use to purchase goods and services as business spend management and to the money that they manage with this process as spend under management. Our BSM platform delivers a broad range of capabilities that would typically require the purchase and use of multiple disparate point applications. The core of our platform consists of procurement, invoicing, expense management, and payment solutions that form the transactional engine for managing a company's business spend. In addition, our platform offers specialized modules targeted for power users, to help companies manage more technical and strategic areas of BSM, including areas such as strategic sourcing, contract management, contingent workforce, supplier risk management, supply chain design and planning, treasury management, and spend analysis.\nWe also provide purchasing programs, such as Coupa Advantage, which offers access to pre-negotiated discounts from various suppliers, and Source Together, which connects community members to engage in group sourcing events, allowing them to leverage pooled buying power to achieve better contracting terms and capture greater savings. Moreover, through our Coupa Open Business Network, suppliers of all sizes can list their goods and services, establish pricing, and interact with buyers electronically, thus significantly reducing paper, improving operating efficiencies, and reducing costs.\nWe offer access to our platform under a Software-as-a-Service ( SaaS\u201d) business model. At the time of initial deployment, our customers often make a set of common functions available to the majority of their licensed employees, as well as incremental modules for select employees and procurement specialists, whom we refer to as power users. Therefore, we are typically able to capture a majority of the expected annual recurring revenue opportunity at the inception of our customer relationships, rather than targeting specific power users at the outset of the customer relationship with the intention of expanding and capturing more annual recurring revenue at later stages of the customer relationship. Customers can rapidly implement our platform, with implementation periods typically ranging from a few weeks to several months. Customers also benefit from software updates that typically require little downtime.\nWe market and sell our solutions to a broad range of enterprises worldwide. We have a diverse, multi-national customer base spanning various sizes and industries and no significant customer concentration. No customer accounted for more than 10% of our total revenues for the years ended January 31, 2021, and 2020, respectively.\nWe market our platform primarily through a direct sales force and also benefit from leads driven by our partner ecosystem. Our initial contract terms are typically three years, although some customers commit for longer or shorter periods. The large majority of our customers pay annually, one year in advance. Our subscription fee includes access to our service, technical support and management of the hosting infrastructure. We generally recognize revenues from our subscription fees ratably over the contractual term of the arrangement. We do not charge suppliers who are on our platform to transact with our customers. We believe this approach helps attract more suppliers to our platform and increases the value of our platform to customers.\nWe have continued to make significant expenditures and investments for long-term growth, including investment in our platform and infrastructure to deliver new functionality and modules to meet the evolving needs of our customers and to take advantage of our market opportunity. We intend to continue to increase our investment in sales and marketing, as we further expand our sales teams, increase our marketing activities, and grow our international operations. Internationally, we currently offer our platform in Europe, the Middle East and Africa, Latin America and Asia-Pacific, including Japan. The combined revenues from non-U.S. regions, as determined based on the billing address of our customers, constituted 38% and 36%, respectively, of our total revenues for the years ended January 31, 2021 and 2020. We believe there is further opportunity to increase our international revenues in absolute dollars and as a percentage of our total revenues. As a result, we are increasingly investing in our international operations and we intend to expand our footprint in international markets.\nOperating in international markets requires significant resources and management attention and will subject us to regulatory, economic and political risks that are different from those in the United States. While we are gaining additional experience with international operations, our international expansion efforts may not be successful in creating additional demand for our platform outside of the United States or in effectively selling subscriptions to our platform in any or all of the international markets we enter.\nIn late 2019, a novel strain of the coronavirus disease ( COVID-19\u201d) was identified in China, and in March 2020, the World Health Organization characterized the COVID-19 outbreak as a pandemic. The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in authorities implementing numerous measures to try to contain and mitigate the virus, including travel bans and restrictions, business shut-downs and limitations, quarantines, and shelter-in-place and social distancing orders.\nThe extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic may impact our financial condition or results of operations in future periods remains uncertain. The effect of the COVID-19 pandemic may not be fully reflected in our results of operations and overall financial performance until future periods. We may experience decreased customer demand, reduced customer spend, customer bankruptcies and other non-payment situations, shorter contract duration, longer sales cycles and extended payment terms, any of which could materially adversely impact our business, results of operations and overall financial performance in future periods. The extent and continued impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our operational and financial performance will depend in part on future developments and conditions, including the duration and spread of the outbreak; government responses to the pandemic; the impact on our customers and our sales cycles; extent of delays in hiring and onboarding new employees; and effect on our partners, vendors and supply chains, all of which are uncertain and difficult to predict. Additionally, due to concerns over the COVID-19 pandemic, we have replaced our in-person, annual Inspire conferences and other in-person marketing events with web-based alternatives. In the first quarter of fiscal 2021, we closed our offices globally and required our employees to work remotely. These changes remained in effect throughout the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021 and are expected to extend into future quarters. The impact, if any, of these and any additional operational changes we may implement is uncertain, but changes we have implemented to date have not materially impaired and are not expected to materially impair our ability to maintain operations, including financial reporting systems, internal control over financial reporting and disclosure controls and procedures. See the section Risk Factors\u201d for further discussion of the possible impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business.\nRecent Business Developments\nIn May 2020, we acquired all of the equity interest in ConnXus, Inc. ( ConnXus\u201d), a cloud-based supplier relationship management platform that enables enterprises, health systems and government agencies to monitor all aspects of their supplier diversity compliance programs. The purchase consideration was approximately $10.0 million in cash of which approximately $1.4 million is being held back by the Company for fifteen months after the transaction closing date.\nIn June 2020, we acquired all of the equity interest in Bellin Treasury International GmbH ( Bellin\u201d), a cloud-based treasury management software platform that improves visibility and control over cash and optimizes treasury processes. The purchase consideration was approximately $121.0 million, comprised of $79.1 million in cash (of which $8.0 million is being held in escrow for eighteen months after the transaction closing date) and 186,300 shares of our common stock with a fair value of approximately $41.8 million as of the transaction close date.\nIn June 2020, we issued $1,380.0 million aggregate principal amount of our 0.375% Convertible Senior Notes due 2026. In conjunction with the issuance of these notes, we purchased capped calls at a total price of $192.8 million. The net proceeds from the issuance of the 2026 Notes were $1,162.3 million, net of debt issuance costs, including the underwriting discount, and the cash used to purchase the capped call. In addition, we used proceeds of approximately $450.6 million from the 2026 Notes issuance to repurchase 2023 Notes in an aggregate principal amount of approximately $89.0 million.\nIn September 2020, we acquired all of the equity interest in Much-Net GmbH (\"Much-Net\"), a financial instrument software and service provider that specializes in risk management. The purchase consideration was approximately $4.3 million in cash, which is net of $1.8 million in cash acquired.\nIn November 2020, we completed the acquisition of Laurel Parent Holdings, Inc. and its subsidiaries (\"LLamasoft\"), a supply chain design and analysis software and solutions company. The acquisition strengthens Coupa's supply chain capabilities, enabling businesses to drive greater value through Business Spend Management. In connection with the acquisition, we issued approximately 2.4 million shares of our common stock and paid aggregate cash of approximately $791.5 million. Approximately $15.0 million of the cash paid is being held in escrow for fifteen months after the transaction closing date as security for the former LLamasoft stockholders' indemnification obligations, and approximately $7.5 million of the cash paid is being held in escrow until the completion of final adjustment on the purchase consideration.\nIn February 2021, we completed the acquisition of Pana Industries, Inc. (\"Pana\"), a corporate travel booking solution company that puts an emphasis on the traveler experience. In connection with the completion of the acquisition, we paid aggregate cash of approximately $48.5 million, and issued 23,822 shares of our common stock.\nOur Business Model\nOur business model focuses on maximizing the lifetime value of a customer relationship, and we continue to make significant investments in order to grow our customer base. Due to our subscription model, we recognize subscription revenues ratably over the term of the subscription period. As a result, the profitability of a customer to our business in any particular period depends in part upon how long a customer has been a subscriber on our platform. In general, the associated upfront costs with respect to new customers are higher in the first year than the aggregate revenues we recognize from those new customers in the first year. We believe that, over time, as our customer base grows and a relatively higher percentage of our subscription revenues are attributable to renewals versus new customers or upsells to existing customers, associated sales and marketing expenses and other allocated upfront costs as a percentage of revenues will decrease, subject to investments we plan to make in our business. Over the lifetime of the customer relationship, we also incur sales and marketing costs to manage the account, renew or upsell the customer to more modules and more users. However, these costs are significantly less than the costs initially incurred to acquire the customer. We calculate the lifetime value of our customers and associated customer acquisition costs for a particular year by comparing (i) gross profit from net new subscription revenues for the year multiplied by the inverse of the estimated subscription renewal rate to (ii) total sales and marketing expense incurred in the preceding year. On this basis, we estimate that for each of fiscal 2021 and 2020, the calculated lifetime value of our customers has exceeded six times the associated cost of acquiring them.\nKey Metrics\nWe review the following key metrics to evaluate our business, measure our performance, identify trends affecting our business, formulate business plans and make strategic decisions:\nTable 17: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>As of January 31, </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2021 </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cumulative spend under management (in billions) </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2,359.3 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,655.2 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,079.2 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Remaining performance obligations (in millions) </td> <td>$ </td> <td>952.3 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>724.9 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>498.6 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Deferred revenue (in millions) </td> <td>$ </td> <td>361.9 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>261.8 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>182.6 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Trailing twelve months calculated billings (in millions) </td> <td>$ </td> <td>641.7 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>468.9 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>314.9 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Customers with annualized subscription revenue above $100,000 </td> <td>1,082 </td> <td> </td> <td>813 </td> <td> </td> <td>602 </td> </tr>\n</table>\nCumulative Spend Under Management\nCumulative spend under management represents the aggregate dollar value of transactions through our core platform for all of our customers collectively since we launched our core platform. We define our core platform for purposes of this metric as our procurement, invoicing and expense management modules. We calculate this metric by aggregating the actual transaction data for purchase orders, invoices and expenses from customers using our core platform. Cumulative spend under management does not include spending data or transactions associated with modules from acquired companies. We regularly review our process for calculating this metric and periodically make adjustments to improve its accuracy. We believe that any such adjustments are immaterial unless otherwise stated.\nThe cumulative spend under management metric presented above does not directly correlate to our revenue or results of operations because we do not generally charge our customers based on actual usage of our core platform. However, we believe the cumulative spend under management metric does illustrate the adoption, scale and value of our platform, which we believe enhances our ability to maintain existing customers and attract new customers.\nRemaining Performance Obligations and Deferred Revenue\nRemaining performance obligations represents the amount of consideration allocated to unsatisfied performance obligations related to non-cancelable contracts, which include both the deferred revenue balance and amounts that will be invoiced and recognized as revenue in future periods. In calculating the remaining performance obligation amount, we elected to apply the two expedients under the revenue standard to exclude remaining performance obligations amounts related to contracts that are twelve months or less and contracts where revenue is being recognized under the as-invoiced method.\nWe generally execute multiple year subscription contracts for our platform and invoice an initial amount at contract signing followed by subsequent annual invoices. At any point in the contract term, there might be amounts that are not due for billing yet. These amounts are not recorded in our consolidated financial statements, and are considered to be part of the remaining performance obligations amount.\nThe remaining performance obligations amount is intended to provide visibility into future revenue streams. We expect remaining performance obligations to fluctuate up or down from period to period for several possible reasons, including amounts, timing, and duration of customer contracts (including changes that we may see to customer contracts as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic), as well as the timing of billing cycles for each order.\nOur deferred revenue consists of amounts that have been invoiced but not yet recognized as revenues as of the end of a reporting period. The majority of our deferred revenue balance consists of subscription revenues that are recognized ratably over the related contractual period.\nTrailing Twelve Months Calculated Billings\nTrailing twelve months calculated billings represents total revenues recognized during the period of consecutive twelve months ended January 31, 2021 and 2020 plus the change in deferred revenue for each of those same periods. Trailing twelve month calculated billings is comprised of subscription contracts with existing customers (including renewal contracts and add-on contracts), subscription contracts with new customers, and contracts for professional services, training and other revenues.\nThe trailing twelve months calculated billings is intended to provide information about our subscription revenue growth over time, and can typically be seen as an early indicator of trends in revenue growth. While trailing twelve months calculated billings can increase as our revenues grow, it may fluctuate up or down from period to period for several reasons, including amounts, timing, and duration of customer contracts (including changes that we may see to customer contracts as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic), as well as the timing of billing cycles for each order.\nCustomers with Annualized Subscription Revenue Above $100,000\nWe define customers with annualized subscription revenue above $100,000 as the total number of customers that contributed subscription revenues in excess of $25,000 during the relevant fiscal quarter, which corresponds to $100,000 on an annualized basis. For purposes of this metric, we generally define a customer as a separate and distinct entity (such as a company or an educational or government institution), a distinct business unit of a large corporation or a partner organization, in each case that has an active contract with us to access our services. Most of the subscription revenue we recognize each quarter is attributable to customers that accounted for more than $25,000 of that revenue during the quarter, and our sales and marketing strategy focuses heavily on the acquisition of customers that have the potential to contribute at least $100,000 in subscription revenues annually. Accordingly, we believe that this metric is a useful tool to aid investors in understanding a key factor that drives changes in our subscription revenues from period to period and in assessing trends in our growth, penetration of our core customer market, and our overall performance. Because the dollar threshold is tied to the actual revenue recognized during a particular quarter, customers that we acquired midway through or at the end of the quarter may not yet be included in this count, even if they have placed orders representing more than $100,000 in annual subscription revenue.\nComponents of Results of Operations\nRevenues\nWe primarily offer subscriptions to our cloud-based BSM platform, including procurement, invoicing and expense management and pay. We derive our revenues primarily from subscription fees and professional services fees.\nSubscription revenues consist primarily of fees to provide our customers access to our cloud-based platform, which includes routine customer support at no additional cost. Term-based licenses are sold as bundled arrangements that include the rights to a term license and post-contract customer support ( PCS\u201d). Accordingly, we allocate the transaction price to each performance obligation. The revenues related to the amount allocated to PCS are included in subscription revenue, which are recognized ratably over the contract term beginning on the license delivery date. Professional services fees and other include deployment services, optimization services, training, and revenues allocated to license component for the sales of term-based licenses. Subscription revenues are a function of renewal rates, the number of customers, the number of users at each customer, the number of modules subscribed to by each customer, and the price of our modules.\nGenerally, subscription fees are recognized ratably as revenues over the contract term beginning on the date the application is made available to the customer. Our new business subscriptions typically have a term of three years, although some customers commit for longer or shorter periods. We generally invoice our customers in annual installments at the beginning of each year in the subscription period. Amounts that have been invoiced are initially recorded as deferred revenue and are recognized ratably over the subscription period. Amounts that will be invoiced and recognized as revenue in future periods are reflected as remaining performance obligations within the notes to our consolidated financial statements.\nProfessional services revenues and other consist primarily of fees associated with the implementation and configuration of our subscription service and revenues allocated to the license component for sales of term-based licenses. Professional services are generally sold on a time-and-materials or fixed-fee basis. Revenue for both time-and-material and fixed-fee arrangements are recognized over-time as the services are performed. We have the ability to reasonably measure progress towards completion of the professional services arrangements. For fixed-fee arrangements, we recognize revenue on the basis of performed hours relative to the total estimated hours to complete satisfaction of the professional service arrangement. For the license component from the sales of term-based licenses, we recognize revenues at the start of the license term when delivery is complete.\nOur professional services engagements typically span from a few weeks to several months. For this reason, our professional services revenues may fluctuate significantly from period to period. The terms of our typical professional services arrangements provide that our customers pay us within 30 days from the invoice date. Fixed-fee services arrangements are generally invoiced in advance. We have made significant investments in our professional services business that are designed to ensure customer success and adoption of our platform. We are continuing to invest in expanding our professional services partner ecosystem to further support our customers. As the professional services practices of our partner firms continue to develop, we expect them to increasingly contract directly with our subscription customers and we incentivize our sales force to further this objective.\nCost of Revenues\nSubscription\nCost of subscription consists primarily of expenses related to hosting our service and providing customer support. Significant expenses are comprised of data center capacity costs; personnel and related costs directly associated with our cloud infrastructure and customer support, including salaries, benefits, bonuses and stock-based compensation; allocated overhead; and amortization of acquired developed technology and capitalized software development costs.\nProfessional Services and Other Cost of Revenues\nCost of professional services and other cost of revenues consist primarily of personnel and related costs directly associated with our professional services and training departments, including salaries, benefits, bonuses and stock-based compensation; the costs of contracted third-party vendors, amortization of acquired developed technology; and allocated overhead. These costs are generally expensed in the period incurred.\nProfessional services associated with the implementation and configuration of our subscription platform are performed directly by our services team, as well as by contracted third-party vendors. In cases in which third-party vendors invoice us for services performed for our customers, those fees are accrued over the requisite service period.\nOperating Expenses\nResearch and Development\nResearch and development expenses consist primarily of personnel costs of our development team, including salaries, benefits, bonuses, stock-based compensation expense and allocated overhead costs. Our cycle of frequent updates has facilitated rapid innovation and the introduction of new modules throughout our history. We have aggressively invested, and intend to continue to invest, in developing technology to support our growth. We capitalize certain software development costs that are attributable to developing new modules and features and adding incremental functionality to our platform, and we amortize such costs as costs of subscription revenues over the estimated life of the new application or incremental functionality, which is typically either two or three years.\nSales and Marketing\nSales and marketing expenses consist primarily of personnel and related costs directly associated with our sales and marketing staff, including salaries, benefits, bonuses, commissions and stock-based compensation. Commissions earned by our sales force that are considered incremental costs for obtaining a non-cancelable subscription contract are deferred and amortized over a period of benefit that we have determined to be five years. For commissions earned from the sale of term-based license contracts, we allocate the costs of commission in proportion to the allocation of transaction price of license and PCS performance obligations. Commissions associated with the license component are expensed at the time the related revenue is recognized. Commissions allocated to PCS are deferred and then amortized over five years. Other sales and marketing costs include promotional events to promote our brand, including our Inspire conferences, web advertising, events, allocated overhead and amortization of customer relationships and trademark.\nGeneral and Administrative\nGeneral and administrative expenses consist of personnel costs and related expenses for executive, finance, legal, human resources, recruiting, and administrative personnel, including salaries, benefits, bonuses and stock-based compensation expense; professional fees for external legal, accounting, recruiting and other consulting services and allocated overhead costs. During fiscal 2021, general and administrative expenses included a benefit of $12.5 million related to the reversal of the Yapta contingent consideration payable, as explained in Note 4, Business Combinations\u201d in the notes to our consolidated financial statements.\nInterest Expense\nInterest expense consists primarily of interest expense associated with our outstanding convertible senior notes.\nInterest Income and Other, Net\nInterest income and other, net consists primarily of interest income earned on our investments in marketable securities and cash and cash equivalents, and gain or loss on conversion of convertible senior notes, in addition to the effects of exchange rates on our foreign currency-denominated asset and liability balances which are recorded as foreign currency gains (losses) in the consolidated statements of operations.\nProvision for (Benefit from) Income Taxes\nProvision for income taxes consists primarily of income taxes related to foreign and state jurisdictions in which we conduct business. Benefit from income taxes is primarily related to the release of valuation allowances for deferred tax assets for the year ended January 31, 2021, partially offset by income taxes related to foreign and state jurisdictions. We maintain a full valuation allowance on net deferred tax assets of our U.S. and the majority of our international entities as we have concluded that it is not more likely than not that the deferred assets will be utilized.\nResults of Operations\nThe following tables set forth selected consolidated statements of operations data and such data as a percentage of total revenues for each of the

This increase in absolute dollars was predominantly driven by the increase in the number of customers with annualized subscription revenue above $100,000, which was 1,082 as of January 31, 2021, compared to 813 as of January 31, 2020. Professional services and other revenues were $71.3 million for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2021 compared to $44.5 million for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2020. The increase of $26.8 million, or 60%, was primarily due to an increase in implementation services as a result of our expanded customer base.\nWe will continue to monitor the COVID-19 pandemic carefully and its impact on our customers and customer acquisitions.\nCost of Revenues\nTable 20: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>For the year ended\nJanuary 31, </td> <td> </td> <td>% Change </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>2021 </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>(in thousands)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Subscription </td> <td>$ </td> <td>147,374 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>89,452 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>65 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Professional services and other </td> <td>74,327 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>49,764 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>49 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total cost of revenues </td> <td>$ </td> <td>221,701 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>139,216 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>59 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table>\nCost of subscription was $147.4 million for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2021 compared to $89.5 million for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2020, an increase of $57.9 million, or 65%. The increase in cost of subscription was primarily due to an increase of $18.4 million in hosting fees to accommodate increased customer spend, an increase of $18.4 million in amortization of developed technology assets related to acquisitions, an increase of $11.3 million in employee compensation costs related to higher headcount, including stock-based compensation costs, an increase of $5.0 million in license and subscription fees, an increase of $3.6 million in amortization of capitalized development costs, and a $1.2 million increase in other costs driven by our overall growth.\nCost of professional services was $74.3 million for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2021, compared to $49.8 million for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2020, an increase of $24.5 million, or 49%. The increase in cost of professional services was primarily due to an increase of $20.7 million in employee compensation costs related to higher headcount, including stock-based compensation costs, an increase of $6.7 million in amortization of developed technology assets related to acquisitions, and an increase of $1.1 million of other costs. This was partially offset by a decrease of $2.6 million due to a reduction in travel costs due to current travel restrictions associated with the COVID-19 pandemic, and from a decrease of $1.4 million in professional and outside services primarily related to customer implementations.\nWe will continue to monitor the COVID-19 pandemic carefully and its impact on our cost profile in providing hosting solutions and services to our customers.\nGross Profit\nTable 21: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>For the year ended\nJanuary 31, </td> <td> </td> <td>% Change </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>2021 </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>(in thousands)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gross profit </td> <td>$ </td> <td>319,942 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>250,503 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>28 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table>\nGross profit was $319.9 million for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2021, compared to $250.5 million for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2020, an increase of $69.4 million, or 28%. The increase in gross profit was primarily due to the acquisition of new customers with annualized subscription revenue above $100,000. Gross margin was 59% for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2021, compared to 64% for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2020. The decrease in gross margin was primarily due to the increase in amortization of developed technology assets related to acquisitions.\nOperating Expenses\nResearch and Development\nTable 22: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>For the year ended\nJanuary 31, </td> <td> </td> <td>% Change </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>2021 </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>(in thousands)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Research and development </td> <td>$ </td> <td>133,842 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>93,089 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>44 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table>\nResearch and development expenses were $133.8 million for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2021 compared to $93.1 million for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2020, an increase of $40.7 million, or 44%. The increase was primarily due to an increase of $39.3 million in employee compensation costs related to higher headcount, including stock-based compensation costs, an increase of $1.8 million in costs associated with the development of our platform and other costs for research and development activities, an increase in outside services of $1.5 million, and a $1.6 million increase in other costs driven by our overall growth. This was partially offset by a $2.1 million increase in capitalization of development costs and $1.4 million reduction in travel costs due to current travel restrictions associated with the COVID-19 pandemic.\nSales and Marketing\nTable 23: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>For the year ended\nJanuary 31, </td> <td> </td> <td>% Change </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>2021 </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>(in thousands)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Sales and marketing </td> <td>$ </td> <td>236,312 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>155,216 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>52 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table>\nSales and marketing expenses were $236.3 million for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2021, compared to $155.2 million for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2020, an increase of $81.1 million, or 52%. The increase was primarily due to an increase of $66.2 million in employee compensation costs related to higher headcount, including stock-based compensation costs, an increase of $13.9 million increase in customer relationship amortization costs, an increase of $2.4 million in marketing costs, an increase of $1.7 million in hosting fees to accommodate sales related activities, an increase in outside services of $1.7 million, and an increase of $3.5 million in other costs driven by our overall growth. This was partially offset by a reduction in travel costs of $8.3 million due to current travel restrictions associated with the COVID-19 pandemic. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we have replaced our in-person marketing events with web-based marketing and remote events.\nGeneral and Administrative\nTable 24: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>For the year ended\nJanuary 31, </td> <td> </td> <td>% Change </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>2021 </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>(in thousands)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>General and administrative </td> <td>$ </td> <td>116,341 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>75,623 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>54 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table>\nGeneral and administrative expenses were $116.3 million for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2021 compared to $75.6 million for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2020, an increase of $40.7 million, or 54%. The increase was primarily due to $44.6 million in employee compensation costs related to higher headcount, including stock-based compensation costs, an increase in outside services of $4.0 million, an increase in allowances for doubtful accounts and credit losses of $3.4 million, and from an increase of $1.2 million in other costs driven by our overall growth. This was partially offset by a benefit of $12.5 million arising from the reversal of the Yapta contingent consideration liability during the fiscal year ended January 31, 2021.\nInterest Expense\nTable 25: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>For the year ended\nJanuary 31, </td> <td> </td> <td>% Change </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>2021 </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>(in thousands)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest expense </td> <td>$ </td> <td>91,271 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>37,658 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>142 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table>\nInterest expense was $91.3 million for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2021, compared to $37.7 million for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2020. The $53.6 million increase in interest expense was primarily due to amortization of the debt discount and issuance costs on the 2026 Notes issued in the second quarter of fiscal 2021, and from the 2025 Notes issued in the second quarter of fiscal 2020, partially offset by a reduction of interest expenses associated with the repurchases and conversions of a portion of the 2023 Notes during fiscal 2021.\nInterest Income and Other, Net\nTable 26: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>For the year ended\nJanuary 31, </td> <td> </td> <td>% Change </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>2021 </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>(in thousands)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest income and other, net </td> <td>$ </td> <td>13,321 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>9,316 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>43 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table>\nInterest income and other, net was $13.3 million for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2021 compared to $9.3 million for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2020. The $4.0 million increase in interest income and other, net was primarily due to a favorable impact of $5.5 million related to foreign currency exchange, an increase of $3.2 million from early conversions gains on the 2023 Notes, and an increase of $0.3 million in other miscellaneous income, partially offset by a decrease of $5.0 million in income earned from our investments in marketable securities and money market funds primarily as a result of a lower market yield.\nBenefit From Income Taxes\nTable 27: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>For the year ended\nJanuary 31, </td> <td> </td> <td>% Change </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>2021 </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>(in thousands)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Benefit from income taxes </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(64,386) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(10,935) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>NM </td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe benefit from income taxes was $64.4 million for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2021, compared to benefit from income taxes of $10.9 million for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2020. Benefit from income taxes for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2021 is primarily related to the release of valuation allowances for deferred tax assets due to the recognition of deferred tax liabilities from acquisitions completed during the year, partially offset by income taxes related to foreign and state jurisdictions. We maintain a full valuation allowance on net deferred tax assets of our U.S. and the majority of our international entities as we have concluded that it is not more likely than not that the deferred assets will be utilized.\nFiscal Years Ended January 31, 2020 and 2019\nFor a comparison of our results of operations for the fiscal years ended January 31, 2020 and 2019, see Item 7, Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2020, filed with the SEC on March 20, 2020.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nOur principal sources of liquidity are cash, cash equivalents, marketable securities, and cash generated from operations. As of January 31, 2021, we had cash and cash equivalents of $323.3 million, and marketable securities of $283.0 million. In November 2020, we completed the acquisition of LLamasoft, Inc. In connection with the completion of the acquisition, we paid approximately $791.5 million in cash and issued approximately 2.4 million shares of our common stock.\nWe had outstanding 2023 Notes, 2025 Notes and 2026 Notes with principal amounts of $8.8 million, $805.0 million and $1,380.0 million, respectively, as of January 31, 2021.\nAs of January 31, 2021, the remaining 2023 Notes with a principal amount of $8.8 million and 2025 Notes with a principal amount of $805.0 million are convertible at the option of the holders. We have the ability to settle the Convertible Notes in cash, shares of our common stock, or a combination of cash and shares of our common stock at our own election. As of January 31, 2021, the unsettled conversion requests related to the 2023 Notes and 2025 Notes were not material. From February 1, 2021 to the date of this Annual Report, we have not received additional requests on either of the 2023 Notes or 2025 Notes. The 2026 Notes were not convertible as of January 31, 2021. It is our current intent to settle conversions of the remaining 2023 Notes and the 2025 and 2026 Notes through combination settlement, which involves repayment of the principal portion in cash and any excess of the conversion value over the principal amount in shares of our common stock.\nIn conjunction with the issuance of the Convertible Notes, we entered into capped call transactions that reduce our exposure to additional cash payments above principal balances in the event of a cash conversion of the Convertible Notes. We may owe additional cash to the noteholders upon early conversion if our stock price exceeds $63.821 per share for the 2023 Notes, $295.55 for the 2025 Notes, or $503.42 for the 2026 Notes. Although our incremental exposure to the additional cash payment above the principal amount of the Convertible Notes is reduced by the capped calls, conversion of the Convertible Notes by noteholders may cause dilution to the ownership interests of existing stockholders. We did not exercise the capped calls for the converted 2023 Notes and 2025 Notes. As of January 31, 2021 all the capped calls for the 2023 Notes and 2025 Notes remained outstanding.\nOur cash equivalents are comprised primarily of bank deposits and money market funds. Cash from operations could be affected by various risks and uncertainties, including, but not limited to, the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic and other risks detailed in Part I, Item 1A titled Risk Factors.\u201d However, we believe our existing cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities will be sufficient to meet our projected operating requirements for at least the next 12 months from the filing of this Annual Report.\nOur future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including our pace of growth, subscription renewal activity, the timing and extent of spend to support development efforts, the expansion of sales and marketing activities, the introduction of new and enhanced services offerings and the continuing market acceptance of our services. We continually assess potential acquisitions and expect to continue to pursue acquisitions of or investments in complementary businesses, services and technologies and intellectual property rights. We may be required to seek additional equity or debt financing. In the event that additional financing is required from outside sources, we may not be able to raise it on terms acceptable to us, or at all. If we are unable to raise additional capital when desired, our business, operating results and financial condition would be adversely affected.\nOperating Activities\nCash provided by operating activities for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2021 was $78.2 million compared to $68.2 million for the year ended January 31, 2020. This increase was primarily driven by cash collections from customers, partially offset by approximately $27.4 million repayments of convertible senior notes attributable to debt discount and $19.4 million from one-time payout of legacy unvested stock awards accelerated in conjunction with the LLamasoft acquisition, which were classified as cash outflows in operating activities for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2021.\nInvesting Activities\nCash used in investing activities for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2021 of $661.1 million was primarily related to cash used in the acquisition of ConnXus, Bellin, Much-Net and LLamasoft of $856.7 million, $11.5 million for the purchases of property and equipment, and from $6.9 million release of holdback purchase consideration related to previous business acquisitions, partially offset by $214.0 million of net purchases, maturities and sales of short-term marketable securities.\nFinancing Activities\nCash provided by financing activities for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2021 of $641.8 million was primarily due to net proceeds of $1,355.1 million from the issuance of 2026 Notes, partially offset by $192.8 million proceeds used to purchase the associated capped calls and $555.4 million for repayments and cancellations of the 2023 Notes. In addition, there was approximately $34.9 million of proceeds from the exercise of stock options and issuance of common stock under the ESPP during the fiscal year ended January 31, 2021.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nThrough January 31, 2021, we did not have any relationships with unconsolidated organizations or financial partnerships, such as structured finance or special purpose entities that would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes.\nCommitments and Contractual Obligations\nOur principal commitments and contractual obligations consist of our Convertible Notes, obligations under operating leases for office facilities and contractual purchase obligations for hosting services and web development services that support our business operations. The following table summarizes our non-cancelable contractual obligations as of January 31, 2021.\nTable 28: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Payments due by period </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Total </td> <td> </td> <td>Less Than\n1 Year </td> <td> </td> <td>1-3 Years </td> <td> </td> <td>3-5 Years </td> <td> </td> <td>More Than\n5 Years </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>(in thousands) </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Convertible senior notes (1)\n</td> <td>$ </td> <td>2,193,831 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2,957 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>5,877 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>804,997 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,380,000 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Aggregate interest obligation(1)(2)\n</td> <td>32,532 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6,204 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>12,387 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>11,353 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,588 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating lease obligations </td> <td>49,217 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>14,060 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>23,727 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>9,125 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,305 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Purchase obligations </td> <td>40,287 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>15,669 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>23,468 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,150 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total contractual obligations </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2,315,867 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>38,890 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>65,459 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>826,625 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,384,893 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\n(1)The conversion period for the 2023 Notes and 2025 Notes was open as of January 31, 2021, and as such the net carrying value of the 2023 Notes and 2025 Notes are included within current liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet. The principal balances of $8.8 million and $805.0 million of the 2023 Notes and 2025 Notes, respectively, were reflected in the payment period in the table above based on the contractual maturity assuming no conversion or repurchase.\n(2)Represents estimated aggregate interest obligations for our outstanding Convertible Notes that are payable in cash.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nOur management's discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, as well as the reported revenues generated and expenses incurred during the reporting periods. Our estimates are based on our historical experience and on various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. We believe that the accounting policies discussed below are critical to understanding our historical and future performance, as these policies relate to the more significant areas involving management's judgments and estimates.\nRevenue Recognition\nWe derive our revenues primarily from subscription fees, professional services fees and other. Revenues are recognized when control of these services are transferred to our customers in an amount that reflects the consideration we expect to be entitled to in exchange for those services. Revenues are recognized net of applicable taxes imposed on the related transaction. Our revenue recognition policy follows guidance from Accounting Standards Codification 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606).\nWe determine revenue recognition through the following five-step framework:\n\u2022 Identification of the contract, or contracts, with a customer;\n\u2022 Identification of the performance obligations in the contract;\n\u2022 Determination of the transaction price;\n\u2022 Allocation of the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract; and\n\u2022 Recognition of revenue when, or as, we satisfy a performance obligation.\nSubscription Revenues\nWe offer subscriptions to our cloud-based business spend management platform, including procurement, invoicing, expense management and pay. Subscription services revenues consist primarily of fees to provide our customers access to our cloud-based platform, which includes routine customer support. Subscription service contracts do not provide customers with the right to take possession of the software, are non-cancelable, and do not contain general rights of return. Generally subscription revenues are recognized ratably over the contractual term of the arrangement, beginning on the date that the service is made available to the customer. Subscription contracts typically have a term of three years with invoicing occurring in annual installments at the beginning of each year in the subscription period.\nSubscription revenues also include fees to provide post-contract customer support related to the term-based licenses. The post-contract customer support revenues are recognized ratably over the contract term beginning on the license delivery date.\nProfessional Services Revenues and Other\nWe offer professional services which include deployment services, optimization services, and training. Professional services are generally sold on a time-and-materials basis or fixed-fee basis. For services billed on a fixed-fee basis, invoicing typically occurs in advance, and revenue is recognized over time based on the proportion performed. For services billed on a time-and-materials basis, revenue is recognized over time as services are performed.\nOther revenues include the sales of term-based licenses that we acquired from business combinations. The revenues are recognized at the start of the license term when delivery is complete.\nSignificant Judgments\nOur contracts with customers often include promises to transfer multiple products and services to a customer. For these contracts, we account for individual performance obligations separately if they are distinct. Subscription services, professional services, the right to term-based licenses, and related post-contract customer support are distinct performance obligations that are accounted for separately. In contracts with multiple performance obligations, the transaction price is allocated to each separate performance obligations on a relative standalone selling price (\"SSP\") basis.\nThe determination of standalone selling price for each distinct performance obligations requires judgment. We determine SSP for performance obligations based on overall pricing objectives, which take into consideration market conditions and entity-specific factors. This includes a review of historical sales data related to the size of arrangements, the applications being sold, customer demographics and the numbers and types of users within the arrangements. We use a range of amounts to estimate SSP for performance obligations. There is typically more than one SSP for individual products and services due to the stratification of those products and services by certain considerations such as size and sales regions.\nDeferred Commissions\nCommissions are earned by sales personnel upon the execution of the sales contract by the customer, and commission payments are made shortly after they are earned. Commission costs can be associated specifically with subscription, professional services, and license arrangements. Commissions earned by our sales personnel are considered incremental and recoverable costs of obtaining a contract with a customer. These costs are deferred and then amortized over a period of benefit of five years. We determined the period of benefit by taking into consideration our past experience with customers, future cash flows expected from customers, industry peers and other available information.\nFor commissions earned from the sale of term-based license contracts, we allocate the costs of commission in proportion to the allocation of transaction price of license and PCS performance obligations. Commissions associated with the license component are expensed at the time the related revenue is recognized. Commissions allocated to PCS are deferred and then amortized over a period of benefit of five years.\nWe capitalized commission costs of $24.2 million, and $26.2 million and amortized $14.7 million and $9.6 million to sales and marketing expense in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations during the years ended January 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively.\nBusiness Combinations\nWe account for acquisitions of entities that include inputs and processes and have the ability to create outputs as business combinations. For acquired businesses, we record tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values at the acquisition dates. The excess of the purchase price over those fair values is recorded as goodwill. During the measurement period, which may be up to one year from the acquisition date, we may record adjustments to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed with the corresponding offset to goodwill. Upon the conclusion of the measurement period or final determination of the values of assets acquired or liabilities assumed, whichever comes first, any subsequent adjustments are recorded to the consolidated statements of operations.\nAccounting for business combinations requires our management to make significant estimates and assumptions at the acquisition date, including estimated fair value of acquired intangible assets, and related amortization period. The estimates of fair value require management to also make estimates of, among other things, future expected cash flows, discount rates or expected costs to reproduce an asset. Although we believe the assumptions and estimates we have made in the past have been reasonable and appropriate, these estimates are based on historical experience and information obtained from the management of the acquired companies and are inherently uncertain.\nWe review goodwill for impairment annually during the fourth quarter or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances would more likely than not reduce the fair value of our single reporting unit below its carrying value. As of January 31, 2021, no impairment of goodwill has been identified.\nAcquired finite-lived intangible assets are amortized over their estimated useful lives. We evaluate the recoverability of our intangible assets for possible impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable. We have not recorded any significant impairment charges during the years presented.\nIn addition to the recoverability assessment, we routinely review the remaining estimated useful lives of our finite-lived intangible assets. If we modify the estimated useful life assumption for any asset, the remaining unamortized balance would be amortized over the revised estimated useful life.\nConvertible Notes\nWe account for the issued convertible senior notes ( Convertible Notes\u201d) as separate liability and equity components. The carrying amount of the liability component was calculated by measuring the fair value of a similar liability that does not have an associated convertible feature using a discounted cash flow model with a discount rate associated with each convertible note. The discount rates were determined primarily using observable yields for stand-alone debt instruments with a comparable credit rating and term. In addition, for the 2026 Notes, the Company also used lattice models to determine the discount rate. The carrying amount of the equity component representing the conversion option was determined by deducting the fair value of the liability component from the par value of the Convertible Notes as a whole. This difference represents a debt discount that is amortized to interest expense over the term of the Convertible Notes using the effective interest rate method. The equity component is not remeasured as long as it continues to meet the conditions for equity classification. We allocated issuance costs incurred to the liability and equity components. Issuance costs attributable to the liability component are being amortized to expense over the respective term of the Convertible Notes, and issuance costs attributable to the equity components were netted with the respective equity component in additional paid in capital.\nTo the extent that we receive note conversion requests prior to the maturity of the Convertible Notes, a portion of the equity component is classified as temporary equity, which is measured as the difference between the principal and net carrying amount of the notes requested for conversion. Upon settlement of the conversion requests, the difference between the fair value and the amortized book value of the liability component of the Convertible Notes requested for conversion is recorded as a gain or loss on early note conversion. The fair value of the Convertible Notes are measured based on a similar liability that does not have an associated convertible feature over the remaining term of the Convertible Notes.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nRefer to Note 2, Significant Accounting Policies\u201d in the notes to consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report for analysis of recent accounting pronouncements that are applicable to our business.", "item_7_truncated": "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nThe following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes appearing elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. As discussed in the section titled Note About Forward-Looking Statements,\u201d the following discussion and analysis contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties, as well as assumptions that, if they never materialize or prove incorrect, could cause our results to differ materially from those expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause or contribute to these differences include, but are not limited to, impacts on our business and general economic conditions due to the current COVID-19 pandemic, those identified below, those discussed in Note About Forward-Looking Statements\u201d and those discussed in the section titled Risk Factors\u201d under Part I, Item 1A in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nThis section of this Form 10-K generally discusses fiscal 2021 and 2020 items and year-to-year comparisons between fiscal 2021 and 2020. Discussions of fiscal 2019 items and year-to-year comparisons between fiscal 2020 and fiscal 2019 that are not included in this Form 10-K can be found in Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d in Part II, Item 7 of the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2020.\nOverview\nWe are a leading provider of Business Spend Management ( BSM\u201d) solutions. We offer a comprehensive, cloud-based BSM platform that has connected our customers with more than seven million suppliers globally. Our platform provides greater visibility into and control over how companies spend money, optimize supply chains, and manage liquidity. Using our platform, businesses are able to achieve real, measurable value and savings that drive their profitability.\nWe refer to the process companies use to purchase goods and services as business spend management and to the money that they manage with this process as spend under management. Our BSM platform delivers a broad range of capabilities that would typically require the purchase and use of multiple disparate point applications. The core of our platform consists of procurement, invoicing, expense management, and payment solutions that form the transactional engine for managing a company's business spend. In addition, our platform offers specialized modules targeted for power users, to help companies manage more technical and strategic areas of BSM, including areas such as strategic sourcing, contract management, contingent workforce, supplier risk management, supply chain design and planning, treasury management, and spend analysis.\nWe also provide purchasing programs, such as Coupa Advantage, which offers access to pre-negotiated discounts from various suppliers, and Source Together, which connects community members to engage in group sourcing events, allowing them to leverage pooled buying power to achieve better contracting terms and capture greater savings. Moreover, through our Coupa Open Business Network, suppliers of all sizes can list their goods and services, establish pricing, and interact with buyers electronically, thus significantly reducing paper, improving operating efficiencies, and reducing costs.\nWe offer access to our platform under a Software-as-a-Service ( SaaS\u201d) business model. At the time of initial deployment, our customers often make a set of common functions available to the majority of their licensed employees, as well as incremental modules for select employees and procurement specialists, whom we refer to as power users. Therefore, we are typically able to capture a majority of the expected annual recurring revenue opportunity at the inception of our customer relationships, rather than targeting specific power users at the outset of the customer relationship with the intention of expanding and capturing more annual recurring revenue at later stages of the customer relationship. Customers can rapidly implement our platform, with implementation periods typically ranging from a few weeks to several months. Customers also benefit from software updates that typically require little downtime.\nWe market and sell our solutions to a broad range of enterprises worldwide. We have a diverse, multi-national customer base spanning various sizes and industries and no significant customer concentration. No customer accounted for more than 10% of our total revenues for the years ended January 31, 2021, and 2020, respectively.\nWe market our platform primarily through a direct sales force and also benefit from leads driven by our partner ecosystem. Our initial contract terms are typically three years, although some customers commit for longer or shorter periods. The large majority of our customers pay annually, one year in advance. Our subscription fee includes access to our service, technical support and management of the hosting infrastructure. We generally recognize revenues from our subscription fees ratably over the contractual term of the arrangement. We do not charge suppliers who are on our platform to transact with our customers. We believe this approach helps attract more suppliers to our platform and increases the value of our platform to customers.\nWe have continued to make significant expenditures and investments for long-term growth, including investment in our platform and infrastructure to deliver new functionality and modules to meet the evolving needs of our customers and to take advantage of our market opportunity. We intend to continue to increase our investment in sales and marketing, as we further expand our sales teams, increase our marketing activities, and grow our international operations. Internationally, we currently offer our platform in Europe, the Middle East and Africa, Latin America and Asia-Pacific, including Japan. The combined revenues from non-U.S. regions, as determined based on the billing address of our customers, constituted 38% and 36%, respectively, of our total revenues for the years ended January 31, 2021 and 2020. We believe there is further opportunity to increase our international revenues in absolute dollars and as a percentage of our total revenues. As a result, we are increasingly investing in our international operations and we intend to expand our footprint in international markets.\nOperating in international markets requires significant resources and management attention and will subject us to regulatory, economic and political risks that are different from those in the United States. While we are gaining additional experience with international operations, our international expansion efforts may not be successful in creating additional demand for our platform outside of the United States or in effectively selling subscriptions to our platform in any or all of the international markets we enter.\nIn late 2019, a novel strain of the coronavirus disease ( COVID-19\u201d) was identified in China, and in March 2020, the World Health Organization characterized the COVID-19 outbreak as a pandemic. The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in authorities implementing numerous measures to try to contain and mitigate the virus, including travel bans and restrictions, business shut-downs and limitations, quarantines, and shelter-in-place and social distancing orders.\nThe extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic may impact our financial condition or results of operations in future periods remains uncertain. The effect of the COVID-19 pandemic may not be fully reflected in our results of operations and overall financial performance until future periods. We may experience decreased customer demand, reduced customer spend, customer bankruptcies and other non-payment situations, shorter contract duration, longer sales cycles and extended payment terms, any of which could materially adversely impact our business, results of operations and overall financial performance in future periods. The extent and continued impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our operational and financial performance will depend in part on future developments and conditions, including the duration and spread of the outbreak; government responses to the pandemic; the impact on our customers and our sales cycles; extent of delays in hiring and onboarding new employees; and effect on our partners, vendors and supply chains, all of which are uncertain and difficult to predict. Additionally, due to concerns over the COVID-19 pandemic, we have replaced our in-person, annual Inspire conferences and other in-person marketing events with web-based alternatives. In the first quarter of fiscal 2021, we closed our offices globally and required our employees to work remotely. These changes remained in effect throughout the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021 and are expected to extend into future quarters. The impact, if any, of these and any additional operational changes we may implement is uncertain, but changes we have implemented to date have not materially impaired and are not expected to materially impair our ability to maintain operations, including financial reporting systems, internal control over financial reporting and disclosure controls and procedures. See the section Risk Factors\u201d for further discussion of the possible impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business.\nRecent Business Developments\nIn May 2020, we acquired all of the equity interest in ConnXus, Inc. ( ConnXus\u201d), a cloud-based supplier relationship management platform that enables enterprises, health systems and government agencies to monitor all aspects of their supplier diversity compliance programs. The purchase consideration was approximately $10.0 million in cash of which approximately $1.4 million is being held back by the Company for fifteen months after the transaction closing date.\nIn June 2020, we acquired all of the equity interest in Bellin Treasury International GmbH ( Bellin\u201d), a cloud-based treasury management software platform that improves visibility and control over cash and optimizes treasury processes. The purchase consideration was approximately $121.0 million, comprised of $79.1 million in cash (of which $8.0 million is being held in escrow for eighteen months after the transaction closing date) and 186,300 shares of our common stock with a fair value of approximately $41.8 million as of the transaction close date.\nIn June 2020, we issued $1,380.0 million aggregate principal amount of our 0.375% Convertible Senior Notes due 2026. In conjunction with the issuance of these notes, we purchased capped calls at a total price of $192.8 million. The net proceeds from the issuance of the 2026 Notes were $1,162.3 million, net of debt issuance costs, including the underwriting discount, and the cash used to purchase the capped call. In addition, we used proceeds of approximately $450.6 million from the 2026 Notes issuance to repurchase 2023 Notes in an aggregate principal amount of approximately $89.0 million.\nIn September 2020, we acquired all of the equity interest in Much-Net GmbH (\"Much-Net\"), a financial instrument software and service provider that specializes in risk management. The purchase consideration was approximately $4.3 million in cash, which is net of $1.8 million in cash acquired.\nIn November 2020, we completed the acquisition of Laurel Parent Holdings, Inc. and its subsidiaries (\"LLamasoft\"), a supply chain design and analysis software and solutions company. The acquisition strengthens Coupa's supply chain capabilities, enabling businesses to drive greater value through Business Spend Management. In connection with the acquisition, we issued approximately 2.4 million shares of our common stock and paid aggregate cash of approximately $791.5 million. Approximately $15.0 million of the cash paid is being held in escrow for fifteen months after the transaction closing date as security for the former LLamasoft stockholders' indemnification obligations, and approximately $7.5 million of the cash paid is being held in escrow until the completion of final adjustment on the purchase consideration.\nIn February 2021, we completed the acquisition of Pana Industries, Inc. (\"Pana\"), a corporate travel booking solution company that puts an emphasis on the traveler experience. In connection with the completion of the acquisition, we paid aggregate cash of approximately $48.5 million, and issued 23,822 shares of our common stock.\nOur Business Model\nOur business model focuses on maximizing the lifetime value of a customer relationship, and we continue to make significant investments in order to grow our customer base. Due to our subscription model, we recognize subscription revenues ratably over the term of the subscription period. As a result, the profitability of a customer to our business in any particular period depends in part upon how long a customer has been a subscriber on our platform. In general, the associated upfront costs with respect to new customers are higher in the first year than the aggregate revenues we recognize from those new customers in the first year. We believe that, over time, as our customer base grows and a relatively higher percentage of our subscription revenues are attributable to renewals versus new customers or upsells to existing customers, associated sales and marketing expenses and other allocated upfront costs as a percentage of revenues will decrease, subject to investments we plan to make in our business. Over the lifetime of the customer relationship, we also incur sales and marketing costs to manage the account, renew or upsell the customer to more modules and more users. However, these costs are significantly less than the costs initially incurred to acquire the customer. We calculate the lifetime value of our customers and associated customer acquisition costs for a particular year by comparing (i) gross profit from net new subscription revenues for the year multiplied by the inverse of the estimated subscription renewal rate to (ii) total sales and marketing expense incurred in the preceding year. On this basis, we estimate that for each of fiscal 2021 and 2020, the calculated lifetime value of our customers has exceeded six times the associated cost of acquiring them.\nKey Metrics\nWe review the following key metrics to evaluate our business, measure our performance, identify trends affecting our business, formulate business plans and make strategic decisions:\nTable 17: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>As of January 31, </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2021 </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cumulative spend under management (in billions) </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2,359.3 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,655.2 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,079.2 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Remaining performance obligations (in millions) </td> <td>$ </td> <td>952.3 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>724.9 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>498.6 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Deferred revenue (in millions) </td> <td>$ </td> <td>361.9 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>261.8 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>182.6 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Trailing twelve months calculated billings (in millions) </td> <td>$ </td> <td>641.7 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>468.9 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>314.9 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Customers with annualized subscription revenue above $100,000 </td> <td>1,082 </td> <td> </td> <td>813 </td> <td> </td> <td>602 </td> </tr>\n</table>\nCumulative Spend Under Management\nCumulative spend under management represents the aggregate dollar value of transactions through our core platform for all of our customers collectively since we launched our core platform. We define our core platform for purposes of this metric as our procurement, invoicing and expense management modules. We calculate this metric by aggregating the actual transaction data for purchase orders, invoices and expenses from customers using our core platform. Cumulative spend under management does not include spending data or transactions associated with modules from acquired companies. We regularly review our process for calculating this metric and periodically make adjustments to improve its accuracy. We believe that any such adjustments are immaterial unless otherwise stated.\nThe cumulative spend under management metric presented above does not directly correlate to our revenue or results of operations because we do not generally charge our customers based on actual usage of our core platform. However, we believe the cumulative spend under management metric does illustrate the adoption, scale and value of our platform, which we believe enhances our ability to maintain existing customers and attract new customers.\nRemaining Performance Obligations and Deferred Revenue\nRemaining performance obligations represents the amount of consideration allocated to unsatisfied performance obligations related to non-cancelable contracts, which include both the deferred revenue balance and amounts that will be invoiced and recognized as revenue in future periods. In calculating the remaining performance obligation amount, we elected to apply the two expedients under the revenue standard to exclude remaining performance obligations amounts related to contracts that are twelve months or less and contracts where revenue is being recognized under the as-invoiced method.\nWe generally execute multiple year subscription contracts for our platform and invoice an initial amount at contract signing followed by subsequent annual invoices. At any point in the contract term, there might be amounts that are not due for billing yet. These amounts are not recorded in our consolidated financial statements, and are considered to be part of the remaining performance obligations amount.\nThe remaining performance obligations amount is intended to provide visibility into future revenue streams. We expect remaining performance obligations to fluctuate up or down from period to period for several possible reasons, including amounts, timing, and duration of customer contracts (including changes that we may see to customer contracts as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic), as well as the timing of billing cycles for each order.\nOur deferred revenue consists of amounts that have been invoiced but not yet recognized as revenues as of the end of a reporting period. The majority of our deferred revenue balance consists of subscription revenues that are recognized ratably over the related contractual period.\nTrailing Twelve Months Calculated Billings\nTrailing twelve months calculated billings represents total revenues recognized during the period of consecutive twelve months ended January 31, 2021 and 2020 plus the change in deferred revenue for each of those same periods. Trailing twelve month calculated billings is comprised of subscription contracts with existing customers (including renewal contracts and add-on contracts), subscription contracts with new customers, and contracts for professional services, training and other revenues.\nThe trailing twelve months calculated billings is intended to provide information about our subscription revenue growth over time, and can typically be seen as an early indicator of trends in revenue growth. While trailing twelve months calculated billings can increase as our revenues grow, it may fluctuate up or down from period to period for several reasons, including amounts, timing, and duration of customer contracts (including changes that we may see to customer contracts as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic), as well as the timing of billing cycles for each order.\nCustomers with Annualized Subscription Revenue Above $100,000\nWe define customers with annualized subscription revenue above $100,000 as the total number of customers that contributed subscription revenues in excess of $25,000 during the relevant fiscal quarter, which corresponds to $100,000 on an annualized basis. For purposes of this metric, we generally define a customer as a separate and distinct entity (such as a company or an educational or government institution), a distinct business unit of a large corporation or a partner organization, in each case that has an active contract with us to access our services. Most of the subscription revenue we recognize each quarter is attributable to customers that accounted for more than $25,000 of that revenue during the quarter, and our sales and marketing strategy focuses heavily on the acquisition of customers that have the potential to contribute at least $100,000 in subscription revenues annually. Accordingly, we believe that this metric is a useful tool to aid investors in understanding a key factor that drives changes in our subscription revenues from period to period and in assessing trends in our growth, penetration of our core customer market, and our overall performance. Because the dollar threshold is tied to the actual revenue recognized during a particular quarter, customers that we acquired midway through or at the end of the quarter may not yet be included in this count, even if they have placed orders representing more than $100,000 in annual subscription revenue.\nComponents of Results of Operations\nRevenues\nWe primarily offer subscriptions to our cloud-based BSM platform, including procurement, invoicing and expense management and pay. We derive our revenues primarily from subscription fees and professional services fees.\nSubscription revenues consist primarily of fees to provide our customers access to our cloud-based platform, which includes routine customer support at no additional cost. Term-based licenses are sold as bundled arrangements that include the rights to a term license and post-contract customer support ( PCS\u201d). Accordingly, we allocate the transaction price to each performance obligation. The revenues related to the amount allocated to PCS are included in subscription revenue, which are recognized ratably over the contract term beginning on the license delivery date. Professional services fees and other include deployment services, optimization services, training, and revenues allocated to license component for the sales of term-based licenses. Subscription revenues are a function of renewal rates, the number of customers, the number of users at each customer, the number of modules subscribed to by each customer, and the price of our modules.\nGenerally, subscription fees are recognized ratably as revenues over the contract term beginning on the date the application is made available to the customer. Our new business subscriptions typically have a term of three years, although some customers commit for longer or shorter periods. We generally invoice our customers in annual installments at the beginning of each year in the subscription period. Amounts that have been invoiced are initially recorded as deferred revenue and are recognized ratably over the subscription period. Amounts that will be invoiced and recognized as revenue in future periods are reflected as remaining performance obligations within the notes to our consolidated financial statements.\nProfessional services revenues and other consist primarily of fees associated with the implementation and configuration of our subscription service and revenues allocated to the license component for sales of term-based licenses. Professional services are generally sold on a time-and-materials or fixed-fee basis. Revenue for both time-and-material and fixed-fee arrangements are recognized over-time as the services are performed. We have the ability to reasonably measure progress towards completion of the professional services arrangements. For fixed-fee arrangements, we recognize revenue on the basis of performed hours relative to the total estimated hours to complete satisfaction of the professional service arrangement. For the license component from the sales of term-based licenses, we recognize revenues at the start of the license term when delivery is complete.\nOur professional services engagements typically span from a few weeks to several months. For this reason, our professional services revenues may fluctuate significantly from period to period. The terms of our typical professional services arrangements provide that our customers pay us within 30 days from the invoice date. Fixed-fee services arrangements are generally invoiced in advance. We have made significant investments in our professional services business that are designed to ensure customer success and adoption of our platform. We are continuing to invest in expanding our professional services partner ecosystem to further support our customers. As the professional services practices of our partner firms continue to develop, we expect them to increasingly contract directly with our subscription customers and we incentivize our sales force to further this objective.\nCost of Revenues\nSubscription\nCost of subscription consists primarily of expenses related to hosting our service and providing customer support. Significant expenses are comprised of data center capacity costs; personnel and related costs directly associated with our cloud infrastructure and customer support, including salaries, benefits, bonuses and stock-based compensation; allocated overhead; and amortization of acquired developed technology and capitalized software development costs.\nProfessional Services and Other Cost of Revenues\nCost of professional services and other cost of revenues consist primarily of personnel and related costs directly associated with our professional services and training departments, including salaries, benefits, bonuses and stock-based compensation; the costs of contracted third-party vendors, amortization of acquired developed technology; and allocated overhead. These costs are generally expensed in the period incurred.\nProfessional services associated with the implementation and configuration of our subscription platform are performed directly by our services team, as well as by contracted third-party vendors. In cases in which third-party vendors invoice us for services performed for our customers, those fees are accrued over the requisite service period.\nOperating Expenses\nResearch and Development\nResearch and development expenses consist primarily of personnel costs of our development team, including salaries, benefits, bonuses, stock-based compensation expense and allocated overhead costs. Our cycle of frequent updates has facilitated rapid innovation and the introduction of new modules throughout our history. We have aggressively invested, and intend to continue to invest, in developing technology to support our growth. We capitalize certain software development costs that are attributable to developing new modules and features and adding incremental functionality to our platform, and we amortize such costs as costs of subscription revenues over the estimated life of the new application or incremental functionality, which is typically either two or three years.\nSales and Marketing\nSales and marketing expenses consist primarily of personnel and related costs directly associated with our sales and marketing staff, including salaries, benefits, bonuses, commissions and stock-based compensation. Commissions earned by our sales force that are considered incremental costs for obtaining a non-cancelable subscription contract are deferred and amortized over a period of benefit that we have determined to be five years. For commissions earned from the sale of term-based license contracts, we allocate the costs of commission in proportion to the allocation of transaction price of license and PCS performance obligations. Commissions associated with the license component are expensed at the time the related revenue is recognized. Commissions allocated to PCS are deferred and then amortized over five years. Other sales and marketing costs include promotional events to promote our brand, including our Inspire conferences, web advertising, events, allocated overhead and amortization of customer relationships and trademark.\nGeneral and Administrative\nGeneral and administrative expenses consist of personnel costs and related expenses for executive, finance, legal, human resources, recruiting, and administrative personnel, including salaries, benefits, bonuses and stock-based compensation expense; professional fees for external legal, accounting, recruiting and other consulting services and allocated overhead costs. During fiscal 2021, general and administrative expenses included a benefit of $12.5 million related to the reversal of the Yapta contingent consideration payable, as explained in Note 4, Business Combinations\u201d in the notes to our consolidated financial statements.\nInterest Expense\nInterest expense consists primarily of interest expense associated with our outstanding convertible senior notes.\nInterest Income and Other, Net\nInterest income and other, net consists primarily of interest income earned on our investments in marketable securities and cash and cash equivalents, and gain or loss on conversion of convertible senior notes, in addition to the effects of exchange rates on our foreign currency-denominated asset and liability balances which are recorded as foreign currency gains (losses) in the consolidated statements of operations.\nProvision for (Benefit from) Income Taxes\nProvision for income taxes consists primarily of income taxes related to foreign and state jurisdictions in which we conduct business. Benefit from income taxes is primarily related to the release of valuation allowances for deferred tax assets for the year ended January 31, 2021, partially offset by income taxes related to foreign and state jurisdictions. We maintain a full valuation allowance on net deferred tax assets of our U.S. and the majority of our international entities as we have concluded that it is not more likely than not that the deferred

Subscription revenues were $470.3 million, or 87% of total revenues, for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2021, compared to $345.3 million, or 89% of total revenues, for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2020. This increase in absolute dollars was predominantly driven by the increase in the number of customers with annualized subscription revenue above $100,000, which was 1,082 as of January 31, 2021, compared to 813 as of January 31, 2020. Professional services and other revenues were $71.3 million for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2021 compared to $44.5 million for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2020. The increase of $26.8 million, or 60%, was primarily due to an increase in implementation services as a result of our expanded customer base.\nWe will continue to monitor the COVID-19 pandemic carefully and its impact on our customers and customer acquisitions.\nCost of Revenues\nTable 20: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>For the year ended\nJanuary 31, </td> <td> </td> <td>% Change </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>2021 </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>(in thousands)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Subscription </td> <td>$ </td> <td>147,374 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>89,452 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>65 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Professional services and other </td> <td>74,327 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>49,764 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>49 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total cost of revenues </td> <td>$ </td> <td>221,701 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>139,216 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>59 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table>\nCost of subscription was $147.4 million for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2021 compared to $89.5 million for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2020, an increase of $57.9 million, or 65%. The increase in cost of subscription was primarily due to an increase of $18.4 million in hosting fees to accommodate increased customer spend, an increase of $18.4 million in amortization of developed technology assets related to acquisitions, an increase of $11.3 million in employee compensation costs related to higher headcount, including stock-based compensation costs, an increase of $5.0 million in license and subscription fees, an increase of $3.6 million in amortization of capitalized development costs, and a $1.2 million increase in other costs driven by our overall growth.\nCost of professional services was $74.3 million for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2021, compared to $49.8 million for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2020, an increase of $24.5 million, or 49%. The increase in cost of professional services was primarily due to an increase of $20.7 million in employee compensation costs related to higher headcount, including stock-based compensation costs, an increase of $6.7 million in amortization of developed technology assets related to acquisitions, and an increase of $1.1 million of other costs. This was partially offset by a decrease of $2.6 million due to a reduction in travel costs due to current travel restrictions associated with the COVID-19 pandemic, and from a decrease of $1.4 million in professional and outside services primarily related to customer implementations.\nWe will continue to monitor the COVID-19 pandemic carefully and its impact on our cost profile in providing hosting solutions and services to our customers.\nGross Profit\nTable 21: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>For the year ended\nJanuary 31, </td> <td> </td> <td>% Change </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>2021 </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>(in thousands)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gross profit </td> <td>$ </td> <td>319,942 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>250,503 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>28 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table>\nGross profit was $319.9 million for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2021, compared to $250.5 million for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2020, an increase of $69.4 million, or 28%. The increase in gross profit was primarily due to the acquisition of new customers with annualized subscription revenue above $100,000. Gross margin was 59% for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2021, compared to 64% for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2020.

The increase was primarily due to an increase of $39.3 million in employee compensation costs related to higher headcount, including stock-based compensation costs, an increase of $1.8 million in costs associated with the development of our platform and other costs for research and development activities, an increase in outside services of $1.5 million, and a $1.6 million increase in other costs driven by our overall growth.

The increase was primarily due to an increase of $66.2 million in employee compensation costs related to higher headcount, including stock-based compensation costs, an increase of $13.9 million increase in customer relationship amortization costs, an increase of $2.4 million in marketing costs, an increase of $1.7 million in hosting fees to accommodate sales related activities, an increase in outside services of $1.7 million, and an increase of $3.5 million in other costs driven by our overall growth. This was partially offset by a reduction in travel costs of $8.3 million due to current travel restrictions associated with the COVID-19 pandemic.

The increase was primarily due to $44.6 million in employee compensation costs related to higher headcount, including stock-based compensation costs, an increase in outside services of $4.0 million, an increase in allowances for doubtful accounts and credit losses of $3.4 million, and from an increase of $1.2 million in other costs driven by our overall growth. This was partially offset by a benefit of $12.5 million arising from the reversal of the Yapta contingent consideration liability during the fiscal year ended January 31, 2021.\nInterest Expense\nTable 25: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>For the year ended\nJanuary 31, </td> <td> </td> <td>% Change </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>2021 </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>(in thousands)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest expense </td> <td>$ </td> <td>91,271 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>37,658 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>142 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table>\nInterest expense was $91.3 million for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2021, compared to $37.7 million for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2020. The $53.6 million increase in interest expense was primarily due to amortization of the debt discount and issuance costs on the 2026 Notes issued in the second quarter of fiscal 2021, and from the 2025 Notes issued in the second quarter of fiscal 2020, partially offset by a reduction of interest expenses associated with the repurchases and conversions of a portion of the 2023 Notes during fiscal 2021.\nInterest Income and Other, Net\nTable 26: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>For the year ended\nJanuary 31, </td> <td> </td> <td>% Change </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>2021 </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>(in thousands)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest income and other, net </td> <td>$ </td> <td>13,321 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>9,316 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>43 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table>\nInterest income and other, net was $13.3 million for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2021 compared to $9.3 million for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2020. The $4.0 million increase in interest income and other, net was primarily due to a favorable impact of $5.5 million related to foreign currency exchange, an increase of $3.2 million from early conversions gains on the 2023 Notes, and an increase of $0.3 million in other miscellaneous income, partially offset by a decrease of $5.0 million in income earned from our investments in marketable securities and money market funds primarily as a result of a lower market yield.\nBenefit From Income Taxes\nTable 27: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>For the year ended\nJanuary 31, </td> <td> </td> <td>% Change </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>2021 </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>(in thousands)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Benefit from income taxes </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(64,386) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(10,935) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>NM </td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe benefit from income taxes was $64.4 million for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2021, compared to benefit from income taxes of $10.9 million for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2020. Benefit from income taxes for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2021 is primarily related to the release of valuation allowances for deferred tax assets due to the recognition of deferred tax liabilities from acquisitions completed during the year, partially offset by income taxes related to foreign and state jurisdictions. We maintain a full valuation allowance on net deferred tax assets of our U.S. and the majority of our international entities as we have concluded that it is not more likely than not that the deferred assets will be utilized.\nFiscal Years Ended January 31, 2020 and 2019\nFor a comparison of our results of operations for the fiscal years ended January 31, 2020 and 2019, see Item 7, Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2020, filed with the SEC on March 20, 2020.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nOur principal sources of liquidity are cash, cash equivalents, marketable securities, and cash generated from operations. As of January 31, 2021, we had cash and cash equivalents of $323.3 million, and marketable securities of $283.0 million. In November 2020, we completed the acquisition of LLamasoft, Inc. In connection with the completion of the acquisition, we paid approximately $791.5 million in cash and issued approximately 2.4 million shares of our common stock.\nWe had outstanding 2023 Notes, 2025 Notes and 2026 Notes with principal amounts of $8.8 million, $805.0 million and $1,380.0 million, respectively, as of January 31, 2021.\nAs of January 31, 2021, the remaining 2023 Notes with a principal amount of $8.8 million and 2025 Notes with a principal amount of $805.0 million are convertible at the option of the holders. We have the ability to settle the Convertible Notes in cash, shares of our common stock, or a combination of cash and shares of our common stock at our own election. As of January 31, 2021, the unsettled conversion requests related to the 2023 Notes and 2025 Notes were not material. From February 1, 2021 to the date of this Annual Report, we have not received additional requests on either of the 2023 Notes or 2025 Notes. The 2026 Notes were not convertible as of January 31, 2021. It is our current intent to settle conversions of the remaining 2023 Notes and the 2025 and 2026 Notes through combination settlement, which involves repayment of the principal portion in cash and any excess of the conversion value over the principal amount in shares of our common stock.\nIn conjunction with the issuance of the Convertible Notes, we entered into capped call transactions that reduce our exposure to additional cash payments above principal balances in the event of a cash conversion of the Convertible Notes. We may owe additional cash to the noteholders upon early conversion if our stock price exceeds $63.821 per share for the 2023 Notes, $295.55 for the 2025 Notes, or $503.42 for the 2026 Notes. Although our incremental exposure to the additional cash payment above the principal amount of the Convertible Notes is reduced by the capped calls, conversion of the Convertible Notes by noteholders may cause dilution to the ownership interests of existing stockholders. We did not exercise the capped calls for the converted 2023 Notes and 2025 Notes. As of January 31, 2021 all the capped calls for the 2023 Notes and 2025 Notes remained outstanding.\nOur cash equivalents are comprised primarily of bank deposits and money market funds. Cash from operations could be affected by various risks and uncertainties, including, but not limited to, the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic and other risks detailed in Part I, Item 1A titled Risk Factors.\u201d However, we believe our existing cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities will be sufficient to meet our projected operating requirements for at least the next 12 months from the filing of this Annual Report.\nOur future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including our pace of growth, subscription renewal activity, the timing and extent of spend to support development efforts, the expansion of sales and marketing activities, the introduction of new and enhanced services offerings and the continuing market acceptance of our services. We continually assess potential acquisitions and expect to continue to pursue acquisitions of or investments in complementary businesses, services and technologies and intellectual property rights. We may be required to seek additional equity or debt financing. In the event that additional financing is required from outside sources, we may not be able to raise it on terms acceptable to us, or at all. If we are unable to raise additional capital when desired, our business, operating results and financial condition would be adversely affected.\nOperating Activities\nCash provided by operating activities for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2021 was $78.2 million compared to $68.2 million for the year ended January 31, 2020. This increase was primarily driven by cash collections from customers, partially offset by approximately $27.4 million repayments of convertible senior notes attributable to debt discount and $19.4 million from one-time payout of legacy unvested stock awards accelerated in conjunction with the LLamasoft acquisition, which were classified as cash outflows in operating activities for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2021.\nInvesting Activities\nCash used in investing activities for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2021 of $661.1 million was primarily related to cash used in the acquisition of ConnXus, Bellin, Much-Net and LLamasoft of $856.7 million, $11.5 million for the purchases of property and equipment, and from $6.9 million release of holdback purchase consideration related to previous business acquisitions, partially offset by $214.0 million of net purchases, maturities and sales of short-term marketable securities.\nFinancing Activities\nCash provided by financing activities for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2021 of $641.8 million was primarily due to net proceeds of $1,355.1 million from the issuance of 2026 Notes, partially offset by $192.8 million proceeds used to purchase the associated capped calls and $555.4 million for repayments and cancellations of the 2023 Notes. In addition, there was approximately $34.9 million of proceeds from the exercise of stock options and issuance of common stock under the ESPP during the fiscal year ended January 31, 2021.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nThrough January 31, 2021, we did not have any relationships with unconsolidated organizations or financial partnerships, such as structured finance or special purpose entities that would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes.\nCommitments and Contractual Obligations\nOur principal commitments and contractual obligations consist of our Convertible Notes, obligations under operating leases for office facilities and contractual purchase obligations for hosting services and web development services that support our business operations. The following table summarizes our non-cancelable contractual obligations as of January 31, 2021.\nTable 28: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Payments due by period </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Total </td> <td> </td> <td>Less Than\n1 Year </td> <td> </td> <td>1-3 Years </td> <td> </td> <td>3-5 Years </td> <td> </td> <td>More Than\n5 Years </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>(in thousands) </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Convertible senior notes (1)\n</td> <td>$ </td> <td>2,193,831 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2,957 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>5,877 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>804,997 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,380,000 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Aggregate interest obligation(1)(2)\n</td> <td>32,532 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6,204 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>12,387 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>11,353 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,588 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating lease obligations </td> <td>49,217 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>14,060 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>23,727 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>9,125 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,305 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Purchase obligations </td> <td>40,287 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>15,669 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>23,468 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,150 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total contractual obligations </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2,315,867 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>38,890 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>65,459 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>826,625 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,384,893 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\n(1)The conversion period for the 2023 Notes and 2025 Notes was open as of January 31, 2021, and as such the net carrying value of the 2023 Notes and 2025 Notes are included within current liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet. The principal balances of $8.8 million and $805.0 million of the 2023 Notes and 2025 Notes, respectively, were reflected in the payment period in the table above based on the contractual maturity assuming no conversion or repurchase.\n(2)Represents estimated aggregate interest obligations for our outstanding Convertible Notes that are payable in cash.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nOur management's discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, as well as the reported revenues generated and expenses incurred during the reporting periods. Our estimates are based on our historical experience and on various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. We believe that the accounting policies discussed below are critical to understanding our historical and future performance, as these policies relate to the more significant areas involving management's judgments and estimates.\nRevenue Recognition\nWe derive our revenues primarily from subscription fees, professional services fees and other. Revenues are recognized when control of these services are transferred to our customers in an amount that reflects the consideration we expect to be entitled to in exchange for those services. Revenues are recognized net of applicable taxes imposed on the related transaction. Our revenue recognition policy follows guidance from Accounting Standards Codification 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606).\nWe determine revenue recognition through the following five-step framework:\n\u2022 Identification of the contract, or contracts, with a customer;\n\u2022 Identification of the performance obligations in the contract;\n\u2022 Determination of the transaction price;\n\u2022 Allocation of the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract; and\n\u2022 Recognition of revenue when, or as, we satisfy a performance obligation.\nSubscription Revenues\nWe offer subscriptions to our cloud-based business spend management platform, including procurement, invoicing, expense management and pay. Subscription services revenues consist primarily of fees to provide our customers access to our cloud-based platform, which includes routine customer support. Subscription service contracts do not provide customers with the right to take possession of the software, are non-cancelable, and do not contain general rights of return. Generally subscription revenues are recognized ratably over the contractual term of the arrangement, beginning on the date that the service is made available to the customer. Subscription contracts typically have a term of three years with invoicing occurring in annual installments at the beginning of each year in the subscription period.\nSubscription revenues also include fees to provide post-contract customer support related to the term-based licenses. The post-contract customer support revenues are recognized ratably over the contract term beginning on the license delivery date.\nProfessional Services Revenues and Other\nWe offer professional services which include deployment services, optimization services, and training. Professional services are generally sold on a time-and-materials basis or fixed-fee basis. For services billed on a fixed-fee basis, invoicing typically occurs in advance, and revenue is recognized over time based on the proportion performed. For services billed on a time-and-materials basis, revenue is recognized over time as services are performed.\nOther revenues include the sales of term-based licenses that we acquired from business combinations. The revenues are recognized at the start of the license term when delivery is complete.\nSignificant Judgments\nOur contracts with customers often include promises to transfer multiple products and services to a customer. For these contracts, we account for individual performance obligations separately if they are distinct. Subscription services, professional services, the right to term-based licenses, and related post-contract customer support are distinct performance obligations that are accounted for separately. In contracts with multiple performance obligations, the transaction price is allocated to each separate performance obligations on a relative standalone selling price (\"SSP\") basis.\nThe determination of standalone selling price for each distinct performance obligations requires judgment. We determine SSP for performance obligations based on overall pricing objectives, which take into consideration market conditions and entity-specific factors. This includes a review of historical sales data related to the size of arrangements, the applications being sold, customer demographics and the numbers and types of users within the arrangements. We use a range of amounts to estimate SSP for performance obligations. There is typically more than one SSP for individual products and services due to the stratification of those products and services by certain considerations such as size and sales regions.\nDeferred Commissions\nCommissions are earned by sales personnel upon the execution of the sales contract by the customer, and commission payments are made shortly after they are earned. Commission costs can be associated specifically with subscription, professional services, and license arrangements. Commissions earned by our sales personnel are considered incremental and recoverable costs of obtaining a contract with a customer. These costs are deferred and then amortized over a period of benefit of five years. We determined the period of benefit by taking into consideration our past experience with customers, future cash flows expected from customers, industry peers and other available information.\nFor commissions earned from the sale of term-based license contracts, we allocate the costs of commission in proportion to the allocation of transaction price of license and PCS performance obligations. Commissions associated with the license component are expensed at the time the related revenue is recognized. Commissions allocated to PCS are deferred and then amortized over a period of benefit of five years.\nWe capitalized commission costs of $24.2 million, and $26.2 million and amortized $14.7 million and $9.6 million to sales and marketing expense in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations during the years ended January 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively.\nBusiness Combinations\nWe account for acquisitions of entities that include inputs and processes and have the ability to create outputs as business combinations. For acquired businesses, we record tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values at the acquisition dates. The excess of the purchase price over those fair values is recorded as goodwill. During the measurement period, which may be up to one year from the acquisition date, we may record adjustments to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed with the corresponding offset to goodwill. Upon the conclusion of the measurement period or final determination of the values of assets acquired or liabilities assumed, whichever comes first, any subsequent adjustments are recorded to the consolidated statements of operations.\nAccounting for business combinations requires our management to make significant estimates and assumptions at the acquisition date, including estimated fair value of acquired intangible assets, and related amortization period. The estimates of fair value require management to also make estimates of, among other things, future expected cash flows, discount rates or expected costs to reproduce an asset. Although we believe the assumptions and estimates we have made in the past have been reasonable and appropriate, these estimates are based on historical experience and information obtained from the management of the acquired companies and are inherently uncertain.\nWe review goodwill for impairment annually during the fourth quarter or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances would more likely than not reduce the fair value of our single reporting unit below its carrying value. As of January 31, 2021, no impairment of goodwill has been identified.\nAcquired finite-lived intangible assets are amortized over their estimated useful lives. We evaluate the recoverability of our intangible assets for possible impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable. We have not recorded any significant impairment charges during the years presented.\nIn addition to the recoverability assessment, we routinely review the remaining estimated useful lives of our finite-lived intangible assets. If we modify the estimated useful life assumption for any asset, the remaining unamortized balance would be amortized over the revised estimated useful life.\nConvertible Notes\nWe account for the issued convertible senior notes ( Convertible Notes\u201d) as separate liability and equity components. The carrying amount of the liability component was calculated by measuring the fair value of a similar liability that does not have an associated convertible feature using a discounted cash flow model with a discount rate associated with each convertible note. The discount rates were determined primarily using observable yields for stand-alone debt instruments with a comparable credit rating and term. In addition, for the 2026 Notes, the Company also used lattice models to determine the discount rate. The carrying amount of the equity component representing the conversion option was determined by deducting the fair value of the liability component from the par value of the Convertible Notes as a whole. This difference represents a debt discount that is amortized to interest expense over the term of the Convertible Notes using the effective interest rate method. The equity component is not remeasured as long as it continues to meet the conditions for equity classification. We allocated issuance costs incurred to the liability and equity components. Issuance costs attributable to the liability component are being amortized to expense over the respective term of the Convertible Notes, and issuance costs attributable to the equity components were netted with the respective equity component in additional paid in capital.\nTo the extent that we receive note conversion requests prior to the maturity of the Convertible Notes, a portion of the equity component is classified as temporary equity, which is measured as the difference between the principal and net carrying amount of the notes requested for conversion. Upon settlement of the conversion requests, the difference between the fair value and the amortized book value of the liability component of the Convertible Notes requested for conversion is recorded as a gain or loss on early note conversion. The fair value of the Convertible Notes are measured based on a similar liability that does not have an associated convertible feature over the remaining term of the Convertible Notes.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nRefer to Note 2, Significant Accounting Policies\u201d in the notes to consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report for analysis of recent accounting pronouncements that are applicable to our business.", "item_7_text": "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nThe following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes appearing elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. As discussed in the section titled Note About Forward-Looking Statements,\u201d the following discussion and analysis contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties, as well as assumptions that, if they never materialize or prove incorrect, could cause our results to differ materially from those expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause or contribute to these differences include, but are not limited to, impacts on our business and general economic conditions due to the current COVID-19 pandemic, those identified below, those discussed in Note About Forward-Looking Statements\u201d and those discussed in the section titled Risk Factors\u201d under Part I, Item 1A in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nThis section of this Form 10-K generally discusses fiscal 2021 and 2020 items and year-to-year comparisons between fiscal 2021 and 2020. Discussions of fiscal 2019 items and year-to-year comparisons between fiscal 2020 and fiscal 2019 that are not included in this Form 10-K can be found in Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d in Part II, Item 7 of the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2020.\nOverview\nWe are a leading provider of Business Spend Management ( BSM\u201d) solutions. We offer a comprehensive, cloud-based BSM platform that has connected our customers with more than seven million suppliers globally. Our platform provides greater visibility into and control over how companies spend money, optimize supply chains, and manage liquidity. Using our platform, businesses are able to achieve real, measurable value and savings that drive their profitability.\nWe refer to the process companies use to purchase goods and services as business spend management and to the money that they manage with this process as spend under management. Our BSM platform delivers a broad range of capabilities that would typically require the purchase and use of multiple disparate point applications. The core of our platform consists of procurement, invoicing, expense management, and payment solutions that form the transactional engine for managing a company's business spend. In addition, our platform offers specialized modules targeted for power users, to help companies manage more technical and strategic areas of BSM, including areas such as strategic sourcing, contract management, contingent workforce, supplier risk management, supply chain design and planning, treasury management, and spend analysis.\nWe also provide purchasing programs, such as Coupa Advantage, which offers access to pre-negotiated discounts from various suppliers, and Source Together, which connects community members to engage in group sourcing events, allowing them to leverage pooled buying power to achieve better contracting terms and capture greater savings. Moreover, through our Coupa Open Business Network, suppliers of all sizes can list their goods and services, establish pricing, and interact with buyers electronically, thus significantly reducing paper, improving operating efficiencies, and reducing costs.\nWe offer access to our platform under a Software-as-a-Service ( SaaS\u201d) business model. At the time of initial deployment, our customers often make a set of common functions available to the majority of their licensed employees, as well as incremental modules for select employees and procurement specialists, whom we refer to as power users. Therefore, we are typically able to capture a majority of the expected annual recurring revenue opportunity at the inception of our customer relationships, rather than targeting specific power users at the outset of the customer relationship with the intention of expanding and capturing more annual recurring revenue at later stages of the customer relationship. Customers can rapidly implement our platform, with implementation periods typically ranging from a few weeks to several months. Customers also benefit from software updates that typically require little downtime.\nWe market and sell our solutions to a broad range of enterprises worldwide. We have a diverse, multi-national customer base spanning various sizes and industries and no significant customer concentration. No customer accounted for more than 10% of our total revenues for the years ended January 31, 2021, and 2020, respectively.\nWe market our platform primarily through a direct sales force and also benefit from leads driven by our partner ecosystem. Our initial contract terms are typically three years, although some customers commit for longer or shorter periods. The large majority of our customers pay annually, one year in advance. Our subscription fee includes access to our service, technical support and management of the hosting infrastructure. We generally recognize revenues from our subscription fees ratably over the contractual term of the arrangement. We do not charge suppliers who are on our platform to transact with our customers. We believe this approach helps attract more suppliers to our platform and increases the value of our platform to customers.\nWe have continued to make significant expenditures and investments for long-term growth, including investment in our platform and infrastructure to deliver new functionality and modules to meet the evolving needs of our customers and to take advantage of our market opportunity. We intend to continue to increase our investment in sales and marketing, as we further expand our sales teams, increase our marketing activities, and grow our international operations. Internationally, we currently offer our platform in Europe, the Middle East and Africa, Latin America and Asia-Pacific, including Japan. The combined revenues from non-U.S. regions, as determined based on the billing address of our customers, constituted 38% and 36%, respectively, of our total revenues for the years ended January 31, 2021 and 2020. We believe there is further opportunity to increase our international revenues in absolute dollars and as a percentage of our total revenues. As a result, we are increasingly investing in our international operations and we intend to expand our footprint in international markets.\nOperating in international markets requires significant resources and management attention and will subject us to regulatory, economic and political risks that are different from those in the United States. While we are gaining additional experience with international operations, our international expansion efforts may not be successful in creating additional demand for our platform outside of the United States or in effectively selling subscriptions to our platform in any or all of the international markets we enter.\nIn late 2019, a novel strain of the coronavirus disease ( COVID-19\u201d) was identified in China, and in March 2020, the World Health Organization characterized the COVID-19 outbreak as a pandemic. The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in authorities implementing numerous measures to try to contain and mitigate the virus, including travel bans and restrictions, business shut-downs and limitations, quarantines, and shelter-in-place and social distancing orders.\nThe extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic may impact our financial condition or results of operations in future periods remains uncertain. The effect of the COVID-19 pandemic may not be fully reflected in our results of operations and overall financial performance until future periods. We may experience decreased customer demand, reduced customer spend, customer bankruptcies and other non-payment situations, shorter contract duration, longer sales cycles and extended payment terms, any of which could materially adversely impact our business, results of operations and overall financial performance in future periods. The extent and continued impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our operational and financial performance will depend in part on future developments and conditions, including the duration and spread of the outbreak; government responses to the pandemic; the impact on our customers and our sales cycles; extent of delays in hiring and onboarding new employees; and effect on our partners, vendors and supply chains, all of which are uncertain and difficult to predict. Additionally, due to concerns over the COVID-19 pandemic, we have replaced our in-person, annual Inspire conferences and other in-person marketing events with web-based alternatives. In the first quarter of fiscal 2021, we closed our offices globally and required our employees to work remotely. These changes remained in effect throughout the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021 and are expected to extend into future quarters. The impact, if any, of these and any additional operational changes we may implement is uncertain, but changes we have implemented to date have not materially impaired and are not expected to materially impair our ability to maintain operations, including financial reporting systems, internal control over financial reporting and disclosure controls and procedures. See the section Risk Factors\u201d for further discussion of the possible impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business.\nRecent Business Developments\nIn May 2020, we acquired all of the equity interest in ConnXus, Inc. ( ConnXus\u201d), a cloud-based supplier relationship management platform that enables enterprises, health systems and government agencies to monitor all aspects of their supplier diversity compliance programs. The purchase consideration was approximately $10.0 million in cash of which approximately $1.4 million is being held back by the Company for fifteen months after the transaction closing date.\nIn June 2020, we acquired all of the equity interest in Bellin Treasury International GmbH ( Bellin\u201d), a cloud-based treasury management software platform that improves visibility and control over cash and optimizes treasury processes. The purchase consideration was approximately $121.0 million, comprised of $79.1 million in cash (of which $8.0 million is being held in escrow for eighteen months after the transaction closing date) and 186,300 shares of our common stock with a fair value of approximately $41.8 million as of the transaction close date.\nIn June 2020, we issued $1,380.0 million aggregate principal amount of our 0.375% Convertible Senior Notes due 2026. In conjunction with the issuance of these notes, we purchased capped calls at a total price of $192.8 million. The net proceeds from the issuance of the 2026 Notes were $1,162.3 million, net of debt issuance costs, including the underwriting discount, and the cash used to purchase the capped call. In addition, we used proceeds of approximately $450.6 million from the 2026 Notes issuance to repurchase 2023 Notes in an aggregate principal amount of approximately $89.0 million.\nIn September 2020, we acquired all of the equity interest in Much-Net GmbH (\"Much-Net\"), a financial instrument software and service provider that specializes in risk management. The purchase consideration was approximately $4.3 million in cash, which is net of $1.8 million in cash acquired.\nIn November 2020, we completed the acquisition of Laurel Parent Holdings, Inc. and its subsidiaries (\"LLamasoft\"), a supply chain design and analysis software and solutions company. The acquisition strengthens Coupa's supply chain capabilities, enabling businesses to drive greater value through Business Spend Management. In connection with the acquisition, we issued approximately 2.4 million shares of our common stock and paid aggregate cash of approximately $791.5 million. Approximately $15.0 million of the cash paid is being held in escrow for fifteen months after the transaction closing date as security for the former LLamasoft stockholders' indemnification obligations, and approximately $7.5 million of the cash paid is being held in escrow until the completion of final adjustment on the purchase consideration.\nIn February 2021, we completed the acquisition of Pana Industries, Inc. (\"Pana\"), a corporate travel booking solution company that puts an emphasis on the traveler experience. In connection with the completion of the acquisition, we paid aggregate cash of approximately $48.5 million, and issued 23,822 shares of our common stock.\nOur Business Model\nOur business model focuses on maximizing the lifetime value of a customer relationship, and we continue to make significant investments in order to grow our customer base. Due to our subscription model, we recognize subscription revenues ratably over the term of the subscription period. As a result, the profitability of a customer to our business in any particular period depends in part upon how long a customer has been a subscriber on our platform. In general, the associated upfront costs with respect to new customers are higher in the first year than the aggregate revenues we recognize from those new customers in the first year. We believe that, over time, as our customer base grows and a relatively higher percentage of our subscription revenues are attributable to renewals versus new customers or upsells to existing customers, associated sales and marketing expenses and other allocated upfront costs as a percentage of revenues will decrease, subject to investments we plan to make in our business. Over the lifetime of the customer relationship, we also incur sales and marketing costs to manage the account, renew or upsell the customer to more modules and more users. However, these costs are significantly less than the costs initially incurred to acquire the customer. We calculate the lifetime value of our customers and associated customer acquisition costs for a particular year by comparing (i) gross profit from net new subscription revenues for the year multiplied by the inverse of the estimated subscription renewal rate to (ii) total sales and marketing expense incurred in the preceding year. On this basis, we estimate that for each of fiscal 2021 and 2020, the calculated lifetime value of our customers has exceeded six times the associated cost of acquiring them.\nKey Metrics\nWe review the following key metrics to evaluate our business, measure our performance, identify trends affecting our business, formulate business plans and make strategic decisions:\n\nCumulative Spend Under Management\nCumulative spend under management represents the aggregate dollar value of transactions through our core platform for all of our customers collectively since we launched our core platform. We define our core platform for purposes of this metric as our procurement, invoicing and expense management modules. We calculate this metric by aggregating the actual transaction data for purchase orders, invoices and expenses from customers using our core platform. Cumulative spend under management does not include spending data or transactions associated with modules from acquired companies. We regularly review our process for calculating this metric and periodically make adjustments to improve its accuracy. We believe that any such adjustments are immaterial unless otherwise stated.\nThe cumulative spend under management metric presented above does not directly correlate to our revenue or results of operations because we do not generally charge our customers based on actual usage of our core platform. However, we believe the cumulative spend under management metric does illustrate the adoption, scale and value of our platform, which we believe enhances our ability to maintain existing customers and attract new customers.\nRemaining Performance Obligations and Deferred Revenue\nRemaining performance obligations represents the amount of consideration allocated to unsatisfied performance obligations related to non-cancelable contracts, which include both the deferred revenue balance and amounts that will be invoiced and recognized as revenue in future periods. In calculating the remaining performance obligation amount, we elected to apply the two expedients under the revenue standard to exclude remaining performance obligations amounts related to contracts that are twelve months or less and contracts where revenue is being recognized under the as-invoiced method.\nWe generally execute multiple year subscription contracts for our platform and invoice an initial amount at contract signing followed by subsequent annual invoices. At any point in the contract term, there might be amounts that are not due for billing yet. These amounts are not recorded in our consolidated financial statements, and are considered to be part of the remaining performance obligations amount.\nThe remaining performance obligations amount is intended to provide visibility into future revenue streams. We expect remaining performance obligations to fluctuate up or down from period to period for several possible reasons, including amounts, timing, and duration of customer contracts (including changes that we may see to customer contracts as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic), as well as the timing of billing cycles for each order.\nOur deferred revenue consists of amounts that have been invoiced but not yet recognized as revenues as of the end of a reporting period. The majority of our deferred revenue balance consists of subscription revenues that are recognized ratably over the related contractual period.\nTrailing Twelve Months Calculated Billings\nTrailing twelve months calculated billings represents total revenues recognized during the period of consecutive twelve months ended January 31, 2021 and 2020 plus the change in deferred revenue for each of those same periods. Trailing twelve month calculated billings is comprised of subscription contracts with existing customers (including renewal contracts and add-on contracts), subscription contracts with new customers, and contracts for professional services, training and other revenues.\nThe trailing twelve months calculated billings is intended to provide information about our subscription revenue growth over time, and can typically be seen as an early indicator of trends in revenue growth. While trailing twelve months calculated billings can increase as our revenues grow, it may fluctuate up or down from period to period for several reasons, including amounts, timing, and duration of customer contracts (including changes that we may see to customer contracts as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic), as well as the timing of billing cycles for each order.\nCustomers with Annualized Subscription Revenue Above $100,000\nWe define customers with annualized subscription revenue above $100,000 as the total number of customers that contributed subscription revenues in excess of $25,000 during the relevant fiscal quarter, which corresponds to $100,000 on an annualized basis. For purposes of this metric, we generally define a customer as a separate and distinct entity (such as a company or an educational or government institution), a distinct business unit of a large corporation or a partner organization, in each case that has an active contract with us to access our services. Most of the subscription revenue we recognize each quarter is attributable to customers that accounted for more than $25,000 of that revenue during the quarter, and our sales and marketing strategy focuses heavily on the acquisition of customers that have the potential to contribute at least $100,000 in subscription revenues annually. Accordingly, we believe that this metric is a useful tool to aid investors in understanding a key factor that drives changes in our subscription revenues from period to period and in assessing trends in our growth, penetration of our core customer market, and our overall performance. Because the dollar threshold is tied to the actual revenue recognized during a particular quarter, customers that we acquired midway through or at the end of the quarter may not yet be included in this count, even if they have placed orders representing more than $100,000 in annual subscription revenue.\nComponents of Results of Operations\nRevenues\nWe primarily offer subscriptions to our cloud-based BSM platform, including procurement, invoicing and expense management and pay. We derive our revenues primarily from subscription fees and professional services fees.\nSubscription revenues consist primarily of fees to provide our customers access to our cloud-based platform, which includes routine customer support at no additional cost. Term-based licenses are sold as bundled arrangements that include the rights to a term license and post-contract customer support ( PCS\u201d). Accordingly, we allocate the transaction price to each performance obligation. The revenues related to the amount allocated to PCS are included in subscription revenue, which are recognized ratably over the contract term beginning on the license delivery date. Professional services fees and other include deployment services, optimization services, training, and revenues allocated to license component for the sales of term-based licenses. Subscription revenues are a function of renewal rates, the number of customers, the number of users at each customer, the number of modules subscribed to by each customer, and the price of our modules.\nGenerally, subscription fees are recognized ratably as revenues over the contract term beginning on the date the application is made available to the customer. Our new business subscriptions typically have a term of three years, although some customers commit for longer or shorter periods. We generally invoice our customers in annual installments at the beginning of each year in the subscription period. Amounts that have been invoiced are initially recorded as deferred revenue and are recognized ratably over the subscription period. Amounts that will be invoiced and recognized as revenue in future periods are reflected as remaining performance obligations within the notes to our consolidated financial statements.\nProfessional services revenues and other consist primarily of fees associated with the implementation and configuration of our subscription service and revenues allocated to the license component for sales of term-based licenses. Professional services are generally sold on a time-and-materials or fixed-fee basis. Revenue for both time-and-material and fixed-fee arrangements are recognized over-time as the services are performed. We have the ability to reasonably measure progress towards completion of the professional services arrangements. For fixed-fee arrangements, we recognize revenue on the basis of performed hours relative to the total estimated hours to complete satisfaction of the professional service arrangement. For the license component from the sales of term-based licenses, we recognize revenues at the start of the license term when delivery is complete.\nOur professional services engagements typically span from a few weeks to several months. For this reason, our professional services revenues may fluctuate significantly from period to period. The terms of our typical professional services arrangements provide that our customers pay us within 30 days from the invoice date. Fixed-fee services arrangements are generally invoiced in advance. We have made significant investments in our professional services business that are designed to ensure customer success and adoption of our platform. We are continuing to invest in expanding our professional services partner ecosystem to further support our customers. As the professional services practices of our partner firms continue to develop, we expect them to increasingly contract directly with our subscription customers and we incentivize our sales force to further this objective.\nCost of Revenues\nSubscription\nCost of subscription consists primarily of expenses related to hosting our service and providing customer support. Significant expenses are comprised of data center capacity costs; personnel and related costs directly associated with our cloud infrastructure and customer support, including salaries, benefits, bonuses and stock-based compensation; allocated overhead; and amortization of acquired developed technology and capitalized software development costs.\nProfessional Services and Other Cost of Revenues\nCost of professional services and other cost of revenues consist primarily of personnel and related costs directly associated with our professional services and training departments, including salaries, benefits, bonuses and stock-based compensation; the costs of contracted third-party vendors, amortization of acquired developed technology; and allocated overhead. These costs are generally expensed in the period incurred.\nProfessional services associated with the implementation and configuration of our subscription platform are performed directly by our services team, as well as by contracted third-party vendors. In cases in which third-party vendors invoice us for services performed for our customers, those fees are accrued over the requisite service period.\nOperating Expenses\nResearch and Development\nResearch and development expenses consist primarily of personnel costs of our development team, including salaries, benefits, bonuses, stock-based compensation expense and allocated overhead costs. Our cycle of frequent updates has facilitated rapid innovation and the introduction of new modules throughout our history. We have aggressively invested, and intend to continue to invest, in developing technology to support our growth. We capitalize certain software development costs that are attributable to developing new modules and features and adding incremental functionality to our platform, and we amortize such costs as costs of subscription revenues over the estimated life of the new application or incremental functionality, which is typically either two or three years.\nSales and Marketing\nSales and marketing expenses consist primarily of personnel and related costs directly associated with our sales and marketing staff, including salaries, benefits, bonuses, commissions and stock-based compensation. Commissions earned by our sales force that are considered incremental costs for obtaining a non-cancelable subscription contract are deferred and amortized over a period of benefit that we have determined to be five years. For commissions earned from the sale of term-based license contracts, we allocate the costs of commission in proportion to the allocation of transaction price of license and PCS performance obligations. Commissions associated with the license component are expensed at the time the related revenue is recognized. Commissions allocated to PCS are deferred and then amortized over five years. Other sales and marketing costs include promotional events to promote our brand, including our Inspire conferences, web advertising, events, allocated overhead and amortization of customer relationships and trademark.\nGeneral and Administrative\nGeneral and administrative expenses consist of personnel costs and related expenses for executive, finance, legal, human resources, recruiting, and administrative personnel, including salaries, benefits, bonuses and stock-based compensation expense; professional fees for external legal, accounting, recruiting and other consulting services and allocated overhead costs. During fiscal 2021, general and administrative expenses included a benefit of $12.5 million related to the reversal of the Yapta contingent consideration payable, as explained in Note 4, Business Combinations\u201d in the notes to our consolidated financial statements.\nInterest Expense\nInterest expense consists primarily of interest expense associated with our outstanding convertible senior notes.\nInterest Income and Other, Net\nInterest income and other, net consists primarily of interest income earned on our investments in marketable securities and cash and cash equivalents, and gain or loss on conversion of convertible senior notes, in addition to the effects of exchange rates on our foreign currency-denominated asset and liability balances which are recorded as foreign currency gains (losses) in the consolidated statements of operations.\nProvision for (Benefit from) Income Taxes\nProvision for income taxes consists primarily of income taxes related to foreign and state jurisdictions in which we conduct business. Benefit from income taxes is primarily related to the release of valuation allowances for deferred tax assets for the year ended January 31, 2021, partially offset by income taxes related to foreign and state jurisdictions. We maintain a full valuation allowance on net deferred tax assets of our U.S. and the majority of our international entities as we have concluded that it is not more likely than not that the deferred assets will be utilized.\nResults of Operations\nThe following tables set forth selected consolidated statements of operations data and such data as a percentage of total revenues for each of the periods indicated:\n\nFiscal Years Ended January 31, 2021 and 2020\nRevenues\n\nTotal revenues were $541.6 million for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2021 compared to $389.7 million for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2020, an increase of $151.9 million, or 39%. Subscription revenues were $470.3 million, or 87% of total revenues, for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2021, compared to $345.3 million, or 89% of total revenues, for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2020. This increase in absolute dollars was predominantly driven by the increase in the number of customers with annualized subscription revenue above $100,000, which was 1,082 as of January 31, 2021, compared to 813 as of January 31, 2020. Professional services and other revenues were $71.3 million for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2021 compared to $44.5 million for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2020. The increase of $26.8 million, or 60%, was primarily due to an increase in implementation services as a result of our expanded customer base.\nWe will continue to monitor the COVID-19 pandemic carefully and its impact on our customers and customer acquisitions.\nCost of Revenues\n\nCost of subscription was $147.4 million for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2021 compared to $89.5 million for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2020, an increase of $57.9 million, or 65%. The increase in cost of subscription was primarily due to an increase of $18.4 million in hosting fees to accommodate increased customer spend, an increase of $18.4 million in amortization of developed technology assets related to acquisitions, an increase of $11.3 million in employee compensation costs related to higher headcount, including stock-based compensation costs, an increase of $5.0 million in license and subscription fees, an increase of $3.6 million in amortization of capitalized development costs, and a $1.2 million increase in other costs driven by our overall growth.\nCost of professional services was $74.3 million for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2021, compared to $49.8 million for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2020, an increase of $24.5 million, or 49%. The increase in cost of professional services was primarily due to an increase of $20.7 million in employee compensation costs related to higher headcount, including stock-based compensation costs, an increase of $6.7 million in amortization of developed technology assets related to acquisitions, and an increase of $1.1 million of other costs. This was partially offset by a decrease of $2.6 million due to a reduction in travel costs due to current travel restrictions associated with the COVID-19 pandemic, and from a decrease of $1.4 million in professional and outside services primarily related to customer implementations.\nWe will continue to monitor the COVID-19 pandemic carefully and its impact on our cost profile in providing hosting solutions and services to our customers.\nGross Profit\n\nGross profit was $319.9 million for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2021, compared to $250.5 million for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2020, an increase of $69.4 million, or 28%. The increase in gross profit was primarily due to the acquisition of new customers with annualized subscription revenue above $100,000. Gross margin was 59% for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2021, compared to 64% for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2020. The decrease in gross margin was primarily due to the increase in amortization of developed technology assets related to acquisitions.\nOperating Expenses\nResearch and Development\n\nResearch and development expenses were $133.8 million for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2021 compared to $93.1 million for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2020, an increase of $40.7 million, or 44%. The increase was primarily due to an increase of $39.3 million in employee compensation costs related to higher headcount, including stock-based compensation costs, an increase of $1.8 million in costs associated with the development of our platform and other costs for research and development activities, an increase in outside services of $1.5 million, and a $1.6 million increase in other costs driven by our overall growth. This was partially offset by a $2.1 million increase in capitalization of development costs and $1.4 million reduction in travel costs due to current travel restrictions associated with the COVID-19 pandemic.\nSales and Marketing\n\nSales and marketing expenses were $236.3 million for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2021, compared to $155.2 million for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2020, an increase of $81.1 million, or 52%. The increase was primarily due to an increase of $66.2 million in employee compensation costs related to higher headcount, including stock-based compensation costs, an increase of $13.9 million increase in customer relationship amortization costs, an increase of $2.4 million in marketing costs, an increase of $1.7 million in hosting fees to accommodate sales related activities, an increase in outside services of $1.7 million, and an increase of $3.5 million in other costs driven by our overall growth. This was partially offset by a reduction in travel costs of $8.3 million due to current travel restrictions associated with the COVID-19 pandemic. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we have replaced our in-person marketing events with web-based marketing and remote events.\nGeneral and Administrative\n\nGeneral and administrative expenses were $116.3 million for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2021 compared to $75.6 million for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2020, an increase of $40.7 million, or 54%. The increase was primarily due to $44.6 million in employee compensation costs related to higher headcount, including stock-based compensation costs, an increase in outside services of $4.0 million, an increase in allowances for doubtful accounts and credit losses of $3.4 million, and from an increase of $1.2 million in other costs driven by our overall growth. This was partially offset by a benefit of $12.5 million arising from the reversal of the Yapta contingent consideration liability during the fiscal year ended January 31, 2021.\nInterest Expense\n\nInterest expense was $91.3 million for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2021, compared to $37.7 million for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2020. The $53.6 million increase in interest expense was primarily due to amortization of the debt discount and issuance costs on the 2026 Notes issued in the second quarter of fiscal 2021, and from the 2025 Notes issued in the second quarter of fiscal 2020, partially offset by a reduction of interest expenses associated with the repurchases and conversions of a portion of the 2023 Notes during fiscal 2021.\nInterest Income and Other, Net\n\nInterest income and other, net was $13.3 million for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2021 compared to $9.3 million for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2020. The $4.0 million increase in interest income and other, net was primarily due to a favorable impact of $5.5 million related to foreign currency exchange, an increase of $3.2 million from early conversions gains on the 2023 Notes, and an increase of $0.3 million in other miscellaneous income, partially offset by a decrease of $5.0 million in income earned from our investments in marketable securities and money market funds primarily as a result of a lower market yield.\nBenefit From Income Taxes\n\nThe benefit from income taxes was $64.4 million for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2021, compared to benefit from income taxes of $10.9 million for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2020. Benefit from income taxes for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2021 is primarily related to the release of valuation allowances for deferred tax assets due to the recognition of deferred tax liabilities from acquisitions completed during the year, partially offset by income taxes related to foreign and state jurisdictions. We maintain a full valuation allowance on net deferred tax assets of our U.S. and the majority of our international entities as we have concluded that it is not more likely than not that the deferred assets will be utilized.\nFiscal Years Ended January 31, 2020 and 2019\nFor a comparison of our results of operations for the fiscal years ended January 31, 2020 and 2019, see Item 7, Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2020, filed with the SEC on March 20, 2020.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nOur principal sources of liquidity are cash, cash equivalents, marketable securities, and cash generated from operations. As of January 31, 2021, we had cash and cash equivalents of $323.3 million, and marketable securities of $283.0 million. In November 2020, we completed the acquisition of LLamasoft, Inc. In connection with the completion of the acquisition, we paid approximately $791.5 million in cash and issued approximately 2.4 million shares of our common stock.\nWe had outstanding 2023 Notes, 2025 Notes and 2026 Notes with principal amounts of $8.8 million, $805.0 million and $1,380.0 million, respectively, as of January 31, 2021.\nAs of January 31, 2021, the remaining 2023 Notes with a principal amount of $8.8 million and 2025 Notes with a principal amount of $805.0 million are convertible at the option of the holders. We have the ability to settle the Convertible Notes in cash, shares of our common stock, or a combination of cash and shares of our common stock at our own election. As of January 31, 2021, the unsettled conversion requests related to the 2023 Notes and 2025 Notes were not material. From February 1, 2021 to the date of this Annual Report, we have not received additional requests on either of the 2023 Notes or 2025 Notes. The 2026 Notes were not convertible as of January 31, 2021. It is our current intent to settle conversions of the remaining 2023 Notes and the 2025 and 2026 Notes through combination settlement, which involves repayment of the principal portion in cash and any excess of the conversion value over the principal amount in shares of our common stock.\nIn conjunction with the issuance of the Convertible Notes, we entered into capped call transactions that reduce our exposure to additional cash payments above principal balances in the event of a cash conversion of the Convertible Notes. We may owe additional cash to the noteholders upon early conversion if our stock price exceeds $63.821 per share for the 2023 Notes, $295.55 for the 2025 Notes, or $503.42 for the 2026 Notes. Although our incremental exposure to the additional cash payment above the principal amount of the Convertible Notes is reduced by the capped calls, conversion of the Convertible Notes by noteholders may cause dilution to the ownership interests of existing stockholders. We did not exercise the capped calls for the converted 2023 Notes and 2025 Notes. As of January 31, 2021 all the capped calls for the 2023 Notes and 2025 Notes remained outstanding.\nOur cash equivalents are comprised primarily of bank deposits and money market funds. Cash from operations could be affected by various risks and uncertainties, including, but not limited to, the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic and other risks detailed in Part I, Item 1A titled Risk Factors.\u201d However, we believe our existing cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities will be sufficient to meet our projected operating requirements for at least the next 12 months from the filing of this Annual Report.\nOur future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including our pace of growth, subscription renewal activity, the timing and extent of spend to support development efforts, the expansion of sales and marketing activities, the introduction of new and enhanced services offerings and the continuing market acceptance of our services. We continually assess potential acquisitions and expect to continue to pursue acquisitions of or investments in complementary businesses, services and technologies and intellectual property rights. We may be required to seek additional equity or debt financing. In the event that additional financing is required from outside sources, we may not be able to raise it on terms acceptable to us, or at all. If we are unable to raise additional capital when desired, our business, operating results and financial condition would be adversely affected.\nOperating Activities\nCash provided by operating activities for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2021 was $78.2 million compared to $68.2 million for the year ended January 31, 2020. This increase was primarily driven by cash collections from customers, partially offset by approximately $27.4 million repayments of convertible senior notes attributable to debt discount and $19.4 million from one-time payout of legacy unvested stock awards accelerated in conjunction with the LLamasoft acquisition, which were classified as cash outflows in operating activities for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2021.\nInvesting Activities\nCash used in investing activities for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2021 of $661.1 million was primarily related to cash used in the acquisition of ConnXus, Bellin, Much-Net and LLamasoft of $856.7 million, $11.5 million for the purchases of property and equipment, and from $6.9 million release of holdback purchase consideration related to previous business acquisitions, partially offset by $214.0 million of net purchases, maturities and sales of short-term marketable securities.\nFinancing Activities\nCash provided by financing activities for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2021 of $641.8 million was primarily due to net proceeds of $1,355.1 million from the issuance of 2026 Notes, partially offset by $192.8 million proceeds used to purchase the associated capped calls and $555.4 million for repayments and cancellations of the 2023 Notes. In addition, there was approximately $34.9 million of proceeds from the exercise of stock options and issuance of common stock under the ESPP during the fiscal year ended January 31, 2021.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nThrough January 31, 2021, we did not have any relationships with unconsolidated organizations or financial partnerships, such as structured finance or special purpose entities that would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes.\nCommitments and Contractual Obligations\nOur principal commitments and contractual obligations consist of our Convertible Notes, obligations under operating leases for office facilities and contractual purchase obligations for hosting services and web development services that support our business operations. The following table summarizes our non-cancelable contractual obligations as of January 31, 2021.\n\n(1)The conversion period for the 2023 Notes and 2025 Notes was open as of January 31, 2021, and as such the net carrying value of the 2023 Notes and 2025 Notes are included within current liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet. The principal balances of $8.8 million and $805.0 million of the 2023 Notes and 2025 Notes, respectively, were reflected in the payment period in the table above based on the contractual maturity assuming no conversion or repurchase.\n(2)Represents estimated aggregate interest obligations for our outstanding Convertible Notes that are payable in cash.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nOur management's discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, as well as the reported revenues generated and expenses incurred during the reporting periods. Our estimates are based on our historical experience and on various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. We believe that the accounting policies discussed below are critical to understanding our historical and future performance, as these policies relate to the more significant areas involving management's judgments and estimates.\nRevenue Recognition\nWe derive our revenues primarily from subscription fees, professional services fees and other. Revenues are recognized when control of these services are transferred to our customers in an amount that reflects the consideration we expect to be entitled to in exchange for those services. Revenues are recognized net of applicable taxes imposed on the related transaction. Our revenue recognition policy follows guidance from Accounting Standards Codification 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606).\nWe determine revenue recognition through the following five-step framework:\n\u2022 Identification of the contract, or contracts, with a customer;\n\u2022 Identification of the performance obligations in the contract;\n\u2022 Determination of the transaction price;\n\u2022 Allocation of the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract; and\n\u2022 Recognition of revenue when, or as, we satisfy a performance obligation.\nSubscription Revenues\nWe offer subscriptions to our cloud-based business spend management platform, including procurement, invoicing, expense management and pay. Subscription services revenues consist primarily of fees to provide our customers access to our cloud-based platform, which includes routine customer support. Subscription service contracts do not provide customers with the right to take possession of the software, are non-cancelable, and do not contain general rights of return. Generally subscription revenues are recognized ratably over the contractual term of the arrangement, beginning on the date that the service is made available to the customer. Subscription contracts typically have a term of three years with invoicing occurring in annual installments at the beginning of each year in the subscription period.\nSubscription revenues also include fees to provide post-contract customer support related to the term-based licenses. The post-contract customer support revenues are recognized ratably over the contract term beginning on the license delivery date.\nProfessional Services Revenues and Other\nWe offer professional services which include deployment services, optimization services, and training. Professional services are generally sold on a time-and-materials basis or fixed-fee basis. For services billed on a fixed-fee basis, invoicing typically occurs in advance, and revenue is recognized over time based on the proportion performed. For services billed on a time-and-materials basis, revenue is recognized over time as services are performed.\nOther revenues include the sales of term-based licenses that we acquired from business combinations. The revenues are recognized at the start of the license term when delivery is complete.\nSignificant Judgments\nOur contracts with customers often include promises to transfer multiple products and services to a customer. For these contracts, we account for individual performance obligations separately if they are distinct. Subscription services, professional services, the right to term-based licenses, and related post-contract customer support are distinct performance obligations that are accounted for separately. In contracts with multiple performance obligations, the transaction price is allocated to each separate performance obligations on a relative standalone selling price (\"SSP\") basis.\nThe determination of standalone selling price for each distinct performance obligations requires judgment. We determine SSP for performance obligations based on overall pricing objectives, which take into consideration market conditions and entity-specific factors. This includes a review of historical sales data related to the size of arrangements, the applications being sold, customer demographics and the numbers and types of users within the arrangements. We use a range of amounts to estimate SSP for performance obligations. There is typically more than one SSP for individual products and services due to the stratification of those products and services by certain considerations such as size and sales regions.\nDeferred Commissions\nCommissions are earned by sales personnel upon the execution of the sales contract by the customer, and commission payments are made shortly after they are earned. Commission costs can be associated specifically with subscription, professional services, and license arrangements. Commissions earned by our sales personnel are considered incremental and recoverable costs of obtaining a contract with a customer. These costs are deferred and then amortized over a period of benefit of five years. We determined the period of benefit by taking into consideration our past experience with customers, future cash flows expected from customers, industry peers and other available information.\nFor commissions earned from the sale of term-based license contracts, we allocate the costs of commission in proportion to the allocation of transaction price of license and PCS performance obligations. Commissions associated with the license component are expensed at the time the related revenue is recognized. Commissions allocated to PCS are deferred and then amortized over a period of benefit of five years.\nWe capitalized commission costs of $24.2 million, and $26.2 million and amortized $14.7 million and $9.6 million to sales and marketing expense in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations during the years ended January 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively.\nBusiness Combinations\nWe account for acquisitions of entities that include inputs and processes and have the ability to create outputs as business combinations. For acquired businesses, we record tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values at the acquisition dates. The excess of the purchase price over those fair values is recorded as goodwill. During the measurement period, which may be up to one year from the acquisition date, we may record adjustments to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed with the corresponding offset to goodwill. Upon the conclusion of the measurement period or final determination of the values of assets acquired or liabilities assumed, whichever comes first, any subsequent adjustments are recorded to the consolidated statements of operations.\nAccounting for business combinations requires our management to make significant estimates and assumptions at the acquisition date, including estimated fair value of acquired intangible assets, and related amortization period. The estimates of fair value require management to also make estimates of, among other things, future expected cash flows, discount rates or expected costs to reproduce an asset. Although we believe the assumptions and estimates we have made in the past have been reasonable and appropriate, these estimates are based on historical experience and information obtained from the management of the acquired companies and are inherently uncertain.\nWe review goodwill for impairment annually during the fourth quarter or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances would more likely than not reduce the fair value of our single reporting unit below its carrying value. As of January 31, 2021, no impairment of goodwill has been identified.\nAcquired finite-lived intangible assets are amortized over their estimated useful lives. We evaluate the recoverability of our intangible assets for possible impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable. We have not recorded any significant impairment charges during the years presented.\nIn addition to the recoverability assessment, we routinely review the remaining estimated useful lives of our finite-lived intangible assets. If we modify the estimated useful life assumption for any asset, the remaining unamortized balance would be amortized over the revised estimated useful life.\nConvertible Notes\nWe account for the issued convertible senior notes ( Convertible Notes\u201d) as separate liability and equity components. The carrying amount of the liability component was calculated by measuring the fair value of a similar liability that does not have an associated convertible feature using a discounted cash flow model with a discount rate associated with each convertible note. The discount rates were determined primarily using observable yields for stand-alone debt instruments with a comparable credit rating and term. In addition, for the 2026 Notes, the Company also used lattice models to determine the discount rate. The carrying amount of the equity component representing the conversion option was determined by deducting the fair value of the liability component from the par value of the Convertible Notes as a whole. This difference represents a debt discount that is amortized to interest expense over the term of the Convertible Notes using the effective interest rate method. The equity component is not remeasured as long as it continues to meet the conditions for equity classification. We allocated issuance costs incurred to the liability and equity components. Issuance costs attributable to the liability component are being amortized to expense over the respective term of the Convertible Notes, and issuance costs attributable to the equity components were netted with the respective equity component in additional paid in capital.\nTo the extent that we receive note conversion requests prior to the maturity of the Convertible Notes, a portion of the equity component is classified as temporary equity, which is measured as the difference between the principal and net carrying amount of the notes requested for conversion. Upon settlement of the conversion requests, the difference between the fair value and the amortized book value of the liability component of the Convertible Notes requested for conversion is recorded as a gain or loss on early note conversion. The fair value of the Convertible Notes are measured based on a similar liability that does not have an associated convertible feature over the remaining term of the Convertible Notes.\nRecent

MD&A report:\n\n- Total revenues for fiscal 2021 were $541.6 million, up 39% from $389.7 million in fiscal 2020. Subscription revenues were $470.3 million (87% of total), professional services were $71.3 million. \n\n- Gross profit was $319.9 million, up 28% from $250.5 million in fiscal 2020. Gross margin was 59%, down from 64% in fiscal 2020 due to increased amortization of acquired technology.\n\n- Operating expenses were $486.5 million, up 50% from $323.9 million in fiscal 2020, driven by increases in R&D, sales & marketing, and G&A expenses. \n\n- Net loss was $180.1 million compared to $90.8 million net loss in fiscal 2020. The increased loss was primarily due to higher operating expenses.\n\n- Cash from operations was $78.2 million compared to $68.2 million in fiscal 2020. Cash used in investing activities was $661.1 million, primarily for acquisitions. Cash from financing was $641.8 million, mainly from convertible debt issuance. \n\n- As of January 31, 2021, the company had $323.3 million in cash & equivalents and $283 million in marketable securities. Outstanding convertible debt was $2.2 billion.\n\n- Key metrics like customers with >$100k in revenue, remaining performance obligations, and trailing 12-month calculated billings all showed strong growth year-over-year.\n\nIn summary, Coupa continued its rapid growth trajectory in fiscal 2021 but losses also increased due to heavy investment in the business. The company maintains a strong balance sheet to fund future growth."}
