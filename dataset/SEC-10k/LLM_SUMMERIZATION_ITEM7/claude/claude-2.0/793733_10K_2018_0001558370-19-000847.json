MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe following discussion and analysis presents factors that had a material effect on our results of operations during the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016. Also discussed is our financial position as of December 31, 2018 and 2017. You should read this discussion in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements, including the notes thereto, appearing elsewhere in this Report or incorporated herein by reference. This discussion and analysis contains forward-looking statements. Please refer to the sections of this Report entitled Cautionary Statement Concerning Forward-looking Statements\u201d and Item 1A. Risk Factors\u201d for discussion of some of the uncertainties, risks and assumptions associated with these statements.\nOverview\nWe have the largest regional airline operation in the United States. As of December 31, 2018, we offered scheduled passenger and air freight service with approximately 2,770 total daily departures to destinations in the United States, Canada, Mexico and the Caribbean. As of December 31, 2018, we had 596 aircraft available for scheduled service consisting of the following (which included 100 ERJ145s and 16 CRJ200s that ExpressJet operated for United and 10 Canadair CRJ700s that ExpressJet operated for American):\nTable 96: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nCRJ200\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nCRJ700\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nCRJ900\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nERJ145\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nE175\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nTotal\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nUnited\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nDelta\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nAmerican\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nAlaska\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nAircraft in scheduled service\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nSubleased to an un-affiliated entity\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nOther*\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nTotal Fleet\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n*As of December 31, 2018, these aircraft have been removed from service and are in the process of being returned under the applicable leasing arrangement or are aircraft transitioning between code-share agreements with our major airline partners.\nOur business model is based on providing scheduled regional airline service under code-share agreements (commercial agreements between airlines that, among other things, allow one airline to use another airline's flight designator codes on its flights) with our major airline partners. Our success is principally centered on our ability to meet the needs of our major airline partners through providing a reliable and safe operation at attractive economics. Over the last several years, our business has evolved as we have added 39 new E175 aircraft and five new CRJ900 aircraft to our fleet since December 31, 2017, and removed 12 ERJ145 aircraft, 20 CRJ700 aircraft and 16 CRJ900 aircraft that were operating under less profitable or unprofitable flying agreements.\nWe anticipate our fleet will continue to evolve, as we are scheduled to add 12 new E175 and 15 new CRJ900 aircraft to existing fixed-fee agreements by the end of 2021. We anticipate these new aircraft will be replacing older CRJ900 and CRJ700 aircraft currently operating under fixed-fee agreements. Our primary objective in the fleet changes is to improve our profitability by adding new aircraft to fixed-fee agreements at improved economics, including the E175 aircraft, while removing aircraft that were operating under less profitable or unprofitable arrangements.\nAs of December 31, 2018, ExpressJet operated 100 ERJ145 aircraft and 16 CRJ200 aircraft under fixed-fee agreements with United and 10 CRJ700 aircraft under a fixed-fee agreement with American. On January 22, 2019, we completed the sale of ExpressJet. In conjunction with the sale of ExpressJet, we retained ownership of the 16 CRJ200 aircraft and the 10 CRJ700 aircraft operated by ExpressJet as of December 31, 2018. ExpressJet retained operation of the 100 ERJ145 aircraft that ExpressJet leased from United. We agreed to lease the 16 CRJ200 aircraft to ExpressJet for up to a five-year period. We are pursuing alternative uses of the 10 CRJ700 aircraft, including but not limited to, using the aircraft under fixed-fee agreements or leasing the aircraft or related engines to third parties.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2018, approximately 48.6% of our aircraft in scheduled service were operated for United, approximately 33.4% were operated for Delta, approximately 12.6% were operated for American and approximately 5.4% were operated for Alaska.\nHistorically, multiple contractual relationships with major airlines have enabled us to reduce our reliance on any single major airline code and to enhance and stabilize operating results through a mix of fixed-fee arrangements and our prorate flying arrangements. For the year ended December 31, 2018, contract flying revenue and prorate revenue represented approximately 84.3% and 15.7%, respectively, of our total flying agreements revenue. On contract routes, the major airline partner controls scheduling, ticketing, pricing and seat inventories and we are compensated by the major airline partner at contracted rates based on completed block hours (measured from takeoff to landing, including taxi time), flight departures and other operating measures.\nOur financial and operating results for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2017 and 2018, and our financial position as of December 31, 2017 and 2018 contained in this Report, include the financial results and position of ExpressJet for those respective periods.\nFinancial Highlights\nWe had total operating revenues of $3.2 billion for the year ended December 31, 2018, a 3.2% increase, compared to total operating revenues of $3.1 billion for the year ended December 31, 2017. We had a net income of $280.4 million, or $5.30 per diluted share, for the year ended December 31, 2018, compared to net income of $428.9 million, or $8.08 per diluted share, for the year ended December 31, 2017. Our results for 2017 included a $246.8 million benefit related to the revaluation of our net deferred tax liability and other tax liabilities in accordance with the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act that was enacted into law in December 2017.\nThe significant items affecting our financial performance during the year ended December 31, 2018 are outlined below:\nRevenue\nThe number of aircraft we have in scheduled service and the number of block hours we generate on our flights are primary drivers to our flying agreements revenue under our fixed-fee arrangements. During 2018, we had a net increase in the number of aircraft operating under fixed-fee agreements. As summarized under the Fleet Activity section below, from December 31, 2017 to December 31, 2018, we removed 48 aircraft from service that were operating under less profitable flying contracts and added 49 aircraft to new or existing fixed-fee arrangements at improved economics. The number of aircraft available for scheduled service increased from 595 aircraft at December 31, 2017 to 596 at December 31, 2018. Our completed block hours decreased 4.5% primarily due to the timing of our fleet transition during 2018. The majority of the aircraft removed from service during 2018 were removed during the first half of the year, whereas the majority of the aircraft added into service were added during the second half of the year.\nDespite the reduction in our block hour production since 2017, our total flying agreements revenue increased 3.2% from 2017 to 2018 primarily due to higher compensation we earned on aircraft, including new aircraft added in 2018, partially offset by a decrease in revenue associated with the aircraft removed from our fleet.\nOperating Expenses\nThe increase in our operating expense from 2017 to 2018 of $13.0 million, or 0.5%, was primarily related to increased compensation paid to our crews since December 31, 2017, an increase in our average fuel costs per gallon on our prorate flying arrangements and an increase in other operating expenses, including pilot recruitment and training costs. Additional details regarding the increase in our operating expenses are described in the section of this Report entitled Results of Operations.\u201d\nFleet Activity\nThe following table summarizes our fleet activity for 2018:\nTable 97: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nAircraft in Service\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nDecember 31, 2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nAdditions\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nRemovals\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nDecember 31, 2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nE175s\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nCRJ900s\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(16) \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nCRJ700s\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(20) \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nCRJ200s\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nERJ145/135s\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(12) \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nTotal\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(48) \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nDuring 2018, we took delivery of 39 new E175 aircraft and five new CRJ900 aircraft and placed the aircraft into service under fixed-fee flying agreements. We removed 16 CRJ900 aircraft from service and returned the aircraft to the lessor. We also removed 20 CRJ700 aircraft from service during 2018 that we either returned to the lessor, are in the process of transitioning to another major airline partner, or are pursuing alternative uses of the aircraft, including, but not limited to, leasing the aircraft or related engines to third parties. The five CRJ200 aircraft added to service during 2018 were temporarily out of service at December 31, 2017. We removed 12 ERJ145s from service and returned the aircraft to the lessor.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nOur significant accounting policies are summarized in Note 1 to our Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Report. Critical accounting policies are those policies that are most important to the preparation of our consolidated financial statements and require management's subjective and complex judgments due to the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. Our critical accounting policies relate to revenue recognition, aircraft maintenance, aircraft leases, impairment of long-lived assets, stock-based compensation expense and fair value as discussed below. The application of these accounting policies involves the exercise of judgment and the use of assumptions as to future uncertainties and, as a result, actual results will likely differ, and could differ materially, from such estimates.\nRevenue Recognition\nFlying agreements and airport customer service and other revenues are recognized when service is provided. Under our fixed-fee and prorate flying agreements with our major airline partners, revenue is considered earned when each flight is completed. A portion of our compensation under our fixed-fee flying agreements is designed to reimburse us for the use of the aircraft we provide under such agreements. This compensation is deemed to be lease revenue, inasmuch as the agreements identify the right of use\u201d or a specific type and number of aircraft over the agreement term. The amount of compensation deemed to be lease revenue is determined from the agreed upon rates for the use of the aircraft included in each fixed-fee agreement, which we believe approximates fair value for the aircraft leases. Under our airport customer service agreements, revenue is considered earned when each flight we provide customer service for departs. Our agreements with our major airline partners contain certain provisions pursuant to which the parties could terminate the respective agreement, subject to certain rights of the other party, if certain performance criteria are not maintained. Our revenues could be impacted by a number of factors, including changes to the applicable code-share agreements, contract modifications resulting from contract renegotiations and our ability to earn incentive payments contemplated under applicable agreements. In the event contracted rates are not finalized at a quarterly or annual financial statement date, we record that period's revenues based on the lower of the prior period's approved rates or our estimate of rates that will be implemented upon completion of negotiations. Also, in the event we have a reimbursement dispute with a major airline partner at a quarterly or annual financial statement date, we evaluate the dispute under established revenue recognition criteria and, provided the revenue recognition criteria have been met, we recognize revenue for that period based on our estimate of the resolution of the dispute. Accordingly, we are required to exercise judgment and use assumptions in the application of our revenue recognition policy.\nMaintenance\nFor the majority of our engines, we have an agreement with a third-party vendor to provide long-term engine maintenance covering scheduled and unscheduled engine repairs, including engine overhauls, operating under our fixed-rate engine contracts (a Power-by-the-Hour Agreement\u201d). Under the terms of the Power-by-the-Hour Agreement,\nwe are obligated to pay a set dollar amount per engine hour flown on a monthly basis and the vendor assumes the obligation to repair the engines at no additional cost to us, subject to certain specified exclusions. Thus, under the Power-by-the-Hour Agreement, we expense the engine maintenance costs as flight hours are incurred on the engines and using the contractual rate set forth in the agreement.\nFor engines not covered under a Power-by-the-Hour-Agreement we use the direct-expense method of accounting for our regional jet aircraft engine overhaul costs. Under this method, the maintenance liability is not recorded until the maintenance services are performed.\nAircraft Leases\nAs of December 31, 2018, our fleet of aircraft in scheduled service included 245 aircraft under lease (including 108 aircraft leased by ExpressJet). In order to determine the proper classification of our leased aircraft as either operating leases or capital leases, we must make certain estimates at the inception of the lease relating to the economic useful life and the fair value of an asset as well as select an appropriate discount rate to be used in discounting future lease payments. These estimates are utilized by management in making computations as required by existing accounting standards that determine whether the lease is classified as an operating lease or a capital lease. All of our aircraft leases have been classified as operating leases, which results in rental payments being charged to expense over the terms of the related leases. Under some of our fixed-fee arrangements, our major airline partners may acquire aircraft from third-parties and lease the aircraft to us for a de minimis amount, and in such cases, no related lease revenue or lease expense is recognized. Under the majority of our operating leases, we are required to meet half-time lease return conditions with the aircraft, which presumes at least 50 percent of the eligible flight time for certain components since the last overhaul remains when the aircraft is returned to the lessor. A liability for probable lease return costs is recorded after the aircraft has completed its last maintenance cycle prior to being returned. Additionally, operating leases are not reflected in our consolidated balance sheet and accordingly, neither a lease asset nor an obligation for future lease payments is reflected in our consolidated balance sheets. See Recent Accounting Pronouncements\u201d set forth below for a discussion of a new accounting standard that is likely to have an impact on our aircraft lease accounting beginning in 2019.\nLong-Lived Assets\nAs of December 31, 2018, we had approximately $5.0 billion of property and equipment and related assets net of accumulated depreciation. In accounting for these long-lived, we make estimates about the expected useful lives of the assets, the expected residual values of certain of these assets, and the potential for impairment based on the fair value of the assets and the cash flows they generate. Factors indicating potential impairment include, but are not limited to, significant decreases in the market value of the long-lived assets, a significant change in the condition of the long-lived assets and operating cash flow losses associated with the use of the long-lived assets. When considering whether or not impairment of long-lived assets exists, we group similar assets together at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities and compare the undiscounted cash flows for each asset group to the net carrying amount of the assets supporting the asset group. Asset groupings are done at the fleet type or contract level. We did not have any impairment charges during the year ended December 31, 2018.\nStock-Based Compensation Expense\nRestricted stock units ( RSUs\u201d) are awarded to eligible employees and entitle the grantee to receive shares of common stock at the end of the vest period. Performance Share Units ( PSUs\u201d) are awarded to certain employees to receive shares of common stock if specific performance targets are achieved. At the end of each performance period, the number of shares awarded can range from 0% to 200% of the original 2018 and 2017 grant amounts for performance share units and can range from 0% to 150% of the original 2016 grant amount for performance shares, depending on the performance against the pre-established targets. The fair value of the RSUs and PSUs are based on the stock price as of the date of grant and cliff vest\u201d after three years. We are required to use judgment and estimates in determining compensation expense for the PSUs based on projected performance compared to the pre-established targets over the measurement period for unvested PSU awards.\nFair value\nWe hold certain assets that are required to be measured at fair value in accordance with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles. We determined fair value of these assets based on the following three levels of inputs:\nTable 98: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nLevel 1-Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nLevel 2-Observable inputs other than Level 1 prices such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities; quoted prices in markets that are not active; or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities. Some of our marketable securities primarily utilize broker quotes in a non-active market for valuation of these securities.\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nLevel 3-Unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair value of the assets or liabilities, therefore requiring an entity to develop its own assumptions.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe utilize several valuation techniques in order to assess the fair value of our financial assets and liabilities. Our cash and cash equivalents primarily utilize quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nSee Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Report for a description of recent accounting pronouncements.\nResults of Operations\n2018 Compared to 2017\nOperational Statistics. The following table sets forth our major operational statistics and the associated percentages of change for the periods identified below. The decrease in block hours, departures and passengers carried during the year ended December 31, 2018, compared to the year ended December 31, 2017, was primarily due to the timing of our fleet transition during 2018. Although our total number of aircraft in service did not significantly change from December 31, 2017 to December 31, 2018, the majority of the aircraft removed from service were removed during the first half of 2018 while the majority of the aircraft added into service were added during the second half of 2018.\nTable 99: <table></table>\nTable 100: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nFor the year ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n% Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nBlock hours\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n1,757,047\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n1,839,779\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(4.5)\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nDepartures\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n1,010,053\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n1,087,052\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(7.1)\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nPassengers carried\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n48,350,470\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n51,483,552\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(6.1)\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nPassenger load factor\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n80.5\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n80.4\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n0.1\n</td> <td>\npts\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nAverage passenger trip length (miles)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n2.1\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOperating Revenues\nThe following table summarizes our operating revenue for the periods indicated (dollar amounts in thousands):\nTable 101: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nFor the year ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$ Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n% Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nFlying agreements\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n3,169,520\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n3,078,297\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n91,223\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n3.0\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nAirport customer service and other\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n52,159\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n44,295\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n7,864\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n17.8\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nTotal operating revenues\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n3,221,679\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n3,122,592\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n99,087\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n3.2\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nFlying agreements revenue primarily consists of revenue earned on flights we operate under our capacity purchase agreements and prorate agreements with our major airline partners.

The decrease in Capacity purchase agreement revenue: aircraft lease\u201d of $19.8 million was primarily due to the timing and number of leased aircraft removed from fixed-fee contracts for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the year ended December 31, 2018. The increase in prorate agreement revenue of $60.3 million was primarily due to the incremental revenue generated from seven CRJ200 aircraft added to our prorate agreements and new prorate agreements at improved economics since December 31, 2017.\nThe $7.9 million increase in airport customer service and other revenues was primarily related to a combination of an increase in volume of airport service agreements and contract rate increases on agreements that were renewed since December 31, 2017.\nIndividual expense components attributable to our operations are set forth in the following table (dollar amounts in thousands).\nTable 103: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nFor the year ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$ Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n% Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nAmount\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nAmount\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nAmount\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nPercent\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nSalaries, wages and benefits\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n1,201,518\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n1,192,067\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n9,451\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n0.8\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nAircraft maintenance, materials and repairs\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n556,259\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n579,463\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(23,204)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(4.0)\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nDepreciation and amortization\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n334,589\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n292,768\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n41,821\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n14.3\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nAircraft rentals\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n154,945\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n215,807\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(60,862)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(28.2)\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nAircraft fuel\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n117,657\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n85,136\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n32,521\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n38.2\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nAirport-related expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n109,605\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n118,374\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(8,769)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(7.4)\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nOther operating expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n272,826\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n250,778\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n22,048\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n8.8\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nTotal operating expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n2,747,399\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n2,734,393\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n13,006\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n0.5\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nInterest expense\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n120,409\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n104,925\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n15,484\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n14.8\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nTotal airline expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n2,867,808\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n2,839,318\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n28,490\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n1.0\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nSalaries, wages and benefits. The $9.5 million, or 0.8%, decrease in salaries, wages and benefits during the year ended December 31, 2018, compared to the year ended December 31, 2017, was primarily due to higher flight crew compensation costs resulting from labor agreements executed during the second half of 2018, which was partially offset by a decrease in direct labor costs resulting from a reduction in departures and block hours.\nAircraft maintenance, materials and repairs. The $23.2 million, or 4.0%, decrease in aircraft maintenance expense during the year ended December 31, 2018, compared to the year ended December 31, 2017, was primarily due to a decrease in scheduled maintenance events and the replacement and repair of aircraft parts and components partially offset by an increase in the percentage of our fleet that is under long-term Power-by-the-Hour maintenance agreements, including the additional 39 E175 aircraft added since December 31, 2017.\nDepreciation and amortization. The $41.8 million, or 14.3%, increase in depreciation and amortization expense during the year ended December 31, 2018, compared to the year ended December 31, 2017, was primarily due to the purchase of 39 additional E175 aircraft and related long-lived aircraft parts in 2018.\nAircraft rentals. The $60.9 million, or 28.2%, decrease in aircraft rentals during the year ended December 31, 2018, compared to the year ended December 31, 2017, was primarily due to a decrease in leased aircraft from 319 leased aircraft for the year ended December 31, 2017, to 260 leased aircraft for the year ended December 31, 2018.\nAircraft fuel. The $32.5 million, or 38.2%, increase in fuel cost during the year ended December 31, 2018, compared to the year ended December 31, 2017, was primarily due to an increase in our average fuel cost per gallon from $2.06 for the year ended December 31, 2017 to $2.60 for the year ended December 31, 2018, along with an increase in the number of prorate flights we operated and the corresponding additional gallons of fuel we purchased. We purchase and incur expense for all fuel on flights operated under our prorate agreements. All fuel costs incurred under our fixed-fee contracts are either purchased directly by our major airline partner, or if purchased by us, we record the direct reimbursement as a reduction to our fuel expense. The following table summarizes the gallons of fuel we purchased under our prorate agreements, for the periods indicated:\nTable 104: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nFor the year ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n(in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n% Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nFuel gallons purchased\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n45,299\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n41,234\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n9.9\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nFuel expense\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n117,657\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n85,136\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n38.2\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nAirport-related expenses. Airport-related expenses include airport-related customer service costs such as outsourced airport gate and ramp agent services, airport security fees, passenger interruption costs, deicing, landing fees and station rents (our employee customer service labor costs are reflected in salaries, wages and benefits). The $8.8 million, or 7.4%, decrease in airport-related expenses during the year ended December 31, 2018, compared to the year\nended December 31, 2017, was primarily due to a decrease in airport terminal rents during the year ended December 31, 2018.\nOther operating expenses. Other operating expenses primarily consist of property taxes, hull and liability insurance, simulator costs, crew per diem, and crew hotel costs. The $22.0 million, or 8.8%, increase in other operating expenses was primarily related to increased pilot recruitment cost, crew training costs, including the cost of hotel rooms, and property tax on additional aircraft added since December 31, 2017.\nInterest Expense. The $15.5 million, or 14.8%, increase in interest expense during the year ended December 31, 2018, compared to the year ended December 31, 2017, was primarily due to the purchase of 39 additional E175 aircraft in 2018 financed through debt.\nTotal airline expenses. Total airline expenses (consisting of total operating and interest expenses) increased $28.5 million, or 1.0%, during the year ended December 31, 2018, compared to the year ended December 31, 2017 primarily related to an increase in our average fuel cost per gallon incurred under our prorate agreements, an increase in flight crew compensation costs and other operating expenses, partially offset by a reduction in departures and block hour production of 4.5% during the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to the year ended December 31, 2017.\nSummary of interest income, other income (expense) and provision for income taxes:\nInterest income. Interest income increased $4.3 million, or 95.7%, during the year ended December 31, 2018, compared to the year ended December 31, 2017. The increase in interest income was primarily related to an increase in interest rates subsequent to December 31, 2017.\nOther Income, net. During the year ended December 31, 2018, we had other income of $3.6 million primarily related to a mark-to-market gain on trading securities and a gain on rotable spare parts sold during the year ended December 31, 2018.\nSummary of provision for income taxes:\nProvision for income taxes. For the year ended December 31, 2018, we recorded an income tax provision of 23%, which includes the statutory federal income tax rate of 21% and other reconciling income tax items, including state income taxes. We recorded a $246.8 million benefit in 2017 related to the revaluation of its net federal, state and other deferred tax liabilities based on the tax effects of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (the Tax Act\u201d). We also recorded a $4.5 million and $5.4 million benefit in 2018 and 2017, respectively, relating to ASU 2016-09 which requires excess tax benefits and deficiencies to be recognized in the income tax provision during the period stock options are vested/exercised.\nNet Income. Primarily due to the factors described above, we generated net income of $280.4 million, or $5.30 per diluted share, for the year ended December 31, 2018, compared to a net income of $428.9 million, or $8.08 per diluted share, for the year ended December 31, 2017.\n2017 Compared to 2016\nOperational Statistics. The following table sets forth our major operational statistics and the associated percentages of change for the periods identified below. The decrease in block hours, departures and passengers carried during the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to the year ended December 31, 2016, was primarily due to a net reduction in our operating fleet from 652 aircraft to 595 aircraft between December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2017.\nTable 105: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nFor the year ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n% Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nBlock hours\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n1,839,779\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n1,938,492\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(5.1)\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nDepartures\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n1,087,052\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n1,153,480\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(5.8)\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nPassengers carried\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n51,483,552\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n53,539,438\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(3.8)\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nPassenger load factor\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n80.4 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n82.1 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n(1.7)\n</td> <td>\npts\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nAverage passenger trip length (miles)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(2.1)\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOperating Revenues\nThe following table summarizes our operating revenue for the periods indicated (dollar amounts in thousands):\nTable 106: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nFor the year ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$ Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n% Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nFlying agreements\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n3,078,297\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n3,010,738\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n67,559\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n2.2\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nAirport customer service and other\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n44,295\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n52,964\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(8,669)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(16.4)\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nTotal operating revenues\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n3,122,592 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n3,063,702 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n58,890\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n1.9\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nFlying agreements revenue primarily consists of revenue earned on flights we operate under our capacity purchase agreements and prorate agreements with our major airline partners.

The increase in Capacity purchase agreement revenue: aircraft lease\u201d of $70.1 million was primarily due to higher aircraft ownership costs. The decrease in prorate agreements revenue of $16.0 million was primarily due to a change in markets from prorate agreements to capacity purchase agreements with higher revenue yields during the year ended December 31, 2017.\nThe $8.7 million decrease in airport customer service and other revenues was primarily related to a decrease in the volume of airport service agreements since December 31, 2016.\nIndividual expense components attributable to our operations are set forth in the following table (dollar amounts in thousands).\nTable 108: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nFor the year ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$ Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n% Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nAmount\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nAmount\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nAmount\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nPercent\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nSalaries, wages and benefits\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n1,192,067\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n1,205,459\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n(13,392)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(1.1)\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nAircraft maintenance, materials and repairs\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n579,463\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n569,306\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n10,157\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n1.8\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nDepreciation and amortization\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n292,768\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n284,969\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n7,799\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n2.7\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nAircraft rentals\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n215,807\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n262,602\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(46,795)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(17.8)\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nAircraft fuel\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n85,136\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n70,701\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n14,435\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n20.4\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nAirport-related expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n118,374\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n122,141\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(3,767)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(3.1)\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nSpecial items\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n465,649\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(465,649)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(100.0)\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nOther operating expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n250,778\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n255,559\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(4,781)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(1.9)\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nTotal operating expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n2,734,393\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n3,236,386\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(501,993)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(15.5)\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nInterest expense\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n104,925\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n78,177\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n26,748\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n34.2\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nTotal airline expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n2,839,318\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n3,314,563\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n(475,245)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(14.3)\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nSalaries, wages and benefits. The $13.4 million, or 1.1%, decrease in salaries, wages and benefits during the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to the year ended December 31, 2016, was primarily due to a decrease in direct labor costs resulting from a net reduction in our fleet size and related level of departures and block hours, which was partially offset by higher crew compensation costs resulting from labor agreements executed since 2016.\nAircraft maintenance, materials and repairs. The $10.2 million, or 1.8%, increase in aircraft maintenance expense during the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to the year ended December 31, 2016, was primarily due to an increase in the number of scheduled maintenance events and an increase in the percentage of our fleet that is under long-term Power-by-the-Hour maintenance agreements, including the additional 21 E175 aircraft added since December 31, 2016, which was partially offset by a decrease in other direct maintenance costs resulting from a reduced fleet size and departures since 2016.\nDepreciation and amortization. The $7.8 million, or 2.7%, increase in depreciation and amortization expense during the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to the year ended December 31, 2016, was primarily due to the purchase of 21 additional E175 aircraft and related long-lived aircraft parts in 2017. Additionally, we acquired 19 E175 aircraft in the fourth quarter of 2016 that only had a partial year of depreciation in 2016.\nAircraft rentals. The $46.8 million, or 17.8%, decrease in aircraft rentals during the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to the year ended December 31, 2016, was primarily due to a decrease in leased aircraft from 415 leased aircraft for the year ended to December 31, 2016, to 319 leased aircraft for the year ended December 31, 2017.\nAircraft fuel. The $14.4 million, or 20.4%, increase in fuel cost during the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to the year ended December 31, 2016, was primarily due to an increase in our average fuel cost per gallon from $1.72 for the year ended December 31, 2016 to $2.06 for the year ended December 31, 2017. The following table summarizes the gallons of fuel we purchased under our prorate agreements, for the periods indicated:\nTable 109: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nFor the year ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n(in thousands, except per gallon amounts)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n% Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nFuel gallons purchased\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n41,234\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n41,074\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n0.4\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nFuel expense\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n85,136\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n70,701\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n20.4\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nAirport-related expenses. The $3.8 million, or 3.1%, decrease in airport-related expenses during the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to the year ended December 31, 2016, was primarily due to a reduction in passenger interruption related costs during the year ended December 31, 2017.\nSpecial items. Special items for the year ended December 31, 2016 included impairment charges and inventory valuation charges related to our 50-seat aircraft and related assets. We did not have comparable special items in 2017.\nOther operating expenses. The $4.8 million, or 1.9%, decrease in other operating expenses was primarily related to the decrease in our fleet size and in other operating costs that resulted from the reduction in block hour production of 5.1%, partially offset by additional training costs associated with E175 aircraft deliveries, including the use of simulators and hotels.\nInterest Expense. The $26.7 million, or 34.2%, increase in interest expense during the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to the year ended December 31, 2016, was primarily due to the purchase of 21 additional E175 aircraft in 2017 financed through debt and an annualized impact of 41 E175 aircraft added throughout 2016 financed through debt.\nTotal airline expenses. Total airline expenses (consisting of total operating and interest expenses) decreased $475.3 million, or 14.3%, during the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to the year ended December 31, 2016 primarily due to the special items of $465.6 million relating to the 50-seat aircraft for the year ended December 31, 2016, and the reduction in fleet size and related block hour production of 5.1% during the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to the year ended December 31, 2016.\nSummary of provision for income taxes:\nProvision for income taxes. On December 22, 2017, the Tax Act was signed into law, which reduced the statutory federal income tax rate from 35% to 21% effective January 1, 2018. We recorded a $246.8 million benefit during 2017 related to the revaluation of our net federal, state and other deferred tax liabilities based on our reasonable estimate of the effects of the Tax Act. We also recorded a $5.4 million benefit in 2017 relating excess tax benefits resulting from vesting employee equity awards and stock options exercised during 2017.\nNet Income (loss). Primarily due to the factors described above, we generated net income of $428.9 million, or $8.08 per diluted share, for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to a net loss of $(161.6) million, or $(3.14) per diluted share, for the year ended December 31, 2016.\nOur Business Segments 2018 compared to 2017:\nFor the year ended December 31, 2018, we had three reportable segments which were the basis of our internal financial reporting.

The facility expires on September 1, 2021 and has a variable interest rate of LIBOR plus 2.5% at December 31, 2018.\nAs of December 31, 2018 and 2017, we had $78.7 million and $87.4 million, respectively, in letters of credit and surety bonds outstanding with various banks and surety institutions.\nAs of December 31, 2018 and 2017, we had no restricted cash.\nSignificant Commitments and Obligations\nGeneral\nThe following table summarizes our commitments and obligations as noted for each of the next five years and thereafter (in thousands):\nTable 141: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nTotal\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nThereafter\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nOperating lease payments for aircraft and facility obligations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n477,946\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n87,256\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n101,741\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n90,787\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n72,593\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n65,749\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n59,820\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nFirm aircraft and spare engine commitments\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n364,023\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n122,498\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n127,585\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n113,940\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nInterest commitments(A)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n660,342\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n129,164\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n113,675\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n98,512\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n84,204\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n68,399\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n166,388\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nPrincipal maturities on long-term debt\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n3,185,438\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n354,072\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n351,738\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n347,835\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n353,935\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n359,677\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n1,418,181\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nTotal commitments and obligations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n4,687,749\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n692,990\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n694,739\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n651,074\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n510,732\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n493,825\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n1,644,389\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 142: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n(A)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nAt December 31, 2018, we had variable rate notes representing less than 0.2% of our total long-term debt.

Rather, we have generally funded our aircraft acquisitions through a combination of operating leases and long-term debt financing. At the time of each aircraft acquisition, we evaluate the financing alternatives available to us, and select one or more of these methods to fund the acquisition. At present, we intend to fund our acquisition of any additional aircraft through cash on hand and debt financing. Based on current market conditions and discussions with prospective leasing organizations and financial institutions, we currently believe that we will be able to obtain financing for our committed acquisitions, as well as additional aircraft. We intend to finance the firm purchase commitment for 12 E175 aircraft with approximately 85% debt and the remaining balance with cash.\nAircraft Lease and Facility Obligations\nWe also have significant long-term lease obligations, primarily relating to our aircraft fleet. At December 31, 2018, we had 260 aircraft under lease with remaining terms ranging from less than one to nine years. Future minimum lease payments due under all long-term operating leases were approximately $477.9 million at December 31, 2018. Assuming a 5.45% discount rate, which is the average rate used to approximate the implicit rates within the applicable aircraft leases, the present value of these lease obligations would have been equal to approximately $399.2 million at December 31, 2018.\nLong-term Debt Obligations\nAs of December 31, 2018, we had $3.2 billion of long-term debt obligations related to the acquisition of aircraft and certain spare engines. The average effective interest rate on those long-term debt obligations was approximately 4.2% at December 31, 2018.\nUnder our fixed-fee arrangements, the major airline partners compensate us for our costs of owning or leasing the aircraft on a monthly basis. The aircraft compensation structure varies by agreement, but is intended to cover either our aircraft principal and interest debt service costs, our aircraft depreciation and interest expense or our aircraft lease expense costs while the aircraft is under contract.\nGuarantees\nWe have guaranteed the obligations of SkyWest Airlines under the Delta Connection Agreement and the United Express Agreement for the E175 aircraft. In addition, we have guaranteed certain other obligations under aircraft financing and leasing agreements.", "item_7_truncated": "ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe following discussion and analysis presents factors that had a material effect on our results of operations during the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016. Also discussed is our financial position as of December 31, 2018 and 2017. You should read this discussion in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements, including the notes thereto, appearing elsewhere in this Report or incorporated herein by reference.

Risk Factors\u201d for discussion of some of the uncertainties, risks and assumptions associated with these statements.\nOverview\nWe have the largest regional airline operation in the United States. As of December 31, 2018, we offered scheduled passenger and air freight service with approximately 2,770 total daily departures to destinations in the United States, Canada, Mexico and the Caribbean. As of December 31, 2018, we had 596 aircraft available for scheduled service consisting of the following (which included 100 ERJ145s and 16 CRJ200s that ExpressJet operated for United and 10 Canadair CRJ700s that ExpressJet operated for American):\nTable 96: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nCRJ200\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nCRJ700\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nCRJ900\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nERJ145\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nE175\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nTotal\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nUnited\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nDelta\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nAmerican\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nAlaska\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nAircraft in scheduled service\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nSubleased to an un-affiliated entity\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nOther*\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nTotal Fleet\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n*As of December 31, 2018, these aircraft have been removed from service and are in the process of being returned under the applicable leasing arrangement or are aircraft transitioning between code-share agreements with our major airline partners.\nOur business model is based on providing scheduled regional airline service under code-share agreements (commercial agreements between airlines that, among other things, allow one airline to use another airline's flight designator codes on its flights) with our major airline partners. Our success is principally centered on our ability to meet the needs of our major airline partners through providing a reliable and safe operation at attractive economics. Over the last several years, our business has evolved as we have added 39 new E175 aircraft and five new CRJ900 aircraft to our fleet since December 31, 2017, and removed 12 ERJ145 aircraft, 20 CRJ700 aircraft and 16 CRJ900 aircraft that were operating under less profitable or unprofitable flying agreements.\nWe anticipate our fleet will continue to evolve, as we are scheduled to add 12 new E175 and 15 new CRJ900 aircraft to existing fixed-fee agreements by the end of 2021. We anticipate these new aircraft will be replacing older CRJ900 and CRJ700 aircraft currently operating under fixed-fee agreements. Our primary objective in the fleet changes is to improve our profitability by adding new aircraft to fixed-fee agreements at improved economics, including the E175 aircraft, while removing aircraft that were operating under less profitable or unprofitable arrangements.\nAs of December 31, 2018, ExpressJet operated 100 ERJ145 aircraft and 16 CRJ200 aircraft under fixed-fee agreements with United and 10 CRJ700 aircraft under a fixed-fee agreement with American. On January 22, 2019, we completed the sale of ExpressJet. In conjunction with the sale of ExpressJet, we retained ownership of the 16 CRJ200 aircraft and the 10 CRJ700 aircraft operated by ExpressJet as of December 31, 2018. ExpressJet retained operation of the 100 ERJ145 aircraft that ExpressJet leased from United. We agreed to lease the 16 CRJ200 aircraft to ExpressJet for up to a five-year period. We are pursuing alternative uses of the 10 CRJ700 aircraft, including but not limited to, using the aircraft under fixed-fee agreements or leasing the aircraft or related engines to third parties.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2018, approximately 48.6% of our aircraft in scheduled service were operated for United, approximately 33.4% were operated for Delta, approximately 12.6% were operated for American and approximately 5.4% were operated for Alaska.\nHistorically, multiple contractual relationships with major airlines have enabled us to reduce our reliance on any single major airline code and to enhance and stabilize operating results through a mix of fixed-fee arrangements and our prorate flying arrangements. For the year ended December 31, 2018, contract flying revenue and prorate revenue represented approximately 84.3% and 15.7%, respectively, of our total flying agreements revenue. On contract routes, the major airline partner controls scheduling, ticketing, pricing and seat inventories and we are compensated by the major airline partner at contracted rates based on completed block hours (measured from takeoff to landing, including taxi time), flight departures and other operating measures.\nOur financial and operating results for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2017 and 2018, and our financial position as of December 31, 2017 and 2018 contained in this Report, include the financial results and position of ExpressJet for those respective periods.\nFinancial Highlights\nWe had total operating revenues of $3.2 billion for the year ended December 31, 2018, a 3.2% increase, compared to total operating revenues of $3.1 billion for the year ended December 31, 2017. We had a net income of $280.4 million, or $5.30 per diluted share, for the year ended December 31, 2018, compared to net income of $428.9 million, or $8.08 per diluted share, for the year ended December 31, 2017. Our results for 2017 included a $246.8 million benefit related to the revaluation of our net deferred tax liability and other tax liabilities in accordance with the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act that was enacted into law in December 2017.\nThe significant items affecting our financial performance during the year ended December 31, 2018 are outlined below:\nRevenue\nThe number of aircraft we have in scheduled service and the number of block hours we generate on our flights are primary drivers to our flying agreements revenue under our fixed-fee arrangements. During 2018, we had a net increase in the number of aircraft operating under fixed-fee agreements. As summarized under the Fleet Activity section below, from December 31, 2017 to December 31, 2018, we removed 48 aircraft from service that were operating under less profitable flying contracts and added 49 aircraft to new or existing fixed-fee arrangements at improved economics. The number of aircraft available for scheduled service increased from 595 aircraft at December 31, 2017 to 596 at December 31, 2018. Our completed block hours decreased 4.5% primarily due to the timing of our fleet transition during 2018. The majority of the aircraft removed from service during 2018 were removed during the first half of the year, whereas the majority of the aircraft added into service were added during the second half of the year.\nDespite the reduction in our block hour production since 2017, our total flying agreements revenue increased 3.2% from 2017 to 2018 primarily due to higher compensation we earned on aircraft, including new aircraft added in 2018, partially offset by a decrease in revenue associated with the aircraft removed from our fleet.\nOperating Expenses\nThe increase in our operating expense from 2017 to 2018 of $13.0 million, or 0.5%, was primarily related to increased compensation paid to our crews since December 31, 2017, an increase in our average fuel costs per gallon on our prorate flying arrangements and an increase in other operating expenses, including pilot recruitment and training costs. Additional details regarding the increase in our operating expenses are described in the section of this Report entitled Results of Operations.\u201d\nFleet Activity\nThe following table summarizes our fleet activity for 2018:\nTable 97: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nAircraft in Service\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nDecember 31, 2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nAdditions\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nRemovals\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nDecember 31, 2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nE175s\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nCRJ900s\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(16) \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nCRJ700s\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(20) \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nCRJ200s\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nERJ145/135s\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(12) \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nTotal\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(48) \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nDuring 2018, we took delivery of 39 new E175 aircraft and five new CRJ900 aircraft and placed the aircraft into service under fixed-fee flying agreements. We removed 16 CRJ900 aircraft from service and returned the aircraft to the lessor. We also removed 20 CRJ700 aircraft from service during 2018 that we either returned to the lessor, are in the process of transitioning to another major airline partner, or are pursuing alternative uses of the aircraft, including, but not limited to, leasing the aircraft or related engines to third parties. The five CRJ200 aircraft added to service during 2018 were temporarily out of service at December 31, 2017. We removed 12 ERJ145s from service and returned the aircraft to the lessor.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nOur significant accounting policies are summarized in Note 1 to our Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Report. Critical accounting policies are those policies that are most important to the preparation of our consolidated financial statements and require management's subjective and complex judgments due to the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. Our critical accounting policies relate to revenue recognition, aircraft maintenance, aircraft leases, impairment of long-lived assets, stock-based compensation expense and fair value as discussed below. The application of these accounting policies involves the exercise of judgment and the use of assumptions as to future uncertainties and, as a result, actual results will likely differ, and could differ materially, from such estimates.\nRevenue Recognition\nFlying agreements and airport customer service and other revenues are recognized when service is provided. Under our fixed-fee and prorate flying agreements with our major airline partners, revenue is considered earned when each flight is completed. A portion of our compensation under our fixed-fee flying agreements is designed to reimburse us for the use of the aircraft we provide under such agreements. This compensation is deemed to be lease revenue, inasmuch as the agreements identify the right of use\u201d or a specific type and number of aircraft over the agreement term. The amount of compensation deemed to be lease revenue is determined from the agreed upon rates for the use of the aircraft included in each fixed-fee agreement, which we believe approximates fair value for the aircraft leases. Under our airport customer service agreements, revenue is considered earned when each flight we provide customer service for departs. Our agreements with our major airline partners contain certain provisions pursuant to which the parties could terminate the respective agreement, subject to certain rights of the other party, if certain performance criteria are not maintained. Our revenues could be impacted by a number of factors, including changes to the applicable code-share agreements, contract modifications resulting from contract renegotiations and our ability to earn incentive payments contemplated under applicable agreements. In the event contracted rates are not finalized at a quarterly or annual financial statement date, we record that period's revenues based on the lower of the prior period's approved rates or our estimate of rates that will be implemented upon completion of negotiations. Also, in the event we have a reimbursement dispute with a major airline partner at a quarterly or annual financial statement date, we evaluate the dispute under established revenue recognition criteria and, provided the revenue recognition criteria have been met, we recognize revenue for that period based on our estimate of the resolution of the dispute. Accordingly, we are required to exercise judgment and use assumptions in the application of our revenue recognition policy.\nMaintenance\nFor the majority of our engines, we have an agreement with a third-party vendor to provide long-term engine maintenance covering scheduled and unscheduled engine repairs, including engine overhauls, operating under our fixed-rate engine contracts (a Power-by-the-Hour Agreement\u201d). Under the terms of the Power-by-the-Hour Agreement,\nwe are obligated to pay a set dollar amount per engine hour flown on a monthly basis and the vendor assumes the obligation to repair the engines at no additional cost to us, subject to certain specified exclusions. Thus, under the Power-by-the-Hour Agreement, we expense the engine maintenance costs as flight hours are incurred on the engines and using the contractual rate set forth in the agreement.\nFor engines not covered under a Power-by-the-Hour-Agreement we use the direct-expense method of accounting for our regional jet aircraft engine overhaul costs. Under this method, the maintenance liability is not recorded until the maintenance services are performed.\nAircraft Leases\nAs of December 31, 2018, our fleet of aircraft in scheduled service included 245 aircraft under lease (including 108 aircraft leased by ExpressJet). In order to determine the proper classification of our leased aircraft as either operating leases or capital leases, we must make certain estimates at the inception of the lease relating to the economic useful life and the fair value of an asset as well as select an appropriate discount rate to be used in discounting future lease payments. These estimates are utilized by management in making computations as required by existing accounting standards that determine whether the lease is classified as an operating lease or a capital lease. All of our aircraft leases have been classified as operating leases, which results in rental payments being charged to expense over the terms of the related leases. Under some of our fixed-fee arrangements, our major airline partners may acquire aircraft from third-parties and lease the aircraft to us for a de minimis amount, and in such cases, no related lease revenue or lease expense is recognized. Under the majority of our operating leases, we are required to meet half-time lease return conditions with the aircraft, which presumes at least 50 percent of the eligible flight time for certain components since the last overhaul remains when the aircraft is returned to the lessor. A liability for probable lease return costs is recorded after the aircraft has completed its last maintenance cycle prior to being returned. Additionally, operating leases are not reflected in our consolidated balance sheet and accordingly, neither a lease asset nor an obligation for future lease payments is reflected in our consolidated balance sheets. See Recent Accounting Pronouncements\u201d set forth below for a discussion of a new accounting standard that is likely to have an impact on our aircraft lease accounting beginning in 2019.\nLong-Lived Assets\nAs of December 31, 2018, we had approximately $5.0 billion of property and equipment and related assets net of accumulated depreciation. In accounting for these long-lived, we make estimates about the expected useful lives of the assets, the expected residual values of certain of these assets, and the potential for impairment based on the fair value of the assets and the cash flows they generate. Factors indicating potential impairment include, but are not limited to, significant decreases in the market value of the long-lived assets, a significant change in the condition of the long-lived assets and operating cash flow losses associated with the use of the long-lived assets. When considering whether or not impairment of long-lived assets exists, we group similar assets together at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities and compare the undiscounted cash flows for each asset group to the net carrying amount of the assets supporting the asset group. Asset groupings are done at the fleet type or contract level. We did not have any impairment charges during the year ended December 31, 2018.\nStock-Based Compensation Expense\nRestricted stock units ( RSUs\u201d) are awarded to eligible employees and entitle the grantee to receive shares of common stock at the end of the vest period. Performance Share Units ( PSUs\u201d) are awarded to certain employees to receive shares of common stock if specific performance targets are achieved. At the end of each performance period, the number of shares awarded can range from 0% to 200% of the original 2018 and 2017 grant amounts for performance share units and can range from 0% to 150% of the original 2016 grant amount for performance shares, depending on the performance against the pre-established targets. The fair value of the RSUs and PSUs are based on the stock price as of the date of grant and cliff vest\u201d after three years. We are required to use judgment and estimates in determining compensation expense for the PSUs based on projected performance compared to the pre-established targets over the measurement period for unvested PSU awards.\nFair value\nWe hold certain assets that are required to be measured at fair value in accordance with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles. We determined fair value of these assets based on the following three levels of inputs:\n Level 1-Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. Level 2-Observable inputs other than Level 1 prices such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities; quoted prices in markets that are not active; or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities. Some of our marketable securities primarily utilize broker quotes in a non-active market for valuation of these securities. Level 3-Unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair value of the assets or liabilities, therefore requiring an entity to develop its own assumptions. \nWe utilize several valuation techniques in order to assess the fair value of our financial assets and liabilities. Our cash and cash equivalents primarily utilize quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nSee Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Report for a description of recent accounting pronouncements.\nResults of Operations\n2018 Compared to 2017\nOperational Statistics.

The decrease in block hours, departures and passengers carried during the year ended December 31, 2018, compared to the year ended December 31, 2017, was primarily due to the timing of our fleet transition during 2018. Although our total number of aircraft in service did not significantly change from December 31, 2017 to December 31, 2018, the majority of the aircraft removed from service were removed during the first half of 2018 while the majority of the aircraft added into service were added during the second half of 2018.\n \nTable 100: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nFor the year ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n% Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nBlock hours\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n1,757,047\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n1,839,779\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(4.5)\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nDepartures\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n1,010,053\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n1,087,052\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(7.1)\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nPassengers carried\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n48,350,470\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n51,483,552\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(6.1)\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nPassenger load factor\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n80.5\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n80.4\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n0.1\n</td> <td>\npts\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nAverage passenger trip length (miles)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n2.1\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOperating Revenues\nThe following table summarizes our operating revenue for the periods indicated (dollar amounts in thousands):\nTable 101: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nFor the year ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$ Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n% Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nFlying agreements\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n3,169,520\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n3,078,297\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n91,223\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n3.0\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nAirport customer service and other\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n52,159\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n44,295\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n7,864\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n17.8\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nTotal operating revenues\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n3,221,679\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n3,122,592\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n99,087\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n3.2\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nFlying agreements revenue primarily consists of revenue earned on flights we operate under our capacity purchase agreements and prorate agreements with our major airline partners.

The decrease in Capacity purchase agreement revenue: aircraft lease\u201d of $19.8 million was primarily due to the timing and number of leased aircraft removed from fixed-fee contracts for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the year ended December 31, 2018. The increase in prorate agreement revenue of $60.3 million was primarily due to the incremental revenue generated from seven CRJ200 aircraft added to our prorate agreements and new prorate agreements at improved economics since December 31, 2017.\nThe $7.9 million increase in airport customer service and other revenues was primarily related to a combination of an increase in volume of airport service agreements and contract rate increases on agreements that were renewed since December 31, 2017.\nIndividual expense components attributable to our operations are set forth in the following table (dollar amounts in thousands).\nTable 103: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nFor the year ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$ Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n% Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nAmount\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nAmount\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nAmount\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nPercent\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nSalaries, wages and benefits\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n1,201,518\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n1,192,067\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n9,451\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n0.8\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nAircraft maintenance, materials and repairs\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n556,259\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n579,463\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(23,204)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(4.0)\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nDepreciation and amortization\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n334,589\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n292,768\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n41,821\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n14.3\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nAircraft rentals\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n154,945\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n215,807\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(60,862)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(28.2)\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nAircraft fuel\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n117,657\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n85,136\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n32,521\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n38.2\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nAirport-related expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n109,605\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n118,374\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(8,769)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(7.4)\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nOther operating expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n272,826\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n250,778\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n22,048\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n8.8\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nTotal operating expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n2,747,399\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n2,734,393\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n13,006\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n0.5\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nInterest expense\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n120,409\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n104,925\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n15,484\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n14.8\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nTotal airline expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n2,867,808\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n2,839,318\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n28,490\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n1.0\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nSalaries, wages and benefits. The $9.5 million, or 0.8%, decrease in salaries, wages and benefits during the year ended December 31, 2018, compared to the year ended December 31, 2017, was primarily due to higher flight crew compensation costs resulting from labor agreements executed during the second half of 2018, which was partially offset by a decrease in direct labor costs resulting from a reduction in departures and block hours.\nAircraft maintenance, materials and repairs. The $23.2 million, or 4.0%, decrease in aircraft maintenance expense during the year ended December 31, 2018, compared to the year ended December 31, 2017, was primarily due to a decrease in scheduled maintenance events and the replacement and repair of aircraft parts and components partially offset by an increase in the percentage of our fleet that is under long-term Power-by-the-Hour maintenance agreements, including the additional 39 E175 aircraft added since December 31, 2017.\nDepreciation and amortization. The $41.8 million, or 14.3%, increase in depreciation and amortization expense during the year ended December 31, 2018, compared to the year ended December 31, 2017, was primarily due to the purchase of 39 additional E175 aircraft and related long-lived aircraft parts in 2018.\nAircraft rentals. The $60.9 million, or 28.2%, decrease in aircraft rentals during the year ended December 31, 2018, compared to the year ended December 31, 2017, was primarily due to a decrease in leased aircraft from 319 leased aircraft for the year ended December 31, 2017, to 260 leased aircraft for the year ended December 31, 2018.\nAircraft fuel. The $32.5 million, or 38.2%, increase in fuel cost during the year ended December 31, 2018, compared to the year ended December 31, 2017, was primarily due to an increase in our average fuel cost per gallon from $2.06 for the year ended December 31, 2017 to $2.60 for the year ended December 31, 2018, along with an increase in the number of prorate flights we operated and the corresponding additional gallons of fuel we purchased. We purchase and incur expense for all fuel on flights operated under our prorate agreements. All fuel costs incurred under our fixed-fee contracts are either purchased directly by our major airline partner, or if purchased by us, we record the direct reimbursement as a reduction to our fuel expense. The following table summarizes the gallons of fuel we purchased under our prorate agreements, for the periods indicated:\nTable 104: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nFor the year ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n(in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n% Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nFuel gallons purchased\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n45,299\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n41,234\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n9.9\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nFuel expense\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n117,657\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n85,136\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n38.2\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nAirport-related expenses. Airport-related expenses include airport-related customer service costs such as outsourced airport gate and ramp agent services, airport security fees, passenger interruption costs, deicing, landing fees and station rents (our employee customer service labor costs are reflected in salaries, wages and benefits). The $8.8 million, or 7.4%, decrease in airport-related expenses during the year ended December 31, 2018, compared to the year\nended December 31, 2017, was primarily due to a decrease in airport terminal rents during the year ended December 31, 2018.\nOther operating expenses. Other operating expenses primarily consist of property taxes, hull and liability insurance, simulator costs, crew per diem, and crew hotel costs. The $22.0 million, or 8.8%, increase in other operating expenses was primarily related to increased pilot recruitment cost, crew training costs, including the cost of hotel rooms, and property tax on additional aircraft added since December 31, 2017.\nInterest Expense. The $15.5 million, or 14.8%, increase in interest expense during the year ended December 31, 2018, compared to the year ended December 31, 2017, was primarily due to the purchase of 39 additional E175 aircraft in 2018 financed through debt.\nTotal airline expenses. Total airline expenses (consisting of total operating and interest expenses) increased $28.5 million, or 1.0%, during the year ended December 31, 2018, compared to the year ended December 31, 2017 primarily related to an increase in our average fuel cost per gallon incurred under our prorate agreements, an increase in flight crew compensation costs and other operating expenses, partially offset by a reduction in departures and block hour production of 4.5% during the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to the year ended December 31, 2017.\nSummary of interest income, other income (expense) and provision for income taxes:\nInterest income. Interest income increased $4.3 million, or 95.7%, during the year ended December 31, 2018, compared to the year ended December 31, 2017. The increase in interest income was primarily related to an increase in interest rates subsequent to December 31, 2017.\nOther Income, net. During the year ended December 31, 2018, we had other income of $3.6 million primarily related to a mark-to-market gain on trading securities and a gain on rotable spare parts sold during the year ended December 31, 2018.\nSummary of provision for income taxes:\nProvision for income taxes. For the year ended December 31, 2018, we recorded an income tax provision of 23%, which includes the statutory federal income tax rate of 21% and other reconciling income tax items, including state income taxes. We recorded a $246.8 million benefit in 2017 related to the revaluation of its net federal, state and other deferred tax liabilities based on the tax effects of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (the Tax Act\u201d). We also recorded a $4.5 million and $5.4 million benefit in 2018 and 2017, respectively, relating to ASU 2016-09 which requires excess tax benefits and deficiencies to be recognized in the income tax provision during the period stock options are vested/exercised.\nNet Income. Primarily due to the factors described above, we generated net income of $280.4 million, or $5.30 per diluted share, for the year ended December 31, 2018, compared to a net income of $428.9 million, or $8.08 per diluted share, for the year ended December 31, 2017.\n2017 Compared to 2016\nOperational Statistics.

The increase in Capacity purchase agreement revenue: aircraft lease\u201d of $70.1 million was primarily due to higher aircraft ownership costs. The decrease in prorate agreements revenue of $16.0 million was primarily due to a change in markets from prorate agreements to capacity purchase agreements with higher revenue yields during the year ended December 31, 2017.\nThe $8.7 million decrease in airport customer service and other revenues was primarily related to a decrease in the volume of airport service agreements since December 31, 2016.\nIndividual expense components attributable to our operations are set forth in the following table (dollar amounts in thousands).\nTable 108: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nFor the year ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$ Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n% Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nAmount\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nAmount\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nAmount\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nPercent\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nSalaries, wages and benefits\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n1,192,067\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n1,205,459\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n(13,392)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(1.1)\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nAircraft maintenance, materials and repairs\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n579,463\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n569,306\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n10,157\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n1.8\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nDepreciation and amortization\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n292,768\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n284,969\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n7,799\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n2.7\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nAircraft rentals\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n215,807\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n262,602\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(46,795)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(17.8)\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nAircraft fuel\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n85,136\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n70,701\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n14,435\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n20.4\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nAirport-related expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n118,374\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n122,141\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(3,767)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(3.1)\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nSpecial items\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n465,649\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(465,649)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(100.0)\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nOther operating expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n250,778\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n255,559\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(4,781)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(1.9)\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nTotal operating expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n2,734,393\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n3,236,386\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(501,993)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(15.5)\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nInterest expense\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n104,925\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n78,177\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n26,748\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n34.2\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nTotal airline expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n2,839,318\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n3,314,563\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n(475,245)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(14.3)\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nSalaries, wages and benefits. The $13.4 million, or 1.1%, decrease in salaries, wages and benefits during the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to the year ended December 31, 2016, was primarily due to a decrease in direct labor costs resulting from a net reduction in our fleet size and related level of departures and block hours, which was partially offset by higher crew compensation costs resulting from labor agreements executed since 2016.\nAircraft maintenance, materials and repairs. The $10.2 million, or 1.8%, increase in aircraft maintenance expense during the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to the year ended December 31, 2016, was primarily due to an increase in the number of scheduled maintenance events and an increase in the percentage of our fleet that is under long-term Power-by-the-Hour maintenance agreements, including the additional 21 E175 aircraft added since December 31, 2016, which was partially offset by a decrease in other direct maintenance costs resulting from a reduced fleet size and departures since 2016.\nDepreciation and amortization. The $7.8 million, or 2.7%, increase in depreciation and amortization expense during the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to the year ended December 31, 2016, was primarily due to the purchase of 21 additional E175 aircraft and related long-lived aircraft parts in 2017. Additionally, we acquired 19 E175 aircraft in the fourth quarter of 2016 that only had a partial year of depreciation in 2016.\nAircraft rentals. The $46.8 million, or 17.8%, decrease in aircraft rentals during the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to the year ended December 31, 2016, was primarily due to a decrease in leased aircraft from 415 leased aircraft for the year ended to December 31, 2016, to 319 leased aircraft for the year ended December 31, 2017.\nAircraft fuel. The $14.4 million, or 20.4%, increase in fuel cost during the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to the year ended December 31, 2016, was primarily due to an increase in our average fuel cost per gallon from $1.72 for the year ended December 31, 2016 to $2.06 for the year ended December 31, 2017. The following table summarizes the gallons of fuel we purchased under our prorate agreements, for the periods indicated:\nTable 109: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nFor the year ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n(in thousands, except per gallon amounts)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n% Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nFuel gallons purchased\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n41,234\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n41,074\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n0.4\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nFuel expense\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n85,136\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n70,701\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n20.4\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nAirport-related expenses. The $3.8 million, or 3.1%, decrease in airport-related expenses during the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to the year ended December 31, 2016, was primarily due to a reduction in passenger interruption related costs during the year ended December 31, 2017.\nSpecial items. Special items for the year ended December 31, 2016 included impairment charges and inventory valuation charges related to our 50-seat aircraft and related assets. We did not have comparable special items in 2017.\nOther operating expenses. The $4.8 million, or 1.9%, decrease in other operating expenses was primarily related to the decrease in our fleet size and in other operating costs that resulted from the reduction in block hour production of 5.1%, partially offset by additional training costs associated with E175 aircraft deliveries, including the use of simulators and hotels.\nInterest Expense. The $26.7 million, or 34.2%, increase in interest expense during the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to the year ended December 31, 2016, was primarily due to the purchase of 21 additional E175 aircraft in 2017 financed through debt and an annualized impact of 41 E175 aircraft added throughout 2016 financed through debt.\nTotal airline expenses. Total airline expenses (consisting of total operating and interest expenses) decreased $475.3 million, or 14.3%, during the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to the year ended December 31, 2016 primarily due to the special items of $465.6 million relating to the 50-seat aircraft for the year ended December 31, 2016, and the reduction in fleet size and related block hour production of 5.1% during the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to the year ended December 31, 2016.\nSummary of provision for income taxes:\nProvision for income taxes. On December 22, 2017, the Tax Act was signed into law, which reduced the statutory federal income tax rate from 35% to 21% effective January 1, 2018. We recorded a $246.8 million benefit during 2017 related to the revaluation of our net federal, state and other deferred tax liabilities based on our reasonable estimate of the effects of the Tax Act. We also recorded a $5.4 million benefit in 2017 relating excess tax benefits resulting from vesting employee equity awards and stock options exercised during 2017.\nNet Income (loss). Primarily due to the factors described above, we generated net income of $428.9 million, or $8.08 per diluted share, for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to a net loss of $(161.6) million, or $(3.14) per diluted share, for the year ended December 31, 2016.\nOur Business Segments 2018 compared to 2017:\nFor the year ended December 31, 2018, we had three reportable segments which were the basis of our internal financial reporting. Our segment disclosure relates to components of our business for which separate financial information was available to, and regularly evaluated by our chief operating decision maker. For the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, our operating segments were SkyWest Airlines, ExpressJet and SkyWest Leasing.

SkyWest Airlines segment profit increased $43.4 million, or 16.5%, during the year ended December 31, 2018, compared to the year ended December 31, 2017. SkyWest Airlines 2018 segment profit was partially impacted by additional profitability from adding 39 E175 aircraft during 2018.\nSkyWest Airlines block hour production increased to 1,380,420, or 11.5%, for 2018 from 1,237,547 for 2017, primarily due to the additional block hour production from the new E175 aircraft added subsequent to December 31, 2017. Significant items contributing to the SkyWest Airlines segment profit are set forth below.\nThe $253.9 million, or 12.1%, increase to SkyWest Airlines operating revenue during 2018, compared to 2017, was primarily due to 39 E175 aircraft placed into service in 2018 and additional aircraft operating under prorate agreements since 2017.\nThe $210.5 million, or 11.5%, increase in the SkyWest Airlines airline expense during 2018, compared to 2017, was primarily due to the following factors:\n \u00b7 SkyWest Airlines' salaries, wages and benefits expense increased by $111.4 million, or 14.7%, primarily due to the additional block hour production along with higher crew compensation costs resulting from labor agreements executed since 2017. \n \u00b7 SkyWest Airlines' aircraft maintenance, materials and repairs expense increased by $30.5 million, or 8.0%, primarily attributable to the additional aircraft engines being placed under Power-by-the-Hour engine maintenance contracts and direct maintenance costs related to the increased volume of block hours, partially offset by a decrease in non-engine scheduled maintenance events and a decrease in the replacement of aircraft parts. \n \u00b7 SkyWest Airlines fuel expense increased $33.4 million, or 39.7%. The increase in fuel cost was primarily due to an increase in the volume of gallons purchased, and an increase in the average fuel cost per gallon in 2017 of $2.60, compared to 2017 of $2.06. \n \u00b7 SkyWest Airlines other operating expense increased $46.5 million, or 27.5%. The increase in other operating expense was primarily related to an increase in pilot recruitment costs, crew training costs including the cost of hotel rooms and crew per diems, and property tax on additional aircraft added since December 31, 2017. \nExpressJet Segment Loss. ExpressJet segment loss decreased $16.8 million, or 51.6%, during the year ended December 31, 2018, compared to the year ended December 31, 2017.\nExpressJet's block hour production decreased to 376,627, or 37.5%, for the year ended December 31, 2018 from 602,232 for the year ended December 31, 2017, primarily due to the reduction in CRJ700, CRJ900 and ERJ145 aircraft from ExpressJet's operations as aircraft were removed from service under its fixed-fee agreements with Delta and American. Significant items contributing to the ExpressJet segment loss are set forth below:\nThe $226.1 million, or 28.6%, decrease in ExpressJet Operating Revenues during 2018, compared to 2017, was primarily due to a 37.5% reduction in block hour production due to a reduced fleet size since 2017.\nThe $242.9 million, or 29.5%, decrease in ExpressJet Airline Expense during 2018, compared to 2017, was primarily due to the following factors:\n \u00b7 ExpressJet's salaries, wages and benefits decreased $100.3 million, or 23.7%. The decrease was primarily due to a decrease in scheduled production subsequent to 2017 that resulted from the decreased number of ERJ145, CRJ700 and CRJ900 aircraft in operation. \n \u00b7 ExpressJet's aircraft maintenance, materials and repairs expense decreased $56.6 million, or 28.4%. The decrease was primarily due to the reduced fleet size and related production subsequent to 2017. \n \u00b7 ExpressJet's aircraft rental expenses decreased $26.7 million, or 77.6%, primarily due to the termination of aircraft leases on CRJ700 and CRJ900 aircraft since 2017. \n \u00b7 ExpressJet's depreciation expense decreased $14.7 million, or 28.3%, primarily due to a reduction in owned 50-seat aircraft and related long-lived assets since December 31, 2017. \n \u00b7 ExpressJet's other airline expenses decreased $24.4 million, or 29.9%, primarily due to a decrease in scheduled production subsequent to 2017. \nSkyWest Leasing Segment Profit. SkyWest Leasing profit increased $10.4 million during the year ended December 31, 2018, compared to the year ended December 31, 2017, primarily due to the additional E175 aircraft revenue attributed to the ownership costs of the E175 aircraft earned under the applicable fixed-fee contract and profitability offset by the E175 aircraft depreciation and interest expense.\nOur Business Segments 2017 compared to 2016:\nFor the year ended December 31, 2017, we had three reportable segments which were the basis of our internal financial reporting.

SkyWest Airlines segment profit increased $240.3 million, or 1,045.0%, during the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to the year ended December 31, 2016. The SkyWest Airlines 2016 segment included $184.3 million of special item expenses associated with the impairment charge of CRJ200 aircraft and related assets. SkyWest Airlines segment profit was also partially impacted by additional profitability from adding 21 E175 aircraft during 2017 and 19 E175 aircraft during the fourth quarter of 2016, which only contributed for a partial year to the 2016 results. SkyWest Airlines also had various flying contract extensions at favorable economics in 2017 compared to 2016.\nSkyWest Airlines block hour production increased to 1,237,547, or 12.0%, for 2017 from 1,105,031 for 2016 primarily due to the additional block hour production from the new E175 aircraft added subsequent to December 31, 2016. Significant items contributing to the SkyWest Airlines segment profit are set forth below.\nThe $213.6 million, or 11.4%, increase to SkyWest Airlines operating revenue during 2017, compared to 2016, was primarily due to 21 E175 aircraft placed into service in 2017 and 19 E175 aircraft added during the fourth quarter of 2016, which only had a partial year impact in 2016 results.\nThe $26.6 million, or 1.4%, decrease in the SkyWest Airlines airline expense during 2017, compared to 2016, was primarily due to the following factors:\n \u00b7 SkyWest Airlines' salaries, wages and benefits expense increased by $80.6 million, or 11.9%, primarily due to the additional block hour production along with higher crew compensation costs resulting from labor agreements executed since 2016. \n \u00b7 SkyWest Airlines' aircraft maintenance, materials and repairs expense increased by $67.8 million, or 21.7%, primarily attributable to the additional aircraft engines being placed under Power-by-the-Hour \n engine maintenance contracts, and an increase in the number of engine events and direct maintenance costs related to the increased volume of block hours. \n \u00b7 SkyWest Airlines aircraft rentals expense decreased $19.2 million, or 9.6%, primarily due to an expiration of 15 aircraft leases subsequent to 2016. \n \u00b7 SkyWest Airlines fuel expense increased $15.1 million, or 21.9%. The increase in fuel cost was primarily due to an increase in the average fuel cost per gallon in 2017 of $2.06, compared to 2016 of $1.72. \n \u00b7 SkyWest Airlines other operating expense increased $21.4 million, or 14.5%. The increase in other operating expense was primarily related to the increased volume of block hours. \n \u00b7 SkyWest Airlines airline expense in 2016 included special items of $184.3 million for impairment charges on its CRJ200 aircraft and write down of certain related assets. SkyWest Airlines did not have any similar special item charges in 2017. \nExpressJet Segment Loss. ExpressJet segment loss decreased $269.0 million, or 89.2%, during the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to the year ended December 31, 2016. The ExpressJet 2016 segment included $281.4 million of special item expenses associated with the CRJ200 and ERJ145 aircraft and write-down of certain assets.\nExpressJet's block hour production decreased to 602,232, or 27.7%, for the year ended December 31, 2016 from 833,461 for the year ended December 31, 2016, primarily due to the removal of CRJ200, CRJ900 and ERJ145 aircraft from operations. Significant items contributing to the ExpressJet segment loss are set forth below:\nThe $253.7 million decrease in ExpressJet Operating Revenues during 2017, compared to 2016, was primarily due to a 24.3% reduction in block hour production due to a reduced fleet size since 2016.\nThe $522.7 million decrease in ExpressJet Airline Expense during 2017, compared to 2016, was primarily due to the following factors:\n \u00b7 ExpressJet's salaries, wages and benefits decreased $94.5 million, or 18.0%. The decrease was primarily due to a decrease in scheduled production subsequent to 2016 that resulted from the decreased number of ERJ145, CRJ200 and CRJ900 aircraft in operation. \n \u00b7 ExpressJet's aircraft maintenance, materials and repairs expense decreased $52.8 million, or 21.0%. The decrease was primarily due to the reduced fleet size and related production subsequent to 2016. \n \u00b7 ExpressJet's aircraft rental expenses decreased $27.6 million, or 44.5%, primarily due to the termination of aircraft leases on CRJ200 and CRJ900 aircraft since 2016. \n \u00b7 ExpressJet's depreciation expense decreased $32.0 million, or 38.1%, primarily due to a reduction in owned 50-seat aircraft and related long-lived assets since December 31, 2016. \n \u00b7 ExpressJet's other airline expenses decreased $26.2 million, or 24.3%, primarily due to a decrease in scheduled production subsequent to 2016. \n \u00b7 ExpressJet's airline expense in 2016 included special items of $281.4 million for impairment charges on certain CRJ200 and ERJ145 long-lived assets and write down of certain related assets. ExpressJet did not have any similar special item charges in 2017. \nSkyWest Leasing Segment Profit. SkyWest Leasing profit increased $52.5 million during the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to the year ended December 31, 2016, primarily due to the additional E175 aircraft\nrevenue attributed to the ownership costs of the E175 aircraft earned under the applicable fixed-fee contract and profitability offset by the E175 aircraft depreciation and interest expense.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nSources and Uses of Cash-2018 Compared to 2017\nCash Position and Liquidity.

Net cash provided by operating activities increased $118.4 million, or 17.3%, during 2018, compared to 2017, primarily due to an increase in pre-tax income from 2018 to 2017 of $78.1 million and changes in our working capital accounts.\nCash Flows from Investing Activities. Net cash used in investing activities increased $232.1 million, or 30.9%, during 2018, compared to 2017, primarily due to the acquisition of 39 E175 aircraft and the related spare aircraft assets during 2017, compared to 21 E175 aircraft and the related spare aircraft assets purchased during 2017, significantly offset by net liquidation of marketable securities, which provided an additional $236.2 million during 2018 compared to 2017. Additionally, during 2017 we received proceeds from the sale of 15 CRJ200 aircraft, eleven EMB120 aircraft, one CRJ700 aircraft and related spare aircraft assets for $52.0 million.\nCash Flows from Financing Activities. Net cash provided by financing activities increased $225.2 million, or 220.3%, during 2018, compared to 2017, primarily related to proceeds from the issuance of long-term debt associated with 39 E175 aircraft acquired during 2018, compared to proceeds from the issuance of debt associated with 21 E175 aircraft acquired during 2017. This increase in cash provided by financing activities was partially offset by an additional $34.4 million and $8.5 million used during 2018 compared to 2017, for the repurchase of common stock and cash paid for income tax withholdings on vested employee equity awards, respectively.\nWe do not anticipate that our sale of ExpressJet in January 2019 will have a significant adverse effect on our liquidity or capital resources.\nSources and Uses of Cash-2017 Compared to 2016\nCash Position and Liquidity.

Net cash provided by operating activities increased $177.5 million, or 35.0%, during 2017, compared to 2016, primarily due to an increase in pre-tax income from 2017 to 2016 and changes in our working capital accounts. Our pre-tax income was $288.2 million in 2017. Our pre-tax loss was $248.8 million in 2016, however our 2016 pre-tax loss included $465.6 million of special charges.\nCash Flows from Investing Activities. Net cash used in investing activities decreased $425.7 million, or 36.2%, during 2017, compared to 2016, primarily due to the acquisition of 21 E175 aircraft and the related spare aircraft assets during 2017, compared to 41 E175 aircraft and the related spare aircraft assets purchased during 2016, partially offset by the proceeds from the sale of 15 CRJ200 aircraft, eleven EMB120 aircraft, one CRJ700 aircraft and related spare aircraft assets during 2017.\nCash Flows from Financing Activities. Net cash provided by financing activities decreased $511.9 million, or 83.4%, during 2017, compared to 2016, primarily related to proceeds from the issuance of long-term debt associated with 21 E175 aircraft acquired during 2017, compared to proceeds from the issuance of debt associated with 41 E175 aircraft acquired during 2016. This decrease in cash provided by financing activities was partially offset by $20.0 million and $5.1 million used in 2017 for the repurchase of common stock and cash paid for income tax withholdings on vested employee equity awards, respectively.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources as of December 31, 2018 and 2017\nWe believe that in the absence of unusual circumstances, the working capital currently available to us, together with our projected cash flows from operations, will be sufficient to meet our present financial requirements, including anticipated expansion, planned capital expenditures, and scheduled lease payments and debt service obligations for at least the next 12 months.\nAt December 31, 2018, our total capital mix was 41.1% equity and 58.9% long-term debt, compared to 42.5% equity and 57.5% long-term debt at December 31, 2017.\nAt December 31, 2018, we had $9.7 million in letters of credit issued under our line of credit facility, which reduced the amount available under the facility to $65.3 million. The facility expires on September 1, 2021 and has a variable interest rate of LIBOR plus 2.5% at December 31, 2018.\nAs of December 31, 2018 and 2017, we had $78.7 million and $87.4 million, respectively, in letters of credit and surety bonds outstanding with various banks and surety institutions.\nAs of December 31, 2018 and 2017, we had no restricted cash.\nSignificant Commitments and Obligations\nGeneral\nThe following table summarizes our commitments and obligations as noted for each of the next five years and thereafter (in thousands):\nTable 141: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nTotal\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nThereafter\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nOperating lease payments for aircraft and facility obligations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n477,946\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n87,256\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n101,741\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n90,787\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n72,593\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n65,749\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n59,820\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nFirm aircraft and spare engine commitments\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n364,023\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n122,498\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n127,585\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n113,940\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nInterest commitments(A)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n660,342\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n129,164\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n113,675\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n98,512\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n84,204\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n68,399\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n166,388\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nPrincipal maturities on long-term debt\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n3,185,438\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n354,072\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n351,738\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n347,835\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n353,935\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n359,677\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n1,418,181\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nTotal commitments and obligations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n4,687,749\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n692,990\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n694,739\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n651,074\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n510,732\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n493,825\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n1,644,389\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n (A) At December 31, 2018, we had variable rate notes representing less than 0.2% of our total long-term debt. Actual interest commitments will change based on the actual variable interest. \nPurchase Commitments and Options\nAs of December 31, 2018, we had a firm purchase commitment for 12 E175 aircraft from Embraer, S.A. with scheduled delivery dates through the end of 2021.\nWe have not historically funded a substantial portion of our aircraft acquisitions with working capital. Rather, we have generally funded our aircraft acquisitions through a combination of operating leases and long-term debt financing. At the time of each aircraft acquisition, we evaluate the financing alternatives available to us, and select one or more of these methods to fund the acquisition. At present, we intend to fund our acquisition of any additional aircraft through cash on hand and debt financing. Based on current market conditions and discussions with prospective leasing organizations and financial institutions, we currently believe that we will be able to obtain financing for our committed acquisitions, as well as additional aircraft. We intend to finance the firm purchase commitment for 12 E175 aircraft with approximately 85% debt and the remaining balance with cash.\nAircraft Lease and Facility Obligations\nWe also have significant long-term lease obligations, primarily relating to our aircraft fleet. At December 31, 2018, we had 260 aircraft under lease with remaining terms ranging from less than one to nine years. Future minimum lease payments due under all long-term operating leases were approximately $477.9 million at December 31, 2018. Assuming a 5.45% discount rate, which is the average rate used to approximate the implicit rates within the applicable aircraft leases, the present value of these lease obligations would have been equal to approximately $399.2 million at December 31, 2018.\nLong-term Debt Obligations\nAs of December 31, 2018, we had $3.2 billion of long-term debt obligations related to the acquisition of aircraft and certain spare engines. The average effective interest rate on those long-term debt obligations was approximately 4.2% at December 31, 2018.\nUnder our fixed-fee arrangements, the major airline partners compensate us for our costs of owning or leasing the aircraft on a monthly basis. The aircraft compensation structure varies by agreement, but is intended to cover either our aircraft principal and interest debt service costs, our aircraft depreciation and interest expense or our aircraft lease expense costs while the aircraft is under contract.\nGuarantees\nWe have guaranteed the obligations of SkyWest Airlines under the Delta Connection Agreement and the United Express Agreement for the E175 aircraft. In addition, we have guaranteed certain other obligations under aircraft financing and leasing agreements.", "item_7_text": "ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe following discussion and analysis presents factors that had a material effect on our results of operations during the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016. Also discussed is our financial position as of December 31, 2018 and 2017. You should read this discussion in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements, including the notes thereto, appearing elsewhere in this Report or incorporated herein by reference. This discussion and analysis contains forward-looking statements. Please refer to the sections of this Report entitled Cautionary Statement Concerning Forward-looking Statements\u201d and Item 1A. Risk Factors\u201d for discussion of some of the uncertainties, risks and assumptions associated with these statements.\nOverview\nWe have the largest regional airline operation in the United States. As of December 31, 2018, we offered scheduled passenger and air freight service with approximately 2,770 total daily departures to destinations in the United States, Canada, Mexico and the Caribbean. As of December 31, 2018, we had 596 aircraft available for scheduled service consisting of the following (which included 100 ERJ145s and 16 CRJ200s that ExpressJet operated for United and 10 Canadair CRJ700s that ExpressJet operated for American):\n\n*As of December 31, 2018, these aircraft have been removed from service and are in the process of being returned under the applicable leasing arrangement or are aircraft transitioning between code-share agreements with our major airline partners.\nOur business model is based on providing scheduled regional airline service under code-share agreements (commercial agreements between airlines that, among other things, allow one airline to use another airline's flight designator codes on its flights) with our major airline partners. Our success is principally centered on our ability to meet the needs of our major airline partners through providing a reliable and safe operation at attractive economics. Over the last several years, our business has evolved as we have added 39 new E175 aircraft and five new CRJ900 aircraft to our fleet since December 31, 2017, and removed 12 ERJ145 aircraft, 20 CRJ700 aircraft and 16 CRJ900 aircraft that were operating under less profitable or unprofitable flying agreements.\nWe anticipate our fleet will continue to evolve, as we are scheduled to add 12 new E175 and 15 new CRJ900 aircraft to existing fixed-fee agreements by the end of 2021. We anticipate these new aircraft will be replacing older CRJ900 and CRJ700 aircraft currently operating under fixed-fee agreements. Our primary objective in the fleet changes is to improve our profitability by adding new aircraft to fixed-fee agreements at improved economics, including the E175 aircraft, while removing aircraft that were operating under less profitable or unprofitable arrangements.\nAs of December 31, 2018, ExpressJet operated 100 ERJ145 aircraft and 16 CRJ200 aircraft under fixed-fee agreements with United and 10 CRJ700 aircraft under a fixed-fee agreement with American. On January 22, 2019, we completed the sale of ExpressJet. In conjunction with the sale of ExpressJet, we retained ownership of the 16 CRJ200 aircraft and the 10 CRJ700 aircraft operated by ExpressJet as of December 31, 2018. ExpressJet retained operation of the 100 ERJ145 aircraft that ExpressJet leased from United. We agreed to lease the 16 CRJ200 aircraft to ExpressJet for up to a five-year period. We are pursuing alternative uses of the 10 CRJ700 aircraft, including but not limited to, using the aircraft under fixed-fee agreements or leasing the aircraft or related engines to third parties.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2018, approximately 48.6% of our aircraft in scheduled service were operated for United, approximately 33.4% were operated for Delta, approximately 12.6% were operated for American and approximately 5.4% were operated for Alaska.\nHistorically, multiple contractual relationships with major airlines have enabled us to reduce our reliance on any single major airline code and to enhance and stabilize operating results through a mix of fixed-fee arrangements and our prorate flying arrangements. For the year ended December 31, 2018, contract flying revenue and prorate revenue represented approximately 84.3% and 15.7%, respectively, of our total flying agreements revenue. On contract routes, the major airline partner controls scheduling, ticketing, pricing and seat inventories and we are compensated by the major airline partner at contracted rates based on completed block hours (measured from takeoff to landing, including taxi time), flight departures and other operating measures.\nOur financial and operating results for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2017 and 2018, and our financial position as of December 31, 2017 and 2018 contained in this Report, include the financial results and position of ExpressJet for those respective periods.\nFinancial Highlights\nWe had total operating revenues of $3.2 billion for the year ended December 31, 2018, a 3.2% increase, compared to total operating revenues of $3.1 billion for the year ended December 31, 2017. We had a net income of $280.4 million, or $5.30 per diluted share, for the year ended December 31, 2018, compared to net income of $428.9 million, or $8.08 per diluted share, for the year ended December 31, 2017. Our results for 2017 included a $246.8 million benefit related to the revaluation of our net deferred tax liability and other tax liabilities in accordance with the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act that was enacted into law in December 2017.\nThe significant items affecting our financial performance during the year ended December 31, 2018 are outlined below:\nRevenue\nThe number of aircraft we have in scheduled service and the number of block hours we generate on our flights are primary drivers to our flying agreements revenue under our fixed-fee arrangements. During 2018, we had a net increase in the number of aircraft operating under fixed-fee agreements. As summarized under the Fleet Activity section below, from December 31, 2017 to December 31, 2018, we removed 48 aircraft from service that were operating under less profitable flying contracts and added 49 aircraft to new or existing fixed-fee arrangements at improved economics. The number of aircraft available for scheduled service increased from 595 aircraft at December 31, 2017 to 596 at December 31, 2018. Our completed block hours decreased 4.5% primarily due to the timing of our fleet transition during 2018. The majority of the aircraft removed from service during 2018 were removed during the first half of the year, whereas the majority of the aircraft added into service were added during the second half of the year.\nDespite the reduction in our block hour production since 2017, our total flying agreements revenue increased 3.2% from 2017 to 2018 primarily due to higher compensation we earned on aircraft, including new aircraft added in 2018, partially offset by a decrease in revenue associated with the aircraft removed from our fleet.\nOperating Expenses\nThe increase in our operating expense from 2017 to 2018 of $13.0 million, or 0.5%, was primarily related to increased compensation paid to our crews since December 31, 2017, an increase in our average fuel costs per gallon on our prorate flying arrangements and an increase in other operating expenses, including pilot recruitment and training costs. Additional details regarding the increase in our operating expenses are described in the section of this Report entitled Results of Operations.\u201d\nFleet Activity\nThe following table summarizes our fleet activity for 2018:\n\nDuring 2018, we took delivery of 39 new E175 aircraft and five new CRJ900 aircraft and placed the aircraft into service under fixed-fee flying agreements. We removed 16 CRJ900 aircraft from service and returned the aircraft to the lessor. We also removed 20 CRJ700 aircraft from service during 2018 that we either returned to the lessor, are in the process of transitioning to another major airline partner, or are pursuing alternative uses of the aircraft, including, but not limited to, leasing the aircraft or related engines to third parties. The five CRJ200 aircraft added to service during 2018 were temporarily out of service at December 31, 2017. We removed 12 ERJ145s from service and returned the aircraft to the lessor.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nOur significant accounting policies are summarized in Note 1 to our Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Report. Critical accounting policies are those policies that are most important to the preparation of our consolidated financial statements and require management's subjective and complex judgments due to the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. Our critical accounting policies relate to revenue recognition, aircraft maintenance, aircraft leases, impairment of long-lived assets, stock-based compensation expense and fair value as discussed below. The application of these accounting policies involves the exercise of judgment and the use of assumptions as to future uncertainties and, as a result, actual results will likely differ, and could differ materially, from such estimates.\nRevenue Recognition\nFlying agreements and airport customer service and other revenues are recognized when service is provided. Under our fixed-fee and prorate flying agreements with our major airline partners, revenue is considered earned when each flight is completed. A portion of our compensation under our fixed-fee flying agreements is designed to reimburse us for the use of the aircraft we provide under such agreements. This compensation is deemed to be lease revenue, inasmuch as the agreements identify the right of use\u201d or a specific type and number of aircraft over the agreement term. The amount of compensation deemed to be lease revenue is determined from the agreed upon rates for the use of the aircraft included in each fixed-fee agreement, which we believe approximates fair value for the aircraft leases. Under our airport customer service agreements, revenue is considered earned when each flight we provide customer service for departs. Our agreements with our major airline partners contain certain provisions pursuant to which the parties could terminate the respective agreement, subject to certain rights of the other party, if certain performance criteria are not maintained. Our revenues could be impacted by a number of factors, including changes to the applicable code-share agreements, contract modifications resulting from contract renegotiations and our ability to earn incentive payments contemplated under applicable agreements. In the event contracted rates are not finalized at a quarterly or annual financial statement date, we record that period's revenues based on the lower of the prior period's approved rates or our estimate of rates that will be implemented upon completion of negotiations. Also, in the event we have a reimbursement dispute with a major airline partner at a quarterly or annual financial statement date, we evaluate the dispute under established revenue recognition criteria and, provided the revenue recognition criteria have been met, we recognize revenue for that period based on our estimate of the resolution of the dispute. Accordingly, we are required to exercise judgment and use assumptions in the application of our revenue recognition policy.\nMaintenance\nFor the majority of our engines, we have an agreement with a third-party vendor to provide long-term engine maintenance covering scheduled and unscheduled engine repairs, including engine overhauls, operating under our fixed-rate engine contracts (a Power-by-the-Hour Agreement\u201d). Under the terms of the Power-by-the-Hour Agreement,\nwe are obligated to pay a set dollar amount per engine hour flown on a monthly basis and the vendor assumes the obligation to repair the engines at no additional cost to us, subject to certain specified exclusions. Thus, under the Power-by-the-Hour Agreement, we expense the engine maintenance costs as flight hours are incurred on the engines and using the contractual rate set forth in the agreement.\nFor engines not covered under a Power-by-the-Hour-Agreement we use the direct-expense method of accounting for our regional jet aircraft engine overhaul costs. Under this method, the maintenance liability is not recorded until the maintenance services are performed.\nAircraft Leases\nAs of December 31, 2018, our fleet of aircraft in scheduled service included 245 aircraft under lease (including 108 aircraft leased by ExpressJet). In order to determine the proper classification of our leased aircraft as either operating leases or capital leases, we must make certain estimates at the inception of the lease relating to the economic useful life and the fair value of an asset as well as select an appropriate discount rate to be used in discounting future lease payments. These estimates are utilized by management in making computations as required by existing accounting standards that determine whether the lease is classified as an operating lease or a capital lease. All of our aircraft leases have been classified as operating leases, which results in rental payments being charged to expense over the terms of the related leases. Under some of our fixed-fee arrangements, our major airline partners may acquire aircraft from third-parties and lease the aircraft to us for a de minimis amount, and in such cases, no related lease revenue or lease expense is recognized. Under the majority of our operating leases, we are required to meet half-time lease return conditions with the aircraft, which presumes at least 50 percent of the eligible flight time for certain components since the last overhaul remains when the aircraft is returned to the lessor. A liability for probable lease return costs is recorded after the aircraft has completed its last maintenance cycle prior to being returned. Additionally, operating leases are not reflected in our consolidated balance sheet and accordingly, neither a lease asset nor an obligation for future lease payments is reflected in our consolidated balance sheets. See Recent Accounting Pronouncements\u201d set forth below for a discussion of a new accounting standard that is likely to have an impact on our aircraft lease accounting beginning in 2019.\nLong-Lived Assets\nAs of December 31, 2018, we had approximately $5.0 billion of property and equipment and related assets net of accumulated depreciation. In accounting for these long-lived, we make estimates about the expected useful lives of the assets, the expected residual values of certain of these assets, and the potential for impairment based on the fair value of the assets and the cash flows they generate. Factors indicating potential impairment include, but are not limited to, significant decreases in the market value of the long-lived assets, a significant change in the condition of the long-lived assets and operating cash flow losses associated with the use of the long-lived assets. When considering whether or not impairment of long-lived assets exists, we group similar assets together at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities and compare the undiscounted cash flows for each asset group to the net carrying amount of the assets supporting the asset group. Asset groupings are done at the fleet type or contract level. We did not have any impairment charges during the year ended December 31, 2018.\nStock-Based Compensation Expense\nRestricted stock units ( RSUs\u201d) are awarded to eligible employees and entitle the grantee to receive shares of common stock at the end of the vest period. Performance Share Units ( PSUs\u201d) are awarded to certain employees to receive shares of common stock if specific performance targets are achieved. At the end of each performance period, the number of shares awarded can range from 0% to 200% of the original 2018 and 2017 grant amounts for performance share units and can range from 0% to 150% of the original 2016 grant amount for performance shares, depending on the performance against the pre-established targets. The fair value of the RSUs and PSUs are based on the stock price as of the date of grant and cliff vest\u201d after three years. We are required to use judgment and estimates in determining compensation expense for the PSUs based on projected performance compared to the pre-established targets over the measurement period for unvested PSU awards.\nFair value\nWe hold certain assets that are required to be measured at fair value in accordance with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles. We determined fair value of these assets based on the following three levels of inputs:\n Level 1-Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. Level 2-Observable inputs other than Level 1 prices such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities; quoted prices in markets that are not active; or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities. Some of our marketable securities primarily utilize broker quotes in a non-active market for valuation of these securities. Level 3-Unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair value of the assets or liabilities, therefore requiring an entity to develop its own assumptions. \nWe utilize several valuation techniques in order to assess the fair value of our financial assets and liabilities. Our cash and cash equivalents primarily utilize quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nSee Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Report for a description of recent accounting pronouncements.\nResults of Operations\n2018 Compared to 2017\nOperational Statistics. The following table sets forth our major operational statistics and the associated percentages of change for the periods identified below. The decrease in block hours, departures and passengers carried during the year ended December 31, 2018, compared to the year ended December 31, 2017, was primarily due to the timing of our fleet transition during 2018. Although our total number of aircraft in service did not significantly change from December 31, 2017 to December 31, 2018, the majority of the aircraft removed from service were removed during the first half of 2018 while the majority of the aircraft added into service were added during the second half of 2018.\n \n\nOperating Revenues\nThe following table summarizes our operating revenue for the periods indicated (dollar amounts in thousands):\n\nFlying agreements revenue primarily consists of revenue earned on flights we operate under our capacity purchase agreements and prorate agreements with our major airline partners. Airport customer service and other revenues primarily consist of revenue earned from providing airport counter, gate and ramp services. Changes in our flying agreements revenue are summarized below (dollar amounts in thousands).\n\nThe increase in Capacity purchase agreements revenue: flight operations\u201d of $50.7 million was primarily due to incremental revenue generated from 39 new E175 aircraft and five new CRJ900 aircraft added to our fleet and economic improvements made to certain existing fixed-fee agreements that were renewed or extended since December 31, 2017, partially offset by the timing of the removal of 48 ERJ145, CRJ700 and CRJ900 aircraft from flying arrangements with a lower revenue per aircraft since December 31, 2017. The decrease in Capacity purchase agreement revenue: aircraft lease\u201d of $19.8 million was primarily due to the timing and number of leased aircraft removed from fixed-fee contracts for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the year ended December 31, 2018. The increase in prorate agreement revenue of $60.3 million was primarily due to the incremental revenue generated from seven CRJ200 aircraft added to our prorate agreements and new prorate agreements at improved economics since December 31, 2017.\nThe $7.9 million increase in airport customer service and other revenues was primarily related to a combination of an increase in volume of airport service agreements and contract rate increases on agreements that were renewed since December 31, 2017.\nIndividual expense components attributable to our operations are set forth in the following table (dollar amounts in thousands).\n\nSalaries, wages and benefits. The $9.5 million, or 0.8%, decrease in salaries, wages and benefits during the year ended December 31, 2018, compared to the year ended December 31, 2017, was primarily due to higher flight crew compensation costs resulting from labor agreements executed during the second half of 2018, which was partially offset by a decrease in direct labor costs resulting from a reduction in departures and block hours.\nAircraft maintenance, materials and repairs. The $23.2 million, or 4.0%, decrease in aircraft maintenance expense during the year ended December 31, 2018, compared to the year ended December 31, 2017, was primarily due to a decrease in scheduled maintenance events and the replacement and repair of aircraft parts and components partially offset by an increase in the percentage of our fleet that is under long-term Power-by-the-Hour maintenance agreements, including the additional 39 E175 aircraft added since December 31, 2017.\nDepreciation and amortization. The $41.8 million, or 14.3%, increase in depreciation and amortization expense during the year ended December 31, 2018, compared to the year ended December 31, 2017, was primarily due to the purchase of 39 additional E175 aircraft and related long-lived aircraft parts in 2018.\nAircraft rentals. The $60.9 million, or 28.2%, decrease in aircraft rentals during the year ended December 31, 2018, compared to the year ended December 31, 2017, was primarily due to a decrease in leased aircraft from 319 leased aircraft for the year ended December 31, 2017, to 260 leased aircraft for the year ended December 31, 2018.\nAircraft fuel. The $32.5 million, or 38.2%, increase in fuel cost during the year ended December 31, 2018, compared to the year ended December 31, 2017, was primarily due to an increase in our average fuel cost per gallon from $2.06 for the year ended December 31, 2017 to $2.60 for the year ended December 31, 2018, along with an increase in the number of prorate flights we operated and the corresponding additional gallons of fuel we purchased. We purchase and incur expense for all fuel on flights operated under our prorate agreements. All fuel costs incurred under our fixed-fee contracts are either purchased directly by our major airline partner, or if purchased by us, we record the direct reimbursement as a reduction to our fuel expense. The following table summarizes the gallons of fuel we purchased under our prorate agreements, for the periods indicated:\n\nAirport-related expenses. Airport-related expenses include airport-related customer service costs such as outsourced airport gate and ramp agent services, airport security fees, passenger interruption costs, deicing, landing fees and station rents (our employee customer service labor costs are reflected in salaries, wages and benefits). The $8.8 million, or 7.4%, decrease in airport-related expenses during the year ended December 31, 2018, compared to the year\nended December 31, 2017, was primarily due to a decrease in airport terminal rents during the year ended December 31, 2018.\nOther operating expenses. Other operating expenses primarily consist of property taxes, hull and liability insurance, simulator costs, crew per diem, and crew hotel costs. The $22.0 million, or 8.8%, increase in other operating expenses was primarily related to increased pilot recruitment cost, crew training costs, including the cost of hotel rooms, and property tax on additional aircraft added since December 31, 2017.\nInterest Expense. The $15.5 million, or 14.8%, increase in interest expense during the year ended December 31, 2018, compared to the year ended December 31, 2017, was primarily due to the purchase of 39 additional E175 aircraft in 2018 financed through debt.\nTotal airline expenses. Total airline expenses (consisting of total operating and interest expenses) increased $28.5 million, or 1.0%, during the year ended December 31, 2018, compared to the year ended December 31, 2017 primarily related to an increase in our average fuel cost per gallon incurred under our prorate agreements, an increase in flight crew compensation costs and other operating expenses, partially offset by a reduction in departures and block hour production of 4.5% during the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to the year ended December 31, 2017.\nSummary of interest income, other income (expense) and provision for income taxes:\nInterest income. Interest income increased $4.3 million, or 95.7%, during the year ended December 31, 2018, compared to the year ended December 31, 2017. The increase in interest income was primarily related to an increase in interest rates subsequent to December 31, 2017.\nOther Income, net. During the year ended December 31, 2018, we had other income of $3.6 million primarily related to a mark-to-market gain on trading securities and a gain on rotable spare parts sold during the year ended December 31, 2018.\nSummary of provision for income taxes:\nProvision for income taxes. For the year ended December 31, 2018, we recorded an income tax provision of 23%, which includes the statutory federal income tax rate of 21% and other reconciling income tax items, including state income taxes. We recorded a $246.8 million benefit in 2017 related to the revaluation of its net federal, state and other deferred tax liabilities based on the tax effects of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (the Tax Act\u201d). We also recorded a $4.5 million and $5.4 million benefit in 2018 and 2017, respectively, relating to ASU 2016-09 which requires excess tax benefits and deficiencies to be recognized in the income tax provision during the period stock options are vested/exercised.\nNet Income. Primarily due to the factors described above, we generated net income of $280.4 million, or $5.30 per diluted share, for the year ended December 31, 2018, compared to a net income of $428.9 million, or $8.08 per diluted share, for the year ended December 31, 2017.\n2017 Compared to 2016\nOperational Statistics. The following table sets forth our major operational statistics and the associated percentages of change for the periods identified below. The decrease in block hours, departures and passengers carried during the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to the year ended December 31, 2016, was primarily due to a net reduction in our operating fleet from 652 aircraft to 595 aircraft between December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2017.\n\nOperating Revenues\nThe following table summarizes our operating revenue for the periods indicated (dollar amounts in thousands):\n\nFlying agreements revenue primarily consists of revenue earned on flights we operate under our capacity purchase agreements and prorate agreements with our major airline partners. Airport customer service and other revenues primarily consist of revenue earned from providing airport counter, gate and ramp services. Changes in our flying agreements revenue are summarized below (dollar amounts in thousands).\n\nThe increase in Capacity purchase agreements revenue: flight operations\u201d of $12.6 million was primarily due to 21 E175 aircraft added to our fleet and improved economics on flying contract renewals, partially offset by a reduction in revenue from aircraft removed from unprofitable or less profitable flying contracts since 2016. The increase in Capacity purchase agreement revenue: aircraft lease\u201d of $70.1 million was primarily due to higher aircraft ownership costs. The decrease in prorate agreements revenue of $16.0 million was primarily due to a change in markets from prorate agreements to capacity purchase agreements with higher revenue yields during the year ended December 31, 2017.\nThe $8.7 million decrease in airport customer service and other revenues was primarily related to a decrease in the volume of airport service agreements since December 31, 2016.\nIndividual expense components attributable to our operations are set forth in the following table (dollar amounts in thousands).\n\nSalaries, wages and benefits. The $13.4 million, or 1.1%, decrease in salaries, wages and benefits during the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to the year ended December 31, 2016, was primarily due to a decrease in direct labor costs resulting from a net reduction in our fleet size and related level of departures and block hours, which was partially offset by higher crew compensation costs resulting from labor agreements executed since 2016.\nAircraft maintenance, materials and repairs. The $10.2 million, or 1.8%, increase in aircraft maintenance expense during the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to the year ended December 31, 2016, was primarily due to an increase in the number of scheduled maintenance events and an increase in the percentage of our fleet that is under long-term Power-by-the-Hour maintenance agreements, including the additional 21 E175 aircraft added since December 31, 2016, which was partially offset by a decrease in other direct maintenance costs resulting from a reduced fleet size and departures since 2016.\nDepreciation and amortization. The $7.8 million, or 2.7%, increase in depreciation and amortization expense during the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to the year ended December 31, 2016, was primarily due to the purchase of 21 additional E175 aircraft and related long-lived aircraft parts in 2017. Additionally, we acquired 19 E175 aircraft in the fourth quarter of 2016 that only had a partial year of depreciation in 2016.\nAircraft rentals. The $46.8 million, or 17.8%, decrease in aircraft rentals during the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to the year ended December 31, 2016, was primarily due to a decrease in leased aircraft from 415 leased aircraft for the year ended to December 31, 2016, to 319 leased aircraft for the year ended December 31, 2017.\nAircraft fuel. The $14.4 million, or 20.4%, increase in fuel cost during the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to the year ended December 31, 2016, was primarily due to an increase in our average fuel cost per gallon from $1.72 for the year ended December 31, 2016 to $2.06 for the year ended December 31, 2017. The following table summarizes the gallons of fuel we purchased under our prorate agreements, for the periods indicated:\n\nAirport-related expenses. The $3.8 million, or 3.1%, decrease in airport-related expenses during the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to the year ended December 31, 2016, was primarily due to a reduction in passenger interruption related costs during the year ended December 31, 2017.\nSpecial items. Special items for the year ended December 31, 2016 included impairment charges and inventory valuation charges related to our 50-seat aircraft and related assets. We did not have comparable special items in 2017.\nOther operating expenses. The $4.8 million, or 1.9%, decrease in other operating expenses was primarily related to the decrease in our fleet size and in other operating costs that resulted from the reduction in block hour production of 5.1%, partially offset by additional training costs associated with E175 aircraft deliveries, including the use of simulators and hotels.\nInterest Expense. The $26.7 million, or 34.2%, increase in interest expense during the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to the year ended December 31, 2016, was primarily due to the purchase of 21 additional E175 aircraft in 2017 financed through debt and an annualized impact of 41 E175 aircraft added throughout 2016 financed through debt.\nTotal airline expenses. Total airline expenses (consisting of total operating and interest expenses) decreased $475.3 million, or 14.3%, during the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to the year ended December 31, 2016 primarily due to the special items of $465.6 million relating to the 50-seat aircraft for the year ended December 31, 2016, and the reduction in fleet size and related block hour production of 5.1% during the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to the year ended December 31, 2016.\nSummary of provision for income taxes:\nProvision for income taxes. On December 22, 2017, the Tax Act was signed into law, which reduced the statutory federal income tax rate from 35% to 21% effective January 1, 2018. We recorded a $246.8 million benefit during 2017 related to the revaluation of our net federal, state and other deferred tax liabilities based on our reasonable estimate of the effects of the Tax Act. We also recorded a $5.4 million benefit in 2017 relating excess tax benefits resulting from vesting employee equity awards and stock options exercised during 2017.\nNet Income (loss). Primarily due to the factors described above, we generated net income of $428.9 million, or $8.08 per diluted share, for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to a net loss of $(161.6) million, or $(3.14) per diluted share, for the year ended December 31, 2016.\nOur Business Segments 2018 compared to 2017:\nFor the year ended December 31, 2018, we had three reportable segments which were the basis of our internal financial reporting. Our segment disclosure relates to components of our business for which separate financial information was available to, and regularly evaluated by our chief operating decision maker. For the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, our operating segments were SkyWest Airlines, ExpressJet and SkyWest Leasing. Corporate overhead expense was allocated to the operating expenses of SkyWest Airlines and ExpressJet.\nThe following table sets forth our segment data for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 (in thousands):\n \n\n (1) Total Airline Expense includes operating expense and interest expense \nSkyWest Airlines Segment Profit. SkyWest Airlines segment profit increased $43.4 million, or 16.5%, during the year ended December 31, 2018, compared to the year ended December 31, 2017. SkyWest Airlines 2018 segment profit was partially impacted by additional profitability from adding 39 E175 aircraft during 2018.\nSkyWest Airlines block hour production increased to 1,380,420, or 11.5%, for 2018 from 1,237,547 for 2017, primarily due to the additional block hour production from the new E175 aircraft added subsequent to December 31, 2017. Significant items contributing to the SkyWest Airlines segment profit are set forth below.\nThe $253.9 million, or 12.1%, increase to SkyWest Airlines operating revenue during 2018, compared to 2017, was primarily due to 39 E175 aircraft placed into service in 2018 and additional aircraft operating under prorate agreements since 2017.\nThe $210.5 million, or 11.5%, increase in the SkyWest Airlines airline expense during 2018, compared to 2017, was primarily due to the following factors:\n \u00b7 SkyWest Airlines' salaries, wages and benefits expense increased by $111.4 million, or 14.7%, primarily due to the additional block hour production along with higher crew compensation costs resulting from labor agreements executed since 2017. \n \u00b7 SkyWest Airlines' aircraft maintenance, materials and repairs expense increased by $30.5 million, or 8.0%, primarily attributable to the additional aircraft engines being placed under Power-by-the-Hour engine maintenance contracts and direct maintenance costs related to the increased volume of block hours, partially offset by a decrease in non-engine scheduled maintenance events and a decrease in the replacement of aircraft parts. \n \u00b7 SkyWest Airlines fuel expense increased $33.4 million, or 39.7%. The increase in fuel cost was primarily due to an increase in the volume of gallons purchased, and an increase in the average fuel cost per gallon in 2017 of $2.60, compared to 2017 of $2.06. \n \u00b7 SkyWest Airlines other operating expense increased $46.5 million, or 27.5%. The increase in other operating expense was primarily related to an increase in pilot recruitment costs, crew training costs including the cost of hotel rooms and crew per diems, and property tax on additional aircraft added since December 31, 2017. \nExpressJet Segment Loss. ExpressJet segment loss decreased $16.8 million, or 51.6%, during the year ended December 31, 2018, compared to the year ended December 31, 2017.\nExpressJet's block hour production decreased to 376,627, or 37.5%, for the year ended December 31, 2018 from 602,232 for the year ended December 31, 2017, primarily due to the reduction in CRJ700, CRJ900 and ERJ145 aircraft from ExpressJet's operations as aircraft were removed from service under its fixed-fee agreements with Delta and American. Significant items contributing to the ExpressJet segment loss are set forth below:\nThe $226.1 million, or 28.6%, decrease in ExpressJet Operating Revenues during 2018, compared to 2017, was primarily due to a 37.5% reduction in block hour production due to a reduced fleet size since 2017.\nThe $242.9 million, or 29.5%, decrease in ExpressJet Airline Expense during 2018, compared to 2017, was primarily due to the following factors:\n \u00b7 ExpressJet's salaries, wages and benefits decreased $100.3 million, or 23.7%. The decrease was primarily due to a decrease in scheduled production subsequent to 2017 that resulted from the decreased number of ERJ145, CRJ700 and CRJ900 aircraft in operation. \n \u00b7 ExpressJet's aircraft maintenance, materials and repairs expense decreased $56.6 million, or 28.4%. The decrease was primarily due to the reduced fleet size and related production subsequent to 2017. \n \u00b7 ExpressJet's aircraft rental expenses decreased $26.7 million, or 77.6%, primarily due to the termination of aircraft leases on CRJ700 and CRJ900 aircraft since 2017. \n \u00b7 ExpressJet's depreciation expense decreased $14.7 million, or 28.3%, primarily due to a reduction in owned 50-seat aircraft and related long-lived assets since December 31, 2017. \n \u00b7 ExpressJet's other airline expenses decreased $24.4 million, or 29.9%, primarily due to a decrease in scheduled production subsequent to 2017. \nSkyWest Leasing Segment Profit. SkyWest Leasing profit increased $10.4 million during the year ended December 31, 2018, compared to the year ended December 31, 2017, primarily due to the additional E175 aircraft revenue attributed to the ownership costs of the E175 aircraft earned under the applicable fixed-fee contract and profitability offset by the E175 aircraft depreciation and interest expense.\nOur Business Segments 2017 compared to 2016:\nFor the year ended December 31, 2017, we had three reportable segments which were the basis of our internal financial reporting. Our segment disclosure relates to components of our business for which separate financial information was available to, and regularly evaluated by our chief operating decision maker. For the years ended\nDecember 31, 2017 and 2016, our operating segments were SkyWest Airlines, ExpressJet and SkyWest Leasing. Corporate overhead expense is allocated to the operating expenses of SkyWest Airlines and ExpressJet.\nThe following table sets forth our segment data for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 (in thousands):\n\n (1) Total Airline Expense includes operating expense and interest expense \nSkyWest Airlines Segment Profit. SkyWest Airlines segment profit increased $240.3 million, or 1,045.0%, during the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to the year ended December 31, 2016. The SkyWest Airlines 2016 segment included $184.3 million of special item expenses associated with the impairment charge of CRJ200 aircraft and related assets. SkyWest Airlines segment profit was also partially impacted by additional profitability from adding 21 E175 aircraft during 2017 and 19 E175 aircraft during the fourth quarter of 2016, which only contributed for a partial year to the 2016 results. SkyWest Airlines also had various flying contract extensions at favorable economics in 2017 compared to 2016.\nSkyWest Airlines block hour production increased to 1,237,547, or 12.0%, for 2017 from 1,105,031 for 2016 primarily due to the additional block hour production from the new E175 aircraft added subsequent to December 31, 2016. Significant items contributing to the SkyWest Airlines segment profit are set forth below.\nThe $213.6 million, or 11.4%, increase to SkyWest Airlines operating revenue during 2017, compared to 2016, was primarily due to 21 E175 aircraft placed into service in 2017 and 19 E175 aircraft added during the fourth quarter of 2016, which only had a partial year impact in 2016 results.\nThe $26.6 million, or 1.4%, decrease in the SkyWest Airlines airline expense during 2017, compared to 2016, was primarily due to the following factors:\n \u00b7 SkyWest Airlines' salaries, wages and benefits expense increased by $80.6 million, or 11.9%, primarily due to the additional block hour production along with higher crew compensation costs resulting from labor agreements executed since 2016. \n \u00b7 SkyWest Airlines' aircraft maintenance, materials and repairs expense increased by $67.8 million, or 21.7%, primarily attributable to the additional aircraft engines being placed under Power-by-the-Hour \n engine maintenance contracts, and an increase in the number of engine events and direct maintenance costs related to the increased volume of block hours. \n \u00b7 SkyWest Airlines aircraft rentals expense decreased $19.2 million, or 9.6%, primarily due to an expiration of 15 aircraft leases subsequent to 2016. \n \u00b7 SkyWest Airlines fuel expense increased $15.1 million, or 21.9%. The increase in fuel cost was primarily due to an increase in the average fuel cost per gallon in 2017 of $2.06, compared to 2016 of $1.72. \n \u00b7 SkyWest Airlines other operating expense increased $21.4 million, or 14.5%. The increase in other operating expense was primarily related to the increased volume of block hours. \n \u00b7 SkyWest Airlines airline expense in 2016 included special items of $184.3 million for impairment charges on its CRJ200 aircraft and write down of certain related assets. SkyWest Airlines did not have any similar special item charges in 2017. \nExpressJet Segment Loss. ExpressJet segment loss decreased $269.0 million, or 89.2%, during the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to the year ended December 31, 2016. The ExpressJet 2016 segment included $281.4 million of special item expenses associated with the CRJ200 and ERJ145 aircraft and write-down of certain assets.\nExpressJet's block hour production decreased to 602,232, or 27.7%, for the year ended December 31, 2016 from 833,461 for the year ended December 31, 2016, primarily due to the removal of CRJ200, CRJ900 and ERJ145 aircraft from operations. Significant items contributing to the ExpressJet segment loss are set forth below:\nThe $253.7 million decrease in ExpressJet Operating Revenues during 2017, compared to 2016, was primarily due to a 24.3% reduction in block hour production due to a reduced fleet size since 2016.\nThe $522.7 million decrease in ExpressJet Airline Expense during 2017, compared to 2016, was primarily due to the following factors:\n \u00b7 ExpressJet's salaries, wages and benefits decreased $94.5 million, or 18.0%. The decrease was primarily due to a decrease in scheduled production subsequent to 2016 that resulted from the decreased number of ERJ145, CRJ200 and CRJ900 aircraft in operation. \n \u00b7 ExpressJet's aircraft maintenance, materials and repairs expense decreased $52.8 million, or 21.0%. The decrease was primarily due to the reduced fleet size and related production subsequent to 2016. \n \u00b7 ExpressJet's aircraft rental expenses decreased $27.6 million, or 44.5%, primarily due to the termination of aircraft leases on CRJ200 and CRJ900 aircraft since 2016. \n \u00b7 ExpressJet's depreciation expense decreased $32.0 million, or 38.1%, primarily due to a reduction in owned 50-seat aircraft and related long-lived assets since December 31, 2016. \n \u00b7 ExpressJet's other airline expenses decreased $26.2 million, or 24.3%, primarily due to a decrease in scheduled production subsequent to 2016. \n \u00b7 ExpressJet's airline expense in 2016 included special items of $281.4 million for impairment charges on certain CRJ200 and ERJ145 long-lived assets and write down of certain related assets. ExpressJet did not have any similar special item charges in 2017. \nSkyWest Leasing Segment Profit. SkyWest Leasing profit increased $52.5 million during the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to the year ended December 31, 2016, primarily due to the additional E175 aircraft\nrevenue attributed to the ownership costs of the E175 aircraft earned under the applicable fixed-fee contract and profitability offset by the E175 aircraft depreciation and interest expense.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nSources and Uses of Cash-2018 Compared to 2017\nCash Position and Liquidity. The following table provides a summary of the net cash provided by (used in) our operating, investing and financing activities for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, and our total cash and marketable securities position as of December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017 (in thousands).\n\n\nCash Flows from Operating Activities. Net cash provided by operating activities increased $118.4 million, or 17.3%, during 2018, compared to 2017, primarily due to an increase in pre-tax income from 2018 to 2017 of $78.1 million and changes in our working capital accounts.\nCash Flows from Investing Activities. Net cash used in investing activities increased $232.1 million, or 30.9%, during 2018, compared to 2017, primarily due to the acquisition of 39 E175 aircraft and the related spare aircraft assets during 2017, compared to 21 E175 aircraft and the related spare aircraft assets purchased during 2017, significantly offset by net liquidation of marketable securities, which provided an additional $236.2 million during 2018 compared to 2017. Additionally, during 2017 we received proceeds from the sale of 15 CRJ200 aircraft, eleven EMB120 aircraft, one CRJ700 aircraft and related spare aircraft assets for $52.0 million.\nCash Flows from Financing Activities. Net cash provided by financing activities increased $225.2 million, or 220.3%, during 2018, compared to 2017, primarily related to proceeds from the issuance of long-term debt associated with 39 E175 aircraft acquired during 2018, compared to proceeds from the issuance of debt associated with 21 E175 aircraft acquired during 2017. This increase in cash provided by financing activities was partially offset by an additional $34.4 million and $8.5 million used during 2018 compared to 2017, for the repurchase of common stock and cash paid for income tax withholdings on vested employee equity awards, respectively.\nWe do not anticipate that our sale of ExpressJet in January 2019 will have a significant adverse effect on our liquidity or capital resources.\nSources and Uses of Cash-2017 Compared to 2016\nCash Position and Liquidity. The following table provides a summary of the net cash provided by (used in) our operating, investing and financing activities for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, and our total cash and marketable securities position as of December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016 (in thousands).\n\n\nCash Flows from Operating Activities. Net cash provided by operating activities increased $177.5 million, or 35.0%, during 2017, compared to 2016, primarily due to an increase in pre-tax income from 2017 to 2016 and changes in our working capital accounts. Our pre-tax income was $288.2 million in 2017. Our pre-tax loss was $248.8 million in 2016, however our 2016 pre-tax loss included $465.6 million of special charges.\nCash Flows from Investing Activities. Net cash used in investing activities decreased $425.7 million, or 36.2%, during 2017, compared to 2016, primarily due to the acquisition of 21 E175 aircraft and the related spare aircraft assets during 2017, compared to 41 E175 aircraft and the related spare aircraft assets purchased during 2016, partially offset by the proceeds from the sale of 15 CRJ200 aircraft, eleven EMB120 aircraft, one CRJ700 aircraft and related spare aircraft assets during 2017.\nCash Flows from Financing Activities. Net cash provided by financing activities decreased $511.9 million, or 83.4%, during 2017, compared to 2016, primarily related to proceeds from the issuance of long-term debt associated with 21 E175 aircraft acquired during 2017, compared to proceeds from the issuance of debt associated with 41 E175 aircraft acquired during 2016. This decrease in cash provided by financing activities was partially offset by $20.0 million and $5.1 million used in 2017 for the repurchase of common stock and cash paid for income tax withholdings on vested employee equity awards, respectively.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources as of December 31, 2018 and 2017\nWe believe that in the absence of unusual circumstances, the working capital currently available to us, together with our projected cash flows from operations, will be sufficient to meet our present financial requirements, including anticipated expansion, planned capital expenditures, and scheduled lease payments and debt service obligations for at least the next 12 months.\nAt December 31, 2018, our total capital mix was 41.1% equity and 58.9% long-term debt, compared to 42.5% equity and 57.5% long-term debt at December 31, 2017.\nAt December 31, 2018, we had $9.7 million in letters of credit issued under our line of credit facility, which reduced the amount available under the facility to $65.3 million. The facility expires on September 1, 2021 and has a variable interest rate of LIBOR plus 2.5% at December 31, 2018.\nAs of December 31, 2018 and 2017, we had $78.7 million and $87.4 million, respectively, in letters of credit and surety bonds outstanding with various banks and surety institutions.\nAs of December 31, 2018 and 2017, we had no restricted cash.\nSignificant Commitments and Obligations\nGeneral\nThe following table summarizes our commitments and obligations as noted for each of the next five years and thereafter (in thousands):\n\n (A) At December 31, 2018, we had variable rate notes representing less than 0.2% of our total long-term debt. Actual interest commitments will change based on the actual variable interest. \nPurchase Commitments and Options\nAs of December 31, 2018, we had a firm purchase commitment for 12 E175 aircraft from Embraer, S.A. with scheduled delivery dates through the end of 2021.\nWe have not historically funded a substantial portion of our aircraft acquisitions with working capital. Rather, we have generally funded our aircraft acquisitions through a combination of operating leases and long-term debt financing. At the time of each aircraft acquisition, we evaluate the financing alternatives available to us, and select one or more of these methods to fund the acquisition. At present, we intend to fund our acquisition of any additional aircraft through cash on hand and debt financing. Based on current market conditions and discussions with prospective leasing organizations and financial institutions, we currently believe that we will be able to obtain financing for our committed acquisitions, as well as additional aircraft. We intend to finance the firm purchase commitment for 12 E175 aircraft with approximately 85% debt and the remaining balance with cash.\nAircraft Lease and Facility Obligations\nWe also have significant long-term lease obligations, primarily relating to our aircraft fleet. At December 31, 2018, we had 260 aircraft under lease with remaining terms ranging from less than one to nine years. Future minimum lease payments due under all long-term operating leases were approximately $477.9 million at December 31, 2018. Assuming a 5.45% discount rate, which is the average rate used to approximate the implicit rates within the applicable aircraft leases, the present value of these lease obligations would have been equal to approximately $399.2 million at December 31, 2018.\nLong-term Debt Obligations\nAs of December 31, 2018, we had $3.2 billion of long-term debt obligations related to the acquisition of aircraft and certain spare engines. The average effective interest rate on those long-term debt obligations was approximately 4.2% at December 31, 2018.\nUnder our fixed-fee arrangements, the major airline partners compensate us for our costs of owning or leasing the aircraft on a monthly basis. The aircraft compensation structure varies by agreement, but is intended to cover either our aircraft principal and interest debt service costs, our aircraft depreciation and interest expense or our aircraft lease expense costs while the aircraft is under contract.\nGuarantees\nWe have guaranteed the obligations of SkyWest Airlines under the Delta Connection Agreement and the United Express Agreement for the E175 aircraft. In addition, we have guaranteed certain other obligations under aircraft financing and leasing agreements.", "item_7_tables": "Table 96: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td>

"summary": " Here are the key points from the MD&A report:\n\n- SkyWest is a regional airline operating under capacity purchase agreements with major airline partners like United, Delta, American Airlines, and Alaska Airlines. As of 2018, they had 596 aircraft in service.\n\n- Total operating revenues in 2018 were $3.2 billion, up 3.2% from 2017, primarily due to adding more E175 aircraft into service. Net income was $280 million in 2018 compared to $429 million in 2017, which included a large tax benefit. \n\n- The main drivers of improved financial performance were adding more profitable E175 aircraft into service, while removing less profitable 50-seat jets. This led to higher revenue and profits, offset somewhat by higher fuel and other operating costs.\n\n- Cash from operations increased to $803 million in 2018 from $684 million in 2017, mainly due to higher pre-tax income. Cash used in investing activities increased due to purchasing more aircraft. Cash from financing increased due to taking on more debt to buy aircraft. \n\n- As of 2018, SkyWest had commitments to purchase more E175 aircraft and substantial obligations for future aircraft lease payments and debt repayment, but believes it has sufficient liquidity and access to financing.\n\n- The report provides an overview of SkyWest's operations, fleet, revenue sources, expenses, profitability, cash flows, liquidity position and obligations looking forward. The main focus is highlighting the improvements in financial performance in 2018."}
