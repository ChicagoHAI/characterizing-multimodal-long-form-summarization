Although we undertake no obligation to revise or update any forward-looking statements, you are advised to consult any additional disclosures that we may make directly to you or through reports that we have filed or in the future may file with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (\"SEC\"), including annual reports on Form 10-K, registration statements on Form N-2, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and current reports on Form 8-K.\nOverview\nNew Mountain Finance Corporation\nWe are a Delaware corporation that was originally incorporated on June 29, 2010. We are a closed-end, non-diversified management investment company that has elected to be regulated as a business development company (\"BDC\") under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the \"1940 Act\"). As such, we are obligated to comply with certain regulatory requirements. We have elected to be treated, and intend to comply with the requirements to continue to qualify annually, as a regulated investment company (\"RIC\") under Subchapter M of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, (the \"Code\"). NMFC is also registered as an investment adviser under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, as amended (the \"Advisers Act\").\nOn May 19, 2011, we priced our initial public offering (the \"IPO\") of 7,272,727 shares of common stock at a public offering price of $13.75 per share. Concurrently with the closing of the IPO and at the public offering price of $13.75 per share, we sold an additional 2,172,000 shares of our common stock to certain executives and employees of, and other individuals affiliated with, New Mountain Capital (defined as New Mountain Capital Group, L.L.C. and its affiliates) in a concurrent private placement (the \"Concurrent Private Placement\"). Additionally, 1,252,964 shares were issued to the partners of New Mountain Guardian Partners, L.P. at that time for their ownership interest in the Predecessor Entities (as defined below). In connection with our IPO and through a series of transactions, New Mountain Finance Holdings, L.L.C. (\"NMF Holdings\" or the \"Predecessor Operating Company\") acquired all of the operations of the Predecessor Entities, including all of the assets and liabilities related to such operations.\nNew Mountain Finance Holdings, L.L.C.\nNMF Holdings is a Delaware limited liability company. Until May 8, 2014, NMF Holdings was externally managed and was regulated as a BDC under the 1940 Act. As such, NMF Holdings was obligated to comply with certain regulatory requirements. NMF Holdings was treated as a partnership for United States (\"U.S.\") federal income tax purposes for so long as it had at least two members. With the completion of the underwritten secondary offering on February 3, 2014, NMF Holdings' existence as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes terminated and NMF Holdings became an entity that is disregarded as a separate entity from its owner for U.S. federal tax purposes. For additional information on our organizational structure prior to May 8, 2014, see \"-Restructuring\".\nUntil May 8, 2014, NMF Holdings was externally managed by the Investment Adviser. As of May 8, 2014, the Investment Adviser serves as the external investment adviser to us. New Mountain Finance Administration, L.L.C. (the \"Administrator\") provides the administrative services necessary for operations. The Investment Adviser and Administrator are wholly-owned subsidiaries of New Mountain Capital. New Mountain Capital is a firm with a track record of investing in the middle market and with assets under management totaling more than $15.0 billion(1), which includes total assets held by us. New Mountain Capital focuses on investing in defensive growth companies across its private equity, public equity and credit investment vehicles. NMF Holdings, formerly known as New Mountain Guardian (Leveraged), L.L.C., was originally formed as a subsidiary of New Mountain Guardian AIV, L.P. (\"Guardian AIV\") by New Mountain Capital in October 2008. Guardian AIV was formed through an allocation of approximately $300.0 million of the $5.1 billion of commitments supporting New Mountain Partners III, L.P., a private equity fund managed by New Mountain Capital. In February 2009, New Mountain Capital formed a co-investment vehicle, New Mountain Guardian Partners, L.P., comprising $20.4 million of commitments. New Mountain Guardian (Leveraged), L.L.C. and New Mountain Guardian Partners, L.P., together with their respective direct and indirect wholly-owned subsidiaries, are defined as the \"Predecessor Entities\".\nPrior to December 18, 2014, New Mountain Finance SPV Funding, L.L.C. (\"NMF SLF\") was a Delaware limited liability company. NMF SLF was a wholly-owned subsidiary of NMF Holdings and thus our wholly-owned indirect subsidiary. NMF SLF was bankruptcy-remote and non-recourse to us. As part of an amendment to our existing credit facilities with Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, NMF SLF merged with and into NMF Holdings on December 18, 2014. See Item 8.-Financial Statements and Supplementary Data-Note 7, Borrowings for additional information on our credit facilities.\nNew Mountain Finance AIV Holdings Corporation\nUntil April 25, 2014, New Mountain Finance AIV Holdings Corporation (\"AIV Holdings\") was a Delaware corporation that was originally incorporated on March 11, 2011. AIV Holdings was dissolved on April 25, 2014. Guardian AIV, a Delaware limited partnership, was AIV Holdings' sole stockholder. AIV Holdings was a closed-end, non-diversified management investment company that was regulated as a BDC under the 1940 Act. As such, AIV Holdings was obligated to comply with certain regulatory requirements. AIV Holdings was treated, and complied with the requirements to qualify annually, as a RIC under the Code.\n_______________________________________________________________________________\nTable 192: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(1)\n</td> <td>Includes amounts committed, not all of which have been drawn down and invested to date, as of December 31, 2015.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nStructure\nPrior to the Restructuring (as defined below) on May 8, 2014, NMFC and AIV Holdings were holding companies with no direct operations of their own, and their sole asset was their ownership in NMF Holdings. In connection with the IPO, NMFC and AIV Holdings each entered into a joinder agreement with respect to the Limited Liability Company Agreement, as amended and restated (the \"Operating Agreement\"), of NMF Holdings, pursuant to which NMFC and AIV Holdings were admitted as members of NMF Holdings. NMFC acquired from NMF Holdings, with the gross proceeds of the IPO and the Concurrent Private Placement, common membership units (\"units\") of NMF Holdings (the number of units were equal to the number of shares of NMFC's common stock sold in the IPO and the Concurrent Private Placement). Additionally, NMFC received units of NMF Holdings equal to the number of shares of common stock of NMFC issued to the partners of New Mountain Guardian Partners, L.P. Guardian AIV was the parent of NMF Holdings prior to the IPO and, as a result of the transactions completed in connection with the IPO, obtained units in NMF Holdings. Guardian AIV contributed its units in NMF Holdings to AIV Holdings in exchange for common stock of AIV Holdings. AIV Holdings had the right to exchange all or any portion of its units in NMF Holdings for shares of NMFC's common stock on a one-for-one basis at any time.\nThe original structure was designed to generally prevent NMFC and its stockholders from being allocated taxable income with respect to unrecognized gains that existed at the time of the IPO in the Predecessor Entities' assets, and rather such amounts would be allocated generally to AIV Holdings. The result was that any distributions made to NMFC's stockholders that were attributable to such gains generally were not treated as taxable dividends but rather as return of capital.\nSince our IPO, and through December 31, 2015, we raised approximately $454.0 million in net proceeds from additional offerings of common stock and issued shares of common stock valued at approximately $288.4 million on behalf of AIV Holdings for exchanged units. We acquired from NMF Holdings units of NMF Holdings equal to the number of shares of our common stock sold in additional offerings. With the completion of the final secondary offering on February 3, 2014, we owned 100.0% of the units of NMF Holdings, which became our wholly-owned subsidiary.\nRestructuring\nAs a BDC, AIV Holdings had been subject to the 1940 Act, including certain provisions applicable only to BDCs. Accordingly, and after careful consideration of the 1940 Act requirements applicable to BDCs, the cost of 1940 Act compliance and a thorough assessment of AIV Holdings' business model, AIV Holdings' board of directors determined that continuation as a BDC was not in the best interests of AIV Holdings and Guardian AIV. Specifically, given that AIV Holdings was formed for the sole purpose of holding units of NMF Holdings and AIV Holdings had disposed of all of the units of NMF Holdings that it was holding as of February 3, 2014, the board of directors of AIV Holdings approved and declared advisable at an in-person meeting held on March 25, 2014 the withdrawal of AIV Holdings' election to be regulated as a BDC under the 1940 Act. In addition, the board of directors of AIV Holdings approved and declared advisable for AIV Holdings to terminate its registration under Section 12(g) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the \"Exchange Act\") and to dissolve AIV Holdings under the laws of the State of Delaware.\nUpon receipt of the necessary stockholder consent to authorize the board of directors of AIV Holdings to withdraw AIV Holdings' election to be regulated as a BDC, the withdrawal was filed and became effective upon receipt by the SEC of AIV Holdings' notification of withdrawal on Form N-54C on April 15, 2014. The board of directors of AIV Holdings believed that AIV Holdings met the requirements for filing the notification to withdraw its election to be regulated as a BDC, upon the receipt of the necessary stockholder consent. After the notification of withdrawal of AIV Holdings' BDC election was filed with the SEC, AIV Holdings was no longer subject to the regulatory provisions of the 1940 Act applicable to BDCs generally, including regulations related to insurance, custody, composition of its board of directors, affiliated transactions and any compensation arrangements.\nIn addition, on April 15, 2014, AIV Holdings filed a Form 15 with the SEC to terminate AIV Holdings' registration under Section 12(g) of the Exchange Act. After these SEC filings and any other federal or state regulatory or tax filings were made, AIV Holdings proceeded to dissolve under Delaware law by filing a certificate of dissolution in Delaware on April 25, 2014.\nUntil May 8, 2014, as a BDC, NMF Holdings had been subject to the 1940 Act, including certain provisions applicable only to BDCs. Accordingly, and after careful consideration of the 1940 Act requirements applicable to BDCs, the cost of 1940 Act compliance and a thorough assessment of NMF Holdings' current business model, NMF Holdings' board of directors determined at an in-person meeting held on March 25, 2014 that continuation as a BDC was not in the best interests of NMF Holdings.\nAt the 2014 joint annual meeting of the stockholders of NMFC and the sole unit holder of NMF Holdings held on May 6, 2014, the stockholders of NMFC and the sole unit holder of NMF Holdings approved a proposal which authorized the board of directors of NMF Holdings to withdraw NMF Holdings' election to be regulated as a BDC. Additionally, the\nstockholders of NMFC approved a new investment advisory and management agreement between NMFC and the Investment Adviser. Upon receipt of the necessary stockholder/unit holder approval to authorize the board of directors of NMF Holdings to withdraw NMF Holdings' election to be regulated as a BDC, the withdrawal was filed and became effective upon receipt by the SEC of NMF Holdings' notification of withdrawal on Form N-54C on May 8, 2014.\nEffective May 8, 2014, NMF Holdings amended and restated its Operating Agreement such that the board of directors of NMF Holdings was dissolved and NMF Holdings remained a wholly-owned subsidiary of NMFC with the sole purpose of serving as a special purpose vehicle for NMF Holdings' credit facility, and NMFC assumed all other operating activities previously undertaken by NMF Holdings under the management of the Investment Adviser (collectively, the \"Restructuring\"). After the Restructuring, all wholly-owned direct and indirect subsidiaries of NMFC are consolidated with NMFC for both 1940 Act and financial statement reporting purposes, subject to any financial statement adjustments required in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (\"GAAP\"). NMFC continues to remain a BDC regulated under the 1940 Act.\nAlso, on May 8, 2014, NMF Holdings filed Form 15 with the SEC to terminate NMF Holdings' registration under Section 12(g) of the Exchange Act. As a special purpose entity, NMF Holdings is bankruptcy-remote and non-recourse to NMFC. In addition, the assets held at NMF Holdings will continue to be used to secure NMF Holdings' credit facility.\nCurrent Organization\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2015, we established a wholly-owned subsidiary, NMF QID NGL Holdings, Inc. ( NMF QID\u201d). Our wholly-owned subsidiaries, NMF Ancora Holdings Inc. ( NMF Ancora\u201d), NMF QID and NMF YP Holdings Inc. ( NMF YP\u201d), are structured as Delaware entities that serve as tax blocker corporations which hold equity or equity-like investments in portfolio companies organized as limited liability companies (or other forms of pass-through entities). We consolidate our tax blocker corporations for accounting purposes. The tax blocker corporations are not consolidated for income tax purposes and may incur income tax expense as a result of their ownership of the portfolio companies. Additionally, our wholly-owned subsidiary, New Mountain Finance Servicing, L.L.C. ( NMF Servicing\u201d) serves as the administrative agent on certain investment transactions. New Mountain Finance SBIC, L.P. ( SBIC LP\u201d), and its general partner, New Mountain Finance SBIC G.P., L.L.C. ( SBIC GP\u201d), were organized in Delaware as a limited partnership and limited liability company, respectively. SBIC LP and SBIC GP are our consolidated wholly-owned direct and indirect subsidiaries. SBIC LP received a license from the U.S. Small Business Administration (the SBA\u201d) to operate as a small business investment company ( SBIC\u201d) under Section 301(c) of the Small Business Investment Act of 1958, as amended (the 1958 Act\u201d).\nThe diagram below depicts our organizational structure as of December 31, 2015.\n_______________________________________________________________________________\nTable 193: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>*\n</td> <td>Includes partners of New Mountain Guardian Partners, L.P.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 194: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>**\n</td> <td>NMFC is the sole limited partner of SBIC LP. NMFC, directly or indirectly through SBIC GP, wholly-owns SBIC LP. NMFC owns 100.0% of SBIC GP which owns 1.0% of SBIC LP. NMFC owns 99.0% of SBIC LP.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOur investment objective is to generate current income and capital appreciation through the sourcing and origination of debt securities at all levels of the capital structure, including first and second lien debt, notes, bonds and mezzanine securities. In some cases, our investments may also include equity interests. The primary focus is in the debt of defensive growth companies, which are defined as generally exhibiting the following characteristics: (i) sustainable secular growth drivers, (ii) high barriers to competitive entry, (iii) high free cash flow after capital expenditure and working capital needs, (iv) high returns on assets and (v) niche market dominance. Similar to us, SBIC LP's investment objective is to generate current income and capital appreciation under our investment criteria. However, SBIC LP's investments must be in SBA eligible companies. Our portfolio may be concentrated in a limited number of industries. As of December 31, 2015, our top five industry concentrations were software, business services, education, distribution & logistics and federal services.\nAs of December 31, 2015, our net asset value was $836.9 million and our portfolio had a fair value of approximately $1,512.2 million in 75 portfolio companies, with a weighted average Yield to Maturity at Cost of approximately 10.7%. This Yield to Maturity at Cost (\"Yield to Maturity at Cost\") calculation assumes that all investments, including secured collateralized agreements, not on non-accrual are purchased at the adjusted cost on the quarter end date and held until their respective maturities with no prepayments or losses and exited at par at maturity. Adjusted cost reflects the GAAP cost for post-IPO investments and a stepped up cost basis of pre-IPO investments (assuming a step-up to fair market value occurred on the IPO date). This calculation excludes the impact of existing leverage. Yield to Maturity at Cost uses the London Interbank Offered Rate (\"LIBOR\") curves at each quarter's end date. The actual yield to maturity may be higher or lower due to the future selection of the LIBOR contracts by the individual companies in our portfolio or other factors.\nRecent Developments\nOn February 4, 2016, our board of directors authorized a program for the purpose of repurchasing up to $50.0 million worth of our common stock. Under the repurchase program, we may, but are not obligated to, repurchase our outstanding common stock in the open market from time to time provided that we comply with our code of ethics and the guidelines specified in Rule 10b-18 of the Exchange Act, including certain price, market volume and timing constraints. In addition, any repurchases will be conducted in accordance with the 1940 Act. Unless amended or extended by our board of directors, we expect the repurchase program to be in place until the earlier of December 31, 2016 or until $50.0 million of our outstanding shares of common stock have been repurchased.\nOur board of directors authorized the repurchase program because it believes the sustained market volatility and uncertainty may cause our common stock to be undervalued from time to time. The timing and number of shares to be repurchased will depend on a number of factors, including market conditions. There are no assurances that we will engage in repurchases, but if market conditions warrant, we now have the ability to take advantage of situations where our management believes share repurchases would be advantageous to us and to our shareholders.\nOn February 22, 2016, our board of directors declared a first quarter 2016 distribution of $0.34 per share payable on March 31, 2016 to holders of record as of March 17, 2016.\nCritical Accounting Policies\nThe preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and revenues and expenses during the periods reported. Actual results could materially differ from those estimates. We have identified the following items as critical accounting policies.\nBasis of Accounting\nWe consolidate our wholly-owned direct and indirect subsidiaries: NMF Holdings, NMF Servicing, SBIC LP, SBIC GP, NMF Ancora, NMF QID and NMF YP. Previously, we consolidated our wholly-owned indirect subsidiary NMF SLF until it merged with and into NMF Holdings on December 18, 2014. See Item 8.-Financial Statements and Supplementary Data-Note 7, Borrowings for additional information on our credit facilities. We are an investment company following accounting and reporting guidance as described in Accounting Standards Codification Topic 946, Financial Services-Investment Companies, (\"ASC 946\"). Prior to the Restructuring, the Predecessor Operating Company consolidated its wholly-owned subsidiary, NMF SLF. NMFC and AIV Holdings did not consolidate the Predecessor Operating Company. Prior to the Restructuring, NMFC and AIV Holdings applied investment company master-feeder financial statement presentation, as described in ASC 946 to their interest in the Predecessor Operating Company. NMFC and AIV Holdings observed that it is also industry practice to follow the presentation prescribed for a master fund-feeder fund structure in ASC 946 in instances in which a master fund is owned by more than one feeder fund and that such presentation provided stockholders of NMFC and AIV Holdings with a clearer depiction of their investment in the master fund.\nValuation and Leveling of Portfolio Investments\nAt all times consistent with GAAP and the 1940 Act, we conduct a valuation of assets, which impacts our net asset value.\nWe value our assets on a quarterly basis, or more frequently if required under the 1940 Act. In all cases, our board of directors is ultimately and solely responsible for determining the fair value of our portfolio investments on a quarterly basis in good faith, including investments that are not publicly traded, those whose market prices are not readily available and any other situation where our portfolio investments require a fair value determination. Security transactions are accounted for on a trade date basis. Our quarterly valuation procedures are set forth in more detail below:\nTable 195: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(1)\n</td> <td>Investments for which market quotations are readily available on an exchange are valued at such market quotations based on the closing price indicated from independent pricing services.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 196: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(2)\n</td> <td>Investments for which indicative prices are obtained from various pricing services and/or brokers or dealers are valued through a multi-step valuation process, as described below, to determine whether the quote(s) obtained is representative of fair value in accordance with GAAP.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 197: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>a.\n</td> <td>Bond quotes are obtained through independent pricing services. Internal reviews are performed by the investment professionals of the Investment Adviser to ensure that the quote obtained is representative of fair value in accordance with GAAP and if so, the quote is used. If the Investment Adviser is unable to sufficiently validate the quote(s) internally and if the investment's par value or its fair value exceeds the materiality threshold, the investment is valued similarly to those assets with no readily available quotes (see (3) below); and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 198: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>b.\n</td> <td>For investments other than bonds, we look at the number of quotes readily available and performs the following:\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 199: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>i.\n</td> <td>Investments for which two or more quotes are received from a pricing service are valued using the mean of the mean of the bid and ask of the quotes obtained;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 200: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>ii.\n</td> <td>Investments for which one quote is received from a pricing service are validated internally. The investment professionals of the Investment Adviser analyze the market quotes obtained using an array of valuation methods (further described below) to validate the fair value. If the Investment Adviser is unable to sufficiently validate the quote internally and if the investment's par value or its fair value exceeds the materiality threshold, the investment is valued similarly to those assets with no readily available quotes (see (3) below).\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 201: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(3)\n</td> <td>Investments for which quotations are not readily available through exchanges, pricing services, brokers, or dealers are valued through a multi-step valuation process:\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 202: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>a.\n</td> <td>Each portfolio company or investment is initially valued by the investment professionals of the Investment Adviser responsible for the credit monitoring;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 203: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>b.\n</td> <td>Preliminary valuation conclusions will then be documented and discussed with our senior management;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 204: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>c.\n</td> <td>If an investment falls into (3) above for four consecutive quarters and if the investment's par value or its fair value exceeds the materiality threshold, then at least once each fiscal year, the valuation for each portfolio investment for which we do not have a readily available market quotation will be reviewed by an independent valuation firm engaged by our board of directors; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 205: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>d.\n</td> <td>When deemed appropriate by our management, an independent valuation firm may be engaged to review and value investment(s) of a portfolio company, without any preliminary valuation being performed by the Investment Adviser. The investment professionals of the Investment Adviser will review and validate the value provided.\n</td> </tr>\n</table> For investments in revolving credit facilities and delayed draw commitments, the cost basis of the funded investments purchased is offset by any costs/netbacks received for any unfunded portion on the total balance committed. The fair value is also adjusted for the price appreciation or depreciation on the unfunded portion. As a result, the purchase of commitments not completely funded may result in a negative fair value until it is called and funded.\nThe values assigned to investments are based upon available information and do not necessarily represent amounts which might ultimately be realized, since such amounts depend on future circumstances and cannot be reasonably determined until the individual positions are liquidated. Due to the inherent uncertainty of determining the fair value of investments that do not have a readily available market value, the fair value of our investments may fluctuate from period to period and the fluctuations could be material.\nGAAP fair value measurement guidance classifies the inputs used in measuring fair value into three levels as follows:\nLevel I-Quoted prices (unadjusted) are available in active markets for identical investments and we have the ability to access such quotes as of the reporting date. The type of investments which would generally be included in Level I include active exchange-traded equity securities and exchange-traded derivatives. As required by Accounting Standards Codification Topic 820, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures (\"ASC 820\"), we, to the extent that we hold such investments, do not adjust the quoted price for these investments, even in situations where we hold a large position and a sale could reasonably impact the quoted price.\nLevel II-Pricing inputs are observable for the investments, either directly or indirectly, as of the reporting date, but are not the same as those used in Level I. Level II inputs include the following:\nTable 206: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 207: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in non-active markets (examples include corporate and municipal bonds, which trade infrequently);\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 208: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Pricing models whose inputs are observable for substantially the full term of the asset or liability (examples include most over-the-counter derivatives, including foreign exchange forward contracts); and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 209: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Pricing models whose inputs are derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data through correlation or other means for substantially the full term of the asset or liability.\n</td> </tr>\n</table> Level III-Pricing inputs are unobservable for the investment and include situations where there is little, if any, market activity for the investment.\nThe inputs used to measure fair value may fall into different levels. In all instances when the inputs fall within different levels of the hierarchy, the level within which the fair value measurement is categorized is based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety. As such, a Level III fair value measurement may include inputs that are both observable and unobservable. Gains and losses for such assets categorized within the Level III table below may include changes in fair value that are attributable to both observable inputs and unobservable inputs.\nThe inputs into the determination of fair value require significant judgment or estimation by management and consideration of factors specific to each investment. A review of the fair value hierarchy classifications is conducted on a quarterly basis. Changes in the observability of valuation inputs may result in the transfer of certain investments within the fair value hierarchy from period to period. Reclassifications impacting the fair value hierarchy are reported as transfers in/out of the respective leveling categories as of the beginning of the quarter in which the reclassifications occur.\nThe following table summarizes the levels in the fair value hierarchy that our portfolio investments fall into as of December 31, 2015:\nTable 210: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(in thousands)\n</td> <td>Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Level I\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Level II\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Level III\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>First lien\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>670,023\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>329,133\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>340,890\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Second lien\n</td> <td>631,985\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>449,227\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>182,758\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Subordinated\n</td> <td>87,005\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>33,546\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>53,459\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Equity and other\n</td> <td>123,211\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>316\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>15\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>122,880\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total investments\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,512,224\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>316\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>811,921\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>699,987\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe generally use the following framework when determining the fair value of investments where there are little, if any, market activity or observable pricing inputs. We typically determine the fair value of our performing debt investments utilizing an income approach. Additional consideration is given using a market based approach, as well as reviewing the overall underlying portfolio company's performance and associated financial risks. The following outlines additional details on the approaches considered:\nCompany Performance, Financial Review, and Analysis: Prior to investment, as part of our due diligence process, we evaluate the overall performance and financial stability of the portfolio company. Post investment, we analyze each portfolio company's current operating performance and relevant financial trends versus prior year and budgeted results, including, but not limited to, factors affecting its revenue and earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (\"EBITDA\") growth, margin trends, liquidity position, covenant compliance and changes to its capital structure. We also attempt to identify and subsequently track any developments at the portfolio company, within its customer or vendor base or within the industry or the macroeconomic environment, generally, that may alter any material element of our original\ninvestment thesis. This analysis is specific to each portfolio company. We leverage the knowledge gained from our original due diligence process, augmented by this subsequent monitoring, to continually refine our outlook for each of our portfolio companies and ultimately form the valuation of our investment in each portfolio company. When an external event such as a purchase transaction, public offering or subsequent sale occurs, we will consider the pricing indicated by the external event to corroborate the private valuation.\nFor debt investments, we may employ the Market Based Approach (as described below) to assess the total enterprise value of the portfolio company, in order to evaluate the enterprise value coverage of our debt investment. For equity investments or in cases where the Market Based Approach implies a lack of enterprise value coverage for the debt investment, we may additionally employ a discounted cash flow analysis based on the free cash flows of the portfolio company to assess the total enterprise value.\nAfter enterprise value coverage is demonstrated for our debt investments through the method(s) above, the Income Based Approach (as described below) may be employed to estimate the fair value of the investment.\nMarket Based Approach: We may estimate the total enterprise value of each portfolio company by utilizing market value cash flow (EBITDA) multiples of publicly traded comparable companies and comparable transactions. We consider numerous factors when selecting the appropriate companies whose trading multiples are used to value our portfolio companies. These factors include, but are not limited to, the type of organization, similarity to the business being valued, relevant risk factors, as well as size, profitability and growth expectations. We may apply an average of various relevant comparable company EBITDA multiples to the portfolio company's latest twelve month (\"LTM\") EBITDA or projected EBITDA to calculate the enterprise value of the portfolio company. Significant increases or decreases in the EBITDA multiple will result in an increase or decrease in enterprise value, which may result in an increase or decrease in the fair value estimate of the investment. In applying the market based approach as of December 31, 2015, we used the relevant EBITDA multiple ranges set forth in the table below to determine the enterprise value of our portfolio companies. We believe this was a reasonable range in light of current comparable company trading levels and the specific portfolio companies involved.\nIncome Based Approach: We also may use a discounted cash flow analysis to estimate the fair value of the investment. Projected cash flows represent the relevant security's contractual interest, fee and principal payments plus the assumption of full principal recovery at the investment's expected maturity date. These cash flows are discounted at a rate established utilizing a yield calibration approach, which incorporates changes in the credit quality (as measured by relevant statistics) of the portfolio company, as compared to changes in the yield associated with comparable credit quality market indices, between the date of origination and the valuation date. Significant increases or decreases in the discount rate would result in a decrease or increase in the fair value measurement. In applying the income based approach as of December 31, 2015, we used the discount ranges set forth in the table below to value investments in our portfolio companies.\nThe unobservable inputs used in the fair value measurement of our Level III investments as of December 31, 2015 were as follows:\nTable 211: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td>

June 10, 2014. SLP I is a portfolio company held by us. SLP I is structured as a private investment fund, in which all of the investors are qualified purchasers, as such term is defined under the 1940 Act. Transfer of interests in SLP I is subject to restrictions, and as a result, such interests are not readily marketable. SLP I operates under a limited liability company agreement (the \"Agreement\") and will continue in existence until June 10, 2019, subject to earlier termination pursuant to certain terms of the Agreement. The term may be extended for up to one year pursuant to certain terms of the Agreement. SLP I has a three year re-investment period. SLP I invests in senior secured loans issued by companies within our core industry verticals. These investments are typically broadly syndicated first lien loans.\nSLP I is capitalized with $93.0 million of capital commitments, $275.0 million of debt from a revolving credit facility and is managed by us. Our capital commitment is $23.0 million, representing less than 25.0% ownership, with third party investors representing the remaining capital commitment. As of December 31, 2015, SLP I had total investments with an aggregate fair value of approximately $349.7 million, debt outstanding of $267.6 million and capital that had been called and funded of $93.0 million. As of December 31, 2014, SLP I had total investments with an aggregate fair value of approximately $369.2 million, debt outstanding of $266.9 million and capital that had been called and funded of $93.0 million. Our investment in SLP I is disclosed on our Consolidated Schedules of Investments as of December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014.\nWe, as an investment adviser registered under the Advisers Act, act as the collateral manager to SLP I and are entitled to receive a management fee for our investment management services provided to SLP I. As a result, SLP I is classified as our affiliate. No management fee is charged on our investment in SLP I in connection with the administrative services provided to SLP I. For the years ended December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014, we earned approximately $1.2 million and $0.5 million, respectively, in management fees related to SLP I which is included in other income. As of December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014, approximately $0.3 million and $0.5 million, respectively, of management fees related to SLP I was included in receivable from affiliates. For the years ended December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014, we earned approximately $3.6 million and $1.1 million, respectively, of dividend income related to SLP I, which is included in dividend\nincome. As of December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014, approximately $0.9 million and $0.8 million, respectively, of dividend income related to SLP I was included in interest and dividend receivable. We did not earn management fees or dividend income for the year ended December 31, 2013.\nCollateralized agreements or repurchase financings\nWe follow the guidance in Accounting Standards Codification Topic 860, Transfers and Servicing-Secured Borrowing and Collateral, (\"ASC 860\") when accounting for transactions involving the purchases of securities under collateralized agreements to resell (resale agreements). These transactions are treated as collateralized financing transactions and are recorded at their contracted resale or repurchase amounts, as specified in the respective agreements. Interest on collateralized agreements is accrued and recognized over the life of the transaction and included in interest income. As of December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014, we held one collateralized agreement to resell with a cost basis of $30.0 million and $30.0 million, respectively, and a carrying value of $29.7 million and $30.0 million, respectively, collateralized by a second lien bond in Northstar GOM Holdings Group LLC with a fair value of $29.7 million and $30.0 million, respectively, and guaranteed by a private hedge fund with approximately $716.6 million and $769.4 million, respectively, of assets under management. Pursuant to the terms of the collateralized agreement, the private hedge fund is obligated to repurchase the collateral from us at the par value of the collateralized agreement once called upon by us or if the private hedge fund's total assets under management fall below the agreed upon thresholds. The collateralized agreement earned interest at a weighted average rate of 15.0% per annum as of December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014.\nRevenue Recognition\nOur revenue recognition policies are as follows:\nSales and paydowns of investments: Realized gains and losses on investments are determined on the specific identification method.\nInterest and dividend income: Interest income, including amortization of premium and discount using the effective interest method, is recorded on the accrual basis and periodically assessed for collectability. Interest income also includes interest earned from cash on hand. Upon the prepayment of a loan or debt security, any prepayment penalties are recorded as part of interest income. We have loans and certain preferred equity investments in the portfolio that contain a payment-in-kind ( PIK\u201d) interest or dividend provision. PIK interest and dividends are accrued and recorded as income at the contractual rates, if deemed collectible. The PIK interest and dividends are added to the principal or share balances on the capitalization dates and generally due at maturity or when redeemed by the issuer.\nDividend income on common equity is recorded on the record date for private portfolio companies or on the ex-dividend date for publicly traded portfolio companies. Dividend income on preferred securities is recorded as dividend income on an accrual basis to the extent that such amounts are deemed collectible.\nNon-accrual income: Investments are placed on non-accrual status when principal or interest payments are past due 30 days or more and when there is reasonable doubt that principal or interest will be collected. Accrued cash and un-capitalized PIK interest or dividends are reversed when an investment is placed on non-accrual status. Previously capitalized PIK interest or dividends are not reversed when an investment is placed on non-accrual status. Interest or dividend payments received on non-accrual investments may be recognized as income or applied to principal depending upon management's judgment of the ultimate outcome. Non-accrual investments are restored to accrual status when past due principal and interest is paid and, in management's judgment, are likely to remain current.\nOther income: Other income represents delayed compensation, consent or amendment fees, revolver fees, structuring fees, upfront fees, management fees from a non-controlled/affiliated investment and other miscellaneous fees received and are typically non-recurring in nature. Delayed compensation is income earned from counterparties on trades that do not settle within a set number of business days after trade date. Other income may also include fees from bridge loans. We may from time to time enter into bridge financing commitments, an obligation to provide interim financing to a counterparty until permanent credit can be obtained. These commitments are short-term in nature and may expire unfunded. A fee is received for providing such commitments. Structuring fees and upfront fees are recognized as income when earned, usually when paid at the closing of the investment and are non-refundable.\nPrior to the Restructuring, our revenue recognition policies were as follows:\nRevenue, expenses, and capital gains (losses): At each quarterly valuation date, the Predecessor Operating Company's investment income, expenses, net realized gains (losses), and net increase (decrease) in unrealized appreciation (depreciation) were allocated to us based on our pro-rata interest in the net assets of the Predecessor Operating Company. This was recorded on our Statements of Operations. Realized gains and losses are recorded upon sales of our investments in the Predecessor Operating Company. Net change in unrealized appreciation (depreciation) of investment in New Mountain Finance Holdings, L.L.C. is the difference between the net asset value per share and the closing price per share for shares issued as part of the dividend reinvestment plan on the dividend payment date. This net change in unrealized appreciation (depreciation) of investment in New Mountain Finance Holdings, L.L.C. includes the unrealized appreciation (depreciation) from the IPO. We used the proceeds from our IPO and Concurrent Private Placement to purchase units in the Predecessor Operating Company at $13.75 per unit (our IPO price per share). At the IPO date, $13.75 per unit represented a discount to the actual net asset value per unit of the Predecessor Operating Company. As a result, we experienced immediate unrealized appreciation on our investment.\nAll expenses were paid and recorded by the Predecessor Operating Company. Expenses were allocated to us based on pro-rata ownership interest. In addition, the Predecessor Operating Company paid all of the offering costs related to the IPO and subsequent offerings. We recorded our portion of the offering costs as a direct reduction to net assets and the cost of our investment in the Predecessor Operating Company.\nMonitoring of Portfolio Investments\nWe monitor the performance and financial trends of our portfolio companies on at least a quarterly basis. We attempt to identify any developments within the portfolio company, the industry or the macroeconomic environment that may alter any material element of our original investment strategy.\nWe use an investment rating system to characterize and monitor the credit profile and expected level of returns on each investment in the portfolio. We use a four-level numeric rating scale as follows:\nTable 213: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Investment Rating 1-Investment is performing materially above expectations;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 214: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Investment Rating 2-Investment is performing materially in-line with expectations.

( Edmentum\u201d) on non-accrual status due to its ongoing restructuring. As of March 31, 2015, our investment in Edmentum had an aggregate cost basis of $30.8 million, an aggregate fair value of $15.6 million and total unearned interest income of $0.4 million for the three months then ended. In June 2015, Edmentum completed a restructuring which resulted in a material modification of the original terms and an extinguishment of our original investment in Edmentum. Prior to the extinguishment in June 2015, our original investment in Edmentum had an aggregate cost of $31.6 million, an aggregate fair value of $16.4 million and total unearned interest income of $0.8 million for the six months ended June 30, 2015. The extinguishment resulted in a realized loss of $15.2 million. Post restructuring, our investments in Edmentum have been restored to full accrual status. As of December 31, 2015, our investments in Edmentum have an aggregate cost basis of $20.9 million and an aggregate fair value of $22.8 million.\nDuring the first quarter of 2015, our first lien position in Education Management LLC ( EDMC\u201d) was non-income producing as a result of the portfolio company undergoing a restructuring. As of December 31, 2014, our investment in EDMC had an aggregate cost basis of $3.0 million, an aggregate fair value of $1.4 million and no unearned interest income for the three months then ended. In January 2015, EDMC completed a restructuring which resulted in a material modification of the original terms and an extinguishment of our original investment in EDMC. Prior to the extinguishment in January 2015, our original investment in EDMC had an aggregate cost of $3.0 million, an aggregate fair value of $1.4 million and no unearned interest income for the period then ended. The extinguishment resulted in a realized loss of $1.6 million. Post restructuring, our investments in EDMC are income producing. As of December 31, 2015, our investments in EDMC have an aggregate cost basis of $1.4 million and an aggregate fair value of $0.5 million.\nDuring the third quarter of 2014, we placed a portion of our first lien position in UniTek Global Services, Inc. (\"UniTek\") on non-accrual status in anticipation of a voluntary petition for a \"Pre-Packaged\" Chapter 11 Bankruptcy in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware which was filed on November 3, 2014. As of December 31, 2014, our investment in UniTek had an aggregate cost basis of $47.4 million, an aggregate fair value of $35.2 million and total unearned interest income of $1.0 million for the year then ended. In January 2015, UniTek emerged from Pre-Packaged\u201d Chapter 11 Bankruptcy and completed its restructuring. The restructuring resulted in a material modification of the original terms and an extinguishment of our original investments in UniTek. Prior to the extinguishment in January 2015, our original investments in UniTek had an aggregate cost of $52.9 million, an aggregate fair value of $40.1 million and total unearned interest income of $0.1 million for the period then ended. The extinguishment resulted in a realized loss of $12.8 million. Post restructuring, our investments in UniTek have been restored to full accrual status. As of December 31, 2015, our investments in UniTek have an aggregate cost basis of $41.3 million and an aggregate fair value of $47.4 million.\nAs of December 31, 2015, our two super priority first lien positions in ATI Acquisition Company and related equity positions in Ancora Acquisition LLC had an Investment Rating of 4 due to the underlying business encountering significant regulatory constraints which have led to the portfolio company's underperformance. As of December 31, 2015, our two super priority first lien positions in ATI Acquisition Company and its related preferred shares and warrants in Ancora Acquisition LLC remained on non-accrual status due to the inability of the portfolio company to service its interest payments for the year then ended and uncertainty about its ability to pay such amounts in the future. As of December 31, 2015, our investment had an aggregate cost basis of $1.6 million, an aggregate fair value of $0.4 million and total unearned interest income of $0.1 million for the year then ended. As of December 31, 2014, our total investment in ATI Acquisition Company and Ancora Acquisition LLC had an aggregate cost basis of $1.6 million, an aggregate fair value of $0.4 million and total unearned interest income of $0.3 million for the year then ended. As of December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014, unrealized gains (losses) include a fee that we would recognize upon realization of the two super priority first lien debt investments.\nPortfolio and Investment Activity\nThe fair value of our investments was approximately $1,512.2 million in 75 portfolio companies at December 31, 2015 and approximately $1,424.7 million in 71 portfolio companies at December 31, 2014. At December 31, 2013 our only investment was our investment in the Predecessor Operating Company. The fair value of the Predecessor Operating Company's investments was approximately $1,115.7 million in 59 portfolio companies at December 31, 2013.\nThe following table shows our portfolio and investment activity for the years ended December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014 and the Predecessor Operating Company's portfolio and investment activity for the year ended December 31, 2013:\nTable 219: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Years Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(in millions)\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014(1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2013\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>New investments in 36, 43 and 34 portfolio companies, respectively\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>612.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>720.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>529.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Debt repayments in existing portfolio companies\n</td> <td>400.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>267.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>395.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Sales of securities in 15, 14 and 12 portfolio companies, respectively\n</td> <td>83.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>117.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>31.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Change in unrealized appreciation on 23, 20 and 45 portfolio companies, respectively\n</td> <td>44.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>21.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>27.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Change in unrealized depreciation on 70, 60 and 29 portfolio companies, respectively\n</td> <td>(79.9\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(63.9\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(19.9\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n_______________________________________________________________________________\nTable 220: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(1)\n</td> <td>For the year ended December 31, 2014, amounts represent the investment activity of the Predecessor Operating Company through and including May 7, 2014 and our investment activity from May 8, 2014 through December 31, 2014.\n</td> </tr>\n</table> At December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014, our weighted average Yield to Maturity at Cost was approximately 10.7% and 10.7%, respectively.\nRecent Accounting Standards Updates\nIn June 2014, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2014-11, Transfers and Servicing Topic 860-Repurchase-to-Maturity Transactions, Repurchase Financings, and Disclosures ( ASU 2014-11\u201d). ASU 2014-11 changes the accounting for repurchase- and resale-to-maturity agreements by requiring that such agreements be recognized as financing arrangements, and requires that a transfer of a financial asset and a repurchase agreement entered into contemporaneously be accounted for separately. ASU 2014-11 requires additional disclosures about certain transferred financial assets accounted for as sales and certain securities financing transactions. The accounting changes and additional disclosures about certain transferred financial assets accounted for as sales are effective for the first interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2014. The additional disclosures for securities financing transactions are required for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2014 and for interim reporting periods beginning after March 15, 2015. The adoption of ASU 2014-11 did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements and disclosures.\nIn August 2014, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2014-15, Presentation of Financial Statements-Going Concern Subtopic 205-40-Disclosure of Uncertainties about an Entity's Ability to Continue as a Going Concern ( ASU 2014-15\u201d). ASU 2014-15 will explicitly require management to assess an entity's ability to continue as a going concern, and to provide related footnote disclosure in certain circumstances. The new standard will be effective for all entities in the first annual period ending after December 15, 2016. Earlier adoption is permitted. The adoption of ASU 2014-15 is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements and disclosures.\nIn February 2015, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2015-02, Consolidation Topic 810-Amendments to the Consolidation Analysis ( ASU 2015-02\u201d), which modifies the consolidation analysis in determining if limited partnerships or similar type entities fall under the variable interest model or voting interest model, particularly those that have fee arrangements and related party relationships. ASU 2015-02 will be effective for all public entities for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2015. Earlier adoption is permitted. We are in the process of evaluating the impact that this guidance will have on our consolidated financial statements and disclosures.\nIn April 2015, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2015-03, Interest-Imputation of Interest Subtopic 835-30-Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs ( ASU 2015-03\u201d), which changes the presentation of debt issuance costs in financial statements. Under ASU 2015-03, an entity presents such costs on the statement of assets and liabilities as a direct deduction from the related debt liability rather than as an asset. Amortization of the costs is reported as interest expense. The new standard will be effective for all public entities for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2015. Earlier adoption is permitted. We are in the process of evaluating the impact that this guidance will have on our consolidated financial statements and disclosures.\nIn May 2015, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2015-07, Fair Value Measurement Topic 820-Disclosures for Investments in Certain Entities that Calculate Net Asset Value per Share (or Its Equivalent) ( ASU 2015-07\u201d), which amends the presentation of investments measured at net asset value, as a practical expedient for fair value, from the fair\nvalue hierarchy. Under ASU 2015-07, an entity would remove investments measured using the practical expedient from the fair value hierarchy. ASU 2015-07 will be effective for annual and interim reporting periods after December 15, 2015. We are in the process of evaluating the impact that this guidance will have on our consolidated financial statements and disclosures.\nResults of Operations\nUnder GAAP, our IPO did not step-up the cost basis of the Predecessor Operating Company's existing investments to fair market value at the IPO date. Since the total value of the Predecessor Operating Company's investments at the time of the IPO was greater than the investments' cost basis, a larger amount of amortization of purchase or original issue discount, and different amounts in realized gain and unrealized appreciation, may be recognized under GAAP in each period than if the step-up had occurred. This will remain until such predecessor investments are sold, repaid or mature in the future. We track the transferred (or fair market) value of each of the Predecessor Operating Company's investments as of the time of the IPO and, for purposes of the incentive fee calculation, adjusts income as if each investment was purchased at the date of the IPO (or stepped up to fair market value). The respective \"Adjusted Net Investment Income\" (defined as net investment income adjusted to reflect income as if the cost basis of investments held at the IPO date had stepped-up to fair market value as of the IPO date) is used in calculating both the incentive fee and dividend payments. See Item 8.-Financial Statements and Supplementary Data-Note 5, Agreements for additional details.\nThe following table for the year ended December 31, 2015 is adjusted to reflect the step-up to fair market value and the allocation of the incentive fees related to hypothetical capital gains out of the adjusted post-incentive fee net investment income.\nTable 221: <table><tr><td> </td>

For the year ended December 31, 2015, total\nadjusted investment income of $153.7 million consisted of approximately $130.0 million in cash interest from investments, approximately $3.9 million in PIK interest from investments, approximately $3.6 million in prepayment fees, net amortization of purchase premiums and discounts of approximately $2.4 million, approximately $3.2 million in cash dividends from investments, $2.6 million in PIK dividends from investments and approximately $8.0 million in other income. Our Adjusted Net Investment Income was $82.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2015.\nIn accordance with GAAP, for the year ended December 31, 2015, we did not have an accrual for hypothetical capital gains incentive fee based upon the cumulative net Adjusted Realized Capital Gains and Adjusted Realized Capital Losses and the cumulative net Adjusted Unrealized Capital Appreciation and Adjusted Unrealized Capital Depreciation on investments held at the end of the period. Actual amounts paid to the Investment Adviser are consistent with the Investment Management Agreement and are based only on actual Adjusted Realized Capital Gains computed net of all Adjusted Realized Capital Losses and Adjusted Unrealized Capital Depreciation on a cumulative basis from inception through the end of each calendar year as if the entire portfolio was sold at fair value.

For the year ended December 31, 2013, total adjusted investment income of $114.0 million consisted of approximately $94.5 million in cash interest from investments, approximately $3.4 million in PIK interest from investments, approximately $5.8 million in prepayment fees, net amortization of purchase premiums and discounts of approximately $2.5 million, approximately $5.0 million in dividend income and approximately $2.8 million in other income. The Predecessor Operating Company's Adjusted Net Investment Income was $66.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2013.\nIn accordance with GAAP, for the year ended December 31, 2013, the Predecessor Operating Company accrued $3.2 million of hypothetical capital gains incentive fee based upon the cumulative net Adjusted Realized Capital Gains and Adjusted Realized Capital Losses and the cumulative net Adjusted Unrealized Capital Appreciation and Adjusted Unrealized Capital Depreciation on investments held at the end of each period.

The 13% increase in total investment income primarily results from an increase in interest income of approximately $14.4 million from the year ended December 31, 2014 to the year ended December 31, 2015, which is attributable to larger invested balances, driven by the proceeds from the September 2015 primary offering of our common stock, our use of leverage from our revolving credit facilities, SBA-guaranteed debentures and the deployment of the June 2014 proceeds from the issuance of $115.0 million of convertible notes to originate new investments, and prepayment fees received associated with the early repayments or partial repayments of nine different portfolio companies held as of December 31, 2014. The increase in dividend income of approximately $1.1 million during the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2014 was primarily attributable to distributions from our investment in SLP I and PIK dividends income from an equity position. The increase in other income, which represents fees that are generally non-recurring in nature, of approximately $2.7 million during the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2014 was primarily attributable to structuring, upfront, amendment and consent fees received from 22 different portfolio companies, commitment fees received from three bridge facilities and management fees from a non-controlled/affiliated portfolio company.\nOur total investment income increased by approximately $20.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 as compared to the Predecessor Operating Company's total investment income for the year ended December 31, 2013. The 18% increase in total investment income primarily results from an increase in interest income of approximately $18.6 million from the year ended December 31, 2013 to the year ended December 31, 2014, which is attributable to larger invested balances, driven by the proceeds from the October 2013, April 2014 and October 2014 primary offerings of our common stock and the June 2014 offering of our convertible notes, our use of leverage from our revolving credit facilities to originate new investments, and prepayment fees received associated with the early repayments or partial repayments of ten different portfolio companies held by the Predecessor Operating Company as of December 31, 2013. The increase in other income of approximately $2.5 million during the year ended December 31, 2014 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2013, which represents fees that are generally non-recurring in nature, was primarily attributable to structuring, amendment and consent fees received from 20 different portfolio companies and management fees from a non-controlled affiliated portfolio company. The decrease in dividend income during the year ended December 31, 2014 as compared to the year ended\nDecember 31, 2013 was primarily attributable to a large distribution from one of the Predecessor Operating Company's warrant investments in the prior year.\nOperating Expenses\nTable 235: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td>

Our management fee increased by approximately $1.7 million, net of a management fee waiver, and incentive fees increased by approximately $2.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2014. The increase in management fee and incentive fee from the year ended December 31, 2014 to the year ended December 31, 2015 was attributable to larger invested balances, driven by the proceeds from the September 2015 primary offering of our common stock, our use of leverage from our revolving credit facilities, SBA-guaranteed debentures and the deployment of the June 2014 Proceeds from the issuance of $115.0 million of convertible notes to originate new investments. No capital gains incentive fee was accrued for the year ended December 31, 2015.\nInterest and other financing expenses increased by approximately $5.3 million during the year ended December 31, 2015, primarily due to our issuance of $115.0 million of convertible notes, the closing of the NMFC Credit Facility (as defined below) during the second quarter of 2014 and the drawing on SBA-guaranteed debentures beginning in the fourth quarter of\n2014. Our total professional fees, total administrative expenses and total other general and administrative expenses marginally decreased by approximately $0.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2014. Our expenses waived and reimbursed decreased by approximately $0.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2014 due to the expiration of the expense cap on March 31, 2014.\nOur total net operating expenses increased by approximately $4.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 as compared to the Predecessor Operating Company's year ended December 31, 2013. Our management fee increased by approximately $4.0 million, net of a management fee waiver, and incentive fees increased by approximately $1.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 as compared to the Predecessor Operating Company's year ended December 31, 2013. The increase in management fee and incentive fee from the Predecessor Operating Company's year ended December 31, 2013 to our year ended December 31, 2014 was attributable to larger invested balances, driven by the proceeds from the October 2013, April 2014 and October 2014 primary offerings of our common stock, the June 2014 offering of our convertible notes and our use of leverage from our revolving credit facilities to originate new investments. Our capital gains incentive fee accrual decreased by approximately $9.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 as compared to the Predecessor Operating Company's year ended December 31, 2013, which was attributable to lower net Adjusted Realized Capital Gains (Losses) and net Adjusted Unrealized Capital Depreciation of investments during the period due to lower marks on the broader portfolio. As of December 31, 2014, no actual capital gains incentive fee was owed under the Investment Management Agreement, as cumulative net Adjusted Realized Gains did not exceed cumulative Adjusted Unrealized Depreciation.\nInterest and other financing expenses increased by approximately $5.6 million during the year ended December 31, 2014, primarily due to the increase of average debt outstanding from $184.1 million to $244.6 million for the Holdings Credit Facility (as defined below) for the year ended December 31, 2013 compared to December 31, 2014. In addition, during the year ended December 31, 2014, we issued $115.0 million of convertible notes, closed the NMFC Credit Facility (as defined below) and began to draw on SBA-guaranteed debentures. Our total professional fees, total administrative expenses and total other general and administrative expenses marginally increased by approximately $0.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 as compared to the Predecessor Operating Company's year ended December 31, 2013. During the year ended December 31, 2014, we incurred $10.9 thousand in other expenses that were not subject to the expense cap pursuant to the administration agreement, as amended and restated (the \"Administration Agreement\"), with the Administrator, and further restricted by us. For the year ended December 31, 2014, approximately $1.4 million of indirect administrative expenses were included in administrative expenses, of which $0.8 million were waived by the Administrator. Our expenses waived and reimbursed decreased by approximately $2.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 as compared to the Predecessor Operating Company's year ended December 31, 2013 due to the expiration of the expense cap on March 31, 2014 and the decrease of waived indirect administrative expenses by the Administrator during the year ended December 31, 2014.\nNet Realized Gains (Losses) and Net Change in Unrealized Appreciation (Depreciation)\nTable 237: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Years Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(in thousands)\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2013\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net realized (losses) gains on investments\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(12,789\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>357\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>7,253\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net realized gains on investments allocated from Predecessor Operating Company\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8,568\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total realized (losses) gains on investments\n</td> <td>(12,789\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8,925\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7,253\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net change in unrealized (depreciation) appreciation of investments\n</td> <td>(35,272\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(43,863\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7,994\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net change in unrealized appreciation (depreciation) of investments allocated from Predecessor Operating Company\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>940\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total change in unrealized (depreciation) appreciation of investments\n</td> <td>(35,272\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(42,923\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7,994\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net change in unrealized (depreciation) appreciation of securities purchased under collateralized agreements to resell\n</td> <td>(296\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Provision for taxes\n</td> <td>(1,183\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(493\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total net realized gains and net change in unrealized (depreciation) appreciation of investments\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(49,540\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(34,491\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>15,247\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOur net realized and unrealized losses resulted in a net loss of approximately $49.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the net realized gain and unrealized losses resulting in a net loss of approximately $34.5 million for the same period in 2014.

The net loss for the year ended December 31, 2015 was primarily driven by the overall decrease in the market prices of our investments during the period and $29.7 million of realized losses on investments resulting from the modification of terms on three portfolio companies that were accounted for as extinguishments.\nThese losses were partially offset by sales or repayments of investments with fair values in excess of December 31, 2014 valuations, resulting in net realized gains being greater than the reversal of the cumulative net unrealized gains for those investments which included the sale of two portfolio companies resulting in realized gains of approximately $14.2 million. The provision for income taxes was primarily attributable to three equity investments that are held as of December 31, 2015 in three of our corporate subsidiaries.\nThe net realized and unrealized losses resulted in a net loss of approximately $34.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to the Predecessor Operating Company's net realized and unrealized gains resulting in a net gain of approximately $15.2 million for the same period in 2013. We look at net realized and unrealized gains or losses together as movement in unrealized appreciation or depreciation can be the result of realizations. The net loss for the year ended December 31, 2014 was primarily driven by the overall decrease in the market prices of our investments during the period and the partial write-down related to two portfolio companies. These losses were partially offset by a $5.6 million gain from the sale of NMF Holdings' warrant investments in one portfolio company and sales or repayments of investments with fair values in excess of December 31, 2013 valuations resulting in net realized gains being greater than the reversal of the cumulative net unrealized gains for those investments. The provision for income taxes was attributable to one warrant investment that is held as of December 31, 2014 in one of our corporate subsidiaries.\nThe net gain for the year ended December 31, 2013 was primarily driven by sales or repayment of investments with fair values in excess of December 31, 2012 valuations, resulting in net realized gains being greater than the reversal of the cumulative net unrealized gains for those investments. Additionally, during the year ended December 31, 2013, a distribution from a warrant investment resulted in a realized gain of approximately $1.1 million, the modification of terms on one debt investment that was accounted for as an extinguishment resulted in a realized gain of $1.7 million and the sale of the first lien position in ATI Acquisition Company resulted in a realized loss of $4.3 million.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nThe primary use of existing funds and any funds raised in the future is expected to be for repayment of indebtedness, investments in portfolio companies, cash distributions to our stockholders or for other general corporate purposes.\nSince our IPO, and through December 31, 2015, we raised approximately $454.0 million in net proceeds from additional offerings of common stock and issued shares of common stock valued at approximately $288.4 million on behalf of AIV Holdings for exchanged units. We acquired from the Predecessor Operating Company units of the Predecessor Operating Company equal to the number of shares of our common stock sold in the additional offerings.\nOn September 25, 2015, we completed a public offering of 5,750,000 shares of common stock (including 750,000 shares of common stock that were issued pursuant to the full exercise of the option granted to the underwriters to purchase additional shares) at a public offering price of $14.14 per share, which resulted in net proceeds of $79.4 million. Steven B. Klinsky, the Chairman of our board of directors, purchased 500,000 shares in this offering at the public offering price.\nOur liquidity is generated and generally available through advances from the revolving credit facilities, from cash flows from operations, and, we expect, through periodic follow-on equity offerings. In addition, we may from time to time enter into additional debt facilities, increase the size of existing facilities or issue additional debt securities, including unsecured debt and/or debt securities convertible into common stock. Any such incurrence or issuance would be subject to prevailing market conditions, our liquidity requirements, contractual and regulatory restrictions and other factors. In accordance with the 1940 Act, with certain limited exceptions, we are only allowed to borrow amounts such that our asset coverage, calculated pursuant to the 1940 Act, is at least 200.0% after such borrowing.\nAt December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014, we had cash and cash equivalents of approximately $30.1 million and $23.4 million, respectively, and at December 31, 2013, the Predecessor Operating Company had cash and cash equivalents of approximately $15.0 million. Our cash used in operating activities during the years ended December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014, was approximately $(63.3) million and $(289.6) million, respectively, and cash used in operating activities for the Predecessor Operating Company for the year ended December 31, 2013 was approximately $(40.4) million. Refer to the Predecessor Operating Company's Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows for the period January 1, 2014 to May 7, 2014 included in an exhibit attached hereto. We expect that all current liquidity needs will be met with cash flows from operations and other activities.\nBorrowings\nHoldings Credit Facility-On December 18, 2014 we entered into the Second Amended and Restated Loan and Security Agreement (the \"Holdings Credit Facility\"), among us, as the Collateral Manager, NMF Holdings as the Borrower, Wells Fargo Securities, LLC as the Administrative Agent and Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as the Lender and Collateral Custodian, which is structured as a revolving credit facility and matures on December 18, 2019.\nImmediately prior to amending the Holdings Credit Facility, NMF SLF merged with and into NMF Holdings. The Holdings Credit Facility effectively amended and restated the Predecessor Holdings Credit Facility (as defined below), merged with the SLF Credit Facility (as defined below), and combined the amount of borrowings previously available.\nThe maximum amount of revolving borrowings available under the Holdings Credit Facility is $495.0 million, which is the aggregate of the $280.0 million previously available under the Predecessor Holdings Credit Facility (as defined below) and the $215.0 million previously available under the SLF Credit Facility (as defined below). Under the Holdings Credit Facility, NMF Holdings is permitted to borrow up to 25.0%, 45.0% or 70.0% of the purchase price of pledged assets, subject to approval by Wells Fargo Securities, LLC. The Holdings Credit Facility is non-recourse to us and is collateralized by all of the investments of NMF Holdings on an investment by investment basis. All fees associated with the origination or upsizing of the Holdings Credit Facility are capitalized on our Consolidated Statement of Assets and Liabilities and charged against income as other financing expenses over the life of the Holdings Credit Facility. The Holdings Credit Facility contains certain customary affirmative and negative covenants and events of default. In addition, the Holdings Credit Facility requires us to maintain a minimum asset coverage ratio. The covenants are generally not tied to mark to market fluctuations in the prices of NMF Holdings investments, but rather to the performance of the underlying portfolio companies.\nThe Holdings Credit Facility bears interest at a rate of the LIBOR plus 2.00% per annum for Broadly Syndicated Loans (as defined in the Loan and Security Agreement) and LIBOR plus 2.75% per annum for all other investments. The Holdings Credit Facility also charges a non-usage fee, based on the unused facility amount multiplied by the Non-Usage Fee Rate (as defined in the Loan and Security Agreement).\nPrior to December 18, 2014, the Loan and Security Agreement, as amended and restated, dated May 19, 2011 (the \"Predecessor Holdings Credit Facility\") among NMF Holdings as the Borrower and Collateral Administrator, Wells Fargo Securities, LLC as the Administrative Agent, and Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as the Collateral Custodian, was structured as a revolving credit facility and would mature on October 27, 2016.\nThe maximum amount of revolving borrowings available under the Predecessor Holdings Credit Facility was $280.0 million. Until December 18, 2014, NMF Holdings was permitted to borrow up to 45.0% or 25.0% of the purchase price of pledged first lien or non-first lien debt securities, and up to 70.0% and 45.0% of the purchase price of specified first lien debt securities and specified non-first lien debt securities, respectively, subject to approval by Wells Fargo Bank, National Association. The Predecessor Holdings Credit Facility was amended and restated on May 6, 2014 and as a result, it was non-recourse to us and was collateralized by all of the investments of NMF Holdings on an investment by investment basis. All fees associated with the origination or upsizing of the Predecessor Holdings Credit Facility were capitalized on our Consolidated Statement of Assets and Liabilities and charged against income as other financing expenses over the life of the Predecessor Holdings Credit Facility. The Predecessor Holdings Credit Facility contained certain customary affirmative and negative covenants and events of default, including the occurrence of a change in control. In addition, the Predecessor Holdings Credit Facility required us to maintain a minimum asset coverage ratio. However, the covenants were generally not tied to mark to market fluctuations in the prices of NMF Holdings' investments, but rather to the performance of the underlying portfolio companies.\nThe Predecessor Holdings Credit Facility bore interest at a rate of the LIBOR plus 2.75% per annum and charged a non-usage fee, based on the unused facility amount multiplied by the Non-Usage Fee Rate (as defined in the Loan and Security Agreement).\nThe following table summarizes the interest expense, non-usage fees and amortization of financing costs incurred, together, on the Holdings Credit Facility and the Predecessor Holdings Credit Facility for the years ended December 31, 2015, December 31, 2014 and December 31, 2013.\nTable 238: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Years Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(in millions)\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2013\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest expense\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>10.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>7.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>5.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Non-usage fee\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>0.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>0.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>0.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Amortization of financing costs\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>0.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>0.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Weighted average interest rate\n</td> <td>2.6\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.9\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.9\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Effective interest rate\n</td> <td>3.2\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.4\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.6\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Average debt outstanding\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>394.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>244.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>184.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nAs of December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014, the outstanding balance on the Holdings Credit Facility was $419.3 million and $468.1 million, respectively, and as of December 31, 2013, the outstanding balance on the Predecessor Holdings Credit Facility was $221.8 million, and NMF Holdings was in compliance with the applicable covenants in the Holdings Credit Facility and Predecessor Holdings Credit Facility on such dates.\nSLF Credit Facility-NMF SLF's Loan and Security Agreement, as amended and restated, dated October 27, 2010 (the \"SLF Credit Facility\") among NMF SLF as the Borrower, NMF Holdings as the Collateral Administrator, Wells Fargo Securities, LLC as the Administrative Agent, and Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as the Collateral Custodian, was structured as a revolving credit facility and was set to mature on October 27, 2016. The maximum amount of revolving borrowings available under the SLF Credit Facility was $215.0 million. The SLF Credit Facility was non-recourse to us and secured by all assets of NMF SLF on an investment by investment basis. All fees associated with the origination or upsizing of the SLF Credit Facility were capitalized on our Consolidated Statement of Assets and Liabilities and charged against income as other financing expenses over the life of the SLF Credit Facility. The SLF Credit Facility contained certain customary affirmative and negative covenants and events of default, including the occurrence of a change in control. The covenants were generally not tied to mark to market fluctuations in the prices of the NMF SLF's investments, but rather to the performance of the underlying portfolio companies. NMF SLF was not restricted from the purchase or sale of loans with an affiliate. Therefore, specified first lien loans could be moved as collateral between the Holdings Credit Facility and the SLF Credit Facility. The SLF Credit Facility merged with the Holdings Credit Facility on December 18, 2014.\nUntil December 18, 2014, the SLF Credit Facility permitted borrowings of up to 70.0% of the purchase price of pledged first lien debt securities and up to 25.0% of the purchase price of specified second lien loans, of which, up to 25.0% of the aggregate outstanding loan balance of all pledged debt securities in the SLF Credit Facility was allowed to be derived from second lien loans, subject to approval by Wells Fargo Bank, National Association.\nThe SLF Credit Facility bore interest at a rate of LIBOR plus 2.00% per annum for first lien loans and LIBOR plus 2.75% per annum for second lien loans, respectively, as amended on March 11, 2013. A non-usage fee was paid, based on the unused facility amount multiplied by the Non-Usage Fee Rate (as defined in the Loan and Security Agreement).\nThe following table summarizes the interest expense, non-usage fees and amortization of financing costs incurred on the SLF Credit Facility for the years ended December 31, 2015, December 31, 2014 and December 31, 2013.\nTable 239: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Years Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(in millions)\n</td> <td>2015(1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014(2)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2013\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest expense\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>4.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>4.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Non-usage fee\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(3)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(3)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Amortization of financing costs\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>0.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>0.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Weighted average interest rate\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.2\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.3\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Effective interest rate\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.6\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.7\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Average debt outstanding\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>209.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>214.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n_______________________________________________________________________________\nTable 240: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(1)\n</td> <td>Not applicable, as the SLF Credit Facility merged into the Holdings Credit Facility on December 18, 2014.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 241: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(2)\n</td> <td>For the year ended December 31, 2014, amounts reported relate to the period from January 1, 2014 to December 17, 2014 (date of merger).\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 242: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(3)\n</td> <td>For the years ended December 31, 2014 and December 31, 2013, the total non-usage fee was less than $50 thousand.\n</td> </tr>\n</table> The SLF Credit Facility merged with the Holdings Credit Facility on December 18, 2014.

The NMFC Credit Facility is guaranteed by certain of our domestic subsidiaries and proceeds from the NMFC Credit Facility may be used for general corporate purposes, including the funding of portfolio investments.\nThe maximum amount of revolving borrowings available under the NMFC Credit Facility is $95.0 million, as amended on June 26, 2015. We are permitted to borrow at various advance rates depending on the type of portfolio investment as outlined in the Senior Secured Revolving Credit Agreement. All fees associated with the origination of the NMFC Credit Facility are capitalized on our Consolidated Statement of Assets and Liabilities and charged against income as other financing expenses over the life of the NMFC Credit Facility. The NMFC Credit Facility contains certain customary affirmative and negative covenants and events of default, including certain financial covenants related to asset coverage and liquidity and other maintenance covenants.\nThe NMFC Credit Facility generally bears interest at a rate of LIBOR plus 2.50% per annum or the prime rate plus 1.50% per annum, and charges a commitment fee, based on the unused facility amount multiplied by 0.375% per annum (as defined in the Senior Secured Revolving Credit Agreement).\nThe following table summarizes the interest expense, non-usage fees and amortization of financing costs incurred on the NMFC Credit Facility for the years ended December 31, 2015, December 31, 2014 and December 31, 2013.\nTable 243: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Years Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(in millions)\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014(1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2013(2)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest expense\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>0.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Non-usage fee\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>0.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>0.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Amortization of financing costs\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>0.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>0.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Weighted average interest rate\n</td> <td>2.7\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.7\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Effective interest rate\n</td> <td>3.5\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.4\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Average debt outstanding\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>60.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>11.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n_______________________________________________________________________________\nTable 244: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(1)\n</td> <td>For the year ended December 31, 2014, amounts reported relate to the period from June 4, 2014 (commencement of the NMFC Credit Facility) to December 31, 2014.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 245: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(2)\n</td> <td>Not applicable, as the NMFC Credit Facility commenced on June 4, 2014.\n</td> </tr>\n</table> As of December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014, the outstanding balance on the NMFC Credit Facility was $90.0 million and $50.0 million, respectively, and NMFC was in compliance with the applicable covenants in the NMFC Credit Facility on such dates.\nConvertible Notes-On June 3, 2014, we closed a private offering of $115.0 million aggregate principal amount of senior unsecured convertible notes (the \"Convertible Notes\"), pursuant to an indenture, dated June 3, 2014 (the \"Indenture\"). The Convertible Notes were issued in a private placement only to qualified institutional buyers pursuant to Rule 144A under the Securities Act of 1933. As of the first anniversary, June 3, 2015, of the Convertible Notes, the restrictions under Rule 144A under the Securities Act of 1933 were removed, allowing the Convertible Notes to be eligible and freely tradeable without restrictions for resale pursuant to Rule 144(b)(1) under the Securities Act of 1933. The Convertible Notes bear interest at an annual rate of 5.0%, payable semi-annually in arrears on June 15 and December 15 of each year, which commenced on December 15, 2014. The Convertible Notes will mature on June 15, 2019 unless earlier converted or repurchased at the holder's option.\nThe following table summarizes certain key terms related to the convertible features of our Convertible Notes as of December 31, 2015.\nTable 246: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>December 31, 2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Initial conversion premium\n</td> <td>12.5\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Initial conversion rate(1)\n</td> <td>62.7746\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Initial conversion price\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>15.93\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Conversion premium at December 31, 2015\n</td> <td>11.7\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Conversion rate at December 31, 2015(1)(2)\n</td> <td>63.2794\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Conversion price at December 31, 2015(2)(3)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>15.80\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Last conversion price calculation date\n</td> <td>June 3, 2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n_______________________________________________________________________________\nTable 247: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(1)\n</td> <td>Conversion rates denominated in shares of common stock per $1.0 thousand principal amount of the Convertible Notes converted.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 248: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(2)\n</td> <td>Represents conversion rate and conversion price, as applicable, taking into account certain de minimis adjustments that will be made on the conversion date.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 249: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(3)\n</td> <td>The conversion price in effect at December 31, 2015 was calculated on the last anniversary of the issuance and will be adjusted again on the next anniversary, unless the exercise price shall have changed by more than 1.0% before the anniversary.\n</td> </tr>\n</table> The conversion rate will be subject to adjustment upon certain events, such as stock splits and combinations, mergers, spin-offs, increases in dividends in excess of $0.34 per share per quarter and certain changes in control. Certain of these adjustments, including adjustments for increases in dividends, are subject to a conversion price floor of $14.16 per share. In no event will the total number of shares of common stock issuable upon conversion exceed 70.6214 per $1.0 thousand principal amount of the Convertible Notes. We have determined that the embedded conversion option in the Convertible Notes is not required to be separately accounted for as a derivative under GAAP.\nThe Convertible Notes are senior unsecured obligations and rank senior in right of payment to our existing and future indebtedness that is expressly subordinated in right of payment to the Convertible Notes; equal in right of payment to our existing and future unsecured indebtedness that is not so subordinated; effectively junior in right of payment to any of our secured indebtedness (including existing unsecured indebtedness that we later secure) to the extent of the value of the assets securing such indebtedness; and structurally junior to all existing and future indebtedness (including trade payables) incurred by our subsidiaries and financing vehicles. As reflected in Item 8.-Financial Statements and Supplementary Data-Note 12, Earnings Per Share, the issuance is considered part of the if-converted method for calculation of diluted earnings per share.\nWe may not redeem the Convertible Notes prior to maturity.

SBA-guaranteed debentures are non-recourse to us, interest only debentures with interest payable semi-annually and have a ten year maturity. The principal amount of SBA-guaranteed debentures is not required to be paid prior to maturity but may be prepaid at any time without penalty. The interest rate of SBA-guaranteed debentures is fixed on a semi-annual basis at a market-driven spread over U.S. Treasury Notes with ten year maturities. The SBA, as a creditor, will have a superior claim to the assets of SBIC LP over our stockholders in the event SBIC LP is liquidated or the SBA exercises remedies upon an event of default.\nThe maximum amount of borrowings available under current SBA regulations is $150.0 million as long as the licensee has at least $75.0 million in regulatory capital, receives a capital commitment from the SBA and has been through an examination by the SBA subsequent to licensing.\nAs of December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014, SBIC LP had regulatory capital of approximately $72.4 million and $42.2 million, respectively, and SBA-guaranteed debentures outstanding of $117.7 million and $37.5 million, respectively. The SBA-guaranteed debentures incur upfront fees of 3.425%, which consists of a 1.00% commitment fee and a 2.425% issuance discount, which are amortized over the life of the SBA-guaranteed debentures.

Although we undertake no obligation to revise or update any forward-looking statements, you are advised to consult any additional disclosures that we may make directly to you or through reports that we have filed or in the future may file with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (\"SEC\"), including annual reports on Form 10-K, registration statements on Form N-2, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and current reports on Form 8-K.\nOverview\nNew Mountain Finance Corporation\nWe are a Delaware corporation that was originally incorporated on June 29, 2010. We are a closed-end, non-diversified management investment company that has elected to be regulated as a business development company (\"BDC\") under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the \"1940 Act\"). As such, we are obligated to comply with certain regulatory requirements. We have elected to be treated, and intend to comply with the requirements to continue to qualify annually, as a regulated investment company (\"RIC\") under Subchapter M of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, (the \"Code\"). NMFC is also registered as an investment adviser under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, as amended (the \"Advisers Act\").\nOn May 19, 2011, we priced our initial public offering (the \"IPO\") of 7,272,727 shares of common stock at a public offering price of $13.75 per share. Concurrently with the closing of the IPO and at the public offering price of $13.75 per share, we sold an additional 2,172,000 shares of our common stock to certain executives and employees of, and other individuals affiliated with, New Mountain Capital (defined as New Mountain Capital Group, L.L.C. and its affiliates) in a concurrent private placement (the \"Concurrent Private Placement\"). Additionally, 1,252,964 shares were issued to the partners of New Mountain Guardian Partners, L.P. at that time for their ownership interest in the Predecessor Entities (as defined below). In connection with our IPO and through a series of transactions, New Mountain Finance Holdings, L.L.C. (\"NMF Holdings\" or the \"Predecessor Operating Company\") acquired all of the operations of the Predecessor Entities, including all of the assets and liabilities related to such operations.\nNew Mountain Finance Holdings, L.L.C.\nNMF Holdings is a Delaware limited liability company. Until May 8, 2014, NMF Holdings was externally managed and was regulated as a BDC under the 1940 Act. As such, NMF Holdings was obligated to comply with certain regulatory requirements. NMF Holdings was treated as a partnership for United States (\"U.S.\") federal income tax purposes for so long as it had at least two members. With the completion of the underwritten secondary offering on February 3, 2014, NMF Holdings' existence as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes terminated and NMF Holdings became an entity that is disregarded as a separate entity from its owner for U.S. federal tax purposes. For additional information on our organizational structure prior to May 8, 2014, see \"-Restructuring\".\nUntil May 8, 2014, NMF Holdings was externally managed by the Investment Adviser. As of May 8, 2014, the Investment Adviser serves as the external investment adviser to us. New Mountain Finance Administration, L.L.C. (the \"Administrator\") provides the administrative services necessary for operations. The Investment Adviser and Administrator are wholly-owned subsidiaries of New Mountain Capital. New Mountain Capital is a firm with a track record of investing in the middle market and with assets under management totaling more than $15.0 billion(1), which includes total assets held by us. New Mountain Capital focuses on investing in defensive growth companies across its private equity, public equity and credit investment vehicles. NMF Holdings, formerly known as New Mountain Guardian (Leveraged), L.L.C., was originally formed as a subsidiary of New Mountain Guardian AIV, L.P. (\"Guardian AIV\") by New Mountain Capital in October 2008. Guardian AIV was formed through an allocation of approximately $300.0 million of the $5.1 billion of commitments supporting New Mountain Partners III, L.P., a private equity fund managed by New Mountain Capital. In February 2009, New Mountain Capital formed a co-investment vehicle, New Mountain Guardian Partners, L.P., comprising $20.4 million of commitments. New Mountain Guardian (Leveraged), L.L.C. and New Mountain Guardian Partners, L.P., together with their respective direct and indirect wholly-owned subsidiaries, are defined as the \"Predecessor Entities\".\nPrior to December 18, 2014, New Mountain Finance SPV Funding, L.L.C. (\"NMF SLF\") was a Delaware limited liability company. NMF SLF was a wholly-owned subsidiary of NMF Holdings and thus our wholly-owned indirect subsidiary. NMF SLF was bankruptcy-remote and non-recourse to us. As part of an amendment to our existing credit facilities with Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, NMF SLF merged with and into NMF Holdings on December 18, 2014. See Item 8.-Financial Statements and Supplementary Data-Note 7, Borrowings for additional information on our credit facilities.\nNew Mountain Finance AIV Holdings Corporation\nUntil April 25, 2014, New Mountain Finance AIV Holdings Corporation (\"AIV Holdings\") was a Delaware corporation that was originally incorporated on March 11, 2011. AIV Holdings was dissolved on April 25, 2014. Guardian AIV, a Delaware limited partnership, was AIV Holdings' sole stockholder. AIV Holdings was a closed-end, non-diversified management investment company that was regulated as a BDC under the 1940 Act. As such, AIV Holdings was obligated to comply with certain regulatory requirements. AIV Holdings was treated, and complied with the requirements to qualify annually, as a RIC under the Code.\n_______________________________________________________________________________\n (1) Includes amounts committed, not all of which have been drawn down and invested to date, as of December 31, 2015. \nStructure\nPrior to the Restructuring (as defined below) on May 8, 2014, NMFC and AIV Holdings were holding companies with no direct operations of their own, and their sole asset was their ownership in NMF Holdings. In connection with the IPO, NMFC and AIV Holdings each entered into a joinder agreement with respect to the Limited Liability Company Agreement, as amended and restated (the \"Operating Agreement\"), of NMF Holdings, pursuant to which NMFC and AIV Holdings were admitted as members of NMF Holdings. NMFC acquired from NMF Holdings, with the gross proceeds of the IPO and the Concurrent Private Placement, common membership units (\"units\") of NMF Holdings (the number of units were equal to the number of shares of NMFC's common stock sold in the IPO and the Concurrent Private Placement). Additionally, NMFC received units of NMF Holdings equal to the number of shares of common stock of NMFC issued to the partners of New Mountain Guardian Partners, L.P. Guardian AIV was the parent of NMF Holdings prior to the IPO and, as a result of the transactions completed in connection with the IPO, obtained units in NMF Holdings. Guardian AIV contributed its units in NMF Holdings to AIV Holdings in exchange for common stock of AIV Holdings. AIV Holdings had the right to exchange all or any portion of its units in NMF Holdings for shares of NMFC's common stock on a one-for-one basis at any time.\nThe original structure was designed to generally prevent NMFC and its stockholders from being allocated taxable income with respect to unrecognized gains that existed at the time of the IPO in the Predecessor Entities' assets, and rather such amounts would be allocated generally to AIV Holdings. The result was that any distributions made to NMFC's stockholders that were attributable to such gains generally were not treated as taxable dividends but rather as return of capital.\nSince our IPO, and through December 31, 2015, we raised approximately $454.0 million in net proceeds from additional offerings of common stock and issued shares of common stock valued at approximately $288.4 million on behalf of AIV Holdings for exchanged units. We acquired from NMF Holdings units of NMF Holdings equal to the number of shares of our common stock sold in additional offerings. With the completion of the final secondary offering on February 3, 2014, we owned 100.0% of the units of NMF Holdings, which became our wholly-owned subsidiary.\nRestructuring\nAs a BDC, AIV Holdings had been subject to the 1940 Act, including certain provisions applicable only to BDCs. Accordingly, and after careful consideration of the 1940 Act requirements applicable to BDCs, the cost of 1940 Act compliance and a thorough assessment of AIV Holdings' business model, AIV Holdings' board of directors determined that continuation as a BDC was not in the best interests of AIV Holdings and Guardian AIV. Specifically, given that AIV Holdings was formed for the sole purpose of holding units of NMF Holdings and AIV Holdings had disposed of all of the units of NMF Holdings that it was holding as of February 3, 2014, the board of directors of AIV Holdings approved and declared advisable at an in-person meeting held on March 25, 2014 the withdrawal of AIV Holdings' election to be regulated as a BDC under the 1940 Act. In addition, the board of directors of AIV Holdings approved and declared advisable for AIV Holdings to terminate its registration under Section 12(g) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the \"Exchange Act\") and to dissolve AIV Holdings under the laws of the State of Delaware.\nUpon receipt of the necessary stockholder consent to authorize the board of directors of AIV Holdings to withdraw AIV Holdings' election to be regulated as a BDC, the withdrawal was filed and became effective upon receipt by the SEC of AIV Holdings' notification of withdrawal on Form N-54C on April 15, 2014. The board of directors of AIV Holdings believed that AIV Holdings met the requirements for filing the notification to withdraw its election to be regulated as a BDC, upon the receipt of the necessary stockholder consent. After the notification of withdrawal of AIV Holdings' BDC election was filed with the SEC, AIV Holdings was no longer subject to the regulatory provisions of the 1940 Act applicable to BDCs generally, including regulations related to insurance, custody, composition of its board of directors, affiliated transactions and any compensation arrangements.\nIn addition, on April 15, 2014, AIV Holdings filed a Form 15 with the SEC to terminate AIV Holdings' registration under Section 12(g) of the Exchange Act. After these SEC filings and any other federal or state regulatory or tax filings were made, AIV Holdings proceeded to dissolve under Delaware law by filing a certificate of dissolution in Delaware on April 25, 2014.\nUntil May 8, 2014, as a BDC, NMF Holdings had been subject to the 1940 Act, including certain provisions applicable only to BDCs. Accordingly, and after careful consideration of the 1940 Act requirements applicable to BDCs, the cost of 1940 Act compliance and a thorough assessment of NMF Holdings' current business model, NMF Holdings' board of directors determined at an in-person meeting held on March 25, 2014 that continuation as a BDC was not in the best interests of NMF Holdings.\nAt the 2014 joint annual meeting of the stockholders of NMFC and the sole unit holder of NMF Holdings held on May 6, 2014, the stockholders of NMFC and the sole unit holder of NMF Holdings approved a proposal which authorized the board of directors of NMF Holdings to withdraw NMF Holdings' election to be regulated as a BDC. Additionally, the\nstockholders of NMFC approved a new investment advisory and management agreement between NMFC and the Investment Adviser. Upon receipt of the necessary stockholder/unit holder approval to authorize the board of directors of NMF Holdings to withdraw NMF Holdings' election to be regulated as a BDC, the withdrawal was filed and became effective upon receipt by the SEC of NMF Holdings' notification of withdrawal on Form N-54C on May 8, 2014.\nEffective May 8, 2014, NMF Holdings amended and restated its Operating Agreement such that the board of directors of NMF Holdings was dissolved and NMF Holdings remained a wholly-owned subsidiary of NMFC with the sole purpose of serving as a special purpose vehicle for NMF Holdings' credit facility, and NMFC assumed all other operating activities previously undertaken by NMF Holdings under the management of the Investment Adviser (collectively, the \"Restructuring\"). After the Restructuring, all wholly-owned direct and indirect subsidiaries of NMFC are consolidated with NMFC for both 1940 Act and financial statement reporting purposes, subject to any financial statement adjustments required in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (\"GAAP\"). NMFC continues to remain a BDC regulated under the 1940 Act.\nAlso, on May 8, 2014, NMF Holdings filed Form 15 with the SEC to terminate NMF Holdings' registration under Section 12(g) of the Exchange Act. As a special purpose entity, NMF Holdings is bankruptcy-remote and non-recourse to NMFC. In addition, the assets held at NMF Holdings will continue to be used to secure NMF Holdings' credit facility.\nCurrent Organization\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2015, we established a wholly-owned subsidiary, NMF QID NGL Holdings, Inc. ( NMF QID\u201d). Our wholly-owned subsidiaries, NMF Ancora Holdings Inc. ( NMF Ancora\u201d), NMF QID and NMF YP Holdings Inc. ( NMF YP\u201d), are structured as Delaware entities that serve as tax blocker corporations which hold equity or equity-like investments in portfolio companies organized as limited liability companies (or other forms of pass-through entities). We consolidate our tax blocker corporations for accounting purposes. The tax blocker corporations are not consolidated for income tax purposes and may incur income tax expense as a result of their ownership of the portfolio companies. Additionally, our wholly-owned subsidiary, New Mountain Finance Servicing, L.L.C. ( NMF Servicing\u201d) serves as the administrative agent on certain investment transactions. New Mountain Finance SBIC, L.P. ( SBIC LP\u201d), and its general partner, New Mountain Finance SBIC G.P., L.L.C. ( SBIC GP\u201d), were organized in Delaware as a limited partnership and limited liability company, respectively. SBIC LP and SBIC GP are our consolidated wholly-owned direct and indirect subsidiaries. SBIC LP received a license from the U.S. Small Business Administration (the SBA\u201d) to operate as a small business investment company ( SBIC\u201d) under Section 301(c) of the Small Business Investment Act of 1958, as amended (the 1958 Act\u201d).\nThe diagram below depicts our organizational structure as of December 31, 2015.\n_______________________________________________________________________________\n * Includes partners of New Mountain Guardian Partners, L.P. \n ** NMFC is the sole limited partner of SBIC LP. NMFC, directly or indirectly through SBIC GP, wholly-owns SBIC LP. NMFC owns 100.0% of SBIC GP which owns 1.0% of SBIC LP. NMFC owns 99.0% of SBIC LP. \nOur investment objective is to generate current income and capital appreciation through the sourcing and origination of debt securities at all levels of the capital structure, including first and second lien debt, notes, bonds and mezzanine securities. In some cases, our investments may also include equity interests. The primary focus is in the debt of defensive growth companies, which are defined as generally exhibiting the following characteristics: (i) sustainable secular growth drivers, (ii) high barriers to competitive entry, (iii) high free cash flow after capital expenditure and working capital needs, (iv) high returns on assets and (v) niche market dominance. Similar to us, SBIC LP's investment objective is to generate current income and capital appreciation under our investment criteria. However, SBIC LP's investments must be in SBA eligible companies. Our portfolio may be concentrated in a limited number of industries. As of December 31, 2015, our top five industry concentrations were software, business services, education, distribution & logistics and federal services.\nAs of December 31, 2015, our net asset value was $836.9 million and our portfolio had a fair value of approximately $1,512.2 million in 75 portfolio companies, with a weighted average Yield to Maturity at Cost of approximately 10.7%. This Yield to Maturity at Cost (\"Yield to Maturity at Cost\") calculation assumes that all investments, including secured collateralized agreements, not on non-accrual are purchased at the adjusted cost on the quarter end date and held until their respective maturities with no prepayments or losses and exited at par at maturity. Adjusted cost reflects the GAAP cost for post-IPO investments and a stepped up cost basis of pre-IPO investments (assuming a step-up to fair market value occurred on the IPO date). This calculation excludes the impact of existing leverage. Yield to Maturity at Cost uses the London Interbank Offered Rate (\"LIBOR\") curves at each quarter's end date. The actual yield to maturity may be higher or lower due to the future selection of the LIBOR contracts by the individual companies in our portfolio or other factors.\nRecent Developments\nOn February 4, 2016, our board of directors authorized a program for the purpose of repurchasing up to $50.0 million worth of our common stock. Under the repurchase program, we may, but are not obligated to, repurchase our outstanding common stock in the open market from time to time provided that we comply with our code of ethics and the guidelines specified in Rule 10b-18 of the Exchange Act, including certain price, market volume and timing constraints. In addition, any repurchases will be conducted in accordance with the 1940 Act. Unless amended or extended by our board of directors, we expect the repurchase program to be in place until the earlier of December 31, 2016 or until $50.0 million of our outstanding shares of common stock have been repurchased.\nOur board of directors authorized the repurchase program because it believes the sustained market volatility and uncertainty may cause our common stock to be undervalued from time to time. The timing and number of shares to be repurchased will depend on a number of factors, including market conditions. There are no assurances that we will engage in repurchases, but if market conditions warrant, we now have the ability to take advantage of situations where our management believes share repurchases would be advantageous to us and to our shareholders.\nOn February 22, 2016, our board of directors declared a first quarter 2016 distribution of $0.34 per share payable on March 31, 2016 to holders of record as of March 17, 2016.\nCritical Accounting Policies\nThe preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and revenues and expenses during the periods reported. Actual results could materially differ from those estimates. We have identified the following items as critical accounting policies.\nBasis of Accounting\nWe consolidate our wholly-owned direct and indirect subsidiaries: NMF Holdings, NMF Servicing, SBIC LP, SBIC GP, NMF Ancora, NMF QID and NMF YP. Previously, we consolidated our wholly-owned indirect subsidiary NMF SLF until it merged with and into NMF Holdings on December 18, 2014. See Item 8.-Financial Statements and Supplementary Data-Note 7, Borrowings for additional information on our credit facilities. We are an investment company following accounting and reporting guidance as described in Accounting Standards Codification Topic 946, Financial Services-Investment Companies, (\"ASC 946\"). Prior to the Restructuring, the Predecessor Operating Company consolidated its wholly-owned subsidiary, NMF SLF. NMFC and AIV Holdings did not consolidate the Predecessor Operating Company. Prior to the Restructuring, NMFC and AIV Holdings applied investment company master-feeder financial statement presentation, as described in ASC 946 to their interest in the Predecessor Operating Company. NMFC and AIV Holdings observed that it is also industry practice to follow the presentation prescribed for a master fund-feeder fund structure in ASC 946 in instances in which a master fund is owned by more than one feeder fund and that such presentation provided stockholders of NMFC and AIV Holdings with a clearer depiction of their investment in the master fund.\nValuation and Leveling of Portfolio Investments\nAt all times consistent with GAAP and the 1940 Act, we conduct a valuation of assets, which impacts our net asset value.\nWe value our assets on a quarterly basis, or more frequently if required under the 1940 Act. In all cases, our board of directors is ultimately and solely responsible for determining the fair value of our portfolio investments on a quarterly basis in good faith, including investments that are not publicly traded, those whose market prices are not readily available and any other situation where our portfolio investments require a fair value determination. Security transactions are accounted for on a trade date basis. Our quarterly valuation procedures are set forth in more detail below:\n (1) Investments for which market quotations are readily available on an exchange are valued at such market quotations based on the closing price indicated from independent pricing services. \n (2) Investments for which indicative prices are obtained from various pricing services and/or brokers or dealers are valued through a multi-step valuation process, as described below, to determine whether the quote(s) obtained is representative of fair value in accordance with GAAP. \n a. Bond quotes are obtained through independent pricing services. Internal reviews are performed by the investment professionals of the Investment Adviser to ensure that the quote obtained is representative of fair value in accordance with GAAP and if so, the quote is used. If the Investment Adviser is unable to sufficiently validate the quote(s) internally and if the investment's par value or its fair value exceeds the materiality threshold, the investment is valued similarly to those assets with no readily available quotes (see (3) below); and \n b. For investments other than bonds, we look at the number of quotes readily available and performs the following: \n i. Investments for which two or more quotes are received from a pricing service are valued using the mean of the mean of the bid and ask of the quotes obtained; \n ii. Investments for which one quote is received from a pricing service are validated internally. The investment professionals of the Investment Adviser analyze the market quotes obtained using an array of valuation methods (further described below) to validate the fair value. If the Investment Adviser is unable to sufficiently validate the quote internally and if the investment's par value or its fair value exceeds the materiality threshold, the investment is valued similarly to those assets with no readily available quotes (see (3) below). \n (3) Investments for which quotations are not readily available through exchanges, pricing services, brokers, or dealers are valued through a multi-step valuation process: \n a. Each portfolio company or investment is initially valued by the investment professionals of the Investment Adviser responsible for the credit monitoring; \n b. Preliminary valuation conclusions will then be documented and discussed with our senior management; \n c. If an investment falls into (3) above for four consecutive quarters and if the investment's par value or its fair value exceeds the materiality threshold, then at least once each fiscal year, the valuation for each portfolio investment for which we do not have a readily available market quotation will be reviewed by an independent valuation firm engaged by our board of directors; and \n d. When deemed appropriate by our management, an independent valuation firm may be engaged to review and value investment(s) of a portfolio company, without any preliminary valuation being performed by the Investment Adviser. The investment professionals of the Investment Adviser will review and validate the value provided.  For investments in revolving credit facilities and delayed draw commitments, the cost basis of the funded investments purchased is offset by any costs/netbacks received for any unfunded portion on the total balance committed. The fair value is also adjusted for the price appreciation or depreciation on the unfunded portion. As a result, the purchase of commitments not completely funded may result in a negative fair value until it is called and funded.\nThe values assigned to investments are based upon available information and do not necessarily represent amounts which might ultimately be realized, since such amounts depend on future circumstances and cannot be reasonably determined until the individual positions are liquidated. Due to the inherent uncertainty of determining the fair value of investments that do not have a readily available market value, the fair value of our investments may fluctuate from period to period and the fluctuations could be material.\nGAAP fair value measurement guidance classifies the inputs used in measuring fair value into three levels as follows:\nLevel I-Quoted prices (unadjusted) are available in active markets for identical investments and we have the ability to access such quotes as of the reporting date. The type of investments which would generally be included in Level I include active exchange-traded equity securities and exchange-traded derivatives. As required by Accounting Standards Codification Topic 820, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures (\"ASC 820\"), we, to the extent that we hold such investments, do not adjust the quoted price for these investments, even in situations where we hold a large position and a sale could reasonably impact the quoted price.\nLevel II-Pricing inputs are observable for the investments, either directly or indirectly, as of the reporting date, but are not the same as those used in Level I. Level II inputs include the following:\n \u2022 Quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets; \n \u2022 Quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in non-active markets (examples include corporate and municipal bonds, which trade infrequently); \n \u2022 Pricing models whose inputs are observable for substantially the full term of the asset or liability (examples include most over-the-counter derivatives, including foreign exchange forward contracts); and \n \u2022 Pricing models whose inputs are derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data through correlation or other means for substantially the full term of the asset or liability.  Level III-Pricing inputs are unobservable for the investment and include situations where there is little, if any, market activity for the investment.\nThe inputs used to measure fair value may fall into different levels. In all instances when the inputs fall within different levels of the hierarchy, the level within which the fair value measurement is categorized is based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety. As such, a Level III fair value measurement may include inputs that are both observable and unobservable. Gains and losses for such assets categorized within the Level III table below may include changes in fair value that are attributable to both observable inputs and unobservable inputs.\nThe inputs into the determination of fair value require significant judgment or estimation by management and consideration of factors specific to each investment. A review of the fair value hierarchy classifications is conducted on a quarterly basis. Changes in the observability of valuation inputs may result in the transfer of certain investments within the fair value hierarchy from period to period. Reclassifications impacting the fair value hierarchy are reported as transfers in/out of the respective leveling categories as of the beginning of the quarter in which the reclassifications occur.\nThe following table summarizes the levels in the fair value hierarchy that our portfolio investments fall into as of December 31, 2015:\nTable 210: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(in thousands)\n</td> <td>Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Level I\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Level II\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Level III\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>First lien\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>670,023\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>329,133\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>340,890\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Second lien\n</td> <td>631,985\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>449,227\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>182,758\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Subordinated\n</td> <td>87,005\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>33,546\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>53,459\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Equity and other\n</td> <td>123,211\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>316\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>15\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>122,880\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total investments\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,512,224\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>316\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>811,921\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>699,987\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe generally use the following framework when determining the fair value of investments where there are little, if any, market activity or observable pricing inputs. We typically determine the fair value of our performing debt investments utilizing an income approach. Additional consideration is given using a market based approach, as well as reviewing the overall underlying portfolio company's performance and associated financial risks. The following outlines additional details on the approaches considered:\nCompany Performance, Financial Review, and Analysis: Prior to investment, as part of our due diligence process, we evaluate the overall performance and financial stability of the portfolio company. Post investment, we analyze each portfolio company's current operating performance and relevant financial trends versus prior year and budgeted results, including, but not limited to, factors affecting its revenue and earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (\"EBITDA\") growth, margin trends, liquidity position, covenant compliance and changes to its capital structure. We also attempt to identify and subsequently track any developments at the portfolio company, within its customer or vendor base or within the industry or the macroeconomic environment, generally, that may alter any material element of our original\ninvestment thesis. This analysis is specific to each portfolio company. We leverage the knowledge gained from our original due diligence process, augmented by this subsequent monitoring, to continually refine our outlook for each of our portfolio companies and ultimately form the valuation of our investment in each portfolio company. When an external event such as a purchase transaction, public offering or subsequent sale occurs, we will consider the pricing indicated by the external event to corroborate the private valuation.\nFor debt investments, we may employ the Market Based Approach (as described below) to assess the total enterprise value of the portfolio company, in order to evaluate the enterprise value coverage of our debt investment. For equity investments or in cases where the Market Based Approach implies a lack of enterprise value coverage for the debt investment, we may additionally employ a discounted cash flow analysis based on the free cash flows of the portfolio company to assess the total enterprise value.\nAfter enterprise value coverage is demonstrated for our debt investments through the method(s) above, the Income Based Approach (as described below) may be employed to estimate the fair value of the investment.\nMarket Based Approach: We may estimate the total enterprise value of each portfolio company by utilizing market value cash flow (EBITDA) multiples of publicly traded comparable companies and comparable transactions. We consider numerous factors when selecting the appropriate companies whose trading multiples are used to value our portfolio companies. These factors include, but are not limited to, the type of organization, similarity to the business being valued, relevant risk factors, as well as size, profitability and growth expectations. We may apply an average of various relevant comparable company EBITDA multiples to the portfolio company's latest twelve month (\"LTM\") EBITDA or projected EBITDA to calculate the enterprise value of the portfolio company. Significant increases or decreases in the EBITDA multiple will result in an increase or decrease in enterprise value, which may result in an increase or decrease in the fair value estimate of the investment. In applying the market based approach as of December 31, 2015, we used the relevant EBITDA multiple ranges set forth in the table below to determine the enterprise value of our portfolio companies. We believe this was a reasonable range in light of current comparable company trading levels and the specific portfolio companies involved.\nIncome Based Approach: We also may use a discounted cash flow analysis to estimate the fair value of the investment. Projected cash flows represent the relevant security's contractual interest, fee and principal payments plus the assumption of full principal recovery at the investment's expected maturity date. These cash flows are discounted at a rate established utilizing a yield calibration approach, which incorporates changes in the credit quality (as measured by relevant statistics) of the portfolio company, as compared to changes in the yield associated with comparable credit quality market indices, between the date of origination and the valuation date. Significant increases or decreases in the discount rate would result in a decrease or increase in the fair value measurement. In applying the income based approach as of December 31, 2015, we used the discount ranges set forth in the table below to value investments in our portfolio companies.\nThe unobservable inputs used

as the best measure of fair value with no material changes in operations of the related portfolio company since the transaction date.  NMFC Senior Loan Program I, LLC\nNMFC Senior Loan Program I, LLC (\"SLP I\") was formed as a Delaware limited liability company on May 27, 2014 and commenced operations on June 10, 2014. SLP I is a portfolio company held by us. SLP I is structured as a private investment fund, in which all of the investors are qualified purchasers, as such term is defined under the 1940 Act. Transfer of interests in SLP I is subject to restrictions, and as a result, such interests are not readily marketable. SLP I operates under a limited liability company agreement (the \"Agreement\") and will continue in existence until June 10, 2019, subject to earlier termination pursuant to certain terms of the Agreement. The term may be extended for up to one year pursuant to certain terms of the Agreement. SLP I has a three year re-investment period. SLP I invests in senior secured loans issued by companies within our core industry verticals. These investments are typically broadly syndicated first lien loans.\nSLP I is capitalized with $93.0 million of capital commitments, $275.0 million of debt from a revolving credit facility and is managed by us. Our capital commitment is $23.0 million, representing less than 25.0% ownership, with third party investors representing the remaining capital commitment. As of December 31, 2015, SLP I had total investments with an aggregate fair value of approximately $349.7 million, debt outstanding of $267.6 million and capital that had been called and funded of $93.0 million. As of December 31, 2014, SLP I had total investments with an aggregate fair value of approximately $369.2 million, debt outstanding of $266.9 million and capital that had been called and funded of $93.0 million. Our investment in SLP I is disclosed on our Consolidated Schedules of Investments as of December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014.\nWe, as an investment adviser registered under the Advisers Act, act as the collateral manager to SLP I and are entitled to receive a management fee for our investment management services provided to SLP I. As a result, SLP I is classified as our affiliate. No management fee is charged on our investment in SLP I in connection with the administrative services provided to SLP I. For the years ended December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014, we earned approximately $1.2 million and $0.5 million, respectively, in management fees related to SLP I which is included in other income. As of December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014, approximately $0.3 million and $0.5 million, respectively, of management fees related to SLP I was included in receivable from affiliates. For the years ended December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014, we earned approximately $3.6 million and $1.1 million, respectively, of dividend income related to SLP I, which is included in dividend\nincome. As of December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014, approximately $0.9 million and $0.8 million, respectively, of dividend income related to SLP I was included in interest and dividend receivable. We did not earn management fees or dividend income for the year ended December 31, 2013.\nCollateralized agreements or repurchase financings\nWe follow the guidance in Accounting Standards Codification Topic 860, Transfers and Servicing-Secured Borrowing and Collateral, (\"ASC 860\") when accounting for transactions involving the purchases of securities under collateralized agreements to resell (resale agreements). These transactions are treated as collateralized financing transactions and are recorded at their contracted resale or repurchase amounts, as specified in the respective agreements. Interest on collateralized agreements is accrued and recognized over the life of the transaction and included in interest income. As of December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014, we held one collateralized agreement to resell with a cost basis of $30.0 million and $30.0 million, respectively, and a carrying value of $29.7 million and $30.0 million, respectively, collateralized by a second lien bond in Northstar GOM Holdings Group LLC with a fair value of $29.7 million and $30.0 million, respectively, and guaranteed by a private hedge fund with approximately $716.6 million and $769.4 million, respectively, of assets under management. Pursuant to the terms of the collateralized agreement, the private hedge fund is obligated to repurchase the collateral from us at the par value of the collateralized agreement once called upon by us or if the private hedge fund's total assets under management fall below the agreed upon thresholds. The collateralized agreement earned interest at a weighted average rate of 15.0% per annum as of December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014.\nRevenue Recognition\nOur revenue recognition policies are as follows:\nSales and paydowns of investments: Realized gains and losses on investments are determined on the specific identification method.\nInterest and dividend income: Interest income, including amortization of premium and discount using the effective interest method, is recorded on the accrual basis and periodically assessed for collectability. Interest income also includes interest earned from cash on hand. Upon the prepayment of a loan or debt security, any prepayment penalties are recorded as part of interest income. We have loans and certain preferred equity investments in the portfolio that contain a payment-in-kind ( PIK\u201d) interest or dividend provision. PIK interest and dividends are accrued and recorded as income at the contractual rates, if deemed collectible. The PIK interest and dividends are added to the principal or share balances on the capitalization dates and generally due at maturity or when redeemed by the issuer.\nDividend income on common equity is recorded on the record date for private portfolio companies or on the ex-dividend date for publicly traded portfolio companies. Dividend income on preferred securities is recorded as dividend income on an accrual basis to the extent that such amounts are deemed collectible.\nNon-accrual income: Investments are placed on non-accrual status when principal or interest payments are past due 30 days or more and when there is reasonable doubt that principal or interest will be collected. Accrued cash and un-capitalized PIK interest or dividends are reversed when an investment is placed on non-accrual status. Previously capitalized PIK interest or dividends are not reversed when an investment is placed on non-accrual status. Interest or dividend payments received on non-accrual investments may be recognized as income or applied to principal depending upon management's judgment of the ultimate outcome. Non-accrual investments are restored to accrual status when past due principal and interest is paid and, in management's judgment, are likely to remain current.\nOther income: Other income represents delayed compensation, consent or amendment fees, revolver fees, structuring fees, upfront fees, management fees from a non-controlled/affiliated investment and other miscellaneous fees received and are typically non-recurring in nature. Delayed compensation is income earned from counterparties on trades that do not settle within a set number of business days after trade date. Other income may also include fees from bridge loans. We may from time to time enter into bridge financing commitments, an obligation to provide interim financing to a counterparty until permanent credit can be obtained. These commitments are short-term in nature and may expire unfunded. A fee is received for providing such commitments. Structuring fees and upfront fees are recognized as income when earned, usually when paid at the closing of the investment and are non-refundable.\nPrior to the Restructuring, our revenue recognition policies were as follows:\nRevenue, expenses, and capital gains (losses): At each quarterly valuation date, the Predecessor Operating Company's investment income, expenses, net realized gains (losses), and net increase (decrease) in unrealized appreciation (depreciation) were allocated to us based on our pro-rata interest in the net assets of the Predecessor Operating Company. This was recorded on our Statements of Operations. Realized gains and losses are recorded upon sales of our investments in the Predecessor Operating Company. Net change in unrealized appreciation (depreciation) of investment in New Mountain Finance Holdings, L.L.C. is the difference between the net asset value per share and the closing price per share for shares issued as part of the dividend reinvestment plan on the dividend payment date. This net change in unrealized appreciation (depreciation) of investment in New Mountain Finance Holdings, L.L.C. includes the unrealized appreciation (depreciation) from the IPO. We used the proceeds from our IPO and Concurrent Private Placement to purchase units in the Predecessor Operating Company at $13.75 per unit (our IPO price per share). At the IPO date, $13.75 per unit represented a discount to the actual net asset value per unit of the Predecessor Operating Company. As a result, we experienced immediate unrealized appreciation on our investment.\nAll expenses were paid and recorded by the Predecessor Operating Company. Expenses were allocated to us based on pro-rata ownership interest. In addition, the Predecessor Operating Company paid all of the offering costs related to the IPO and subsequent offerings. We recorded our portion of the offering costs as a direct reduction to net assets and the cost of our investment in the Predecessor Operating Company.\nMonitoring of Portfolio Investments\nWe monitor the performance and financial trends of our portfolio companies on at least a quarterly basis. We attempt to identify any developments within the portfolio company, the industry or the macroeconomic environment that may alter any material element of our original investment strategy.\nWe use an investment rating system to characterize and monitor the credit profile and expected level of returns on each investment in the portfolio. We use a four-level numeric rating scale as follows:\n \u2022 Investment Rating 1-Investment is performing materially above expectations; \n \u2022 Investment Rating 2-Investment is performing materially in-line with expectations. All new loans are rated 2 at initial purchase; \n \u2022 Investment Rating 3-Investment is performing materially below expectations and risk has increased materially since the original investment; and \n \u2022 Investment Rating 4-Investment is performing substantially below expectations and risks have increased substantially since the original investment. Payments may be delinquent. There is meaningful possibility that we will not recoup its original cost basis in the investment and may realize a substantial loss upon exit.  The following table shows the distribution of our investments on the 1 to 4 investment rating scale at fair value as of December 31, 2015:\nTable 217: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(in millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>As of December 31, 2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Investment Rating\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Par Value(1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Percent\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Fair Value\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Percent\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Investment Rating 1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>189.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12.6\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>247.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>16.4\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Investment Rating 2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,251.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>83.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,231.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>81.5\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Investment Rating 3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>65.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.3\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>32.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.1\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Investment Rating 4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.1\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,508.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>100.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,512.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>100.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n_______________________________________________________________________________\n (1) Excludes shares and warrants.

( Edmentum\u201d) on non-accrual status due to its ongoing restructuring. As of March 31, 2015, our investment in Edmentum had an aggregate cost basis of $30.8 million, an aggregate fair value of $15.6 million and total unearned interest income of $0.4 million for the three months then ended. In June 2015, Edmentum completed a restructuring which resulted in a material modification of the original terms and an extinguishment of our original investment in Edmentum. Prior to the extinguishment in June 2015, our original investment in Edmentum had an aggregate cost of $31.6 million, an aggregate fair value of $16.4 million and total unearned interest income of $0.8 million for the six months ended June 30, 2015. The extinguishment resulted in a realized loss of $15.2 million. Post restructuring, our investments in Edmentum have been restored to full accrual status. As of December 31, 2015, our investments in Edmentum have an aggregate cost basis of $20.9 million and an aggregate fair value of $22.8 million.\nDuring the first quarter of 2015, our first lien position in Education Management LLC ( EDMC\u201d) was non-income producing as a result of the portfolio company undergoing a restructuring. As of December 31, 2014, our investment in EDMC had an aggregate cost basis of $3.0 million, an aggregate fair value of $1.4 million and no unearned interest income for the three months then ended. In January 2015, EDMC completed a restructuring which resulted in a material modification of the original terms and an extinguishment of our original investment in EDMC. Prior to the extinguishment in January 2015, our original investment in EDMC had an aggregate cost of $3.0 million, an aggregate fair value of $1.4 million and no unearned interest income for the period then ended. The extinguishment resulted in a realized loss of $1.6 million. Post restructuring, our investments in EDMC are income producing. As of December 31, 2015, our investments in EDMC have an aggregate cost basis of $1.4 million and an aggregate fair value of $0.5 million.\nDuring the third quarter of 2014, we placed a portion of our first lien position in UniTek Global Services, Inc. (\"UniTek\") on non-accrual status in anticipation of a voluntary petition for a \"Pre-Packaged\" Chapter 11 Bankruptcy in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware which was filed on November 3, 2014. As of December 31, 2014, our investment in UniTek had an aggregate cost basis of $47.4 million, an aggregate fair value of $35.2 million and total unearned interest income of $1.0 million for the year then ended. In January 2015, UniTek emerged from Pre-Packaged\u201d Chapter 11 Bankruptcy and completed its restructuring. The restructuring resulted in a material modification of the original terms and an extinguishment of our original investments in UniTek. Prior to the extinguishment in January 2015, our original investments in UniTek had an aggregate cost of $52.9 million, an aggregate fair value of $40.1 million and total unearned interest income of $0.1 million for the period then ended.

As of December 31, 2015, our two super priority first lien positions in ATI Acquisition Company and its related preferred shares and warrants in Ancora Acquisition LLC remained on non-accrual status due to the inability of the portfolio company to service its interest payments for the year then ended and uncertainty about its ability to pay such amounts in the future. As of December 31, 2015, our investment had an aggregate cost basis of $1.6 million, an aggregate fair value of $0.4 million and total unearned interest income of $0.1 million for the year then ended. As of December 31, 2014, our total investment in ATI Acquisition Company and Ancora Acquisition LLC had an aggregate cost basis of $1.6 million, an aggregate fair value of $0.4 million and total unearned interest income of $0.3 million for the year then ended.

At December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014, our weighted average Yield to Maturity at Cost was approximately 10.7% and 10.7%, respectively.\nRecent Accounting Standards Updates\nIn June 2014, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2014-11, Transfers and Servicing Topic 860-Repurchase-to-Maturity Transactions, Repurchase Financings, and Disclosures ( ASU 2014-11\u201d). ASU 2014-11 changes the accounting for repurchase- and resale-to-maturity agreements by requiring that such agreements be recognized as financing arrangements, and requires that a transfer of a financial asset and a repurchase agreement entered into contemporaneously be accounted for separately. ASU 2014-11 requires additional disclosures about certain transferred financial assets accounted for as sales and certain securities financing transactions. The accounting changes and additional disclosures about certain transferred financial assets accounted for as sales are effective for the first interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2014. The additional disclosures for securities financing transactions are required for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2014 and for interim reporting periods beginning after March 15, 2015. The adoption of ASU 2014-11 did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements and disclosures.\nIn August 2014, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2014-15, Presentation of Financial Statements-Going Concern Subtopic 205-40-Disclosure of Uncertainties about an Entity's Ability to Continue as a Going Concern ( ASU 2014-15\u201d). ASU 2014-15 will explicitly require management to assess an entity's ability to continue as a going concern, and to provide related footnote disclosure in certain circumstances. The new standard will be effective for all entities in the first annual period ending after December 15, 2016. Earlier adoption is permitted. The adoption of ASU 2014-15 is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements and disclosures.\nIn February 2015, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2015-02, Consolidation Topic 810-Amendments to the Consolidation Analysis ( ASU 2015-02\u201d), which modifies the consolidation analysis in determining if limited partnerships or similar type entities fall under the variable interest model or voting interest model, particularly those that have fee arrangements and related party relationships. ASU 2015-02 will be effective for all public entities for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2015. Earlier adoption is permitted. We are in the process of evaluating the impact that this guidance will have on our consolidated financial statements and disclosures.\nIn April 2015, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2015-03, Interest-Imputation of Interest Subtopic 835-30-Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs ( ASU 2015-03\u201d), which changes the presentation of debt issuance costs in financial statements. Under ASU 2015-03, an entity presents such costs on the statement of assets and liabilities as a direct deduction from the related debt liability rather than as an asset. Amortization of the costs is reported as interest expense. The new standard will be effective for all public entities for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2015. Earlier adoption is permitted. We are in the process of evaluating the impact that this guidance will have on our consolidated financial statements and disclosures.\nIn May 2015, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2015-07, Fair Value Measurement Topic 820-Disclosures for Investments in Certain Entities that Calculate Net Asset Value per Share (or Its Equivalent) ( ASU 2015-07\u201d), which amends the presentation of investments measured at net asset value, as a practical expedient for fair value, from the fair\nvalue hierarchy. Under ASU 2015-07, an entity would remove investments measured using the practical expedient from the fair value hierarchy. ASU 2015-07 will be effective for annual and interim reporting periods after December 15, 2015. We are in the process of evaluating the impact that this guidance will have on our consolidated financial statements and disclosures.\nResults of Operations\nUnder GAAP, our IPO did not step-up the cost basis of the Predecessor Operating Company's existing investments to fair market value at the IPO date. Since the total value of the Predecessor Operating Company's investments at the time of the IPO was greater than the investments' cost basis, a larger amount of amortization of purchase or original issue discount, and different amounts in realized gain and unrealized appreciation, may be recognized under GAAP in each period than if the step-up had occurred. This will remain until such predecessor investments are sold, repaid or mature in the future. We track the transferred (or fair market) value of each of the Predecessor Operating Company's investments as of the time of the IPO and, for purposes of the incentive fee calculation, adjusts income as if each investment was purchased at the date of the IPO (or stepped up to fair market value). The respective \"Adjusted Net Investment Income\" (defined as net investment income adjusted to reflect income as if the cost basis of investments held at the IPO date had stepped-up to fair market value as of the IPO date) is used in calculating both the incentive fee and dividend payments. See Item 8.-Financial Statements and Supplementary Data-Note 5, Agreements for additional details.\nThe following table for the year ended December 31, 2015 is adjusted to reflect the step-up to fair market value and the allocation of the incentive fees related to hypothetical capital gains out of the adjusted post-incentive fee net investment income.\nTable 221: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(in thousands)\n</td> <td>Year Ended\nDecember 31, 2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Stepped-up\nCost Basis\nAdjustments\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Incentive Fee\nAdjustments(1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Adjusted Year Ended\nDecember 31, 2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Investment income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest income\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>140,074\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(131\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>139,943\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Dividend income\n</td> <td>5,771\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5,771\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other income\n</td> <td>8,010\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8,010\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total investment income(2)\n</td> <td>153,855\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(131\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>153,724\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total expenses pre-incentive fee(3)\n</td> <td>50,769\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>50,769\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income\n</td> <td>103,086\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(131\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>102,955\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Incentive fee\n</td> <td>20,591\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>20,591\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Post-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income\n</td> <td>82,495\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(131\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>82,364\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net realized losses on investments(4)\n</td> <td>(12,789\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(78\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(12,867\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net change in unrealized (depreciation) appreciation of investments(4)\n</td> <td>(35,272\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>209\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(35,063\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net change in unrealized (depreciation) appreciation of securities purchased under collateralized agreements to resell\n</td> <td>(296\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(296\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Provision for taxes\n</td> <td>(1,183\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1,183\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Capital gains incentive fees\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net increase in net assets resulting from operations\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>32,955\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>32,955\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n_______________________________________________________________________________\n (1) For the year ended December 31, 2015, we incurred total incentive fees of $20.6 million, of which none was related to the capital gains incentive fee accrual on a hypothetical liquidation basis. \n (2) Includes income from non-controlled/non-affiliated investments, non-controlled/affiliated investments and controlled investments. \n (3) Includes expense waivers and reimbursements of $0.7 million and management fee waivers of $5.2 million. \n (4) Includes net realized gains and losses on investments and net change in unrealized (depreciation) appreciation of investments from non-controlled/non-affiliated investments, non-controlled/affiliated investments and controlled investments.

As of December 31, 2013, approximately $1.1 million of capital gains incentive fees was owed under the Investment Management Agreement by the Predecessor Operating Company, as cumulative net Adjusted Realized Gains exceeded cumulative Adjusted Unrealized Depreciation and was paid during the year ended December 31, 2014.\nOur Results of Operations for the Years Ended December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014 and the Predecessor Operating Company for the Year Ended December 31, 2013\nRevenue\nTable 234: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Years Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(in thousands)\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2013\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest income\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>140,074\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>85,123\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>107,027\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest income allocated from the Predecessor Operating Company\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>40,515\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total interest income\n</td> <td>140,074\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>125,638\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>107,027\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Dividend income\n</td> <td>5,771\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,309\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5,049\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Dividend income allocated from the Predecessor Operating Company\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,368\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total dividend income\n</td> <td>5,771\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,677\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5,049\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other income\n</td> <td>8,010\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,491\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,836\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other income allocated from the Predecessor Operating Company\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>795\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total other income\n</td> <td>8,010\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5,286\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,836\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total investment income\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>153,855\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>135,601\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>114,912\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOur total investment income increased by approximately $18.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to total investment income for the year ended December 31, 2014. The 13% increase in total investment income primarily results from an increase in interest income of approximately $14.4 million from the year ended December 31, 2014 to the year ended December 31, 2015, which is attributable to larger invested balances, driven by the proceeds from the September 2015 primary offering of our common stock, our use of leverage from our revolving credit facilities, SBA-guaranteed debentures and the deployment of the June 2014 proceeds from the issuance of $115.0 million of convertible notes to originate new investments, and prepayment fees received associated with the early repayments or partial repayments of nine different portfolio companies held as of December 31, 2014. The increase in dividend income of approximately $1.1 million during the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2014 was primarily attributable to distributions from our investment in SLP I and PIK dividends income from an equity position. The increase in other income, which represents fees that are generally non-recurring in nature, of approximately $2.7 million during the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2014 was primarily attributable to structuring, upfront, amendment and consent fees received from 22 different portfolio companies, commitment fees received from three bridge facilities and management fees from a non-controlled/affiliated portfolio company.\nOur total investment income increased by approximately $20.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 as compared to the Predecessor Operating Company's total investment income for the year ended December 31, 2013. The 18% increase in total investment income primarily results from an increase in interest income of approximately $18.6 million from the year ended December 31, 2013 to the year ended December 31, 2014, which is attributable to larger invested balances, driven by the proceeds from the October 2013, April 2014 and October 2014 primary offerings of our common stock and the June 2014 offering of our convertible notes, our use of leverage from our revolving credit facilities to originate new investments, and prepayment fees received associated with the early repayments or partial repayments of ten different portfolio companies held by the Predecessor Operating Company as of December 31, 2013. The increase in other income of approximately $2.5 million during the year ended December 31, 2014 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2013, which represents fees that are generally non-recurring in nature, was primarily attributable to structuring, amendment and consent fees received from 20 different portfolio companies and management fees from a non-controlled affiliated portfolio company. The decrease in dividend income during the year ended December 31, 2014 as compared to the year ended\nDecember 31, 2013 was primarily attributable to a large distribution from one of the Predecessor Operating Company's warrant investments in the prior year.\nOperating Expenses\nTable 235: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td>

gains incentive fee accrual assumes a hypothetical liquidation basis.  Our total net operating expenses increased by approximately $15.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2014. Our management fee increased by approximately $1.7 million, net of a management fee waiver, and incentive fees increased by approximately $2.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2014. The increase in management fee and incentive fee from the year ended December 31, 2014 to the year ended December 31, 2015 was attributable to larger invested balances, driven by the proceeds from the September 2015 primary offering of our common stock, our use of leverage from our revolving credit facilities, SBA-guaranteed debentures and the deployment of the June 2014 Proceeds from the issuance of $115.0 million of convertible notes to originate new investments. No capital gains incentive fee was accrued for the year ended December 31, 2015.\nInterest and other financing expenses increased by approximately $5.3 million during the year ended December 31, 2015, primarily due to our issuance of $115.0 million of convertible notes, the closing of the NMFC Credit Facility (as defined below) during the second quarter of 2014 and the drawing on SBA-guaranteed debentures beginning in the fourth quarter of\n2014. Our total professional fees, total administrative expenses and total other general and administrative expenses marginally decreased by approximately $0.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2014. Our expenses waived and reimbursed decreased by approximately $0.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2014 due to the expiration of the expense cap on March 31, 2014.\nOur total net operating expenses increased by approximately $4.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 as compared to the Predecessor Operating Company's year ended December 31, 2013. Our management fee increased by approximately $4.0 million, net of a management fee waiver, and incentive fees increased by approximately $1.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 as compared to the Predecessor Operating Company's year ended December 31, 2013. The increase in management fee and incentive fee from the Predecessor Operating Company's year ended December 31, 2013 to our year ended December 31, 2014 was attributable to larger invested balances, driven by the proceeds from the October 2013, April 2014 and October 2014 primary offerings of our common stock, the June 2014 offering of our convertible notes and our use of leverage from our revolving credit facilities to originate new investments. Our capital gains incentive fee accrual decreased by approximately $9.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 as compared to the Predecessor Operating Company's year ended December 31, 2013, which was attributable to lower net Adjusted Realized Capital Gains (Losses) and net Adjusted Unrealized Capital Depreciation of investments during the period due to lower marks on the broader portfolio. As of December 31, 2014, no actual capital gains incentive fee was owed under the Investment Management Agreement, as cumulative net Adjusted Realized Gains did not exceed cumulative Adjusted Unrealized Depreciation.\nInterest and other financing expenses increased by approximately $5.6 million during the year ended December 31, 2014, primarily due to the increase of average debt outstanding from $184.1 million to $244.6 million for the Holdings Credit Facility (as defined below) for the year ended December 31, 2013 compared to December 31, 2014. In addition, during the year ended December 31, 2014, we issued $115.0 million of convertible notes, closed the NMFC Credit Facility (as defined below) and began to draw on SBA-guaranteed debentures. Our total professional fees, total administrative expenses and total other general and administrative expenses marginally increased by approximately $0.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 as compared to the Predecessor Operating Company's year ended December 31, 2013. During the year ended December 31, 2014, we incurred $10.9 thousand in other expenses that were not subject to the expense cap pursuant to the administration agreement, as amended and restated (the \"Administration Agreement\"), with the Administrator, and further restricted by us. For the year ended December 31, 2014, approximately $1.4 million of indirect administrative expenses were included in administrative expenses, of which $0.8 million were waived by the Administrator. Our expenses waived and reimbursed decreased by approximately $2.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 as compared to the Predecessor Operating Company's year ended December 31, 2013 due to the expiration of the expense cap on March 31, 2014 and the decrease of waived indirect administrative expenses by the Administrator during the year ended December 31, 2014.\nNet Realized Gains (Losses) and Net Change in Unrealized Appreciation (Depreciation)\nTable 237: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Years Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(in thousands)\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2013\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net realized (losses) gains on investments\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(12,789\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>357\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>7,253\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net realized gains on investments allocated from Predecessor Operating Company\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8,568\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total realized (losses) gains on investments\n</td> <td>(12,789\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8,925\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7,253\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net change in unrealized (depreciation) appreciation of investments\n</td> <td>(35,272\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(43,863\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7,994\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net change in unrealized appreciation (depreciation) of investments allocated from Predecessor Operating Company\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>940\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total change in unrealized (depreciation) appreciation of investments\n</td> <td>(35,272\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(42,923\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7,994\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net change in unrealized (depreciation) appreciation of securities purchased under collateralized agreements to resell\n</td> <td>(296\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Provision for taxes\n</td> <td>(1,183\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(493\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total net realized gains and net change in unrealized (depreciation) appreciation of investments\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(49,540\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(34,491\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>15,247\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOur net realized and unrealized losses resulted in a net loss of approximately $49.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the net realized gain and unrealized losses resulting in a net loss of approximately $34.5 million for the same period in 2014. We look at net realized and unrealized gains or losses together as movement in unrealized appreciation or depreciation can be the result of realizations. The net loss for the year ended December 31, 2015 was primarily driven by the overall decrease in the market prices of our investments during the period and $29.7 million of realized losses on investments resulting from the modification of terms on three portfolio companies that were accounted for as extinguishments.\nThese losses were partially offset by sales or repayments of investments with fair values in excess of December 31, 2014 valuations, resulting in net realized gains being greater than the reversal of the cumulative net unrealized gains for those investments which included the sale of two portfolio companies resulting in realized gains of approximately $14.2 million. The provision for income taxes was primarily attributable to three equity investments that are held as of December 31, 2015 in three of our corporate subsidiaries.\nThe net realized and unrealized losses resulted in a net loss of approximately $34.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to the Predecessor Operating Company's net realized and unrealized gains resulting in a net gain of approximately $15.2 million for the same period in 2013. We look at net realized and unrealized gains or losses together as movement in unrealized appreciation or depreciation can be the result of realizations. The net loss for the year ended December 31, 2014 was primarily driven by the overall decrease in the market prices of our investments during the period and the partial write-down related to two portfolio companies. These losses were partially offset by a $5.6 million gain from the sale of NMF Holdings' warrant investments in one portfolio company and sales or repayments of investments with fair values in excess of December 31, 2013 valuations resulting in net realized gains being greater than the reversal of the cumulative net unrealized gains for those investments. The provision for income taxes was attributable to one warrant investment that is held as of December 31, 2014 in one of our corporate subsidiaries.\nThe net gain for the year ended December 31, 2013 was primarily driven by sales or repayment of investments with fair values in excess of December 31, 2012 valuations, resulting in net realized gains being greater than the reversal of the cumulative net unrealized gains for those investments. Additionally, during the year ended December 31, 2013, a distribution from a warrant investment resulted in a realized gain of approximately $1.1 million, the modification of terms on one debt investment that was accounted for as an extinguishment resulted in a realized gain of $1.7 million and the sale of the first lien position in ATI Acquisition Company resulted in a realized loss of $4.3 million.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nThe primary use of existing funds and any funds raised in the future is expected to be for repayment of indebtedness, investments in portfolio companies, cash distributions to our stockholders or for other general corporate purposes.\nSince our IPO, and through December 31, 2015, we raised approximately $454.0 million in net proceeds from additional offerings of common stock and issued shares of common stock valued at approximately $288.4 million on behalf of AIV Holdings for exchanged units. We acquired from the Predecessor Operating Company units of the Predecessor Operating Company equal to the number of shares of our common stock sold in the additional offerings.\nOn September 25, 2015, we completed a public offering of 5,750,000 shares of common stock (including 750,000 shares of common stock that were issued pursuant to the full exercise of the option granted to the underwriters to purchase additional shares) at a public offering price of $14.14 per share, which resulted in net proceeds of $79.4 million. Steven B. Klinsky, the Chairman of our board of directors, purchased 500,000 shares in this offering at the public offering price.\nOur liquidity is generated and generally available through advances from the revolving credit facilities, from cash flows from operations, and, we expect, through periodic follow-on equity offerings. In addition, we may from time to time enter into additional debt facilities, increase the size of existing facilities or issue additional debt securities, including unsecured debt and/or debt securities convertible into common stock. Any such incurrence or issuance would be subject to prevailing market conditions, our liquidity requirements, contractual and regulatory restrictions and other factors. In accordance with the 1940 Act, with certain limited exceptions, we are only allowed to borrow amounts such that our asset coverage, calculated pursuant to the 1940 Act, is at least 200.0% after such borrowing.\nAt December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014, we had cash and cash equivalents of approximately $30.1 million and $23.4 million, respectively, and at December 31, 2013, the Predecessor Operating Company had cash and cash equivalents of approximately $15.0 million. Our cash used in operating activities during the years ended December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014, was approximately $(63.3) million and $(289.6) million, respectively, and cash used in operating activities for the Predecessor Operating Company for the year ended December 31, 2013 was approximately $(40.4) million. Refer to the Predecessor Operating Company's Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows for the period January 1, 2014 to May 7, 2014 included in an exhibit attached hereto. We expect that all current liquidity needs will be met with cash flows from operations and other activities.\nBorrowings\nHoldings Credit Facility-On December 18, 2014 we entered into the Second Amended and Restated Loan and Security Agreement (the \"Holdings Credit Facility\"), among us, as the Collateral Manager, NMF Holdings as the Borrower, Wells Fargo Securities, LLC as the Administrative Agent and Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as the Lender and Collateral Custodian, which is structured as a revolving credit facility and matures on December 18, 2019.\nImmediately prior to amending the Holdings Credit Facility, NMF SLF merged with and into NMF Holdings. The Holdings Credit Facility effectively amended and restated the Predecessor Holdings Credit Facility (as defined below), merged with the SLF Credit Facility (as defined below), and combined the amount of borrowings previously available.\nThe maximum amount of revolving borrowings available under the Holdings Credit Facility is $495.0 million, which is the aggregate of the $280.0 million previously available under the Predecessor Holdings Credit Facility (as defined below) and the $215.0 million previously available under the SLF Credit Facility (as defined below). Under the Holdings Credit Facility, NMF Holdings is permitted to borrow up to 25.0%, 45.0% or 70.0% of the purchase price of pledged assets, subject to approval by Wells Fargo Securities, LLC. The Holdings Credit Facility is non-recourse to us and is collateralized by all of the investments of NMF Holdings on an investment by investment basis. All fees associated with the origination or upsizing of the Holdings Credit Facility are capitalized on our Consolidated Statement of Assets and Liabilities and charged against income as other financing expenses over the life of the Holdings Credit Facility. The Holdings Credit Facility contains certain customary affirmative and negative covenants and events of default. In addition, the Holdings Credit Facility requires us to maintain a minimum asset coverage ratio. The covenants are generally not tied to mark to market fluctuations in the prices of NMF Holdings investments, but rather to the performance of the underlying portfolio companies.\nThe Holdings Credit Facility bears interest at a rate of the LIBOR plus 2.00% per annum for Broadly Syndicated Loans (as defined in the Loan and Security Agreement) and LIBOR plus 2.75% per annum for all other investments. The Holdings Credit Facility also charges a non-usage fee, based on the unused facility amount multiplied by the Non-Usage Fee Rate (as defined in the Loan and Security Agreement).\nPrior to December 18, 2014, the Loan and Security Agreement, as amended and restated, dated May 19, 2011 (the \"Predecessor Holdings Credit Facility\") among NMF Holdings as the Borrower and Collateral Administrator, Wells Fargo Securities, LLC as the Administrative Agent, and Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as the Collateral Custodian, was structured as a revolving credit facility and would mature on October 27, 2016.\nThe maximum amount of revolving borrowings available under the Predecessor Holdings Credit Facility was $280.0 million. Until December 18, 2014, NMF Holdings was permitted to borrow up to 45.0% or 25.0% of the purchase price of pledged first lien or non-first lien debt securities, and up to 70.0% and 45.0% of the purchase price of specified first lien debt securities and specified non-first lien debt securities, respectively, subject to approval by Wells Fargo Bank, National Association. The Predecessor Holdings Credit Facility was amended and restated on May 6, 2014 and as a result, it was non-recourse to us and was collateralized by all of the investments of NMF Holdings on an investment by investment basis. All fees associated with the origination or upsizing of the Predecessor Holdings Credit Facility were capitalized on our Consolidated Statement of Assets and Liabilities and charged against income as other financing expenses over the life of the Predecessor Holdings Credit Facility. The Predecessor Holdings Credit Facility contained certain customary affirmative and negative covenants and events of default, including the occurrence of a change in control. In addition, the Predecessor Holdings Credit Facility required us to maintain a minimum asset coverage ratio. However, the covenants were generally not tied to mark to market fluctuations in the prices of NMF Holdings' investments, but rather to the performance of the underlying portfolio companies.\nThe Predecessor Holdings Credit Facility bore interest at a rate of the LIBOR plus 2.75% per annum and charged a non-usage fee, based on the unused facility amount multiplied by the Non-Usage Fee Rate (as defined in the Loan and Security Agreement).\nThe following table summarizes the interest expense, non-usage fees and amortization of financing costs incurred, together, on the Holdings Credit Facility and the Predecessor Holdings Credit Facility for the years ended December 31, 2015, December 31, 2014 and December 31, 2013.\nTable 238: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Years Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(in millions)\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2013\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest expense\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>10.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>7.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>5.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Non-usage fee\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>0.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>0.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>0.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Amortization of financing costs\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>0.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>0.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Weighted average interest rate\n</td> <td>2.6\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.9\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.9\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Effective interest rate\n</td> <td>3.2\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.4\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.6\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Average debt outstanding\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>394.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>244.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>184.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nAs of December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014, the outstanding balance on the Holdings Credit Facility was $419.3 million and $468.1 million, respectively, and as of December 31, 2013, the outstanding balance on the Predecessor Holdings Credit Facility was $221.8 million, and NMF Holdings was in compliance with the applicable covenants in the Holdings Credit Facility and Predecessor Holdings Credit Facility on such dates.\nSLF Credit Facility-NMF SLF's Loan and Security Agreement, as amended and restated, dated October 27, 2010 (the \"SLF Credit Facility\") among NMF SLF as the Borrower, NMF Holdings as the Collateral Administrator, Wells Fargo Securities, LLC as the Administrative Agent, and Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as the Collateral Custodian, was structured as a revolving credit facility and was set to mature on October 27, 2016. The maximum amount of revolving borrowings available under the SLF Credit Facility was $215.0 million. The SLF Credit Facility was non-recourse to us and secured by all assets of NMF SLF on an investment by investment basis. All fees associated with the origination or upsizing of the SLF Credit Facility were capitalized on our Consolidated Statement of Assets and Liabilities and charged against income as other financing expenses over the life of the SLF Credit Facility. The SLF Credit Facility contained certain customary affirmative and negative covenants and events of default, including the occurrence of a change in control. The covenants were generally not tied to mark to market fluctuations in the prices of the NMF SLF's investments, but rather to the performance of the underlying portfolio companies. NMF SLF was not restricted from the purchase or sale of loans with an affiliate. Therefore, specified first lien loans could be moved as collateral between the Holdings Credit Facility and the SLF Credit Facility. The SLF Credit Facility merged with the Holdings Credit Facility on December 18, 2014.\nUntil December 18, 2014, the SLF Credit Facility permitted borrowings of up to 70.0% of the purchase price of pledged first lien debt securities and up to 25.0% of the purchase price of specified second lien loans, of which, up to 25.0% of the aggregate outstanding loan balance of all pledged debt securities in the SLF Credit Facility was allowed to be derived from second lien loans, subject to approval by Wells Fargo Bank, National Association.\nThe SLF Credit Facility bore interest at a rate of LIBOR plus 2.00% per annum for first lien loans and LIBOR plus 2.75% per annum for second lien loans, respectively, as amended on March 11, 2013. A non-usage fee was paid, based on the unused facility amount multiplied by the Non-Usage Fee Rate (as defined in the Loan and Security Agreement).\nThe following table summarizes the interest expense, non-usage fees and amortization of financing costs incurred on the SLF Credit Facility for the years ended December 31, 2015, December 31, 2014 and December 31, 2013.\nTable 239: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Years Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(in millions)\n</td> <td>2015(1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014(2)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2013\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest expense\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>4.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>4.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Non-usage fee\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(3)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(3)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Amortization of financing costs\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>0.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>0.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Weighted average interest rate\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.2\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.3\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Effective interest rate\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.6\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.7\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Average debt outstanding\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>209.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>214.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n_______________________________________________________________________________\n (1) Not applicable, as the SLF Credit Facility merged into the Holdings Credit Facility on December 18, 2014. \n (2) For the year ended December 31, 2014, amounts reported relate to the period from January 1, 2014 to December 17, 2014 (date of merger). \n (3) For the years ended December 31, 2014 and December 31, 2013, the total non-usage fee was less than $50 thousand.

The outstanding balance as of December 31, 2013 was $214.7 million and NMF SLF was in compliance with the applicable covenants in the SLF Credit Facility on such date.\nNMFC Credit Facility-The Senior Secured Revolving Credit Agreement, as amended, dated June 4, 2014 (together with the related guarantee and security agreement, the \"NMFC Credit Facility\"), among us as the Borrower, Goldman Sachs Bank USA as the Administrative Agent and Collateral Agent, and Goldman Sachs Bank USA, Morgan Stanley Bank, N.A. and Stifel Bank & Trust as Lenders, is structured as a senior secured revolving credit facility and matures on June 4, 2019. The NMFC Credit Facility is guaranteed by certain of our domestic subsidiaries and proceeds from the NMFC Credit Facility may be used for general corporate purposes, including the funding of portfolio investments.\nThe maximum amount of revolving borrowings available under the NMFC Credit Facility is $95.0 million, as amended on June 26, 2015. We are permitted to borrow at various advance rates depending on the type of portfolio investment as outlined in the Senior Secured Revolving Credit Agreement. All fees associated with the origination of the NMFC Credit Facility are capitalized on our Consolidated Statement of Assets and Liabilities and charged against income as other financing expenses over the life of the NMFC Credit Facility. The NMFC Credit Facility contains certain customary affirmative and negative covenants and events of default, including certain financial covenants related to asset coverage and liquidity and other maintenance covenants.\nThe NMFC Credit Facility generally bears interest at a rate of LIBOR plus 2.50% per annum or the prime rate plus 1.50% per annum, and charges a commitment fee, based on the unused facility amount multiplied by 0.375% per annum (as defined in the Senior Secured Revolving Credit Agreement).\nThe following table summarizes the interest expense, non-usage fees and amortization of financing costs incurred on the NMFC Credit Facility for the years ended December 31, 2015, December 31, 2014 and December 31, 2013.\nTable 243: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Years Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(in millions)\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014(1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2013(2)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest expense\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>0.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Non-usage fee\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>0.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>0.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Amortization of financing costs\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>0.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>0.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Weighted average interest rate\n</td> <td>2.7\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.7\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Effective interest rate\n</td> <td>3.5\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.4\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Average debt outstanding\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>60.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>11.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n_______________________________________________________________________________\n (1) For the year ended December 31, 2014, amounts reported relate to the period from June 4, 2014 (commencement of the NMFC Credit Facility) to December 31, 2014. \n (2) Not applicable, as the NMFC Credit Facility commenced on June 4, 2014.

The Convertible Notes were issued in a private placement only to qualified institutional buyers pursuant to Rule 144A under the Securities Act of 1933. As of the first anniversary, June 3, 2015, of the Convertible Notes, the restrictions under Rule 144A under the Securities Act of 1933 were removed, allowing the Convertible Notes to be eligible and freely tradeable without restrictions for resale pursuant to Rule 144(b)(1) under the Securities Act of 1933. The Convertible Notes bear interest at an annual rate of 5.0%, payable semi-annually in arrears on June 15 and December 15 of each year, which commenced on December 15, 2014. The Convertible Notes will mature on June 15, 2019 unless earlier converted or repurchased at the holder's option.\nThe following table summarizes certain key terms related to the convertible features of our Convertible Notes as of December 31, 2015.\nTable 246: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>December 31, 2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Initial conversion premium\n</td> <td>12.5\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Initial conversion rate(1)\n</td> <td>62.7746\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Initial conversion price\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>15.93\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Conversion premium at December 31, 2015\n</td> <td>11.7\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Conversion rate at December 31, 2015(1)(2)\n</td> <td>63.2794\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Conversion price at December 31, 2015(2)(3)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>15.80\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Last conversion price calculation date\n</td> <td>June 3, 2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n_______________________________________________________________________________\n (1) Conversion rates denominated in shares of common stock per $1.0 thousand principal amount of the Convertible Notes converted. \n (2) Represents conversion rate and conversion price, as applicable, taking into account certain de minimis adjustments that will be made on the conversion date. \n (3) The conversion price in effect at December 31, 2015 was calculated on the last anniversary of the issuance and will be adjusted again on the next anniversary, unless the exercise price shall have changed by more than 1.0% before the anniversary.  The conversion rate will be subject to adjustment upon certain events, such as stock splits and combinations, mergers, spin-offs, increases in dividends in excess of $0.34 per share per quarter and certain changes in control. Certain of these adjustments, including adjustments for increases in dividends, are subject to a conversion price floor of $14.16 per share. In no event will the total number of shares of common stock issuable upon conversion exceed 70.6214 per $1.0 thousand principal amount of the Convertible Notes. We have determined that the embedded conversion option in the Convertible Notes is not required to be separately accounted for as a derivative under GAAP.\nThe Convertible Notes are senior unsecured obligations and rank senior in right of payment to our existing and future indebtedness that is expressly subordinated in right of payment to the Convertible Notes; equal in right of payment to our existing and future unsecured indebtedness that is not so subordinated; effectively junior in right of payment to any of our secured indebtedness (including existing unsecured indebtedness that we later secure) to the extent of the value of the assets securing such indebtedness; and structurally junior to all existing and future indebtedness (including trade payables) incurred by our subsidiaries and financing vehicles. As reflected in Item 8.-Financial Statements and Supplementary Data-Note 12, Earnings Per Share, the issuance is considered part of the if-converted method for calculation of diluted earnings per share.\nWe may not redeem the Convertible Notes prior to maturity. No sinking fund is provided for the Convertible Notes. In addition, if certain corporate events, holders of the Convertible Notes may require us to repurchase for cash all or part of their Convertible Notes at a repurchase price equal to 100.0% of the principal amount of the Convertible Notes to be repurchased, plus accrued and unpaid interest through, but excluding, the repurchase date.\nThe Indenture contains certain covenants, including covenants requiring us to provide financial information to the holders of the Convertible Note and the Trustee if we cease to be subject to the reporting requirements of the Exchange Act. These covenants are subject to limitations and exceptions that are described in the Indenture.\nThe following table summarizes the interest expense and amortization of financing costs incurred on the Convertible Notes for the years ended December 31, 2015, December 31, 2014 and December 31, 2013.\nTable 250: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Years Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(in millions)\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014(1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2013(2)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest expense\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>5.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Amortization of financing costs\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>0.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>0.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Effective interest rate\n</td> <td>5.6\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5.6\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n_______________________________________________________________________________\n (1) For the year ended December 31, 2014, amounts reported relate to the period from June 3, 2014 (commencement of the Convertible Notes) to December 31, 2014. \n (2) Not applicable, as the Convertible Notes commenced on June 3, 2014.

SBA-guaranteed debentures are non-recourse to us, interest only debentures with interest payable semi-annually and have a ten year maturity. The principal amount of SBA-guaranteed debentures is not required to be paid prior to maturity but may be prepaid at any time without penalty. The interest rate of SBA-guaranteed debentures is fixed on a semi-annual basis at a market-driven spread over U.S. Treasury Notes with ten year maturities. The SBA, as a creditor, will have a superior claim to the assets of SBIC LP over our stockholders in the event SBIC LP is liquidated or the SBA exercises remedies upon an event of default.\nThe maximum amount of borrowings available under current SBA regulations is $150.0 million as long as the licensee has at least $75.0 million in regulatory capital, receives a capital commitment from the SBA and has been through an examination by the SBA subsequent to licensing.\nAs of December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014, SBIC LP had regulatory capital of approximately $72.4 million and $42.2 million, respectively, and SBA-guaranteed debentures outstanding of $117.7 million and $37.5 million, respectively. The SBA-guaranteed debentures incur upfront fees of 3.425%, which consists of a 1.00% commitment fee and a 2.425% issuance discount, which are amortized over the life of the SBA-guaranteed debentures.

The initial SBA-guaranteed debenture borrowing occurred on November 17, 2014. \n (2) Not applicable, as the SBIC LP received an SBIC license from the SBA on August 1, 2014. \n (3) For the year ended December 31, 2014, the total interest expense and amortization of financing costs were less than $50 thousand.  The SBIC program is designed to stimulate the flow of private investor capital into eligible small businesses, as defined by the SBA. Under SBA regulations, SBIC LP is subject to regulatory requirements, including making investments in SBA-eligible businesses, investing at least 25.0% of its investment capital in eligible smaller businesses, as defined under the 1958 Act, placing certain limitations on the financing terms of investments, regulating the types of financing, prohibiting investments in small businesses with certain characteristics or in certain industries and requiring capitalization thresholds that limit distributions to us. SBIC LP is subject to an annual periodic examination by an SBA examiner to determine SBIC LP's compliance with the relevant SBA regulations and an annual financial audit of its financial statements that are prepared on a basis of accounting other than GAAP (such as ASC 820) by an independent auditor. As of December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014, SBIC LP was in compliance with SBA regulatory requirements.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe may become a party to financial instruments with off-balance sheet risk in the normal course of business to meet the financial needs of our portfolio companies. These instruments may include commitments to extend credit and involve, to varying degrees, elements of liquidity and credit risk in excess of the amount recognized in the balance sheet. As of December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014, we had outstanding commitments to third parties to fund investments totaling $26.3 million and $27.4 million respectively, under various undrawn revolving credit facilities, delayed draw commitments or other future funding commitments.\nWe may from time to time enter into financing commitment letters or bridge financing commitments, which could require funding in the future. As of December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014, we did not enter into any commitment letters to purchase debt investments. As of December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014, we had not entered into any bridge financing commitments which could require funding in the future.\nContractual Obligations\nA summary of our significant contractual payment obligations as of December 31, 2015 is as follows:\nTable 259: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Contractual Obligations Payments Due by Period\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(in millions)\n</td> <td>Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Less than\n1 Year\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1 - 3 Years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3 - 5 Years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>More than\n5 Years\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Holdings Credit Facility(1)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>419.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>419.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>SBA-guaranteed debentures(2)\n</td> <td>117.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>117.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Convertible Notes(3)\n</td> <td>115.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>115.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>NMFC Credit Facility(4)\n</td> <td>90.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>90.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total Contractual Obligations\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>742.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>624.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>117.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n_______________________________________________________________________________\n (1) Under the terms of the $495.0 million Holdings Credit Facility, all outstanding borrowings under that facility ($419.3 million as of December 31, 2015) must be repaid on or before December 18, 2019. As of December 31, 2015, there was approximately $75.7 million of possible capacity remaining under the Holdings Credit Facility. \n (2) Our SBA-guaranteed debentures will begin to mature on March 1, 2025. \n (3) The $115.0 million Convertible Notes will mature on June 15, 2019 unless earlier converted or repurchased at the holder's option. \n (4) Under the terms of the $95.0 million NMFC Credit Facility, all outstanding borrowings under that facility ($90.0 million as of December 31, 2015) must be repaid on or before June 4, 2019. As of December 31, 2015, there was approximately $5.0 million of possible capacity remaining under the NMFC Credit Facility.  We have certain contracts under which we have material future commitments. We have $26.3 million of undrawn funding commitments as of December 31, 2015 related to our participation as a lender in revolving credit facilities, delayed draw commitments or other future funding commitments of our portfolio companies. As of December 31, 2015, we had not entered into any bridge financing commitments or commitment letters which could require funding in the future.\nWe have entered into the Investment Management Agreement with the Investment Adviser in accordance with the 1940 Act. Under the Investment Management Agreement, the Investment Adviser has agreed to provide us with investment advisory and management services. We have agreed to pay for these services (1) a management fee and (2) an incentive fee based on our performance.\nWe have also entered into an Administration Agreement with the Administrator. Under the Administration Agreement, the Administrator has agreed to arrange office space for us and provide office equipment and clerical, bookkeeping and record keeping services and other administrative services necessary to conduct our respective day-to-day operations. The Administrator has also agreed to perform, or oversee the performance of, our financial records, our reports to stockholders and reports filed with the SEC.\nIf any of the contractual obligations discussed above are terminated, our costs under any new agreements that are entered into may increase. In addition, we would likely incur significant time and expense in locating alternative parties to provide the services we expect to receive under the Investment Management Agreement and the Administration Agreement.\nDistributions and Dividends\nDistributions declared and paid to stockholders for the year ended December 31, 2015 totaled $81.0 million.\nThe following table reflects cash distributions, including dividends and returns of capital, if any, per share that have been declared by our board of directors for the years ended December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014:\nTable 264: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Fiscal Year Ended\n</td> <td>Date Declared\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Record Date\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Payment Date\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Per Share Amount\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>December 31, 2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Fourth Quarter\n</td> <td>November 3, 2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>December 16, 2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>December 30, 2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>0.34\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Third Quarter\n</td> <td>August 4, 2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>September 16, 2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>September 30, 2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.34\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Second Quarter\n</td> <td>May 5, 2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>June 16, 2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>June 30, 2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.34\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>First Quarter\n</td> <td>February 23, 2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>March 17, 2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>March 31, 2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.34\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1.36\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>December 31, 2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Fourth Quarter\n</td> <td>November 4, 2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>December 16, 2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>December 30, 2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>0.34\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Third Quarter\n</td> <td>August 5, 2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>September 16, 2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>September 30, 2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.34\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Third Quarter\n</td> <td>July 30, 2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>August 20, 2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>September 3, 2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.12\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Second Quarter\n</td> <td>May 6, 2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>June 16, 2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>June 30, 2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.34\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>First Quarter\n</td> <td>March 4, 2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>March 17, 2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>March 31, 2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.34\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1.48\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n_______________________________________________________________________________\n (1) Special dividend related to estimated realized capital gains attributable to the Predecessor Operating Company's warrant investments in Learning Care Group (US), Inc.  Tax characteristics of all dividends paid are reported to stockholders on Form 1099 after the end of the calendar year. Future quarterly dividends, if any, will be determined by our board of directors.\nWe intend to pay quarterly distributions to our stockholders in amounts sufficient to maintain our status as a RIC. We intend to distribute approximately all of our Adjusted Net Investment Income on a quarterly basis and substantially all of our taxable income on an annual basis, except that we may retain certain net capital gains for reinvestment.\nWe maintain an \"opt out\" dividend reinvestment plan on behalf of our common stockholders, pursuant to which each of our stockholders' cash distributions will be automatically reinvested in additional shares of common stock, unless the stockholder elects to receive cash. See Item 8 - Financial Statements and Supplementary Data-Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies for additional details regarding our dividend reinvestment plan.\nRelated Parties\nWe have entered into a number of business relationships with affiliated or related parties, including the following:\n \u2022 We have entered into the Investment Management Agreement with the Investment Adviser, a wholly-owned subsidiary of New Mountain Capital. Therefore, New Mountain Capital is entitled to any profits earned by the Investment Adviser, which includes any fees payable to the Investment Adviser under the terms of the Investment Management Agreement, less expenses incurred by the Investment Adviser in performing its services under the Investment Management Agreement. \n \u2022 We have entered into an Administration Agreement with the Administrator, a wholly-owned subsidiary of New Mountain Capital. The Administrator arranges our office space and provides office equipment and administrative services necessary to conduct our respective day-to-day operations pursuant to the Administration Agreement. We reimburse the Administrator for the allocable portion of overhead and other expenses incurred by it in performing its obligations to us under the Administration Agreement, which includes the fees and expenses associated with performing administrative, finance, and compliance functions, and the compensation of our chief financial officer and chief compliance officer and their respective staffs. Pursuant to the Administration Agreement and further restricted by us, expenses payable to the Administrator as well as other direct and indirect expenses (excluding \ninterest, other financing expense, trading expenses and management and incentive fees) had been capped at $3.5 million for the time period from April 1, 2012 to March 31, 2013 and capped at $4.25 million for the time period from April 1, 2013 to March 31, 2014. The expense cap expired on March 31, 2014. Thereafter, the Administrator may, in its own discretion, submit to us for reimbursement some or all of the expenses that the Administrator has incurred on our behalf during any quarterly period. As a result, the amount of expenses for which we will have to reimburse the Administrator may fluctuate in future quarterly periods and there can be no assurance given as to when, or if, the Administrator may determine to limit the expenses that the Administrator submits to us for reimbursement in the future. However, it is expected that the Administrator will continue to support part of our expense burden in the near future and may decide to not calculate and charge through certain overhead related amounts as well as continue to cover some of the indirect costs. The Administrator cannot recoup any expenses that the Administrator has previously waived. For the year ended December 31, 2015, approximately $1.4 million of indirect administrative expenses were included in administrative expenses, of which $0.7 million were waived by the Administrator. As of December 31, 2015, approximately $0.4 million were payable to the Administrator.\n \u2022 We, the Investment Adviser and the Administrator have entered into a royalty-free Trademark License Agreement, as amended, with New Mountain Capital, pursuant to which New Mountain Capital has agreed to grant us, the Investment Adviser and the Administrator, a non-exclusive, royalty-free license to use the name \"New Mountain\" and \"New Mountain Finance\".  In addition, we have adopted a formal code of ethics that governs the conduct of our respective officers and directors. These officers and directors also remain subject to the duties imposed by the 1940 Act, the Delaware General Corporation Law and the Delaware Limited Liability Company Act.\nThe Investment Adviser and its affiliates may also manage other funds in the future that may have investment mandates that are similar, in whole and in part, with our investment mandates. The Investment Adviser and its affiliates may determine that an investment is appropriate for us and for one or more of those other funds. In such event, depending on the availability of such investment and other appropriate factors, the Investment Adviser or its affiliates may determine that we should invest side-by-side with one or more other funds. Any such investments will be made only to the extent permitted by applicable law and interpretive positions of the SEC and its staff, and consistent with the Investment Adviser's allocation procedures.\nConcurrently with the IPO, we sold an additional 2,172,000 shares of our common stock to certain executives and employees of, and other individuals affiliated with, New Mountain Capital in the Concurrent Private Placement.", "item_7_text": "Item 7.

We are a closed-end, non-diversified management investment company that has elected to be regulated as a business development company (\"BDC\") under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the \"1940 Act\"). As such, we are obligated to comply with certain regulatory requirements. We have elected to be treated, and intend to comply with the requirements to continue to qualify annually, as a regulated investment company (\"RIC\") under Subchapter M of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, (the \"Code\"). NMFC is also registered as an investment adviser under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, as amended (the \"Advisers Act\").\nOn May 19, 2011, we priced our initial public offering (the \"IPO\") of 7,272,727 shares of common stock at a public offering price of $13.75 per share. Concurrently with the closing of the IPO and at the public offering price of $13.75 per share, we sold an additional 2,172,000 shares of our common stock to certain executives and employees of, and other individuals affiliated with, New Mountain Capital (defined as New Mountain Capital Group, L.L.C. and its affiliates) in a concurrent private placement (the \"Concurrent Private Placement\"). Additionally, 1,252,964 shares were issued to the partners of New Mountain Guardian Partners, L.P. at that time for their ownership interest in the Predecessor Entities (as defined below). In connection with our IPO and through a series of transactions, New Mountain Finance Holdings, L.L.C. (\"NMF Holdings\" or the \"Predecessor Operating Company\") acquired all of the operations of the Predecessor Entities, including all of the assets and liabilities related to such operations.\nNew Mountain Finance Holdings, L.L.C.\nNMF Holdings is a Delaware limited liability company. Until May 8, 2014, NMF Holdings was externally managed and was regulated as a BDC under the 1940 Act. As such, NMF Holdings was obligated to comply with certain regulatory requirements. NMF Holdings was treated as a partnership for United States (\"U.S.\") federal income tax purposes for so long as it had at least two members. With the completion of the underwritten secondary offering on February 3, 2014, NMF Holdings' existence as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes terminated and NMF Holdings became an entity that is disregarded as a separate entity from its owner for U.S. federal tax purposes. For additional information on our organizational structure prior to May 8, 2014, see \"-Restructuring\".\nUntil May 8, 2014, NMF Holdings was externally managed by the Investment Adviser. As of May 8, 2014, the Investment Adviser serves as the external investment adviser to us. New Mountain Finance Administration, L.L.C. (the \"Administrator\") provides the administrative services necessary for operations. The Investment Adviser and Administrator are wholly-owned subsidiaries of New Mountain Capital. New Mountain Capital is a firm with a track record of investing in the middle market and with assets under management totaling more than $15.0 billion(1), which includes total assets held by us. New Mountain Capital focuses on investing in defensive growth companies across its private equity, public equity and credit investment vehicles. NMF Holdings, formerly known as New Mountain Guardian (Leveraged), L.L.C., was originally formed as a subsidiary of New Mountain Guardian AIV, L.P. (\"Guardian AIV\") by New Mountain Capital in October 2008. Guardian AIV was formed through an allocation of approximately $300.0 million of the $5.1 billion of commitments supporting New Mountain Partners III, L.P., a private equity fund managed by New Mountain Capital. In February 2009, New Mountain Capital formed a co-investment vehicle, New Mountain Guardian Partners, L.P., comprising $20.4 million of commitments. New Mountain Guardian (Leveraged), L.L.C. and New Mountain Guardian Partners, L.P., together with their respective direct and indirect wholly-owned subsidiaries, are defined as the \"Predecessor Entities\".\nPrior to December 18, 2014, New Mountain Finance SPV Funding, L.L.C. (\"NMF SLF\") was a Delaware limited liability company. NMF SLF was a wholly-owned subsidiary of NMF Holdings and thus our wholly-owned indirect subsidiary. NMF SLF was bankruptcy-remote and non-recourse to us. As part of an amendment to our existing credit facilities with Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, NMF SLF merged with and into NMF Holdings on December 18, 2014. See Item 8.-Financial Statements and Supplementary Data-Note 7, Borrowings for additional information on our credit facilities.\nNew Mountain Finance AIV Holdings Corporation\nUntil April 25, 2014, New Mountain Finance AIV Holdings Corporation (\"AIV Holdings\") was a Delaware corporation that was originally incorporated on March 11, 2011. AIV Holdings was dissolved on April 25, 2014. Guardian AIV, a Delaware limited partnership, was AIV Holdings' sole stockholder. AIV Holdings was a closed-end, non-diversified management investment company that was regulated as a BDC under the 1940 Act. As such, AIV Holdings was obligated to comply with certain regulatory requirements. AIV Holdings was treated, and complied with the requirements to qualify annually, as a RIC under the Code.\n_______________________________________________________________________________\n (1) Includes amounts committed, not all of which have been drawn down and invested to date, as of December 31, 2015. \nStructure\nPrior to the Restructuring (as defined below) on May 8, 2014, NMFC and AIV Holdings were holding companies with no direct operations of their own, and their sole asset was their ownership in NMF Holdings. In connection with the IPO, NMFC and AIV Holdings each entered into a joinder agreement with respect to the Limited Liability Company Agreement, as amended and restated (the \"Operating Agreement\"), of NMF Holdings, pursuant to which NMFC and AIV Holdings were admitted as members of NMF Holdings. NMFC acquired from NMF Holdings, with the gross proceeds of the IPO and the Concurrent Private Placement, common membership units (\"units\") of NMF Holdings (the number of units were equal to the number of shares of NMFC's common stock sold in the IPO and the Concurrent Private Placement). Additionally, NMFC received units of NMF Holdings equal to the number of shares of common stock of NMFC issued to the partners of New Mountain Guardian Partners, L.P. Guardian AIV was the parent of NMF Holdings prior to the IPO and, as a result of the transactions completed in connection with the IPO, obtained units in NMF Holdings. Guardian AIV contributed its units in NMF Holdings to AIV Holdings in exchange for common stock of AIV Holdings. AIV Holdings had the right to exchange all or any portion of its units in NMF Holdings for shares of NMFC's common stock on a one-for-one basis at any time.\nThe original structure was designed to generally prevent NMFC and its stockholders from being allocated taxable income with respect to unrecognized gains that existed at the time of the IPO in the Predecessor Entities' assets, and rather such amounts would be allocated generally to AIV Holdings. The result was that any distributions made to NMFC's stockholders that were attributable to such gains generally were not treated as taxable dividends but rather as return of capital.\nSince our IPO, and through December 31, 2015, we raised approximately $454.0 million in net proceeds from additional offerings of common stock and issued shares of common stock valued at approximately $288.4 million on behalf of AIV Holdings for exchanged units. We acquired from NMF Holdings units of NMF Holdings equal to the number of shares of our common stock sold in additional offerings. With the completion of the final secondary offering on February 3, 2014, we owned 100.0% of the units of NMF Holdings, which became our wholly-owned subsidiary.\nRestructuring\nAs a BDC, AIV Holdings had been subject to the 1940 Act, including certain provisions applicable only to BDCs. Accordingly, and after careful consideration of the 1940 Act requirements applicable to BDCs, the cost of 1940 Act compliance and a thorough assessment of AIV Holdings' business model, AIV Holdings' board of directors determined that continuation as a BDC was not in the best interests of AIV Holdings and Guardian AIV. Specifically, given that AIV Holdings was formed for the sole purpose of holding units of NMF Holdings and AIV Holdings had disposed of all of the units of NMF Holdings that it was holding as of February 3, 2014, the board of directors of AIV Holdings approved and declared advisable at an in-person meeting held on March 25, 2014 the withdrawal of AIV Holdings' election to be regulated as a BDC under the 1940 Act. In addition, the board of directors of AIV Holdings approved and declared advisable for AIV Holdings to terminate its registration under Section 12(g) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the \"Exchange Act\") and to dissolve AIV Holdings under the laws of the State of Delaware.\nUpon receipt of the necessary stockholder consent to authorize the board of directors of AIV Holdings to withdraw AIV Holdings' election to be regulated as a BDC, the withdrawal was filed and became effective upon receipt by the SEC of AIV Holdings' notification of withdrawal on Form N-54C on April 15, 2014. The board of directors of AIV Holdings believed that AIV Holdings met the requirements for filing the notification to withdraw its election to be regulated as a BDC, upon the receipt of the necessary stockholder consent. After the notification of withdrawal of AIV Holdings' BDC election was filed with the SEC, AIV Holdings was no longer subject to the regulatory provisions of the 1940 Act applicable to BDCs generally, including regulations related to insurance, custody, composition of its board of directors, affiliated transactions and any compensation arrangements.\nIn addition, on April 15, 2014, AIV Holdings filed a Form 15 with the SEC to terminate AIV Holdings' registration under Section 12(g) of the Exchange Act. After these SEC filings and any other federal or state regulatory or tax filings were made, AIV Holdings proceeded to dissolve under Delaware law by filing a certificate of dissolution in Delaware on April 25, 2014.\nUntil May 8, 2014, as a BDC, NMF Holdings had been subject to the 1940 Act, including certain provisions applicable only to BDCs. Accordingly, and after careful consideration of the 1940 Act requirements applicable to BDCs, the cost of 1940 Act compliance and a thorough assessment of NMF Holdings' current business model, NMF Holdings' board of directors determined at an in-person meeting held on March 25, 2014 that continuation as a BDC was not in the best interests of NMF Holdings.\nAt the 2014 joint annual meeting of the stockholders of NMFC and the sole unit holder of NMF Holdings held on May 6, 2014, the stockholders of NMFC and the sole unit holder of NMF Holdings approved a proposal which authorized the board of directors of NMF Holdings to withdraw NMF Holdings' election to be regulated as a BDC. Additionally, the\nstockholders of NMFC approved a new investment advisory and management agreement between NMFC and the Investment Adviser. Upon receipt of the necessary stockholder/unit holder approval to authorize the board of directors of NMF Holdings to withdraw NMF Holdings' election to be regulated as a BDC, the withdrawal was filed and became effective upon receipt by the SEC of NMF Holdings' notification of withdrawal on Form N-54C on May 8, 2014.\nEffective May 8, 2014, NMF Holdings amended and restated its Operating Agreement such that the board of directors of NMF Holdings was dissolved and NMF Holdings remained a wholly-owned subsidiary of NMFC with the sole purpose of serving as a special purpose vehicle for NMF Holdings' credit facility, and NMFC assumed all other operating activities previously undertaken by NMF Holdings under the management of the Investment Adviser (collectively, the \"Restructuring\"). After the Restructuring, all wholly-owned direct and indirect subsidiaries of NMFC are consolidated with NMFC for both 1940 Act and financial statement reporting purposes, subject to any financial statement adjustments required in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (\"GAAP\"). NMFC continues to remain a BDC regulated under the 1940 Act.\nAlso, on May 8, 2014, NMF Holdings filed Form 15 with the SEC to terminate NMF Holdings' registration under Section 12(g) of the Exchange Act. As a special purpose entity, NMF Holdings is bankruptcy-remote and non-recourse to NMFC. In addition, the assets held at NMF Holdings will continue to be used to secure NMF Holdings' credit facility.\nCurrent Organization\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2015, we established a wholly-owned subsidiary, NMF QID NGL Holdings, Inc. ( NMF QID\u201d). Our wholly-owned subsidiaries, NMF Ancora Holdings Inc. ( NMF Ancora\u201d), NMF QID and NMF YP Holdings Inc. ( NMF YP\u201d), are structured as Delaware entities that serve as tax blocker corporations which hold equity or equity-like investments in portfolio companies organized as limited liability companies (or other forms of pass-through entities). We consolidate our tax blocker corporations for accounting purposes. The tax blocker corporations are not consolidated for income tax purposes and may incur income tax expense as a result of their ownership of the portfolio companies. Additionally, our wholly-owned subsidiary, New Mountain Finance Servicing, L.L.C. ( NMF Servicing\u201d) serves as the administrative agent on certain investment transactions. New Mountain Finance SBIC, L.P. ( SBIC LP\u201d), and its general partner, New Mountain Finance SBIC G.P., L.L.C. ( SBIC GP\u201d), were organized in Delaware as a limited partnership and limited liability company, respectively. SBIC LP and SBIC GP are our consolidated wholly-owned direct and indirect subsidiaries. SBIC LP received a license from the U.S. Small Business Administration (the SBA\u201d) to operate as a small business investment company ( SBIC\u201d) under Section 301(c) of the Small Business Investment Act of 1958, as amended (the 1958 Act\u201d).\nThe diagram below depicts our organizational structure as of December 31, 2015.\n_______________________________________________________________________________\n * Includes partners of New Mountain Guardian Partners, L.P. \n ** NMFC is the sole limited partner of SBIC LP. NMFC, directly or indirectly through SBIC GP, wholly-owns SBIC LP. NMFC owns 100.0% of SBIC GP which owns 1.0% of SBIC LP. NMFC owns 99.0% of SBIC LP. \nOur investment objective is to generate current income and capital appreciation through the sourcing and origination of debt securities at all levels of the capital structure, including first and second lien debt, notes, bonds and mezzanine securities. In some cases, our investments may also include equity interests. The primary focus is in the debt of defensive growth companies, which are defined as generally exhibiting the following characteristics: (i) sustainable secular growth drivers, (ii) high barriers to competitive entry, (iii) high free cash flow after capital expenditure and working capital needs, (iv) high returns on assets and (v) niche market dominance. Similar to us, SBIC LP's investment objective is to generate current income and capital appreciation under our investment criteria. However, SBIC LP's investments must be in SBA eligible companies. Our portfolio may be concentrated in a limited number of industries. As of December 31, 2015, our top five industry concentrations were software, business services, education, distribution & logistics and federal services.\nAs of December 31, 2015, our net asset value was $836.9 million and our portfolio had a fair value of approximately $1,512.2 million in 75 portfolio companies, with a weighted average Yield to Maturity at Cost of approximately 10.7%. This Yield to Maturity at Cost (\"Yield to Maturity at Cost\") calculation assumes that all investments, including secured collateralized agreements, not on non-accrual are purchased at the adjusted cost on the quarter end date and held until their respective maturities with no prepayments or losses and exited at par at maturity. Adjusted cost reflects the GAAP cost for post-IPO investments and a stepped up cost basis of pre-IPO investments (assuming a step-up to fair market value occurred on the IPO date). This calculation excludes the impact of existing leverage. Yield to Maturity at Cost uses the London Interbank Offered Rate (\"LIBOR\") curves at each quarter's end date. The actual yield to maturity may be higher or lower due to the future selection of the LIBOR contracts by the individual companies in our portfolio or other factors.\nRecent Developments\nOn February 4, 2016, our board of directors authorized a program for the purpose of repurchasing up to $50.0 million worth of our common stock. Under the repurchase program, we may, but are not obligated to, repurchase our outstanding common stock in the open market from time to time provided that we comply with our code of ethics and the guidelines specified in Rule 10b-18 of the Exchange Act, including certain price, market volume and timing constraints. In addition, any repurchases will be conducted in accordance with the 1940 Act. Unless amended or extended by our board of directors, we expect the repurchase program to be in place until the earlier of December 31, 2016 or until $50.0 million of our outstanding shares of common stock have been repurchased.\nOur board of directors authorized the repurchase program because it believes the sustained market volatility and uncertainty may cause our common stock to be undervalued from time to time. The timing and number of shares to be repurchased will depend on a number of factors, including market conditions. There are no assurances that we will engage in repurchases, but if market conditions warrant, we now have the ability to take advantage of situations where our management believes share repurchases would be advantageous to us and to our shareholders.\nOn February 22, 2016, our board of directors declared a first quarter 2016 distribution of $0.34 per share payable on March 31, 2016 to holders of record as of March 17, 2016.\nCritical Accounting Policies\nThe preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and revenues and expenses during the periods reported. Actual results could materially differ from those estimates. We have identified the following items as critical accounting policies.\nBasis of Accounting\nWe consolidate our wholly-owned direct and indirect subsidiaries: NMF Holdings, NMF Servicing, SBIC LP, SBIC GP, NMF Ancora, NMF QID and NMF YP. Previously, we consolidated our wholly-owned indirect subsidiary NMF SLF until it merged with and into NMF Holdings on December 18, 2014. See Item 8.-Financial Statements and Supplementary Data-Note 7, Borrowings for additional information on our credit facilities. We are an investment company following accounting and reporting guidance as described in Accounting Standards Codification Topic 946, Financial Services-Investment Companies, (\"ASC 946\"). Prior to the Restructuring, the Predecessor Operating Company consolidated its wholly-owned subsidiary, NMF SLF. NMFC and AIV Holdings did not consolidate the Predecessor Operating Company. Prior to the Restructuring, NMFC and AIV Holdings applied investment company master-feeder financial statement presentation, as described in ASC 946 to their interest in the Predecessor Operating Company. NMFC and AIV Holdings observed that it is also industry practice to follow the presentation prescribed for a master fund-feeder fund structure in ASC 946 in instances in which a master fund is owned by more than one feeder fund and that such presentation provided stockholders of NMFC and AIV Holdings with a clearer depiction of their investment in the master fund.\nValuation and Leveling of Portfolio Investments\nAt all times consistent with GAAP and the 1940 Act, we conduct a valuation of assets, which impacts our net asset value.\nWe value our assets on a quarterly basis, or more frequently if required under the 1940 Act. In all cases, our board of directors is ultimately and solely responsible for determining the fair value of our portfolio investments on a quarterly basis in good faith, including investments that are not publicly traded, those whose market prices are not readily available and any other situation where our portfolio investments require a fair value determination. Security transactions are accounted for on a trade date basis. Our quarterly valuation procedures are set forth in more detail below:\n (1) Investments for which market quotations are readily available on an exchange are valued at such market quotations based on the closing price indicated from independent pricing services. \n (2) Investments for which indicative prices are obtained from various pricing services and/or brokers or dealers are valued through a multi-step valuation process, as described below, to determine whether the quote(s) obtained is representative of fair value in accordance with GAAP. \n a. Bond quotes are obtained through independent pricing services. Internal reviews are performed by the investment professionals of the Investment Adviser to ensure that the quote obtained is representative of fair value in accordance with GAAP and if so, the quote is used. If the Investment Adviser is unable to sufficiently validate the quote(s) internally and if the investment's par value or its fair value exceeds the materiality threshold, the investment is valued similarly to those assets with no readily available quotes (see (3) below); and \n b. For investments other than bonds, we look at the number of quotes readily available and performs the following: \n i. Investments for which two or more quotes are received from a pricing service are valued using the mean of the mean of the bid and ask of the quotes obtained; \n ii. Investments for which one quote is received from a pricing service are validated internally. The investment professionals of the Investment Adviser analyze the market quotes obtained using an array of valuation methods (further described below) to validate the fair value. If the Investment Adviser is unable to sufficiently validate the quote internally and if the investment's par value or its fair value exceeds the materiality threshold, the investment is valued similarly to those assets with no readily available quotes (see (3) below). \n (3) Investments for which quotations are not readily available through exchanges, pricing services, brokers, or dealers are valued through a multi-step valuation process: \n a. Each portfolio company or investment is initially valued by the investment professionals of the Investment Adviser responsible for the credit monitoring; \n b. Preliminary valuation conclusions will then be documented and discussed with our senior management; \n c. If an investment falls into (3) above for four consecutive quarters and if the investment's par value or its fair value exceeds the materiality threshold, then at least once each fiscal year, the valuation for each portfolio investment for which we do not have a readily available market quotation will be reviewed by an independent valuation firm engaged by our board of directors; and \n d. When deemed appropriate by our management, an independent valuation firm may be engaged to review and value investment(s) of a portfolio company, without any preliminary valuation being performed by the Investment Adviser. The investment professionals of the Investment Adviser will review and validate the value provided.  For investments in revolving credit facilities and delayed draw commitments, the cost basis of the funded investments purchased is offset by any costs/netbacks received for any unfunded portion on the total balance committed. The fair value is also adjusted for the price appreciation or depreciation on the unfunded portion. As a result, the purchase of commitments not completely funded may result in a negative fair value until it is called and funded.\nThe values assigned to investments are based upon available information and do not necessarily represent amounts which might ultimately be realized, since such amounts depend on future circumstances and cannot be reasonably determined until the individual positions are liquidated. Due to the inherent uncertainty of determining the fair value of investments that do not have a readily available market value, the fair value of our investments may fluctuate from period to period and the fluctuations could be material.\nGAAP fair value measurement guidance classifies the inputs used in measuring fair value into three levels as follows:\nLevel I-Quoted prices (unadjusted) are available in active markets for identical investments and we have the ability to access such quotes as of the reporting date. The type of investments which would generally be included in Level I include active exchange-traded equity securities and exchange-traded derivatives. As required by Accounting Standards Codification Topic 820, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures (\"ASC 820\"), we, to the extent that we hold such investments, do not adjust the quoted price for these investments, even in situations where we hold a large position and a sale could reasonably impact the quoted price.\nLevel II-Pricing inputs are observable for the investments, either directly or indirectly, as of the reporting date, but are not the same as those used in Level I. Level II inputs include the following:\n \u2022 Quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets; \n \u2022 Quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in non-active markets (examples include corporate and municipal bonds, which trade infrequently); \n \u2022 Pricing models whose inputs are observable for substantially the full term of the asset or liability (examples include most over-the-counter derivatives, including foreign exchange forward contracts); and \n \u2022 Pricing models whose inputs are derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data through correlation or other means for substantially the full term of the asset or liability.  Level III-Pricing inputs are unobservable for the investment and include situations where there is little, if any, market activity for the investment.\nThe inputs used to measure fair value may fall into different levels. In all instances when the inputs fall within different levels of the hierarchy, the level within which the fair value measurement is categorized is based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety. As such, a Level III fair value measurement may include inputs that are both observable and unobservable. Gains and losses for such assets categorized within the Level III table below may include changes in fair value that are attributable to both observable inputs and unobservable inputs.\nThe inputs into the determination of fair value require significant judgment or estimation by management and consideration of factors specific to each investment. A review of the fair value hierarchy classifications is conducted on a quarterly basis. Changes in the observability of valuation inputs may result in the transfer of certain investments within the fair value hierarchy from period to period. Reclassifications impacting the fair value hierarchy are reported as transfers in/out of the respective leveling categories as of the beginning of the quarter in which the reclassifications occur.\nThe following table summarizes the levels in the fair value hierarchy that our portfolio investments fall into as of December 31, 2015:\n\nWe generally use the following framework when determining the fair value of investments where there are little, if any, market activity or observable pricing inputs. We typically determine the fair value of our performing debt investments utilizing an income approach. Additional consideration is given using a market based approach, as well as reviewing the overall underlying portfolio company's performance and associated financial risks. The following outlines additional details on the approaches considered:\nCompany Performance, Financial Review, and Analysis: Prior to investment, as part of our due diligence process, we evaluate the overall performance and financial stability of the portfolio company. Post investment, we analyze each portfolio company's current operating performance and relevant financial trends versus prior year and budgeted results, including, but not limited to, factors affecting its revenue and earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (\"EBITDA\") growth, margin trends, liquidity position, covenant compliance and changes to its capital structure. We also attempt to identify and subsequently track any developments at the portfolio company, within its customer or vendor base or within the industry or the macroeconomic environment, generally, that may alter any material element of our original\ninvestment thesis. This analysis is specific to each portfolio company. We leverage the knowledge gained from our original due diligence process, augmented by this subsequent monitoring, to continually refine our outlook for each of our portfolio companies and ultimately form the valuation of our investment in each portfolio company. When an external event such as a purchase transaction, public offering or subsequent sale occurs, we will consider the pricing indicated by the external event to corroborate the private valuation.\nFor debt investments, we may employ the Market Based Approach (as described below) to assess the total enterprise value of the portfolio company, in order to evaluate the enterprise value coverage of our debt investment. For equity investments or in cases where the Market Based Approach implies a lack of enterprise value coverage for the debt investment, we may additionally employ a discounted cash flow analysis based on the free cash flows of the portfolio company to assess the total enterprise value.\nAfter enterprise value coverage is demonstrated for our debt investments through the method(s) above, the Income Based Approach (as described below) may be employed to estimate the fair value of the investment.\nMarket Based Approach: We may estimate the total enterprise value of each portfolio company by utilizing market value cash flow (EBITDA) multiples of publicly traded comparable companies and comparable transactions. We consider numerous factors when selecting the appropriate companies whose trading multiples are used to value our portfolio companies. These factors include, but are not limited to, the type of organization, similarity to the business being valued, relevant risk factors, as well as size, profitability and growth expectations. We may apply an average of various relevant comparable company EBITDA multiples to the portfolio company's latest twelve month (\"LTM\") EBITDA or projected EBITDA to calculate the enterprise value of the portfolio company. Significant increases or decreases in the EBITDA multiple will result in an increase or decrease in enterprise value, which may result in an increase or decrease in the fair value estimate of the investment. In applying the market based approach as of December 31, 2015, we used the relevant EBITDA multiple ranges set forth in the table below to determine the enterprise value of our portfolio companies. We believe this was a reasonable range in light of current comparable company trading levels and the specific portfolio companies involved.\nIncome Based Approach: We also may use a discounted cash flow analysis to estimate the fair value of the investment. Projected cash flows represent the relevant security's contractual interest, fee and principal payments plus the assumption of full principal recovery at the investment's expected maturity date. These cash flows are discounted at a rate established utilizing a yield calibration approach, which incorporates changes in the credit quality (as measured by relevant statistics) of the portfolio company, as compared to changes in the yield associated with comparable credit quality market indices, between the date of origination and the valuation date. Significant increases or decreases in the discount rate would result in a decrease or increase in the fair value measurement. In applying the income based approach as of December 31, 2015, we used the discount ranges set forth in the table below to value investments in our portfolio companies.\nThe unobservable inputs used in the fair value measurement of our Level III investments as of December 31, 2015 were as follows:\n\n_______________________________________________________________________________\n (1) Fair value was determined based on transaction pricing or recent acquisition or sale as the best measure of fair value with no material changes in operations of the related portfolio company since the transaction date.  NMFC Senior Loan Program I, LLC\nNMFC Senior Loan Program I, LLC (\"SLP I\") was formed as a Delaware limited liability company on May 27, 2014 and commenced operations on June 10, 2014. SLP I is a portfolio company held by us. SLP I is structured as a private investment fund, in which all of the investors are qualified purchasers, as such term is defined under the 1940 Act. Transfer of interests in SLP I is subject to restrictions, and as a result, such interests are not readily marketable. SLP I operates under a limited liability company agreement (the \"Agreement\") and will continue in existence until June 10, 2019, subject to earlier termination pursuant to certain terms of the Agreement. The term may be extended for up to one year pursuant to certain terms of the Agreement. SLP I has a three year re-investment period. SLP I invests in senior secured loans issued by companies within our core industry verticals. These investments are typically broadly syndicated first lien loans.\nSLP I is capitalized with $93.0 million of capital commitments, $275.0 million of debt from a revolving credit facility and is managed by us. Our capital commitment is $23.0 million, representing less than 25.0% ownership, with third party investors representing the remaining capital commitment. As of December 31, 2015, SLP I had total investments with an aggregate fair value of approximately $349.7 million, debt outstanding of $267.6 million and capital that had been called and funded of $93.0 million. As of December 31, 2014, SLP I had total investments with an aggregate fair value of approximately $369.2 million, debt outstanding of $266.9 million and capital that had been called and funded of $93.0 million. Our investment in SLP I is disclosed on our Consolidated Schedules of Investments as of December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014.\nWe, as an investment adviser registered under the Advisers Act, act as the collateral manager to SLP I and are entitled to receive a management fee for our investment management services provided to SLP I. As a result, SLP I is classified as our affiliate. No management fee is charged on our investment in SLP I in connection with the administrative services provided to SLP I. For the years ended December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014, we earned approximately $1.2 million and $0.5 million, respectively, in management fees related to SLP I which is included in other income. As of December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014, approximately $0.3 million and $0.5 million, respectively, of management fees related to SLP I was included in receivable from affiliates. For the years ended December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014, we earned approximately $3.6 million and $1.1 million, respectively, of dividend income related to SLP I, which is included in dividend\nincome. As of December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014, approximately $0.9 million and $0.8 million, respectively, of dividend income related to SLP I was included in interest and dividend receivable. We did not earn management fees or dividend income for the year ended December 31, 2013.\nCollateralized agreements or repurchase financings\nWe follow the guidance in Accounting Standards Codification Topic 860, Transfers and Servicing-Secured Borrowing and Collateral, (\"ASC 860\") when accounting for transactions involving the purchases of securities under collateralized agreements to resell (resale agreements). These transactions are treated as collateralized financing transactions and are recorded at their contracted resale or repurchase amounts, as specified in the respective agreements. Interest on collateralized agreements is accrued and recognized over the life of the transaction and included in interest income. As of December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014, we held one collateralized agreement to resell with a cost basis of $30.0 million and $30.0 million, respectively, and a carrying value of $29.7 million and $30.0 million, respectively, collateralized by a second lien bond in Northstar GOM Holdings Group LLC with a fair value of $29.7 million and $30.0 million, respectively, and guaranteed by a private hedge fund with approximately $716.6 million and $769.4 million, respectively, of assets under management. Pursuant to the terms of the collateralized agreement, the private hedge fund is obligated to repurchase the collateral from us at the par value of the collateralized agreement once called upon by us or if the private hedge fund's total assets under management fall below the agreed upon thresholds. The collateralized agreement earned interest at a weighted average rate of 15.0% per annum as of December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014.\nRevenue Recognition\nOur revenue recognition policies are as follows:\nSales and paydowns of investments: Realized gains and losses on investments are determined on the specific identification method.\nInterest and dividend income: Interest income, including amortization of premium and discount using the effective interest method, is recorded on the accrual basis and periodically assessed for collectability. Interest income also includes interest earned from cash on hand. Upon the prepayment of a loan or debt security, any prepayment penalties are recorded as part of interest income. We have loans and certain preferred equity investments in the portfolio that contain a payment-in-kind ( PIK\u201d) interest or dividend provision. PIK interest and dividends are accrued and recorded as income at the contractual rates, if deemed collectible. The PIK interest and dividends are added to the principal or share balances on the capitalization dates and generally due at maturity or when redeemed by the issuer.\nDividend income on common equity is recorded on the record date for private portfolio companies or on the ex-dividend date for publicly traded portfolio companies. Dividend income on preferred securities is recorded as dividend income on an accrual basis to the extent that such amounts are deemed collectible.\nNon-accrual income: Investments are placed on non-accrual status when principal or interest payments are past due 30 days or more and when there is reasonable doubt that principal or interest will be collected. Accrued cash and un-capitalized PIK interest or dividends are reversed when an investment is placed on non-accrual status. Previously capitalized PIK interest or dividends are not reversed when an investment is placed on non-accrual status. Interest or dividend payments received on non-accrual investments may be recognized as income or applied to principal depending upon management's judgment of the ultimate outcome. Non-accrual investments are restored to accrual status when past due principal and interest is paid and, in management's judgment, are likely to remain current.\nOther income: Other income represents delayed compensation, consent or amendment fees, revolver fees, structuring fees, upfront fees, management fees from a non-controlled/affiliated investment and other miscellaneous fees received and are typically non-recurring in nature. Delayed compensation is income earned from counterparties on trades that do not settle within a set number of business days after trade date. Other income may also include fees from bridge loans. We may from time to time enter into bridge financing commitments, an obligation to provide interim financing to a counterparty until permanent credit can be obtained. These commitments are short-term in nature and may expire unfunded. A fee is received for providing such commitments. Structuring fees and upfront fees are recognized as income when earned, usually when paid at the closing of the investment and are non-refundable.\nPrior to the Restructuring, our revenue recognition policies were as follows:\nRevenue, expenses, and capital gains (losses): At each quarterly valuation date, the Predecessor Operating Company's investment income, expenses, net realized gains (losses), and net increase (decrease) in unrealized appreciation (depreciation) were allocated to us based on our pro-rata interest in the net assets of the Predecessor Operating Company. This was recorded on our Statements of Operations. Realized gains and losses are recorded upon sales of our investments in the Predecessor Operating Company. Net change in unrealized appreciation (depreciation) of investment in New Mountain Finance Holdings, L.L.C. is the difference between the net asset value per share and the closing price per share for shares issued as part of the dividend reinvestment plan on the dividend payment date. This net change in unrealized appreciation (depreciation) of investment in New Mountain Finance Holdings, L.L.C. includes the unrealized appreciation (depreciation) from the IPO. We used the proceeds from our IPO and Concurrent Private Placement to purchase units in the Predecessor Operating Company at $13.75 per unit (our IPO price per share). At the IPO date, $13.75 per unit represented a discount to the actual net asset value per unit of the Predecessor Operating Company. As a result, we experienced immediate unrealized appreciation on our investment.\nAll expenses were paid and recorded by the Predecessor Operating Company. Expenses were allocated to us based on pro-rata ownership interest. In addition, the Predecessor Operating Company paid all of the offering costs related to the IPO and subsequent offerings. We recorded our portion of the offering costs as a direct reduction to net assets and the cost of our investment in the Predecessor Operating Company.\nMonitoring of Portfolio Investments\nWe monitor the performance and financial trends of our portfolio companies on at least a quarterly basis. We attempt to identify any developments within the portfolio company, the industry or the macroeconomic environment that may alter any material element of our original investment strategy.\nWe use an investment rating system to characterize and monitor the credit profile and expected level of returns on each investment in the portfolio. We use a four-level numeric rating scale as follows:\n \u2022 Investment Rating 1-Investment is performing materially above expectations; \n \u2022 Investment Rating 2-Investment is performing materially in-line with expectations. All new loans are rated 2 at initial purchase; \n \u2022 Investment Rating 3-Investment is performing materially below expectations and risk has increased materially since the original investment; and \n \u2022 Investment Rating 4-Investment is performing substantially below expectations and risks have increased substantially since the original investment. Payments may be delinquent. There is meaningful possibility that we will not recoup its original cost basis in the investment and may realize a substantial loss upon exit.  The following table shows the distribution of our investments on the 1 to 4 investment rating scale at fair value as of December 31, 2015:\n\n_______________________________________________________________________________\n (1) Excludes shares and warrants.  As of December 31, 2015, all investments in our portfolio had an Investment Rating of 1 or 2 with the exception of five portfolio company names; four portfolio companies with an Investment Rating of 3 and one portfolio company with an Investment Rating of 4.\nDuring the first quarter of 2015, we placed a portion of our second lien position in Edmentum, Inc. ( Edmentum\u201d) on non-accrual status due to its ongoing restructuring. As of March 31, 2015, our investment in Edmentum had an aggregate cost basis of $30.8 million, an aggregate fair value of $15.6 million and total unearned interest income of $0.4 million for the three months then ended. In June 2015, Edmentum completed a restructuring which resulted in a material modification of the original terms and an extinguishment of our original investment in Edmentum. Prior to the extinguishment in June 2015, our original investment in Edmentum had an aggregate cost of $31.6 million, an aggregate fair value of $16.4 million and total unearned interest income of $0.8 million for the six months ended June 30, 2015. The extinguishment resulted in a realized loss of $15.2 million. Post restructuring, our investments in Edmentum have been restored to full accrual status. As of December 31, 2015, our investments in Edmentum have an aggregate cost basis of $20.9 million and an aggregate fair value of $22.8 million.\nDuring the first quarter of 2015, our first lien position in Education Management LLC ( EDMC\u201d) was non-income producing as a result of the portfolio company undergoing a restructuring. As of December 31, 2014, our investment in EDMC had an aggregate cost basis of $3.0 million, an aggregate fair value of $1.4 million and no unearned interest income for the three months then ended. In January 2015, EDMC completed a restructuring which resulted in a material modification of the original terms and an extinguishment of our original investment in EDMC. Prior to the extinguishment in January 2015, our original investment in EDMC had an aggregate cost of $3.0 million, an aggregate fair value of $1.4 million and no unearned interest income for the period then ended. The extinguishment resulted in a realized loss of $1.6 million. Post restructuring, our investments in EDMC are income producing. As of December 31, 2015, our investments in EDMC have an aggregate cost basis of $1.4 million and an aggregate fair value of $0.5 million.\nDuring the third quarter of 2014, we placed a portion of our first lien position in UniTek Global Services, Inc. (\"UniTek\") on non-accrual status in anticipation of a voluntary petition for a \"Pre-Packaged\" Chapter 11 Bankruptcy in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware which was filed on November 3, 2014. As of December 31, 2014, our investment in UniTek had an aggregate cost basis of $47.4 million, an aggregate fair value of $35.2 million and total unearned interest income of $1.0 million for the year then ended. In January 2015, UniTek emerged from Pre-Packaged\u201d Chapter 11 Bankruptcy and completed its restructuring. The restructuring resulted in a material modification of the original terms and an extinguishment of our original investments in UniTek. Prior to the extinguishment in January 2015, our original investments in UniTek had an aggregate cost of $52.9 million, an aggregate fair value of $40.1 million and total unearned interest income of $0.1 million for the period then ended. The extinguishment resulted in a realized loss of $12.8 million. Post restructuring, our investments in UniTek have been restored to full accrual status. As of December 31, 2015, our investments in UniTek have an aggregate cost basis of $41.3 million and an aggregate fair value of $47.4 million.\nAs of December 31, 2015, our two super priority first lien positions in ATI Acquisition Company and related equity positions in Ancora Acquisition LLC had an Investment Rating of 4 due to the underlying business encountering significant regulatory constraints which have led to the portfolio company's underperformance. As of December 31, 2015, our two super priority first lien positions in ATI Acquisition Company and its related preferred shares and warrants in Ancora Acquisition LLC remained on non-accrual status due to the inability of the portfolio company to service its interest payments for the year then ended and uncertainty about its ability to pay such amounts in the future. As of December 31, 2015, our investment had an aggregate cost basis of $1.6 million, an aggregate fair value of $0.4 million and total unearned interest income of $0.1 million for the year then ended. As of December 31, 2014, our total investment in ATI Acquisition Company and Ancora Acquisition LLC had an aggregate cost basis of $1.6 million, an aggregate fair value of $0.4 million and total unearned interest income of $0.3 million for the year then ended. As of December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014, unrealized gains (losses) include a fee that we would recognize upon realization of the two super priority first lien debt investments.\nPortfolio and Investment Activity\nThe fair value of our investments was approximately $1,512.2 million in 75 portfolio companies at December 31, 2015 and approximately $1,424.7 million in 71 portfolio companies at December 31, 2014. At December 31, 2013 our only investment was our investment in the Predecessor Operating Company. The fair value of the Predecessor Operating Company's investments was approximately $1,115.7 million in 59 portfolio companies at December 31, 2013.\nThe following table shows our portfolio and investment activity for the years ended December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014 and the Predecessor Operating Company's portfolio and investment activity for the year ended December 31, 2013:\n\n_______________________________________________________________________________\n (1) For the year ended December 31, 2014, amounts represent the investment activity of the Predecessor Operating Company through and including May 7, 2014 and our investment activity from May 8, 2014 through December 31, 2014.  At December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014, our weighted average Yield to Maturity at Cost was approximately 10.7% and 10.7%, respectively.\nRecent Accounting Standards Updates\nIn June 2014, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2014-11, Transfers and Servicing Topic 860-Repurchase-to-Maturity Transactions, Repurchase Financings, and Disclosures ( ASU 2014-11\u201d). ASU 2014-11 changes the accounting for repurchase- and resale-to-maturity agreements by requiring that such agreements be recognized as financing arrangements, and requires that a transfer of a financial asset and a repurchase agreement entered into contemporaneously be accounted for separately. ASU 2014-11 requires additional disclosures about certain transferred financial assets accounted for as sales and certain securities financing transactions. The accounting changes and additional disclosures about certain transferred financial assets accounted for as sales are effective for the first interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2014. The additional disclosures for securities financing transactions are required for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2014 and for interim reporting periods beginning after March 15, 2015. The adoption of ASU 2014-11 did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements and disclosures.\nIn August 2014, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2014-15, Presentation of Financial Statements-Going Concern Subtopic 205-40-Disclosure of Uncertainties about an Entity's Ability to Continue as a Going Concern ( ASU 2014-15\u201d). ASU 2014-15 will explicitly require management to assess an entity's ability to continue as a going concern, and to provide related footnote disclosure in certain circumstances. The new standard will be effective for all entities in the first annual period ending after December 15, 2016. Earlier adoption is permitted. The adoption of ASU 2014-15 is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements and disclosures.\nIn February 2015, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2015-02, Consolidation Topic 810-Amendments to the Consolidation Analysis ( ASU 2015-02\u201d), which modifies the consolidation analysis in determining if limited partnerships or similar type entities fall under the variable interest model or voting interest model, particularly those that have fee arrangements and related party relationships. ASU 2015-02 will be effective for all public entities for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2015. Earlier adoption is permitted. We are in the process of evaluating the impact that this guidance will have on our consolidated financial statements and disclosures.\nIn April 2015, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2015-03, Interest-Imputation of Interest Subtopic 835-30-Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs ( ASU 2015-03\u201d), which changes the presentation of debt issuance costs in financial statements. Under ASU 2015-03, an entity presents such costs on the statement of assets and liabilities as a direct deduction from the related debt liability rather than as an asset. Amortization of the costs is reported as interest expense. The new standard will be effective for all public entities for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2015. Earlier adoption is permitted. We are in the process of evaluating the impact that this guidance will have on our consolidated financial statements and disclosures.\nIn May 2015, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2015-07, Fair Value Measurement Topic 820-Disclosures for Investments in Certain Entities that Calculate Net Asset Value per Share (or Its Equivalent) ( ASU 2015-07\u201d), which amends the presentation of investments measured at net asset value, as a practical expedient for fair value, from the fair\nvalue hierarchy. Under ASU 2015-07, an entity would remove investments measured using the practical expedient from the fair value hierarchy. ASU 2015-07 will be effective for annual and interim reporting periods after December 15, 2015. We are in the process of evaluating the impact that this guidance will have on our consolidated financial statements and disclosures.\nResults of Operations\nUnder GAAP, our IPO did not step-up the cost basis of the Predecessor Operating Company's existing investments to fair market value at the IPO date. Since the total value of the Predecessor Operating Company's investments at the time of the IPO was greater than the investments' cost basis, a larger amount of amortization of purchase or original issue discount, and different amounts in realized gain and unrealized appreciation, may be recognized under GAAP in each period than if the step-up had occurred. This will remain until such predecessor investments are sold, repaid or mature in the future. We track the transferred (or fair market) value of each of the Predecessor Operating Company's investments as of the time of the IPO and, for purposes of the incentive fee calculation, adjusts income as if each investment was purchased at the date of the IPO (or stepped up to fair market value). The respective \"Adjusted Net Investment Income\" (defined as net investment income adjusted to reflect income as if the cost basis of investments held at the IPO date had stepped-up to fair market value as of the IPO date) is used in calculating both the incentive fee and dividend payments. See Item 8.-Financial Statements and Supplementary Data-Note 5, Agreements for additional details.\nThe following table for the year ended December 31, 2015 is adjusted to reflect the step-up to fair market value and the allocation of the incentive fees related to hypothetical capital gains out of the adjusted post-incentive fee net investment income.\n\n_______________________________________________________________________________\n (1) For the year ended December 31, 2015, we incurred total incentive fees of $20.6 million, of which none was related to the capital gains incentive fee accrual on a hypothetical liquidation basis. \n (2) Includes income from non-controlled/non-affiliated investments, non-controlled/affiliated investments and controlled investments. \n (3) Includes expense waivers and reimbursements of $0.7 million and management fee waivers of $5.2 million. \n (4) Includes net realized gains and losses on investments and net change in unrealized (depreciation) appreciation of investments from non-controlled/non-affiliated investments, non-controlled/affiliated investments and controlled investments.  For the year ended December 31, 2015, we had a $0.1 million adjustment to interest income for amortization, a decrease of $0.1 million to net realized losses and an increase of $0.2 million to net change in unrealized depreciation to adjust for the stepped-up cost basis of the transferred investments as discussed above. For the year ended December 31, 2015, total\nadjusted investment income of $153.7 million consisted of approximately $130.0 million in cash interest from investments, approximately $3.9 million in PIK interest from investments, approximately $3.6 million in prepayment fees, net amortization of purchase premiums and discounts of approximately $2.4 million, approximately $3.2 million in cash dividends from investments, $2.6 million in PIK dividends from investments and approximately $8.0 million in other income. Our Adjusted Net Investment Income was $82.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2015.\nIn accordance with GAAP, for the year ended December 31, 2015, we did not have an accrual for hypothetical capital gains incentive fee based upon the cumulative net Adjusted Realized Capital Gains and Adjusted Realized Capital Losses and the cumulative net Adjusted Unrealized Capital Appreciation and Adjusted Unrealized Capital Depreciation on investments held at the end of the period. Actual amounts paid to the Investment Adviser are consistent with the Investment Management Agreement and are based only on actual Adjusted Realized Capital Gains computed net of all Adjusted Realized Capital Losses and Adjusted Unrealized Capital Depreciation on a cumulative basis from inception through the end of each calendar year as if the entire portfolio was sold at fair value. As of December 31, 2015, no actual capital gains incentive fee was owed under the Investment Management Agreement, as cumulative net Adjusted Realized Gains did not exceed cumulative Adjusted Unrealized Depreciation.\nThe following table for the year ended December 31, 2014 is adjusted to reflect the step-up to fair market value and the allocation of the incentive fees related to hypothetical capital gains out of the adjusted post-incentive fee net investment income.\n\n_______________________________________________________________________________\n (1) For the year ended December 31, 2014, we incurred total incentive fees of $11.8 million, of which $(6.5) million related to the reduction of the capital gains incentive fee accrual on a hypothetical liquidation basis. \n (2) Includes income from non-controlled/non-affiliated investments and non-controlled/affiliated investments. \n (3) Includes expense waivers and reimbursements of $1.1 million and management fee waivers of $0.7 million. \n (4) Includes net change in unrealized (depreciation) appreciation of investments from non-controlled/non-affiliated investments and non-controlled/affiliated investments. \nFor the year ended December 31, 2014, we had a $0.2 million adjustment to interest income for amortization, a decrease of $0.5 million to net realized gains and an increase of $0.7 million to net change in unrealized depreciation to adjust for the stepped-up cost basis of the transferred investments as discussed above. For the year ended December 31, 2014, total adjusted investment income of $135.4 million consisted of approximately $114.5 million in cash interest from investments, approximately $4.6 million in PIK interest from investments, approximately $3.9 million in prepayment fees, net amortization of purchase premiums and discounts of approximately $2.5 million, approximately $4.6 million in dividend income and approximately $5.3 million in other income. Our Adjusted Net Investment Income was $73.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2014.\nIn accordance with GAAP, for the year ended December 31, 2014, we decreased our hypothetical capital gains incentive fee accrual by $6.5 million based upon the cumulative net Adjusted Realized Capital Gains and Adjusted Realized Capital Losses and the cumulative net Adjusted Unrealized Capital Appreciation and Adjusted Unrealized Capital Depreciation on investments held at the end of each period. Actual amounts paid to the Investment Adviser are consistent with the Investment Management Agreement and are based only on actual Adjusted Realized Capital Gains computed net of all Adjusted Realized Capital Losses and Adjusted Unrealized Capital Depreciation on a cumulative basis from inception through the end of each calendar year as if the entire portfolio was sold at fair value. As of December 31, 2014, no actual capital gains incentive fee was owed under the Investment Management Agreement, as cumulative net Adjusted Realized Gains did not exceed cumulative Adjusted Unrealized Depreciation.\nAt December 31, 2013, our only investment was our investment in the Predecessor Operating Company. The following table for the Predecessor Operating Company for the year ended December 31, 2013 is adjusted to reflect the step-up to fair market value and the allocation of the incentive fees related to hypothetical capital gains out of the adjusted post-incentive fee net investment income.\n\n_______________________________________________________________________________\n (1) For the year ended December 31, 2013, the Predecessor Operating Company incurred total incentive fees of $19.7 million, of which $3.2 million related to capital gains incentive fees on a hypothetical liquidation basis. \n (2) Includes expense waivers and reimbursements of $3.2 million.  For the year ended December 31, 2013, the Predecessor Operating Company had a $0.9 million adjustment to interest income for amortization, a decrease of $3.2 million to net realized gains and an increase of $4.1 million to net change in unrealized appreciation to adjust for the stepped-up cost basis of the transferred investments as discussed above. For the year ended December 31, 2013, total adjusted investment income of $114.0 million consisted of approximately $94.5 million in cash interest from investments, approximately $3.4 million in PIK interest from investments, approximately $5.8 million in prepayment fees, net amortization of purchase premiums and discounts of approximately $2.5 million, approximately $5.0 million in dividend income and approximately $2.8 million in other income. The Predecessor Operating Company's Adjusted Net Investment Income was $66.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2013.\nIn accordance with GAAP, for the year ended December 31, 2013, the Predecessor Operating Company accrued $3.2 million of hypothetical capital gains incentive fee based upon the cumulative net Adjusted Realized Capital Gains and Adjusted Realized Capital Losses and the cumulative net Adjusted Unrealized Capital Appreciation and Adjusted Unrealized Capital Depreciation on investments held at the end of each period. Actual amounts paid to the Investment Adviser are consistent with the Investment Management Agreement and are based only on actual Adjusted Realized Capital Gains computed net of all Adjusted Realized Capital Losses and Adjusted Unrealized Capital Depreciation on a cumulative basis from inception through the end of each calendar year as if the entire portfolio was sold at fair value. As of December 31, 2013, approximately $1.1 million of capital gains incentive fees was owed under the Investment Management Agreement by the Predecessor Operating Company, as cumulative net Adjusted Realized Gains exceeded cumulative Adjusted Unrealized Depreciation and was paid during the year ended December 31, 2014.\nOur Results of Operations for the Years Ended December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014 and the Predecessor Operating Company for the Year Ended December 31, 2013\nRevenue\n\nOur total investment income increased by approximately $18.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to total investment income for the year ended December 31, 2014. The 13% increase in total investment income primarily results from an increase in interest income of approximately $14.4 million from the year ended December 31, 2014 to the year ended December 31, 2015, which is attributable to larger invested balances, driven by the proceeds from the September 2015 primary offering of our common stock, our use of leverage from our revolving credit facilities, SBA-guaranteed debentures and the deployment of the June 2014 proceeds from the issuance of $115.0 million of convertible notes to originate new investments, and prepayment fees received associated with the early repayments or partial repayments of nine different portfolio companies held as of December 31, 2014. The increase in dividend income of approximately $1.1 million during the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2014 was primarily attributable to distributions from our investment in SLP I and PIK dividends income from an equity position. The increase in other income, which represents fees that are generally non-recurring in nature, of approximately $2.7 million during the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2014 was primarily attributable to structuring, upfront, amendment and consent fees received from 22 different portfolio companies, commitment fees received from three bridge facilities and management fees from a non-controlled/affiliated portfolio company.\nOur total investment income increased by approximately $20.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 as compared to the Predecessor Operating Company's total investment income for the year ended December 31, 2013. The 18% increase in total investment income primarily results from an increase in interest income of approximately $18.6 million from the year ended December 31, 2013 to the year ended December 31, 2014, which is attributable to larger invested balances, driven by the proceeds from the October 2013, April 2014 and October 2014 primary offerings of our common stock and the June 2014 offering of our convertible notes, our use of leverage from our revolving credit facilities to originate new investments, and prepayment fees received associated with the early repayments or partial repayments of ten different portfolio companies held by the Predecessor Operating Company as of December 31, 2013. The increase in other income of approximately $2.5 million during the year ended December 31, 2014 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2013, which represents fees that are generally non-recurring in nature, was primarily attributable to structuring, amendment and consent fees received from 20 different portfolio companies and management fees from a non-controlled affiliated portfolio company. The decrease in dividend income during the year ended December 31, 2014 as compared to the year ended\nDecember 31, 2013 was primarily attributable to a large distribution from one of the Predecessor Operating Company's warrant investments in the prior year.\nOperating Expenses\n\n_______________________________________________________________________________\n (1) Capital gains incentive fee accrual assumes a hypothetical liquidation basis.  Our total net operating expenses increased by approximately $15.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2014. Our management fee increased by approximately $1.7 million, net of a management fee waiver, and incentive fees increased by approximately $2.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2014. The increase in management fee and incentive fee from the year ended December 31, 2014 to the year ended December 31, 2015 was attributable to larger invested balances, driven by the proceeds from the September 2015 primary offering of our common stock, our use of leverage from our revolving credit facilities, SBA-guaranteed debentures and the deployment of the June 2014 Proceeds from the issuance of $115.0 million of convertible notes to originate new investments. No capital gains incentive fee was accrued for the year ended December 31, 2015.\nInterest and other financing expenses increased by approximately $5.3 million during the year ended December 31, 2015, primarily due to our issuance of $115.0 million of convertible notes, the closing of the NMFC Credit Facility (as defined below) during the second quarter of 2014 and the drawing on SBA-guaranteed debentures beginning in the fourth quarter of\n2014. Our total professional fees, total administrative expenses and total other general and administrative expenses marginally decreased by approximately $0.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2014. Our expenses waived and reimbursed decreased by approximately $0.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2014 due to the expiration of the expense cap on March 31, 2014.\nOur total net operating expenses increased by approximately $4.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 as compared to the Predecessor Operating Company's year ended December 31, 2013. Our management fee increased by approximately $4.0 million, net of a management fee waiver, and incentive fees increased by approximately $1.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 as compared to the Predecessor Operating Company's year ended December 31, 2013. The increase in management fee and incentive fee from the Predecessor Operating Company's year ended December 31, 2013 to our year ended December 31, 2014 was attributable to larger invested balances, driven by the proceeds from the October 2013, April 2014 and October 2014 primary offerings of our common stock, the June 2014 offering of our convertible notes and our use of leverage from our revolving credit facilities to originate new investments. Our capital gains incentive fee accrual decreased by approximately $9.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 as compared to the Predecessor Operating Company's year ended December 31, 2013, which was attributable to lower net Adjusted Realized Capital Gains (Losses) and net Adjusted Unrealized Capital Depreciation of investments during the period due to lower marks on the broader portfolio. As of December 31, 2014, no actual capital gains incentive fee was owed under the Investment Management Agreement, as cumulative net Adjusted Realized Gains did not exceed cumulative Adjusted Unrealized Depreciation.\nInterest and other financing expenses increased by approximately $5.6 million during the year ended December 31, 2014, primarily due to the increase of average debt outstanding from $184.1 million to $244.6 million for the Holdings Credit Facility (as defined below) for the year ended December 31, 2013 compared to December 31, 2014. In addition, during the year ended December 31, 2014, we issued $115.0 million of convertible notes, closed the NMFC Credit Facility (as defined below) and began to draw on SBA-guaranteed debentures. Our total professional fees, total administrative expenses and total other general and administrative expenses marginally increased by approximately $0.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 as compared to the Predecessor Operating Company's year ended December 31, 2013. During the year ended December 31, 2014, we incurred $10.9 thousand in other expenses that were not subject to the expense cap pursuant to the administration agreement, as amended and restated (the \"Administration Agreement\"), with the Administrator, and further restricted by us. For the year ended December 31, 2014, approximately $1.4 million of indirect administrative expenses were included in administrative expenses, of which $0.8 million were waived by the Administrator. Our expenses waived and reimbursed decreased by approximately $2.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 as compared to the Predecessor Operating Company's year ended December 31, 2013 due to the expiration of the expense cap on March 31, 2014 and the decrease of waived indirect administrative expenses by the Administrator during the year ended December 31, 2014.\nNet Realized Gains (Losses) and Net Change in Unrealized Appreciation (Depreciation)\n\nOur net realized and unrealized losses resulted in a net loss of approximately $49.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the net realized gain and unrealized losses resulting in a net loss of approximately $34.5 million for the same period in 2014. We look at net realized and unrealized gains or losses together as movement in unrealized appreciation or depreciation can be the result of realizations. The net loss for the year ended December 31, 2015 was primarily driven by the overall decrease in the market prices of our investments during the period and $29.7 million of realized losses on investments resulting from the modification of terms on three portfolio companies that were accounted for as extinguishments.\nThese losses were partially offset by sales or repayments of investments with fair values in excess of December 31, 2014 valuations, resulting in net realized gains being greater than the reversal of the cumulative net unrealized gains for those investments which included the sale of two portfolio companies resulting in realized gains of approximately $14.2 million. The provision for income taxes was primarily attributable to three equity investments that are held as of December 31, 2015 in three of our corporate subsidiaries.\nThe net realized and unrealized losses resulted in a net loss of approximately $34.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to the Predecessor Operating Company's net realized and unrealized gains resulting in a net gain of approximately $15.2 million for the same period in 2013. We look at net realized and unrealized gains or losses together as movement in unrealized appreciation or depreciation can be the result of realizations. The net loss for the year ended December 31, 2014 was primarily driven by the overall decrease in the market prices of our investments during the period and the partial write-down related to two portfolio companies. These losses were partially offset by a $5.6 million gain from the sale of NMF Holdings' warrant investments in one portfolio company and sales or repayments of investments with fair values in excess of December 31, 2013 valuations resulting in net realized gains being greater than the reversal of the cumulative net unrealized gains for those investments. The provision for income taxes was attributable to one warrant investment that is held as of December 31, 2014 in one of our corporate subsidiaries.\nThe net gain for the year ended December 31, 2013 was primarily driven by sales or repayment of investments with fair values in excess of December 31, 2012 valuations, resulting in net realized gains being greater than the reversal of the cumulative net unrealized gains for those investments. Additionally, during the year ended December 31, 2013, a distribution from a warrant investment resulted in a realized gain of approximately $1.1 million, the modification of terms on one debt investment that was accounted for as an extinguishment resulted in a realized gain of $1.7 million and the sale of the first lien position in ATI Acquisition Company resulted in a realized loss of $4.3 million.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nThe primary use of existing funds and any funds raised in the future is expected to be for repayment of indebtedness, investments in portfolio companies, cash distributions to our stockholders or for other general corporate purposes.\nSince our IPO, and through December 31, 2015, we raised approximately $454.0 million in net proceeds from additional offerings of common stock and issued shares of common stock valued at approximately $288.4 million on behalf of AIV Holdings for exchanged units. We acquired from the Predecessor Operating Company units of the Predecessor Operating Company equal to the number of shares of our common stock sold in the additional offerings.\nOn September 25, 2015, we completed a public offering of 5,750,000 shares of common stock (including 750,000 shares of common stock that were issued pursuant to the full exercise of the option granted to the underwriters to purchase additional shares) at a public offering price of $14.14 per share, which resulted in net proceeds of $79.4 million. Steven B. Klinsky, the Chairman of our board of directors, purchased 500,000 shares in this offering at the public offering price.\nOur liquidity is generated and generally available through advances from the revolving credit facilities, from cash flows from operations, and, we expect, through periodic follow-on equity offerings. In addition, we may from time to time enter into additional debt facilities, increase the size of existing facilities or issue additional debt securities, including unsecured debt and/or debt securities convertible into common stock. Any such incurrence or issuance would be subject to prevailing market conditions, our liquidity requirements, contractual and regulatory restrictions and other factors. In accordance with the 1940 Act, with certain limited exceptions, we are only allowed to borrow amounts such that our asset coverage, calculated pursuant to the 1940 Act, is at least 200.0% after such borrowing.\nAt December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014, we had cash and cash equivalents of approximately $30.1 million and $23.4 million, respectively, and at December 31, 2013, the Predecessor Operating Company had cash and cash equivalents of approximately $15.0 million. Our cash used in operating activities during the years ended December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014, was approximately $(63.3) million and $(289.6) million, respectively, and cash used in operating activities for the Predecessor Operating Company for the year ended December 31, 2013 was approximately $(40.4) million. Refer to the Predecessor Operating Company's Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows for the period January 1, 2014 to May 7, 2014 included in an exhibit attached hereto. We expect that all current liquidity needs will be met with cash flows from operations and other activities.\nBorrowings\nHoldings Credit Facility-On December 18, 2014 we entered into the Second Amended and Restated Loan and Security Agreement (the \"Holdings Credit Facility\"), among us, as the Collateral Manager, NMF Holdings as the Borrower, Wells Fargo Securities, LLC as the Administrative Agent and Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as the Lender and Collateral Custodian, which is structured as a revolving credit facility and matures on December 18, 2019.\nImmediately prior to amending the Holdings Credit Facility, NMF SLF merged with and into NMF Holdings. The Holdings Credit Facility effectively amended and restated the Predecessor Holdings Credit Facility (as defined below), merged with the SLF Credit Facility (as defined below), and combined the amount of borrowings previously available.\nThe maximum amount of revolving borrowings available under the Holdings Credit Facility is $495.0 million, which is the aggregate of the $280.0 million previously available under the Predecessor Holdings Credit Facility (as defined below) and the $215.0 million previously available under the SLF Credit Facility (as defined below). Under the Holdings Credit Facility, NMF Holdings is permitted to borrow up to 25.0%, 45.0% or 70.0% of the purchase price of pledged assets, subject to approval by Wells Fargo Securities, LLC. The Holdings Credit Facility is non-recourse to us and is collateralized by all of the investments of NMF Holdings on an investment by investment basis. All fees associated with the origination or upsizing of the Holdings Credit Facility are capitalized on our Consolidated Statement of Assets and Liabilities and charged against income as other financing expenses over the life of the Holdings Credit Facility. The Holdings Credit Facility contains certain customary affirmative and negative covenants and events of default. In addition, the Holdings Credit Facility requires us to maintain a minimum asset coverage ratio. The covenants are generally not tied to mark to market fluctuations in the prices of NMF Holdings investments, but rather to the performance of the underlying portfolio companies.\nThe Holdings Credit Facility bears interest at a rate of the LIBOR plus 2.00% per annum for Broadly Syndicated Loans (as defined in the Loan and Security Agreement) and LIBOR plus 2.75% per annum for all other investments. The Holdings Credit Facility also charges a non-usage fee, based on the unused facility amount multiplied by the Non-Usage Fee Rate (as defined in the Loan and Security Agreement).\nPrior to December 18, 2014, the Loan and Security Agreement, as amended and restated, dated May 19, 2011 (the \"Predecessor Holdings Credit Facility\") among NMF Holdings as the Borrower and Collateral Administrator, Wells Fargo Securities, LLC as the Administrative Agent, and Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as the Collateral Custodian, was structured as a revolving credit facility and would mature on October 27, 2016.\nThe maximum amount of revolving borrowings available under the Predecessor Holdings Credit Facility was $280.0 million. Until December 18, 2014, NMF Holdings was permitted to borrow up to 45.0% or 25.0% of the purchase price of pledged first lien or non-first lien debt securities, and up to 70.0% and 45.0% of the purchase price of specified first lien debt securities and specified non-first lien debt securities, respectively, subject to approval by Wells Fargo Bank, National Association. The Predecessor Holdings Credit Facility was amended and restated on May 6, 2014 and as a result, it was non-recourse to us and was collateralized by all of the investments of NMF Holdings on an investment by investment basis. All fees associated with the origination or upsizing of the Predecessor Holdings Credit Facility were capitalized on our Consolidated Statement of Assets and Liabilities and charged against income as other financing expenses over the life of the Predecessor Holdings Credit Facility. The Predecessor Holdings Credit Facility contained certain customary affirmative and negative covenants and events of default, including the occurrence of a change in control. In addition, the Predecessor Holdings Credit Facility required us to maintain a minimum asset coverage ratio. However, the covenants were generally not tied to mark to market fluctuations in the prices of NMF Holdings' investments, but rather to the performance of the underlying portfolio companies.\nThe Predecessor Holdings Credit Facility bore interest at a rate of the LIBOR plus 2.75% per annum and charged a non-usage fee, based on the unused facility amount multiplied by the Non-Usage Fee Rate (as defined in the Loan and Security Agreement).\nThe following table summarizes the interest expense, non-usage fees and amortization of financing costs incurred, together, on the Holdings Credit Facility and the Predecessor Holdings Credit Facility for the years ended December 31, 2015, December 31, 2014 and December 31, 2013.\n\nAs of December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014, the outstanding balance on the Holdings Credit Facility was $419.3 million and $468.1 million, respectively, and as of December 31, 2013, the outstanding balance on the Predecessor Holdings Credit Facility was $221.8 million, and NMF Holdings was in compliance with the applicable covenants in the Holdings Credit Facility and Predecessor Holdings Credit Facility on such dates.\nSLF Credit Facility-NMF SLF's Loan and Security Agreement, as amended and restated, dated October 27, 2010 (the \"SLF Credit Facility\") among NMF SLF as the Borrower, NMF Holdings as the Collateral Administrator, Wells Fargo Securities, LLC as the Administrative Agent, and Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as the Collateral Custodian, was structured as a revolving credit facility and was set to mature on October 27, 2016. The maximum amount of revolving borrowings available under the SLF Credit Facility was $215.0 million. The SLF Credit Facility was non-recourse to us and secured by all assets of NMF SLF on an investment by investment basis. All fees associated with the origination or upsizing of the SLF Credit Facility were capitalized on our Consolidated Statement of Assets and Liabilities and charged against income as other financing expenses over the life of the SLF Credit Facility. The SLF Credit Facility contained certain customary affirmative and negative covenants and events of default, including the occurrence of a change in control. The covenants were generally not tied to mark to market fluctuations in the prices of the NMF SLF's investments, but rather to the performance of the underlying portfolio companies. NMF SLF was not restricted from the purchase or sale of loans with an affiliate. Therefore, specified first lien loans could be moved as collateral between the Holdings Credit Facility and the SLF Credit Facility. The SLF Credit Facility merged with the Holdings Credit Facility on December 18, 2014.\nUntil December 18, 2014, the SLF Credit Facility permitted borrowings of up to 70.0% of the purchase price of pledged first lien debt securities and up to 25.0% of the purchase price of specified second lien loans, of which, up to 25.0% of the aggregate outstanding loan balance of all pledged debt securities in the SLF Credit Facility was allowed to be derived from second lien loans, subject to approval by Wells Fargo Bank, National Association.\nThe SLF Credit Facility bore interest at a rate of LIBOR plus 2.00% per annum for first lien loans and LIBOR plus 2.75% per annum for second lien loans, respectively, as amended on March 11, 2013. A non-usage fee was paid, based on the unused facility amount multiplied by the Non-Usage Fee Rate (as defined in the Loan and Security Agreement).\nThe following table summarizes the interest expense, non-usage fees and amortization of financing costs incurred on the SLF Credit Facility for the years ended December 31, 2015, December 31, 2014 and December 31, 2013.\n\n_______________________________________________________________________________\n (1) Not applicable, as the SLF Credit Facility merged into the Holdings Credit Facility on December 18, 2014. \n (2) For the year ended December 31, 2014, amounts reported relate to the period from January 1, 2014 to December 17, 2014 (date of merger). \n (3) For the years ended December 31, 2014 and December 31, 2013, the total non-usage fee was less than $50 thousand.  The SLF Credit Facility merged with the Holdings Credit Facility on December 18, 2014. The outstanding balance as of December 31, 2013 was $214.7 million and NMF SLF was in compliance with the applicable covenants in the SLF Credit Facility on such date.\nNMFC Credit Facility-The Senior Secured Revolving Credit Agreement, as amended, dated June 4, 2014 (together with the related guarantee and security agreement, the \"NMFC Credit Facility\"), among us as the Borrower, Goldman Sachs Bank USA as the Administrative Agent and Collateral Agent, and Goldman Sachs Bank USA, Morgan Stanley Bank, N.A. and Stifel Bank & Trust as Lenders, is structured as a senior secured revolving credit facility and matures on June 4, 2019. The NMFC Credit Facility is guaranteed by certain of our domestic subsidiaries and proceeds from the NMFC Credit Facility may be used for general corporate purposes, including the funding of portfolio investments.\nThe maximum amount of revolving borrowings available under the NMFC Credit Facility is $95.0 million, as amended on June 26, 2015. We are permitted to borrow at various advance rates depending on the type of portfolio investment as outlined in the Senior Secured Revolving Credit Agreement. All fees associated with the origination of the NMFC Credit Facility are capitalized on our Consolidated Statement of Assets and Liabilities and charged against income as other financing expenses over the life of the NMFC Credit Facility. The NMFC Credit Facility contains certain customary affirmative and negative covenants and events of default, including certain financial covenants related to asset coverage and liquidity and other maintenance covenants.\nThe NMFC Credit Facility generally bears interest at a rate of LIBOR plus 2.50% per annum or the prime rate plus 1.50% per annum, and charges a commitment fee, based on the unused facility amount multiplied by 0.375% per annum (as defined in the Senior Secured Revolving Credit Agreement).\nThe following table summarizes the interest expense, non-usage fees and amortization of financing costs incurred on the NMFC Credit Facility for the years ended December 31, 2015, December 31, 2014 and December 31, 2013.\n\n_______________________________________________________________________________\n (1) For the year ended December 31, 2014, amounts reported relate to the period from June 4, 2014 (commencement of the NMFC Credit Facility) to December 31, 2014. \n (2) Not applicable, as the NMFC Credit Facility commenced on June 4, 2014.  As of December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014, the outstanding balance on the NMFC Credit Facility was $90.0 million and $50.0 million, respectively, and NMFC was in compliance with the applicable covenants in the NMFC Credit Facility on such dates.\nConvertible Notes-On June 3, 2014, we closed a private offering of $115.0 million aggregate principal amount of senior unsecured convertible notes (the \"Convertible Notes\"), pursuant to an indenture, dated June 3, 2014 (the \"Indenture\"). The Convertible Notes were issued in a private placement only to qualified institutional buyers pursuant to Rule 144A under the Securities Act of 1933. As of the first anniversary, June 3, 2015, of the Convertible Notes, the restrictions under Rule 144A under the Securities Act of 1933 were removed, allowing the Convertible Notes to be eligible and freely tradeable without restrictions for resale pursuant to Rule 144(b)(1) under the Securities Act of 1933. The Convertible Notes bear interest at an annual rate of 5.0%, payable semi-annually in arrears on June 15 and December 15 of each year, which commenced on December 15, 2014. The Convertible Notes will mature on June 15, 2019 unless earlier converted or repurchased at the holder's option.\nThe following table summarizes certain key terms related to the convertible features of our Convertible Notes as of December 31, 2015.\n\n_______________________________________________________________________________\n (1) Conversion rates denominated in shares of common stock per $1.0 thousand principal amount of the Convertible Notes converted. \n (2) Represents conversion rate and conversion price, as applicable, taking into account certain de minimis adjustments that will be made on the conversion date. \n (3) The conversion price in effect at December 31, 2015 was calculated on the last anniversary of the issuance and will be adjusted again on the next anniversary, unless the exercise price shall have changed by more than 1.0% before the anniversary.  The conversion rate will be subject to adjustment upon certain events, such as stock splits and combinations, mergers, spin-offs, increases in dividends in excess of $0.34 per share per quarter and certain changes in control. Certain of these adjustments, including adjustments for increases in dividends, are subject to a conversion price floor of $14.16 per share. In no event will the total number of shares of common stock issuable upon conversion exceed 70.6214 per $1.0 thousand principal amount of the Convertible Notes. We have determined that the embedded conversion option in the Convertible Notes is not required to be separately accounted for as a derivative under GAAP.\nThe Convertible Notes are senior unsecured obligations and rank senior in right of payment to our existing and future indebtedness that is expressly subordinated in right of payment to the Convertible Notes; equal in right of payment to our existing and future unsecured indebtedness that is not so subordinated; effectively junior in right of payment to any of our secured indebtedness (including existing unsecured indebtedness that we later secure) to the extent of the value of the assets securing such indebtedness; and structurally junior to all existing and future indebtedness (including trade payables) incurred by our subsidiaries and financing vehicles. As reflected in Item 8.-Financial Statements and Supplementary Data-Note 12, Earnings Per Share, the issuance is considered part of the if-converted method for calculation of diluted earnings per share.\nWe may not redeem the Convertible Notes prior to maturity. No sinking fund is provided for the Convertible Notes. In addition, if certain corporate events, holders of the Convertible Notes may require us to repurchase for cash all or part of their Convertible Notes at a repurchase price equal to 100.0% of the principal amount of the Convertible Notes to be repurchased, plus accrued and unpaid interest through, but excluding, the repurchase date.\nThe Indenture contains certain covenants, including covenants requiring us to provide financial information to the holders of the Convertible Note and the Trustee if we cease to be subject to the reporting requirements of the Exchange Act. These covenants are subject to limitations and exceptions that are described in the Indenture.\nThe following table summarizes the interest expense and amortization of financing costs incurred on the Convertible Notes for the years ended December 31, 2015, December 31, 2014 and December 31, 2013.\n\n_______________________________________________________________________________\n (1) For the year ended December 31, 2014, amounts reported relate to the period from June 3, 2014 (commencement of the Convertible Notes) to December 31, 2014. \n (2) Not applicable, as the Convertible Notes commenced on June 3, 2014.  As of December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014, the outstanding balance on the Convertible Notes was $115.0 million and $115.0 million, respectively, and NMFC was in compliance with the terms of the Indenture on such dates.\nSBA-guaranteed debentures-On August 1, 2014, SBIC LP received an SBIC license from the SBA.\nThe SBIC license allows SBIC LP to obtain leverage by issuing SBA-guaranteed debentures, subject to the issuance of a capital commitment by the SBA and other customary procedures. SBA-guaranteed debentures are non-recourse to us, interest only debentures with interest payable semi-annually and have a ten year maturity. The principal amount of SBA-guaranteed debentures is not required to be paid prior to maturity but may be prepaid at any time without penalty. The interest rate of SBA-guaranteed debentures is fixed on a semi-annual basis at a market-driven spread over U.S. Treasury Notes with ten year maturities. The SBA, as a creditor, will have a superior claim to the assets of SBIC LP over our stockholders in the event SBIC LP is liquidated or the SBA exercises remedies upon an event of default.\nThe maximum amount of borrowings available under current SBA regulations is $150.0 million as long as the licensee has at least $75.0 million in regulatory capital, receives a capital commitment from the SBA and has been through an examination by the SBA subsequent to licensing.\nAs of December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014, SBIC LP had regulatory capital of approximately $72.4 million and $42.2 million, respectively, and SBA-guaranteed debentures outstanding of $117.7 million and $37.5 million, respectively. The SBA-guaranteed debentures incur upfront fees of 3.425%, which consists of a 1.00% commitment fee and a 2.425% issuance discount, which are amortized over the life of the SBA-guaranteed debentures. The following table summarizes our fixed-rate SBA-guaranteed debentures as of December 31, 2015.\n\n_____________________________________________________________________________\n (1) Estimated maturity date as interim SBA-guaranteed debentures are expected to pool in March 2016.  Prior to pooling, the SBA-guaranteed debentures bear interest at an interim floating rate of LIBOR plus 0.30%. Once pooled, which occurs in March and September each year, the SBA-guaranteed debentures bear interest at a fixed rate that is set to the current 10-year treasury rate plus a spread at each pooling date.\nThe following table summarizes the interest expense and amortization of financing costs incurred on the SBA-guaranteed debentures for the years ended December 31, 2015, December 31, 2014 and December 31, 2013.\n\n_______________________________________________________________________________\n (1) For the year ended December 31, 2014, amounts reported relate to the period from August 1, 2014 (receipt of the SBIC license) to December 31, 2014. The initial SBA-guaranteed debenture borrowing occurred on November 17, 2014. \n (2) Not applicable, as the SBIC LP received an SBIC license from the SBA on August 1, 2014. \n (3) For the year ended December 31, 2014, the total interest expense and amortization of financing costs were less than $50 thousand.  The SBIC program is designed to stimulate the flow of private investor capital into eligible small businesses, as defined by the SBA. Under SBA regulations, SBIC LP is subject to regulatory requirements, including making investments in SBA-eligible businesses, investing at least 25.0% of its investment capital in eligible smaller businesses, as defined under the 1958 Act, placing certain limitations on the financing terms of investments, regulating the types of financing, prohibiting investments in small businesses with certain characteristics or in certain industries and requiring capitalization thresholds that limit distributions to us. SBIC LP is subject to an annual periodic examination by an SBA examiner to determine SBIC LP's compliance with the relevant SBA regulations and an annual financial audit of its financial statements that are prepared on a basis of accounting other than GAAP (such as ASC 820) by an independent auditor. As of December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014, SBIC LP was in compliance with SBA regulatory requirements.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe may become a party to financial instruments with off-balance sheet risk in the normal course of business to meet the financial needs of our portfolio companies. These instruments may include commitments to extend credit and involve, to varying degrees, elements of liquidity and credit risk in excess of the amount recognized in the balance sheet. As of December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014, we had outstanding commitments to third parties to fund investments totaling $26.3 million and $27.4 million respectively, under various undrawn revolving credit facilities, delayed draw commitments or other future funding commitments.\nWe may from time to time enter into financing commitment letters or bridge financing commitments, which could require funding in the future. As of December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014, we did not enter into any commitment letters to purchase debt investments. As of December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014, we had not entered into any bridge financing commitments which could require funding in the future.\nContractual Obligations\nA summary of our significant contractual payment obligations as of December 31, 2015 is as follows:\n\n_______________________________________________________________________________\n (1) Under the terms of the $495.0 million Holdings Credit Facility, all outstanding borrowings under that facility ($419.3 million as of December 31, 2015) must be repaid on or before December 18, 2019. As of December 31, 2015, there was approximately $75.7 million of possible capacity remaining under the Holdings Credit Facility. \n (2) Our SBA-guaranteed debentures will begin to mature on March 1, 2025. \n (3) The $115.0 million Convertible Notes will mature on June 15, 2019 unless earlier converted or repurchased at the holder's option. \n (4) Under the terms of the $95.0 million NMFC Credit Facility, all outstanding borrowings under that facility ($90.0 million as of December 31, 2015) must be repaid on or before June 4, 2019. As of December 31, 2015, there was approximately $5.0 million of possible capacity remaining under the NMFC Credit Facility.  We have certain contracts under which we have material future commitments. We have $26.3 million of undrawn funding commitments as of December 31, 2015 related to our participation as a lender in revolving credit facilities, delayed draw commitments or other future funding commitments of our portfolio companies. As of December 31, 2015, we had not entered into any bridge financing commitments or commitment letters which could require funding in the future.\nWe have entered into the Investment Management Agreement with the Investment Adviser in accordance with the 1940 Act. Under the Investment Management Agreement, the Investment Adviser has agreed to provide us with investment advisory and management services. We have agreed to pay for these services (1) a management fee and (2) an incentive fee based on our performance.\nWe have also entered into an Administration Agreement with the Administrator. Under the Administration Agreement, the Administrator has agreed to arrange office space for us and provide office equipment and clerical, bookkeeping and record keeping services and other administrative services necessary to conduct our respective day-to-day operations. The Administrator has also agreed to perform, or oversee the performance of, our financial records, our reports to stockholders and reports filed with the SEC.\nIf any of the contractual obligations discussed above are terminated, our costs under any new agreements that are entered into may increase. In addition, we would likely incur significant time and expense in locating alternative parties to provide the services we expect to receive under the Investment Management Agreement and the Administration Agreement.\nDistributions and Dividends\nDistributions declared and paid to stockholders for the year ended December 31, 2015 totaled $81.0 million.\nThe following table reflects cash distributions, including dividends and returns of capital, if any, per share that have been declared by our board of directors for the years ended December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014:\n\n_______________________________________________________________________________\n (1) Special dividend related to estimated realized capital gains attributable to the Predecessor Operating Company's warrant investments in Learning Care Group (US), Inc.  Tax characteristics of all dividends paid are reported to stockholders on Form 1099 after the end of the calendar year. Future quarterly dividends, if any, will be determined by our board of directors.\nWe intend to pay quarterly distributions to our stockholders in amounts sufficient to maintain our status as a RIC. We intend to distribute approximately all of our Adjusted Net Investment Income on a quarterly basis and substantially all of our taxable income on an annual basis, except that we may retain certain net capital gains for reinvestment.\nWe maintain an \"opt out\" dividend reinvestment plan on behalf of our common stockholders, pursuant to which each of our stockholders' cash distributions will be automatically reinvested in additional shares of common stock, unless the stockholder elects to receive cash. See Item 8 - Financial Statements and Supplementary Data-Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies for additional details regarding our dividend reinvestment plan.\nRelated Parties\nWe have entered into a number of business relationships with affiliated or related parties, including the following:\n \u2022 We have entered into the Investment Management Agreement with the Investment Adviser, a wholly-owned subsidiary of New Mountain Capital. Therefore, New Mountain Capital is entitled to any profits earned by the Investment Adviser, which includes any fees payable to the Investment Adviser under the terms of the Investment Management Agreement, less expenses incurred by the Investment Adviser in performing its services under the Investment Management Agreement. \n \u2022 We have entered into an Administration Agreement with the Administrator, a wholly-owned subsidiary of New Mountain Capital. The Administrator arranges our office space and provides office equipment and administrative services necessary to conduct our respective day-to-day operations pursuant to the Administration Agreement. We reimburse the Administrator for the allocable portion of overhead and other expenses incurred by it in performing its obligations to us under the Administration Agreement, which includes the fees and expenses associated with performing administrative, finance, and compliance functions, and the compensation of our chief financial officer and chief compliance officer and their respective staffs. Pursuant to the Administration Agreement and further restricted by us, expenses payable to the Administrator as well as other direct and indirect expenses (excluding \ninterest, other financing expense, trading expenses and management and incentive fees) had been capped at $3.5 million for the time period from April 1, 2012 to March 31, 2013 and capped at $4.25 million for the time period from April 1, 2013 to March 31, 2014. The expense cap expired on March 31, 2014. Thereafter, the Administrator may, in its own discretion, submit to us for reimbursement some or all of the expenses that the Administrator has incurred on our behalf during any quarterly period. As a result, the amount of expenses for which we will have to reimburse the Administrator may fluctuate in future quarterly periods and there can be no assurance given as to when, or if, the Administrator may determine to limit the expenses that the Administrator submits to us for reimbursement in the future. However, it is expected that the Administrator will continue to support part of our expense burden in the near future and may decide to not calculate and charge through certain overhead related amounts as well as continue to cover some of the indirect costs. The Administrator cannot recoup any expenses that the Administrator has previously waived. For the year ended December 31, 2015, approximately $1.4 million of indirect administrative expenses were included in administrative expenses, of which $0.7 million were waived by the Administrator. As of December 31, 2015, approximately $0.4 million were payable to the Administrator.\n \u2022 We, the Investment Adviser and the Administrator have entered into a royalty-free Trademark License Agreement, as amended, with New Mountain Capital, pursuant to which New Mountain Capital has agreed to grant us, the Investment Adviser and the Administrator, a non-exclusive, royalty-free license to use the name \"New Mountain\" and \"New Mountain Finance\".  In addition, we have adopted a formal code of ethics that governs the conduct of our respective officers and directors. These officers and directors also remain subject to the duties imposed by the 1940 Act, the Delaware General Corporation Law and the Delaware Limited Liability Company Act.\nThe Investment Adviser and its affiliates may also manage other funds in the future that may have investment mandates that are similar, in whole and in part, with our investment mandates. The Investment Adviser and its affiliates may determine that an investment is appropriate for us and for one or more of those other funds. In such event, depending on the availability of such investment and other appropriate factors, the Investment Adviser or its affiliates may determine that we should invest side-by-side with one or more other funds. Any such investments will be made only to the extent permitted by applicable law and interpretive positions of the SEC and its staff, and consistent with the Investment Adviser's allocation procedures.\nConcurrently with the IPO, we sold an additional 2,172,000 shares of our common stock to certain executives and employees of, and other individuals affiliated with, New Mountain Capital in the Concurrent Private Placement.", "item_7_tables": "Table 210: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td>
