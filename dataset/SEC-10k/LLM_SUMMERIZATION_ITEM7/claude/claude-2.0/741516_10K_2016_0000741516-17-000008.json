The discussion and analysis are intended to supplement and highlight information contained in the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements and the selected financial data presented elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nRECLASSIFICATION\nIn certain circumstances, reclassifications have been made to prior period information to conform to the 2016 presentation. There were no material reclassifications.\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES\nThe accounting and reporting policies followed by the Company conform with GAAP and they conform to general practices within the banking industry. The Company's critical accounting policies, which are summarized below, relate to (1) the allowance for loan losses, (2) mergers and acquisitions, (3) acquired loans with specific credit-related deterioration, (4) goodwill and intangible assets, (5) other real estate owned, (6) deferred tax assets and liabilities, (7) other-than-temporary impairment of securities and (8) the unfunded pension liability. A summary of the Company's significant accounting policies is set forth in Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nThe financial information contained within the Company's financial statements is, to a significant extent, financial information that is based on measures of the financial effects of transactions and events that have already occurred. A variety of factors could affect the ultimate value that is obtained when earning income, recognizing an expense, recovering an asset, or relieving a liability. In addition, GAAP itself may change from one previously acceptable method to another method.\nAllowance for Loan Losses\nThe purpose of the allowance for loan losses (\"ALLL\") is to provide for probable losses inherent in the loan portfolio. The allowance is increased by the provision for loan losses and by recoveries of previously charged-off loans. Loan charge-offs decrease the allowance.\nThe goal of the Company is to maintain an appropriate, systematic, and consistently applied process to determine the amounts of the ALLL and the provision for loan loss expense.\nThe Company uses certain practices to manage its credit risk. These practices include (1) appropriate lending limits for loan officers, (2) a loan approval process, (3) careful underwriting of loan requests, including analysis of borrowers, cash flows, collateral, and market risks, (4) regular monitoring of the portfolio, including diversification by type and geography, (5) review of loans by the Loan Review department, which operates independently of loan production (the Loan Review function consists of a co-sourced arrangement using both internal personnel and external vendors to provide the Company with a more robust review function of the loan portfolio), (6) regular meetings of the Credit Committee to discuss portfolio and policy changes and make decisions on large or unusual loan requests, and (7) regular meetings of the Asset Quality Committee which reviews the status of individual loans.\nRisk grades are assigned as part of the loan origination process. From time to time, risk grades may be modified as warranted by the facts and circumstances surrounding the credit.\nCalculation and analysis of the ALLL is prepared quarterly by the Finance Department. The Company's Credit Committee, Capital Management Committee, Audit Committee, and the Board of Directors review the allowance for adequacy.\nThe Company's ALLL has two basic components: the formula allowance and the specific allowance. Each of these components is determined based upon estimates and judgments.\nThe formula allowance uses historical loss experience as an indicator of future losses, along with various qualitative factors, including levels and trends in delinquencies, nonaccrual loans, charge-offs and recoveries, trends in volume and terms of loans, effects of changes in underwriting standards, experience of lending staff, economic conditions, and portfolio concentrations, regulatory, legal, competition, quality of loan review system, and value of underlying collateral. In the formula allowance for commercial and commercial real estate loans, the historical loss rate is combined with the qualitative factors, resulting in an adjusted loss factor for each risk-grade category of loans. The period-end balances for each loan risk-grade category are multiplied by the adjusted loss factor. Allowance calculations for residential real estate and consumer loans are calculated based on historical losses for each product category without regard to risk grade. This loss rate is combined with qualitative factors resulting in an adjusted loss factor for each product category.\nThe specific allowance uses various techniques to arrive at an estimate of loss for specifically identified impaired loans. These include:\nTable 21: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>The present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan's effective interest rate. The effective interest rate on a loan is the rate of return implicit in the loan (that is, the contractual interest rate adjusted for any net deferred loan fees or costs and any premium or discount existing at the origination or acquisition of the loan);\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 22: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>The loan's observable market price, or\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 23: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>The fair value of the collateral, net of estimated costs to dispose, if the loan is collateral dependent.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe use of these computed values is inherently subjective and actual losses could be greater or less than the estimates.\nNo single statistic, formula, or measurement determines the adequacy of the allowance. Management makes subjective and complex judgments about matters that are inherently uncertain, and different amounts would be reported under different conditions or using different assumptions. For analytical purposes, management allocates a portion of the allowance to specific loan categories and specific loans. However, the entire allowance is used to absorb credit losses inherent in the loan portfolio, including identified and unidentified losses.\nThe relationships and ratios used in calculating the allowance, including the qualitative factors, may change from period to period as facts and circumstances evolve. Furthermore, management cannot provide assurance that in any particular period the Bank will not have sizeable credit losses in relation to the amount reserved. Management may find it necessary to significantly adjust the allowance, considering current factors at the time.\nMergers and Acquisitions\nBusiness combinations are accounted for under the Financial Accounting Standards Board (the \"FASB\") Accounting Standards Codification (\"ASC\") 805, Business Combinations, using the acquisition method of accounting. The acquisition method of accounting requires an acquirer to recognize the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed at the acquisition date measured at their fair values as of that date. To determine the fair values, the Company will rely on third party valuations, such as appraisals, or internal valuations based on discounted cash flow analysis or other valuation techniques. Under the acquisition method of accounting, the Company will identify the acquirer and the closing date and apply applicable recognition principles and conditions.\nAcquisition-related costs are costs the Company incurs to effect a business combination. Those costs include advisory, legal, accounting, valuation, and other professional or consulting fees. Some other examples of costs to the Company include systems conversions, integration planning, consultants, and advertising costs. The Company will account for acquisition-related costs as expenses in the periods in which the costs are incurred and the services are received, with one exception. The costs to issue debt or equity securities will be recognized in accordance with other applicable GAAP. These acquisition-related costs have been and will be included within the Consolidated Statements of Income classified within the noninterest expense caption.\nAcquired Loans with Specific Credit-Related Deterioration\nAcquired loans with specific credit deterioration are accounted for by the Company in accordance with FASB ASC 310-30, Receivables - Loans and Debt Securities Acquired with Deteriorated Credit Quality. Certain acquired loans, those for which specific credit-related deterioration, since origination, is identified, are recorded at fair value reflecting the present value of the amounts expected to be collected. Income recognition on these loans is based on a reasonable expectation about the timing and amount of cash flows to be collected. Acquired loans deemed impaired and considered collateral dependent, with the timing of the sale of loan collateral indeterminate, remain on non-accrual status and have no accretable yield.\nGoodwill and Intangible Assets\nThe Company follows ASC 350, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, which prescribes the accounting for goodwill and intangible assets subsequent to initial recognition. Goodwill resulting from business combinations prior to January 1, 2009 represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net assets of businesses acquired. Goodwill resulting from business combinations after January 1, 2009 is generally determined as the excess of the fair value of the consideration transferred, plus the fair value of any noncontrolling interests in the acquiree, over the fair value of the net assets acquired and liabilities assumed as of the acquisition date. Goodwill and intangible assets acquired in a purchase business combination and determined to have an indefinite useful life are not amortized, but tested for impairment at least annually or more frequently if events and circumstances exists that indicate that a goodwill impairment test should be performed. The Company has selected June 30 as the date to perform the annual impairment test. Intangible assets with definite useful lives are amortized over their estimated useful lives, which range from 8.25 to 10 years, to their estimated residual values. Goodwill is the only intangible asset with an indefinite life on the Company's consolidated balance sheets. No indicators of impairment were identified during the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015, and 2014.\nOther Real Estate Owned\nAssets acquired through, or in lieu of, loan foreclosure are held for sale and are initially recorded at fair value less costs to sell at the date of foreclosure. Subsequent to foreclosure, management periodically performs valuations of the foreclosed assets based on updated appraisals, general market conditions, recent sales of similar properties, length of time the properties have been held, and our ability and intention with regard to continued ownership of the properties. The Company may incur additional write-downs of foreclosed assets to fair value less costs to sell if valuations indicate a further deterioration in market conditions.\nDeferred Tax Assets and Liabilities\nThe realization of deferred income tax assets is assessed and a valuation allowance is recorded if it is more likely than not\u201d that all or a portion of the deferred tax asset will not be realized. More likely than not\u201d is defined as greater than a 50% chance. Management considers all available evidence, both positive and negative, to determine whether, based on the weight of that evidence, a valuation allowance is needed.\nOther-than-temporary Impairment of Securities\nImpairment of securities occurs when the fair value of a security is less than its amortized cost. For debt securities, impairment is considered other-than-temporary and recognized in its entirety in net income if either (i) we intend to sell the security or (ii) it is more-likely-than-not that we will be required to sell the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis. If, however, we do not intend to sell the security and it is not more-likely-than-not that we will be required to sell the security before recovery, we must determine what portion of the impairment is attributable to a credit loss, which occurs when the amortized cost basis of the security exceeds the present value of the cash flows expected to be collected from the security. If there is no credit loss, there is no other-than-temporary impairment. If there is a credit loss, other-than-temporary impairment exists, and the credit loss must be recognized in net income and the remaining portion of impairment must be recognized in other comprehensive income. For equity securities, impairment is considered to be other-than-temporary based on our ability and intent to hold the investment until a recovery of fair value. Other-than-temporary impairment of an equity security results in a write-down that must be included in net income. We regularly review each investment security for other-than-temporary impairment based on criteria that includes the extent to which cost exceeds market price, the duration of that market decline, the financial health of and specific prospects for the issuer, our best estimate of the present value of cash flows expected to be collected from debt securities, our intention with regard to holding the security to maturity and the likelihood that we would be required to sell the security before recovery.\nUnfunded Pension Liability\nThe Company previously maintained a non-contributory, defined benefit pension plan for eligible full-time employees as specified by the plan. The Company froze its pension plan to new participants and converted its pension plan to a cash balance plan effective December 31, 2009. Plan assets, which consist primarily of mutual funds invested in marketable equity securities and corporate and government fixed income securities, are valued using market quotations. The Company's actuary determines plan obligations and annual pension expense using a number of key assumptions. Key assumptions may include the discount rate, the interest crediting rate, the estimated future return on plan assets and the anticipated rate of future salary increases. Changes in these assumptions in the future, if any, or in the method under which benefits are calculated may impact pension assets, liabilities or expense.\nNON-GAAP PRESENTATIONS\nNon-GAAP presentations are provided because the Company believes these may be valuable to investors. These include (1) the analysis of net interest income presented on a taxable equivalent basis to facilitate performance comparisons among various taxable and tax-exempt assets and (2) the calculation of the efficiency ratio.\nThe efficiency ratio is calculated by dividing noninterest expense excluding gains or losses on the sale of other real estate owned (\"OREO\") by net interest income including tax equivalent income on nontaxable loans and securities and noninterest income and excluding (i) gains or losses on securities and (ii) gains or losses on sale of premises and equipment. The efficiency ratio for 2016, 2015, and 2014 was 61.47%, 63.81%, and 63.41%, respectively. The Company expects continued improvement in this ratio in 2017. This is a non-GAAP financial measure that the Company believes provides investors with important information regarding operational efficiency. Such information is not prepared in accordance with GAAP and should not be construed as such. Management believes, however, such financial information is meaningful to the reader in understanding operating performance, but cautions that such information not be viewed as a substitute for GAAP. The Company, in referring to its net income, is referring to income under GAAP. The components of the efficiency ratio calculation are summarized in the following table (dollars in thousands): Table 24: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Efficiency Ratio\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Noninterest expense\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>39,801\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>40,543\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>34,558\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Add/Subtract: loss/(gain) on sale OREO\n</td> <td>(228\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>99\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(2\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>39,573\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>40,642\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>34,556\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net interest income\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>49,854\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>49,265\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>41,725\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Tax equivalent adjustment\n</td> <td>1,846\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,088\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Noninterest income\n</td> <td>13,505\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>13,287\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11,176\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Subtract: gain on securities\n</td> <td>(836\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(867\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(505\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Add/Subtract: (gain)/loss on sale of fixed assets\n</td> <td>9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(11\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>64,378\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>63,688\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>54,494\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Efficiency ratio\n</td> <td>61.47\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>63.81\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>63.41\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nNet interest margin is calculated by dividing tax equivalent net interest income by total average earning assets. Because a portion of interest income earned by the Company is nontaxable, the tax equivalent net interest income is considered in the calculation of this ratio. Tax equivalent net interest income is calculated by adding the tax benefit realized from interest income that is nontaxable to total interest income then subtracting total interest expense. The tax rate utilized in calculating the tax benefit for 2016, 2015, and 2014 is 35%. The reconciliation of tax equivalent net interest income, which is not a measurement under GAAP, to net interest income, is reflected in the table below (in thousands):\nTable 25: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Reconciliation of Net Interest Income to Tax-Equivalent Net Interest Income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Non-GAAP measures:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest income - loans\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>48,224\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>46,985\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>39,298\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest income - investments and other\n</td> <td>9,792\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10,198\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10,245\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest expense - deposits\n</td> <td>(5,103\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(4,811\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(4,654\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest expense - customer repurchase agreements\n</td> <td>(5\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(9\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(7\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest expense - other short-term borrowings\n</td> <td>(5\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(2\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest expense - long-term borrowings\n</td> <td>(1,203\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1,084\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1,067\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total net interest income\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>51,700\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>51,279\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>43,813\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Less non-GAAP measures:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Tax benefit realized on non-taxable interest income - loans\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(253\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(125\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(41\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Tax benefit realized on non-taxable interest income - municipal securities\n</td> <td>(1,593\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1,889\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(2,047\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>GAAP measures\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>49,854\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>49,265\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>41,725\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nINTERNET ACCESS TO CORPORATE DOCUMENTS\nThe Company provides access to its SEC filings through a link on the Investor Relations page of the Company's website at www.amnb.com.

The merger of MainStreet with and into the Company was effected pursuant to the terms and conditions of the Agreement and Plan of Reorganization, dated as of August 24, 2014, between the Company and MainStreet. Immediately after the merger of MainStreet into the Company, Franklin Bank, MainStreet's wholly-owned bank subsidiary, merged with and into the Bank.\nPursuant to the MainStreet merger agreement, the former holders of shares of MainStreet common stock received $3.46 in cash and 0.482 shares of the Company's common stock for each share of MainStreet common stock held immediately prior to the effective date of the merger, plus cash in lieu of fractional shares. Each option to purchase shares of MainStreet common stock that was outstanding immediately prior to the effective date of the merger vested upon the merger and was converted into an option to purchase shares of the Company's common stock, adjusted based on a 0.643 exchange ratio. Each share of the Company's common stock outstanding immediately prior to the merger remained outstanding and was unaffected by the merger. The cash portion of the merger consideration was funded through a cash dividend of $6,000,000 from the Bank to the Company, and no borrowing was incurred by the Company or the Bank in connection with the merger.\nMainStreet was the holding company for Franklin Bank. Immediately prior to the Company's acquisition of MainStreet on January 1, 2015, MainStreet had net loans of approximately $122,000,000, total assets of approximately $164,000,000, and total deposits of approximately $137,000,000. Franklin Community Bank, N.A. provided banking services to its customers from three banking offices located in Rocky Mount, Hardy, and Union Hall, Virginia, which are now branch offices of the Bank.\nSTRATEGIC EVENT\nThe Company announced in September 2016 its plans to form a de novo branch in each of Roanoke, Virginia, and Winston-Salem, North Carolina. Initial staffing for Roanoke included fifteeen full-time equivalent employees. Initial staffing for Winston-Salem included five full-time equivalent employees. Initial operations from both offices impacted the fourth quarter of 2016 earning assets and operating results.\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nNet Income\nNet income for 2016 was $16,301,000 compared to $15,039,000 for 2015, an increase of $1,262,000 or 8.4%. Basic and diluted earnings per share were $1.89 for 2016 compared to $1.73 for 2015. This net income produced for 2016 a return on average assets of 1.02%, a return on average equity of 8.07%, and a return on average tangible equity of 10.85%.\nNet income for 2015 was $15,039,000 compared to $12,741,000 for 2014, an increase of $2,298,000 or 18.0%. Basic and diluted earnings per share were $1.73 for 2015 compared to $1.62 for 2014. This net income produced for 2015 a return on average assets of 0.99%, a return on average equity of 7.65%, and a return on average tangible equity of 10.62%.\nEarnings for 2016, 2015, and 2014 were favorably impacted by the 2011 acquisition of MidCarolina and the 2015 acquisition of MainStreet. The financial impact of the mergers was mostly a significant increase in earning assets.\nNet Interest Income\nNet interest income is the difference between interest income on earning assets, primarily loans and securities, and interest expense on interest bearing liabilities, primarily deposits. Fluctuations in interest rates as well as volume and mix changes in earning assets and interest bearing liabilities can materially impact net interest income. The 2011 acquisition of MidCarolina and the 2015 acquisition of MainStreet impacted net interest income positively for 2016 and 2015, through increased earning assets.\nThe following discussion of net interest income is presented on a taxable equivalent basis to facilitate performance comparisons among various taxable and tax-exempt assets, such as certain state and municipal securities. A tax rate of 35% was used in adjusting interest on tax-exempt assets to a fully taxable equivalent basis. Net interest income divided by average earning assets is referred to as the net interest margin. The net interest spread represents the difference between the average rate earned on earning assets and the average rate paid on interest bearing liabilities. All references in this section relate to average yields and rates and average asset and liability balances during the periods discussed.\nNet interest income on a taxable equivalent basis increased $421,000 or 0.8% in 2016 from 2015, following a $7,466,000 or 17.0% increase in 2015 from 2014. The increase in net interest income in 2016 was primarily due to increased volumes of earning assets related to organic growth.\nYields on loans were 4.54% in 2016 compared to 4.81% in 2015. Cost of funds was 0.60% in 2016 compared to 0.58% in 2015. Between 2016 and 2015, deposit rates for demand accounts increased to 0.05% from 0.04%, money market accounts increased to 0.18% from 0.13%, and time deposits increased to 1.14% from 1.09%. Management regularly reviews deposit pricing and attempts to keep costs as low as possible, while remaining competitive. The net interest margin was 3.52% for 2016, 3.69% for 2015, and 3.66% for 2014.\nDuring 2008, the Federal Open Market Committee (\"FOMC\") of the FRB reduced the federal funds rate seven times from 4.25% to 0.25%, where it remained, unchanged, through mid December 2015. On December 17, 2015, the FOMC raised the target federal funds rate from 0.25% to 0.50%. On December 15, 2016, the FOMC raised the target federal funds rate from 0.50% to 0.75%. The increase in rates is expected to have a nominal positive impact on net interest income. Given recent economic and geopolitical events in 2016 and early 2017, the federal funds rate may be higher at year end 2017, but there is considerable uncertainty as to how much higher it may be.\nNet interest income on a taxable equivalent basis increased $7,466,000 or 17.0% in 2015 from 2014, following a $4,819,000 or 9.9% decrease in 2014 from 2013. The increase in net interest income in 2015 was primarily due to increased volumes of earning assets and accretion income related to the MainStreet acquired loan portfolio, and accounted for $6,430,000 or 86% of the total increase.\nYields on loans were 4.81% in 2015 compared to 4.88% in 2014. Cost of funds was 0.58% in 2015 compared to 0.64% in 2014. Between 2015 and 2014, deposit rates for demand, money market, and savings accounts remained basically stable while time deposit rates decreased to 1.09% from 1.17%. Management regularly reviews deposit pricing and attempts to keep costs\nas low as possible, while remaining competitive. The net interest margin was 3.69% for 2015, 3.66% for 2014, and 4.10% for 2013.\nThe following presentation is an analysis of net interest income and related yields and rates, on a taxable equivalent basis, for the last three years. Nonaccrual loans are included in average balances. Interest income on nonaccrual loans, if recognized, is recorded on a cash basis or when the loan returns to accrual status.\nNet Interest Income Analysis\n(in thousands, except yields and

Trust income decreased for 2015 compared to 2014, largely related to the 2014 recognition of a one-time estate fee revenue of approximately $110,000. Trust income was not immediately impacted by the MainStreet acquisition. Service charge income was positively impacted by increases in overdraft and returned check fee income and higher fee income from debit card activity. These categories were higher based on larger transaction volume. Mortgage banking income was higher in 2015 based on greater loan demand volume in existing markets and the impact of the MainStreet acquisition. Secondary market mortgage loan volume for 2015 was $59,030,000 compared to $49,565,000 for 2014. Securities gains also increased, which related to the Company's decision to reduce its exposure to states with unusually large unfunded pension obligations and states sensitive to the large decline in the price of oil, notably Texas.

The major driver of this increase is additional compensation expense related to the de novo efforts in Roanoke, Virginia and Winston-Salem, North Carolina. The expense for FDIC assessment decreased in 2016 due to the reduction in FDIC assessment rates effective the third quarter of 2016. Other real estate owned expense includes gains and losses on sale of foreclosed properties, adjustments related to re-appraisals of foreclosed properties, and operating expenses related to maintaining foreclosed properties. It is inherently volatile from period to period. The change in other real estate owned expense during 2016 was primarily a result of the gain on the sale of one foreclosed property in the amount of $183,000 during 2015. The largest component of the decrease in noninterest expense in 2016 was the 2015 nonrecurring merger related expenses of $1,998,000.\nTable 31: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Years Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(Dollars in thousands)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$ Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>% Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Noninterest Expense:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Salaries\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>16,554\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>14,688\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,866\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12.7\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Employee benefits\n</td> <td>4,311\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,988\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,323\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>44.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Occupancy and equipment\n</td> <td>4,425\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,727\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>698\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>18.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> FDIC assessment\n</td> <td>750\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>647\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>103\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>15.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Bank franchise tax\n</td> <td>898\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>901\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(3\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>NM\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Core deposit intangible amortization\n</td> <td>1,201\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,114\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>87\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Data processing\n</td> <td>1,725\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,448\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>277\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>19.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Software\n</td> <td>1,158\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>139\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>13.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Other real estate owned, net\n</td> <td>99\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>240\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(141\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(58.8\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Merger related expenses\n</td> <td>1,998\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>780\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,218\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>156.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Other\n</td> <td>7,424\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7,006\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>418\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total noninterest expense\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>40,543\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>34,558\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>5,985\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>17.3\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>NM - Not meaningful\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nSalaries expense increased significantly in 2015 compared to 2014 primarily related to the MainStreet acquisition. The increase in salaries expense represents 31.2% of the total increase in noninterest expense between 2015 and 2014. Total full time equivalent employees increased to 303 in 2015 from 284 in 2014. Employee benefits were impacted by the acquisition and also increased health care and pension settlement expense. Data processing expense increased due to higher transaction volumes, increased usage of the Company's core information management system, and also a delay in the operational conversion for MainStreet from March to May 2015. Other real estate owned expense includes gains and losses on sale of foreclosed properties, adjustments related to re-appraisals of foreclosed properties, and operating expenses related to maintaining foreclosed properties. It is inherently volatile from period to period. Nonrecurring MainStreet acquisition related expenses represent 20.4% of the total increase in noninterest expense between 2015 and 2014.\nOREO expense, includes gains and losses on sale of foreclosed properties, adjustments related to re-appraisals of foreclosed properties, and operating expenses related to maintaining foreclosed properties.

The effective tax rate is lower than the statutory rate of 35% due to income that is not taxable for federal income tax purposes. The primary non-taxable income is that of state and municipal securities and loans. The increase in the effective tax rate is primarily related to a lower level of tax exempt municipal securities income.\nFair Value Impact to Pretax Income\nThe July 2011 merger with MidCarolina and the January 2015 merger with MainStreet had a material and positive impact on earnings. The ongoing financial impact of the mergers was mostly the result of the increase in earnings assets. However, the specific financial impact of the fair value related accounting adjustments is reflected in the following tables. The tables present the actual effect of the accretable and amortizable fair value adjustments attributable to the mergers on net interest income and pretax income for the years ended December 31,

In the context of acquiring a commercial bank, most of the balance sheet is interest rate sensitive and this can generate significant discounts or premiums to contractual values. These discounts or premiums will have potentially significant impact to net interest income and to net income.\nThe table below summarizes the impact of the fair value merger related accounting impact to net interest income and impact to pretax income of the MidCarolina (\"MC\") and MainStreet (\"MS\") acquisitions (dollars in thousands):\nTable 36: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>For the Years Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>MC\n</td> <td>MS\n</td> <td>Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>MC\n</td> <td>MS\n</td> <td>Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>MC\n</td> <td>MS\n</td> <td>Total\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net interest income\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,450\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>868\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,318\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,268\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>929\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,197\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,431\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,431\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Core deposit amortization\n</td> <td>(717\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>(247\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>(964\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(906\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>(295\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>(1,201\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(924\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(924\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total pretax income\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>733\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>621\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,354\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,362\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>634\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,996\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,507\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,507\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe MidCarolina acquisition was effective July 1, 2011. The MainStreet acquisition was effective January 1, 2015. Management expects that the fair value accounting financial impact of both acquisitions will continue to decline in subsequent quarters.\nImpact of Inflation and Changing Prices\nThe majority of assets and liabilities of a financial institution are monetary in nature and therefore differ greatly from most commercial and industrial companies that have significant investments in fixed assets or inventories. The most significant effect of inflation is on noninterest expenses that tend to rise during periods of inflation. Changes in interest rates have a greater impact on a financial institution's profitability than do the effects of higher costs for goods and services. Through its balance sheet management practices, the Company has the ability to react to those changes and measure and monitor its interest rate and liquidity risk.\nMarket Risk Management\nEffectively managing market risk is essential to achieving the Company's financial objectives. Market risk reflects the risk of economic loss resulting from changes in interest rates and market prices. The Company is generally not subject to currency exchange risk or commodity price risk. The Company's primary market risk exposure is interest rate risk; however, market risk also includes liquidity risk. Both are discussed in the following sections.\nInterest Rate Risk Management\nInterest rate risk and its impact on net interest income is a primary market risk exposure. The Company manages its exposure to fluctuations in interest rates through policies approved by its Asset Liability Committee (\"ALCO\") and Board of Directors, both of which receive and review periodic reports of the Company's interest rate risk position.\nThe Company uses computer simulation analysis to measure the sensitivity of projected earnings to changes in interest rates. Simulation takes into account current balance sheet volumes and the scheduled repricing dates, instrument level optionality, and maturities of assets and liabilities. It incorporates numerous assumptions including growth, changes in the mix of assets and liabilities, prepayments, and average rates earned and paid. Based on this information, management uses the model to project net interest income under multiple interest rate scenarios.\nA balance sheet is considered asset sensitive when its earning assets (loans and securities) reprice faster or to a greater extent than its liabilities (deposits and borrowings). An asset sensitive balance sheet will produce relatively more net interest income when interest rates rise and less net interest income when they decline. Based on the Company's simulation analysis, management believes the Company's interest sensitivity position at December 31, 2016 is asset sensitive. As of early 2017, management expects that the general direction of market interest rates will be stable to up, though volatility, sometimes substantial, is anticipated in the short-term.\nEarnings Simulation\nThe table below shows the estimated impact of changes in interest rates on net interest income as of December 31, 2016 (dollars in thousands), assuming gradual and parallel changes in interest rates, and consistent levels of assets and liabilities. Net interest income for the following twelve months is projected to increase when interest rates are higher than current rates.\nEstimated Changes in Net Interest Income\nTable 37: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>December 31, 2016\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Change in net interest income\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Change in interest rates\n</td> <td>Amount\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Percent\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Up 4.0%\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>6,565\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12.3\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Up 3.0%\n</td> <td>5,114\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Up 2.0%\n</td> <td>3,548\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Up 1.0%\n</td> <td>1,813\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Flat\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Down 0.25%\n</td> <td>(716\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1.3\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Down 0.50%\n</td> <td>(1,730\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(3.2\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nManagement cannot predict future interest rates or their exact effect on net interest income. Computations of future effects of hypothetical interest rate changes are based on numerous assumptions and should not be relied upon as indicative of actual results. Certain limitations are inherent in such computations. Assets and liabilities may react differently than projected to changes in market interest rates. The interest rates on certain types of assets and liabilities may fluctuate in advance of changes in market interest rates, while rates on other types of assets and liabilities may lag changes in market interest rates. Interest rate shifts may not be parallel.\nChanges in interest rates can cause substantial changes in the amount of prepayments of loans and mortgage-backed securities, which may in turn affect the Company's interest rate sensitivity position. Additionally, credit risk may rise if an interest rate increase adversely affects the ability of borrowers to service their debt.\nEconomic Value Simulation\nEconomic value simulation is used to calculate the estimated fair value of assets and liabilities over different interest rate environments. Economic values are calculated based on discounted cash flow analysis. The net economic value of equity is the economic value of all assets minus the economic value of all liabilities. The change in net economic value over different rate environments is an indication of the longer-term earnings capability of the balance sheet. The same assumptions are used in the economic value simulation as in the earnings simulation. The economic value simulation uses instantaneous rate shocks to the balance sheet.\nThe following table reflects the estimated change in net economic value over different rate environments using economic value simulation for the balances at the period ended December 31, 2016 (dollars in thousands):\nEstimated Changes in Economic Value of Equity\nTable 38: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>December 31, 2016\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Change in interest rates\n</td> <td>Amount\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$ Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>% Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Up 4%\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>272,633\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>40,063\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>17.2\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Up 3%\n</td> <td>271,710\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>39,140\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>16.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Up 2%\n</td> <td>267,298\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>34,728\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>14.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Up 1%\n</td> <td>255,244\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>22,674\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Flat\n</td> <td>232,570\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Down 0.25%\n</td> <td>224,551\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(8,019\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(3.4\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Down 0.50%\n</td> <td>215,626\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(16,944\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(7.3\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nLiquidity Risk Management\nLiquidity is the ability of the Company in a timely manner to convert assets into cash or cash equivalents without significant loss and to raise additional funds by increasing liabilities. Liquidity management involves maintaining the Company's ability to meet the daily cash flow requirements of its customers, whether they are borrowers requiring funds or depositors desiring to withdraw funds. Additionally, the Company requires cash for various operating needs including dividends to shareholders, the servicing of debt, and the payment of general corporate expenses. The Company manages its exposure to fluctuations in interest rates and liquidity needs through policies approved by the ALCO and Board of Directors, both of which receive periodic reports of the Company's interest rate risk and liquidity position. The Company uses a computer simulation model to assist in the management of the future liquidity needs of the Company.\nLiquidity sources include on balance sheet and off balance sheet sources.\nBalance sheet liquidity sources include cash, amounts due from banks, loan repayments, bond maturities and calls, and increases in deposits. Further, the Company maintains a large, high quality, very liquid bond portfolio, which is generally 50% to 60% unpledged and would, accordingly, be available for sale if necessary.\nOff balance sheet sources include lines of credit from the Federal Home Loan Bank of Atlanta (\"FHLB\"), federal funds lines of credit, and access to the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond's discount window.\nThe Company has a line of credit with the FHLB, equal to 30% of the Company's assets, subject to the amount of collateral pledged. Under the terms of its collateral agreement with the FHLB, the Company provides a blanket lien covering all of its residential first mortgage loans, home equity lines of credit, commercial real estate loans and commercial construction loans. In addition, the Company pledges as collateral its capital stock in and deposits with the FHLB. At December 31, 2016, principal advance obligations to the FHLB consisted of $9,980,000 in fixed-rate, long-term advances and $20,000,000 in variable-rate, short-term advances compared to $9,958,000 in long-term advances and no short-term advances at December 31, 2015. The Company also had outstanding $130,700,000 in letters of credit at December 31, 2016 compared to $70,700,000 in letters of credit at December 31, 2015. The letters of credit provide the Bank with additional collateral for securing public entity deposits above FDIC insurance levels, thereby providing less need for collateral pledging from the securities portfolio and accordingly increasing our balance sheet liquidity.\nShort-term borrowing is discussed in Note 10 and long-term borrowing is discussed in Note 11 of the Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Item 8 of this Form 10-K.\nThe Company has federal funds lines of credit established with two correspondent banks in the amounts of $15,000,000 each and has access to the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond's discount window. There were no amounts outstanding under these facilities at December 31, 2016. The Company, through its subsidiary bank, has a relationship with Promontory Network, the sponsoring entity for the Certificate of Deposit Account Registry Service\u00ae (\"CDARS\"). Through CDARS, the Company is able to provide deposit customers with access to aggregate FDIC insurance in amounts far exceeding $250,000. This gives the Company the ability, as and when needed, to attract and retain large deposits from insurance sensitive customers. CDARS are classified as brokered deposits, however they are generally derived from customers with whom our institution has or wishes to have a direct and ongoing core deposit relationship. As a result, management considers these deposits functionally, though not technically, in the same category as core deposits. With CDARS, the Company has the option to keep deposits on balance sheet or sell them to other members of the network. Additionally, subject to certain limits, the Company can use CDARS to purchase\ncost-effective funding without collateralization and in lieu of generating funds through traditional brokered CDs or the FHLB. Thus, CDARS serves as a deposit-gathering tool and an additional liquidity management tool. Deposits through the CDARS program as of December 31, 2016 and 2015 were $23,445,000 and $23,633,000, respectively.\nThe Bank also participates with the Promontory Network using Insured Cash Sweep\u00ae, a product which provides the Bank the capability of providing additional deposit insurance to customers in the context of a money market account arrangement. The product is analogous to the CDARS product discussed above.\nManagement believes that these sources provide sufficient and timely liquidity, both on and off balance sheet.\nBALANCE SHEET ANALYSIS\nSecurities\nThe securities portfolio generates income, plays a strategic role in the management of interest rate sensitivity, provides a source of liquidity, and is used to meet collateral requirements. The securities portfolio consists of high quality investments, mostly federal agency, mortgage-backed, and state and municipal securities.\nThe Company is cognizant of the continuing historically low and recently volatile interest rate environment and has elected to maintain a defensive asset liability strategy of purchasing high quality taxable securities of relatively short duration and somewhat longer term tax exempt securities, whose market values are not as volatile in rising rate environments as similar termed taxable investments. The Company is aware that possible changes in corporate tax rates could have a negative impact on our municipal portfolio valuation.\nThe following table presents information on the amortized cost, maturities, and taxable equivalent yields of securities at the end of the last three years (dollars in thousands):\nTable 39: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>

preferred stock was converted to common stock. At December 31, 2016, the Company had two common stock investments, neither of which was paying dividends, with a total amortized cost of $1,288,000.\nLoans\nThe loan portfolio consists primarily of commercial and residential real estate loans, commercial loans to small and medium-sized businesses, construction and land development loans, and home equity loans.\nAverage loans increased $87,417,000 or 9.0% from 2015 to 2016. Average loans increased $171,001,000 or 21.2% from 2014 to 2015, mostly impacted by the MainStreet merger.\nAt December 31, 2016, total loans were $1,164,821,000, an increase of $159,296,000 or 15.8% from the prior year. The increase is the result of broad based organic loan growth and the de novo branch start-ups in Roanoke, Virginia and Winston-Salem, North Carolina.\nLoans held for sale totaled $5,996,000 at December 31, 2016 and $3,266,000 at December 31, 2015. Loan production volume was $78,330,000 and $59,030,000 for 2016 and 2015, respectively.

Improvements in asset quality were apparent in declines in past due and nonaccrual loans, as well as, in qualitative factors for asset quality and economic conditions, which were somewhat offset by additional factors assigned to unseasoned loans in new markets. The larger provision expense in 2015 related to the increase in organic loan growth and the relatively rapid maturities and renewals of the performing acquired loan portfolio of MainStreet and their resulting transfer to the regular loan portfolio.\nAllowance for Loan Losses\nThe purpose of the ALLL is to provide for probable losses inherent in the loan portfolio. The allowance is increased by the provision for loan losses and by recoveries of previously charged-off loans. Loan charge-offs decrease the allowance.\nThe ALLL was $12,801,000, $12,601,000, and $12,427,000 at December 31, 2016, 2015, and 2014, respectively. The ALLL as a percentage of loans at each of those dates were 1.10%, 1.25%, and 1.48%, respectively.\nThe decrease in the allowance as a percentage of loans during 2016 was primarily due to continued high asset quality, low charge offs, and improvement in various qualitative factors, notably economic and legal, used in the determination of the allowance. The decrease in the allowance as a percentage of loans during 2015 was primarily impacted by the January 2015 acquisition of MainStreet.\nIn an effort to better evaluate the adequacy of its ALLL, the Company computes its ASC 450, Contingencies, loan balance by reducing total loans by acquired loans and loans that were evaluated for impairment individually or smaller balance nonaccrual loans evaluated for impairment in homogeneous pools. It also adjusts its ASC 450 loan loss reserve balance total by removing allowances associated with these other pools of loans.\nThe general allowance, ASC 450 (FAS 5) reserves to ASC 450 loans, was 1.17% at December 31, 2016, compared to 1.40% at December 31, 2015. On a dollar basis, the reserve was $12,429,000 at December 31, 2016, compared to $12,159,000 at December 31, 2015. The percentage of the reserve to total loans has declined due to improving local and national economic conditions and continued improvement in asset quality metrics. This segment of the allowance represents by far the largest portion of the loan portfolio and the largest aggregate risk.\nThe specific allowance, ASC 310-40 (FAS 114) reserves to ASC 310-40 loans, was 0.47% at December 31, 2016, compared to 1.17% at December 31, 2015. On a dollar basis, the reserve was $23,000 at December 31, 2016, compared to $35,000 at December 31, 2015. The decrease in the dollar amount of the reserve was related to changes in characteristics of\nloans reviewed individually for impairment and charge-offs of specific reserves in 2016 that were recorded in the prior year. There is ongoing turnover in the composition of the impaired loan population, which increased $137,000 over December 31, 2015.\nThe specific allowance does not include reserves related to acquired loans with deteriorated credit quality. This reserve was $349,000 at December 31, 2016, compared to $407,000 at December 31, 2015. This is the only portion of the reserve related to acquired loans. Cash flow expectations for these loans are reviewed on a quarterly basis and unfavorable changes in those estimates relative to the initial estimates can result in the need for specific loan loss provision.\nThe following table presents the Company's loan loss and recovery experience for the past five years (dollars in thousands):\nSummary of Loan Loss Experience\nTable 45: <table><tr><td>

at year end.\nNonperforming Assets (Loans and Other Real Estate Owned)\nNonperforming loans include loans on which interest is no longer accrued and accruing loans that are contractually past due 90 days or more. Nonperforming loans include loans originated and loans acquired.\nNonperforming loans to total loans were 0.30% at December 31, 2016 compared to 0.52% at December 31, 2015. The decrease in nonperforming loans during 2016 was $1,653,000.\nNonperforming assets include nonperforming loans and foreclosed real estate. Nonperforming assets represented 0.29% at December 31, 2016 compared to 0.48% of total assets at December 31, 2015.\nIn most cases, it is the policy of the Company that any loan that becomes 90 days past due will automatically be placed on nonaccrual loan status, accrued interest reversed out of income, and further interest accrual ceased. Any payments received on such loans will be credited to principal. In some cases a loan in process of renewal may become 90 days past due. In these instances the loan may still be accruing because of a delayed renewal process in which the customer has not been billed. In accounting for acquired impaired loans, such loans are not classified as nonaccrual when they become 90 days past due. They are considered to be accruing because their interest income relates to the accretable yield and not to contractual interest payments.\nLoans will only be restored to full accrual status after six consecutive months of payments that were each less than 30 days delinquent. The Company strictly adheres with this policy before restoring a loan to normal accrual status.\nThe following table presents the Company's nonperforming asset history, including acquired impaired loans as of the dates indicated (dollars in thousands):\nNonperforming Assets\nTable 48: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>As of December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2013\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2012\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Nonaccrual loans:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Real estate\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,928\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>5,022\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>4,111\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>5,060\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>5,261\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Commercial\n</td> <td>19\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>90\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>52\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Agricultural\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Consumer\n</td> <td>18\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total nonaccrual loans\n</td> <td>2,965\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5,114\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,112\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5,071\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5,316\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Loans past due 90 days and accruing interest:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Real estate\n</td> <td>587\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>84\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Commercial\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Agricultural\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Consumer\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total past due loans\n</td> <td>587\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>91\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total nonperforming loans\n</td> <td>3,552\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5,205\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,112\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5,071\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5,316\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other real estate owned, net\n</td> <td>1,328\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,184\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,119\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,422\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6,193\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total nonperforming assets\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>4,880\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>7,389\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>6,231\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>8,493\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>11,509\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nImpaired Loans\nA loan is considered impaired when, based on current information and events, it is probable that the Company will be unable to collect the scheduled payments of principal or interest when due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement.

Foreclosed assets are initially recorded at fair value, less estimated costs to sell, at the date of foreclosure. Loan losses resulting from foreclosure are charged against the ALLL at that time. Subsequent to foreclosure, valuations are periodically performed by management and the assets are carried at the lower of the new cost basis or fair value, less estimated costs to sell with any additional write-downs charged against earnings. For significant assets, these valuations are typically outside annual appraisals.

Average deposits increased $68,844,000 or 5.6% in 2016, after increasing $179,669,000 or 17.1% in 2015. The increase in 2015 was primarily related to the MainStreet acquisition.\nPeriod-end total deposits increased $107,980,000 or 8.6% during 2016. The increase was primarily related to steady growth in core deposits, which is consistent with the Company's asset liability strategy. The Company has only a relatively small portion of its time deposits provided by wholesale sources. These include brokered time deposits, of which there were none at year end 2016, 2015, and 2014, and time deposits through the CDARS program, which at year end totaled $23,445,000 for 2016, $23,633,000 for 2015, and $22,255,000 for 2014. Management considers the CDARS deposits the functional, though not regulatory, equivalent of core deposits, because they relate to balances derived from customers with long standing relationships with the Company.\nAverage deposits and rates for the years indicated (dollars in thousands):\nDeposits\nTable 51: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Average\nBalance\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Rate\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Average\nBalance\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Rate\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Average\nBalance\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Rate\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Noninterest bearing deposits\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>330,315\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>297,483\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>234,149\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest bearing accounts:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>NOW accounts\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>216,521\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.05\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>223,825\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.04\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>183,994\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.04\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Money market\n</td> <td>239,262\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.18\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>196,828\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.13\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>177,046\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.13\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Savings\n</td> <td>118,144\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.04\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>109,697\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.05\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>88,629\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.05\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Time\n</td> <td>396,801\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.14\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>404,366\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.09\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>368,712\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.17\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total interest bearing deposits\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>970,728\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.53\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>934,716\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.51\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>818,381\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.57\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Average total deposits\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,301,043\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.40\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,232,199\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.39\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,052,530\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.44\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nCertificates of Deposit of $100,000 or More\nCertificates of deposit at December 31, 2016 in amounts of $100,000 or more were classified by maturity as follows (dollars in thousands):\nTable 52: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>December 31, 2016\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>3 months or less\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>50,256\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Over 3 through 6 months\n</td> <td>12,636\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Over 6 through 12 months\n</td> <td>29,221\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Over 12 months\n</td> <td>152,271\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>244,384\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nCertificates of Deposit of $250,000 or More\nCertificates of deposit at December 31, 2016 in amounts of $250,000 or more were classified by maturity as follows (dollars in thousands):\nTable 53: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>December 31, 2016\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>3 months or less\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>18,704\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Over 3 through 6 months\n</td> <td>4,653\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Over 6 through 12 months\n</td> <td>12,391\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Over 12 months\n</td> <td>106,779\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>142,527\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nBorrowed Funds\nIn addition to internal deposit generation, the Company also relies on borrowed funds as a supplemental source of funding. Borrowed funds consist of customer repurchase agreements, overnight borrowings from the FHLB and longer-term FHLB advances, and trust preferred capital notes. Customer repurchase agreements are borrowings collateralized by securities of the U.S. Government, its agencies, or Government Sponsored Enterprises (\"GSEs\") and generally mature daily. The Company considers these accounts to be a stable and low cost source of funds. The securities underlying these agreements remain under the Company's control.

At December 31, 2016, the Bank's public deposits totaled $207,740,000. The Company is legally required to provide collateral to secure the deposits that exceed the insurance coverage provided by the FDIC. This collateral\ncan be provided in the form of certain types of government agency bonds or letters of credit from the FHLB. At year-end 2016, the Company had $130,000,000 in letters of credit with the FHLB outstanding to supplement collateral for such deposits.\nShareholders' Equity\nThe Company's goal with capital management is to be classified as \"well capitalized\" under regulatory capital ratios and to support growth, while generating acceptable returns on equity and paying a high rate of dividends.\nShareholders' equity was $201,380,000 at December 31, 2016 and $197,835,000 at December 31, 2015.\nThe Company declared and paid quarterly dividends totaling $0.96 per share for 2016, $0.93 per share for 2015, and $0.92 per share for 2014. Cash dividends in 2016 totaled $8,266,000 and represented a 50.7% payout of 2016 net income, compared to a 53.6% payout in 2015, and a 56.8% payout in 2014.\nIn July 2013, the FRB issued final rules that make technical changes to its capital rules to align them with the Basel III regulatory capital framework and meet certain requirements of the Dodd-Frank Act. The final rules maintain the general structure of the prompt corrective action framework in effect at such time while incorporating certain increased minimum requirements. Effective January 1, 2015, the final rules require the Company and the Bank to comply with the following minimum capital ratios: (i) a new common equity Tier 1 capital ratio of 4.5% of risk-weighted assets; (ii) a Tier 1 capital ratio of 6.0% of risk-weighted assets (increased from the prior requirement of 4.0%); (iii) a total capital ratio of 8.0% of risk-weighted assets (unchanged from the prior requirement); and (iv) a leverage ratio of 4.0% of total assets (unchanged from the prior requirement). These are the initial capital requirements, which will be phased in over a four-year period. When fully phased in on January 1, 2019, the rules will require the Company and the Bank to maintain such minimum ratios plus a 2.5% \"capital conservation buffer\" (other than for the leverage ratio). The phase in of the capital conservation buffer requirement began on January 1, 2016, at 0.625% of risk-weighted assets, increasing by the same amount each year until fully implemented at 2.5% on January 1, 2019. Management believes the Company and the Bank will be compliant with the fully phased-in requirements when they become effective January 1, 2019.\nThe following table represents the major regulatory capital ratios for the Company as of the dates indicated:\nTable 55: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>As of December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2013\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2012\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Risk-Based Capital Ratios:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Common equity tier 1 capital ratio\n</td> <td>11.77\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12.88\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>NA\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>NA\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>NA\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Tier 1 capital ratio\n</td> <td>13.83\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>15.23\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>16.59\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>16.88\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>15.75\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total capital ratio\n</td> <td>14.81\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>16.34\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>17.86\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>18.14\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>17.00\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Leverage Capital Ratios:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Tier 1 leverage ratio\n</td> <td>11.67\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12.05\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12.16\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11.81\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11.27\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nManagement believes the Company and the Bank meet the requirements to be considered \"well capitalized\" for all regulatory capital ratios as of December 31, 2016 and 2015.\nStock Repurchase Programs\nIn years prior to 2014 the Company had, in the normal course of business, operated certain stock repurchase programs. Authority to repurchase shares under these programs had been expired for some time.\nOn April 17, 2014, the Company filed a Form 8-K with the SEC to announce the approval by its Board of Directors (the \"Board\") of a stock repurchase program. The program authorized the repurchase of up to 250,000 shares of the Company's common stock over a two year period. The share purchase limit was established at such number of shares equal to approximately 3% of the 7,900,000 common shares then outstanding at the time the Board approved the program.\nOn November 19, 2015, the Company filed a Form 8-K with the SEC to announce the approval by its Board of another stock repurchase program. The program authorizes the repurchase of up to 300,000 shares of the Company's common stock over a two year period. The share purchase limit was established at such number of shares equal to approximately 3.5% of the 8,622,000 common shares then outstanding at the time the Board approved the program.\nDuring 2016, the Company repurchased 51,384 shares at an average cost of $25.14 per share, for a total cost of $1,292,000. In 2015, the Company repurchased 150,656 shares at an average cost of $23.27 per share, for a total cost of $3,506,000.\nCONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS\nThe following items are contractual obligations of the Company as of December 31, 2016 (dollars in thousands):\nTable 56: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Payments Due By Period\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Under 1 Year\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1-3 Years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3-5 Years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>More than 5 years\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Time deposits\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>378,855\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>160,219\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>89,170\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>124,759\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>4,707\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Repurchase agreements\n</td> <td>39,166\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>39,166\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>FHLB borrowings\n</td> <td>29,980\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>20,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9,980\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating leases\n</td> <td>1,755\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>878\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>806\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>49\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>22\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Junior subordinated debt\n</td> <td>27,724\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>27,724\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOFF-BALANCE SHEET ACTIVITIES\nThe Company enters into certain financial transactions in the ordinary course of performing traditional banking services that result in off-balance sheet transactions. Other than AMNB Statutory Trust I, formed in 2006 to issue trust preferred securities, and the MidCarolina Trust I and MidCarolina Trust II, the Company does not have any off-balance sheet subsidiaries. Refer to Note 12 of the Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Item 8 of this Form 10-K for a discussion of junior subordinated debt. Off-balance sheet transactions were as follows as of the dates indicated (dollars in thousands):\nTable 57: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Off-Balance Sheet Commitments\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Commitments to extend credit\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>345,803\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>301,360\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Standby letters of credit\n</td> <td>4,088\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,286\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Mortgage loan rate-lock commitments\n</td> <td>12,839\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5,365\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTotal off-balance sheet transaction volume increased significantly due to the demand from the de novo branches in Roanoke, Virginia and Winston-Salem, North Carolina.\nCommitments to extend credit to customers represent legally binding agreements with fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses. Since many of the commitments are expected to expire without being funded, the total commitment amounts do not necessarily represent future funding requirements. Standby letters of credit are conditional commitments issued by the Company guaranteeing the performance of a customer to a third party. Those guarantees are primarily issued to support public and private borrowing arrangements.", "item_7_truncated": "ITEM 7 - MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe purpose of this discussion is to focus on significant changes in the financial condition and results of operations of the Company during the past three years. The discussion and analysis are intended to supplement and highlight information contained in the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements and the selected financial data presented elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nRECLASSIFICATION\nIn certain circumstances, reclassifications have been made to prior period information to conform to the 2016 presentation. There were no material reclassifications.\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES\nThe accounting and reporting policies followed by the Company conform with GAAP and they conform to general practices within the banking industry. The Company's critical accounting policies, which are summarized below, relate to (1) the allowance for loan losses, (2) mergers and acquisitions, (3) acquired loans with specific credit-related deterioration, (4) goodwill and intangible assets, (5) other real estate owned, (6) deferred tax assets and liabilities, (7) other-than-temporary impairment of securities and (8) the unfunded pension liability. A summary of the Company's significant accounting policies is set forth in Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nThe financial information contained within the Company's financial statements is, to a significant extent, financial information that is based on measures of the financial effects of transactions and events that have already occurred. A variety of factors could affect the ultimate value that is obtained when earning income, recognizing an expense, recovering an asset, or relieving a liability. In addition, GAAP itself may change from one previously acceptable method to another method.\nAllowance for Loan Losses\nThe purpose of the allowance for loan losses (\"ALLL\") is to provide for probable losses inherent in the loan portfolio. The allowance is increased by the provision for loan losses and by recoveries of previously charged-off loans. Loan charge-offs decrease the allowance.\nThe goal of the Company is to maintain an appropriate, systematic, and consistently applied process to determine the amounts of the ALLL and the provision for loan loss expense.\nThe Company uses certain practices to manage its credit risk. These practices include (1) appropriate lending limits for loan officers, (2) a loan approval process, (3) careful underwriting of loan requests, including analysis of borrowers, cash flows, collateral, and market risks, (4) regular monitoring of the portfolio, including diversification by type and geography, (5) review of loans by the Loan Review department, which operates independently of loan production (the Loan Review function consists of a co-sourced arrangement using both internal personnel and external vendors to provide the Company with a more robust review function of the loan portfolio), (6) regular meetings of the Credit Committee to discuss portfolio and policy changes and make decisions on large or unusual loan requests, and (7) regular meetings of the Asset Quality Committee which reviews the status of individual loans.\nRisk grades are assigned as part of the loan origination process. From time to time, risk grades may be modified as warranted by the facts and circumstances surrounding the credit.\nCalculation and analysis of the ALLL is prepared quarterly by the Finance Department. The Company's Credit Committee, Capital Management Committee, Audit Committee, and the Board of Directors review the allowance for adequacy.\nThe Company's ALLL has two basic components: the formula allowance and the specific allowance. Each of these components is determined based upon estimates and judgments.\nThe formula allowance uses historical loss experience as an indicator of future losses, along with various qualitative factors, including levels and trends in delinquencies, nonaccrual loans, charge-offs and recoveries, trends in volume and terms of loans, effects of changes in underwriting standards, experience of lending staff, economic conditions, and portfolio concentrations, regulatory, legal, competition, quality of loan review system, and value of underlying collateral. In the formula allowance for commercial and commercial real estate loans, the historical loss rate is combined with the qualitative factors, resulting in an adjusted loss factor for each risk-grade category of loans. The period-end balances for each loan risk-grade category are multiplied by the adjusted loss factor. Allowance calculations for residential real estate and consumer loans are calculated based on historical losses for each product category without regard to risk grade. This loss rate is combined with qualitative factors resulting in an adjusted loss factor for each product category.\nThe specific allowance uses various techniques to arrive at an estimate of loss for specifically identified impaired loans. These include:\n \u2022 The present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan's effective interest rate. The effective interest rate on a loan is the rate of return implicit in the loan (that is, the contractual interest rate adjusted for any net deferred loan fees or costs and any premium or discount existing at the origination or acquisition of the loan); \n \u2022 The loan's observable market price, or \n \u2022 The fair value of the collateral, net of estimated costs to dispose, if the loan is collateral dependent. \nThe use of these computed values is inherently subjective and actual losses could be greater or less than the estimates.\nNo single statistic, formula, or measurement determines the adequacy of the allowance. Management makes subjective and complex judgments about matters that are inherently uncertain, and different amounts would be reported under different conditions or using different assumptions. For analytical purposes, management allocates a portion of the allowance to specific loan categories and specific loans. However, the entire allowance is used to absorb credit losses inherent in the loan portfolio, including identified and unidentified losses.\nThe relationships and ratios used in calculating the allowance, including the qualitative factors, may change from period to period as facts and circumstances evolve. Furthermore, management cannot provide assurance that in any particular period the Bank will not have sizeable credit losses in relation to the amount reserved. Management may find it necessary to significantly adjust the allowance, considering current factors at the time.\nMergers and Acquisitions\nBusiness combinations are accounted for under the Financial Accounting Standards Board (the \"FASB\") Accounting Standards Codification (\"ASC\") 805, Business Combinations, using the acquisition method of accounting. The acquisition method of accounting requires an acquirer to recognize the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed at the acquisition date measured at their fair values as of that date. To determine the fair values, the Company will rely on third party valuations, such as appraisals, or internal valuations based on discounted cash flow analysis or other valuation techniques. Under the acquisition method of accounting, the Company will identify the acquirer and the closing date and apply applicable recognition principles and conditions.\nAcquisition-related costs are costs the Company incurs to effect a business combination. Those costs include advisory, legal, accounting, valuation, and other professional or consulting fees. Some other examples of costs to the Company include systems conversions, integration planning, consultants, and advertising costs. The Company will account for acquisition-related costs as expenses in the periods in which the costs are incurred and the services are received, with one exception. The costs to issue debt or equity securities will be recognized in accordance with other applicable GAAP. These acquisition-related costs have been and will be included within the Consolidated Statements of Income classified within the noninterest expense caption.\nAcquired Loans with Specific Credit-Related Deterioration\nAcquired loans with specific credit deterioration are accounted for by the Company in accordance with FASB ASC 310-30, Receivables - Loans and Debt Securities Acquired with Deteriorated Credit Quality. Certain acquired loans, those for which specific credit-related deterioration, since origination, is identified, are recorded at fair value reflecting the present value of the amounts expected to be collected. Income recognition on these loans is based on a reasonable expectation about the timing and amount of cash flows to be collected. Acquired loans deemed impaired and considered collateral dependent, with the timing of the sale of loan collateral indeterminate, remain on non-accrual status and have no accretable yield.\nGoodwill and Intangible Assets\nThe Company follows ASC 350, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, which prescribes the accounting for goodwill and intangible assets subsequent to initial recognition. Goodwill resulting from business combinations prior to January 1, 2009 represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net assets of businesses acquired. Goodwill resulting from business combinations after January 1, 2009 is generally determined as the excess of the fair value of the consideration transferred, plus the fair value of any noncontrolling interests in the acquiree, over the fair value of the net assets acquired and liabilities assumed as of the acquisition date. Goodwill and intangible assets acquired in a purchase business combination and determined to have an indefinite useful life are not amortized, but tested for impairment at least annually or more frequently if events and circumstances exists that indicate that a goodwill impairment test should be performed. The Company has selected June 30 as the date to perform the annual impairment test. Intangible assets with definite useful lives are amortized over their estimated useful lives, which range from 8.25 to 10 years, to their estimated residual values. Goodwill is the only intangible asset with an indefinite life on the Company's consolidated balance sheets. No indicators of impairment were identified during the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015, and 2014.\nOther Real Estate Owned\nAssets acquired through, or in lieu of, loan foreclosure are held for sale and are initially recorded at fair value less costs to sell at the date of foreclosure. Subsequent to foreclosure, management periodically performs valuations of the foreclosed assets based on updated appraisals, general market conditions, recent sales of similar properties, length of time the properties have been held, and our ability and intention with regard to continued ownership of the properties. The Company may incur additional write-downs of foreclosed assets to fair value less costs to sell if valuations indicate a further deterioration in market conditions.\nDeferred Tax Assets and Liabilities\nThe realization of deferred income tax assets is assessed and a valuation allowance is recorded if it is more likely than not\u201d that all or a portion of the deferred tax asset will not be realized. More likely than not\u201d is defined as greater than a 50% chance. Management considers all available evidence, both positive and negative, to determine whether, based on the weight of that evidence, a valuation allowance is needed.\nOther-than-temporary Impairment of Securities\nImpairment of securities occurs when the fair value of a security is less than its amortized cost. For debt securities, impairment is considered other-than-temporary and recognized in its entirety in net income if either (i) we intend to sell the security or (ii) it is more-likely-than-not that we will be required to sell the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis. If, however, we do not intend to sell the security and it is not more-likely-than-not that we will be required to sell the security before recovery, we must determine what portion of the impairment is attributable to a credit loss, which occurs when the amortized cost basis of the security exceeds the present value of the cash flows expected to be collected from the security. If there is no credit loss, there is no other-than-temporary impairment. If there is a credit loss, other-than-temporary impairment exists, and the credit loss must be recognized in net income and the remaining portion of impairment must be recognized in other comprehensive income. For equity securities, impairment is considered to be other-than-temporary based on our ability and intent to hold the investment until a recovery of fair value. Other-than-temporary impairment of an equity security results in a write-down that must be included in net income. We regularly review each investment security for other-than-temporary impairment based on criteria that includes the extent to which cost exceeds market price, the duration of that market decline, the financial health of and specific prospects for the issuer, our best estimate of the present value of cash flows expected to be collected from debt securities, our intention with regard to holding the security to maturity and the likelihood that we would be required to sell the security before recovery.\nUnfunded Pension Liability\nThe Company previously maintained a non-contributory, defined benefit pension plan for eligible full-time employees as specified by the plan. The Company froze its pension plan to new participants and converted its pension plan to a cash balance plan effective December 31, 2009. Plan assets, which consist primarily of mutual funds invested in marketable equity securities and corporate and government fixed income securities, are valued using market quotations. The Company's actuary determines plan obligations and annual pension expense using a number of key assumptions. Key assumptions may include the discount rate, the interest crediting rate, the estimated future return on plan assets and the anticipated rate of future salary increases. Changes in these assumptions in the future, if any, or in the method under which benefits are calculated may impact pension assets, liabilities or expense.\nNON-GAAP PRESENTATIONS\nNon-GAAP presentations are provided because the Company believes these may be valuable to investors. These include (1) the analysis of net interest income presented on a taxable equivalent basis to facilitate performance comparisons among various taxable and tax-exempt assets and (2) the calculation of the efficiency ratio.\nThe efficiency ratio is calculated by dividing noninterest expense excluding gains or losses on the sale of other real estate owned (\"OREO\") by net interest income including tax equivalent income on nontaxable loans and securities and noninterest income and excluding (i) gains or losses on securities and (ii) gains or losses on sale of premises and equipment. The efficiency ratio for 2016, 2015, and 2014 was 61.47%, 63.81%, and 63.41%, respectively. The Company expects continued improvement in this ratio in 2017. This is a non-GAAP financial measure that the Company believes provides investors with important information regarding operational efficiency. Such information is not prepared in accordance with GAAP and should not be construed as such. Management believes, however, such financial information is meaningful to the reader in understanding operating performance, but cautions that such information not be viewed as a substitute for GAAP. The Company, in referring to its net income, is referring to income under GAAP. The components of the efficiency ratio calculation are summarized in the following table (dollars in thousands): Table 24: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Efficiency Ratio\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Noninterest expense\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>39,801\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>40,543\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>34,558\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Add/Subtract: loss/(gain) on sale OREO\n</td> <td>(228\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>99\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(2\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>39,573\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>40,642\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>34,556\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net interest income\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>49,854\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>49,265\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>41,725\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Tax equivalent adjustment\n</td> <td>1,846\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,088\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Noninterest income\n</td> <td>13,505\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>13,287\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11,176\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Subtract: gain on securities\n</td> <td>(836\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(867\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(505\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Add/Subtract: (gain)/loss on sale of fixed assets\n</td> <td>9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(11\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>64,378\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>63,688\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>54,494\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Efficiency ratio\n</td> <td>61.47\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>63.81\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>63.41\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nNet interest margin is calculated by dividing tax equivalent net interest income by total average earning assets. Because a portion of interest income earned by the Company is nontaxable, the tax equivalent net interest income is considered in the calculation of this ratio. Tax equivalent net interest income is calculated by adding the tax benefit realized from interest income that is nontaxable to total interest income then subtracting total interest expense. The tax rate utilized in calculating the tax benefit for 2016, 2015, and 2014 is 35%. The reconciliation of tax equivalent net interest income, which is not a measurement under GAAP, to net interest income, is reflected in the table below (in thousands):\nTable 25: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Reconciliation of Net Interest Income to Tax-Equivalent Net Interest Income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Non-GAAP measures:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest income - loans\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>48,224\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>46,985\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>39,298\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest income - investments and other\n</td> <td>9,792\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10,198\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10,245\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest expense - deposits\n</td> <td>(5,103\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(4,811\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(4,654\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest expense - customer repurchase agreements\n</td> <td>(5\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(9\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(7\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest expense - other short-term borrowings\n</td> <td>(5\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(2\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest expense - long-term borrowings\n</td> <td>(1,203\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1,084\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1,067\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total net interest income\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>51,700\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>51,279\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>43,813\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Less non-GAAP measures:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Tax benefit realized on non-taxable interest income - loans\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(253\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(125\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(41\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Tax benefit realized on non-taxable interest income - municipal securities\n</td> <td>(1,593\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1,889\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(2,047\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>GAAP measures\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>49,854\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>49,265\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>41,725\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nINTERNET ACCESS TO CORPORATE DOCUMENTS\nThe Company provides access to its SEC filings through a link on the Investor Relations page of the Company's website at www.amnb.com.

The merger of MainStreet with and into the Company was effected pursuant to the terms and conditions of the Agreement and Plan of Reorganization, dated as of August 24, 2014, between the Company and MainStreet. Immediately after the merger of MainStreet into the Company, Franklin Bank, MainStreet's wholly-owned bank subsidiary, merged with and into the Bank.\nPursuant to the MainStreet merger agreement, the former holders of shares of MainStreet common stock received $3.46 in cash and 0.482 shares of the Company's common stock for each share of MainStreet common stock held immediately prior to the effective date of the merger, plus cash in lieu of fractional shares. Each option to purchase shares of MainStreet common stock that was outstanding immediately prior to the effective date of the merger vested upon the merger and was converted into an option to purchase shares of the Company's common stock, adjusted based on a 0.643 exchange ratio. Each share of the Company's common stock outstanding immediately prior to the merger remained outstanding and was unaffected by the merger. The cash portion of the merger consideration was funded through a cash dividend of $6,000,000 from the Bank to the Company, and no borrowing was incurred by the Company or the Bank in connection with the merger.\nMainStreet was the holding company for Franklin Bank. Immediately prior to the Company's acquisition of MainStreet on January 1, 2015, MainStreet had net loans of approximately $122,000,000, total assets of approximately $164,000,000, and total deposits of approximately $137,000,000. Franklin Community Bank, N.A. provided banking services to its customers from three banking offices located in Rocky Mount, Hardy, and Union Hall, Virginia, which are now branch offices of the Bank.\nSTRATEGIC EVENT\nThe Company announced in September 2016 its plans to form a de novo branch in each of Roanoke, Virginia, and Winston-Salem, North Carolina. Initial staffing for Roanoke included fifteeen full-time equivalent employees. Initial staffing for Winston-Salem included five full-time equivalent employees. Initial operations from both offices impacted the fourth quarter of 2016 earning assets and operating results.\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nNet Income\nNet income for 2016 was $16,301,000 compared to $15,039,000 for 2015, an increase of $1,262,000 or 8.4%. Basic and diluted earnings per share were $1.89 for 2016 compared to $1.73 for 2015. This net income produced for 2016 a return on average assets of 1.02%, a return on average equity of 8.07%, and a return on average tangible equity of 10.85%.\nNet income for 2015 was $15,039,000 compared to $12,741,000 for 2014, an increase of $2,298,000 or 18.0%. Basic and diluted earnings per share were $1.73 for 2015 compared to $1.62 for 2014. This net income produced for 2015 a return on average assets of 0.99%, a return on average equity of 7.65%, and a return on average tangible equity of 10.62%.\nEarnings for 2016, 2015, and 2014 were favorably impacted by the 2011 acquisition of MidCarolina and the 2015 acquisition of MainStreet. The financial impact of the mergers was mostly a significant increase in earning assets.\nNet Interest Income\nNet interest income is the difference between interest income on earning assets, primarily loans and securities, and interest expense on interest bearing liabilities, primarily deposits. Fluctuations in interest rates as well as volume and mix changes in earning assets and interest bearing liabilities can materially impact net interest income. The 2011 acquisition of MidCarolina and the 2015 acquisition of MainStreet impacted net interest income positively for 2016 and 2015, through increased earning assets.\nThe following discussion of net interest income is presented on a taxable equivalent basis to facilitate performance comparisons among various taxable and tax-exempt assets, such as certain state and municipal securities. A tax rate of 35% was used in adjusting interest on tax-exempt assets to a fully taxable equivalent basis. Net interest income divided by average earning assets is referred to as the net interest margin. The net interest spread represents the difference between the average rate earned on earning assets and the average rate paid on interest bearing liabilities. All references in this section relate to average yields and rates and average asset and liability balances during the periods discussed.\nNet interest income on a taxable equivalent basis increased $421,000 or 0.8% in 2016 from 2015, following a $7,466,000 or 17.0% increase in 2015 from 2014. The increase in net interest income in 2016 was primarily due to increased volumes of earning assets related to organic growth.\nYields on loans were 4.54% in 2016 compared to 4.81% in 2015. Cost of funds was 0.60% in 2016 compared to 0.58% in 2015. Between 2016 and 2015, deposit rates for demand accounts increased to 0.05% from 0.04%, money market accounts increased to 0.18% from 0.13%, and time deposits increased to 1.14% from 1.09%. Management regularly reviews deposit pricing and attempts to keep costs as low as possible, while remaining competitive. The net interest margin was 3.52% for 2016, 3.69% for 2015, and 3.66% for 2014.\nDuring 2008, the Federal Open Market Committee (\"FOMC\") of the FRB reduced the federal funds rate seven times from 4.25% to 0.25%, where it remained, unchanged, through mid December 2015. On December 17, 2015, the FOMC raised the target federal funds rate from 0.25% to 0.50%. On December 15, 2016, the FOMC raised the target federal funds rate from 0.50% to 0.75%. The increase in rates is expected to have a nominal positive impact on net interest income. Given recent economic and geopolitical events in 2016 and early 2017, the federal funds rate may be higher at year end 2017, but there is considerable uncertainty as to how much higher it may be.\nNet interest income on a taxable equivalent basis increased $7,466,000 or 17.0% in 2015 from 2014, following a $4,819,000 or 9.9% decrease in 2014 from 2013. The increase in net interest income in 2015 was primarily due to increased volumes of earning assets and accretion income related to the MainStreet acquired loan portfolio, and accounted for $6,430,000 or 86% of the total increase.\nYields on loans were 4.81% in 2015 compared to 4.88% in 2014. Cost of funds was 0.58% in 2015 compared to 0.64% in 2014. Between 2015 and 2014, deposit rates for demand, money market, and savings accounts remained basically stable while time deposit rates decreased to 1.09% from 1.17%. Management regularly reviews deposit pricing and attempts to keep costs\nas low as possible, while remaining competitive. The net interest margin was 3.69% for 2015, 3.66% for 2014, and 4.10% for 2013.\nThe following presentation is an analysis of net interest income and related yields and rates, on a taxable equivalent basis, for the last three years. Nonaccrual loans are included in average balances. Interest income on nonaccrual loans, if recognized, is recorded on a cash basis or when the loan returns to accrual status.\nNet Interest Income Analysis\n(in thousands, except yields and

Trust income decreased for 2015 compared to 2014, largely related to the 2014 recognition of a one-time estate fee revenue of approximately $110,000. Trust income was not immediately impacted by the MainStreet acquisition. Service charge income was positively impacted by increases in overdraft and returned check fee income and higher fee income from debit card activity. These categories were higher based on larger transaction volume. Mortgage banking income was higher in 2015 based on greater loan demand volume in existing markets and the impact of the MainStreet acquisition. Secondary market mortgage loan volume for 2015 was $59,030,000 compared to $49,565,000 for 2014. Securities gains also increased, which related to the Company's decision to reduce its exposure to states with unusually large unfunded pension obligations and states sensitive to the large decline in the price of oil, notably Texas.

The major driver of this increase is additional compensation expense related to the de novo efforts in Roanoke, Virginia and Winston-Salem, North Carolina. The expense for FDIC assessment decreased in 2016 due to the reduction in FDIC assessment rates effective the third quarter of 2016. Other real estate owned expense includes gains and losses on sale of foreclosed properties, adjustments related to re-appraisals of foreclosed properties, and operating expenses related to maintaining foreclosed properties. It is inherently volatile from period to period. The change in other real estate owned expense during 2016 was primarily a result of the gain on the sale of one foreclosed property in the amount of $183,000 during 2015.

The effective tax rate is lower than the statutory rate of 35% due to income that is not taxable for federal income tax purposes. The primary non-taxable income is that of state and municipal securities and loans. The increase in the effective tax rate is primarily related to a lower level of tax exempt municipal securities income.\nFair Value Impact to Pretax Income\nThe July 2011 merger with MidCarolina and the January 2015 merger with MainStreet had a material and positive impact on earnings.

In the context of acquiring a commercial bank, most of the balance sheet is interest rate sensitive and this can generate significant discounts or premiums to contractual values. These discounts or premiums will have potentially significant impact to net interest income and to net income.\nThe table below summarizes the impact of the fair value merger related accounting impact to net interest income and impact to pretax income of the MidCarolina (\"MC\") and MainStreet (\"MS\") acquisitions (dollars in thousands):\nTable 36: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>For the Years Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>MC\n</td> <td>MS\n</td> <td>Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>MC\n</td> <td>MS\n</td> <td>Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>MC\n</td> <td>MS\n</td> <td>Total\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net interest income\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,450\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>868\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,318\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,268\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>929\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,197\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,431\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,431\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Core deposit amortization\n</td> <td>(717\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>(247\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>(964\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(906\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>(295\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>(1,201\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(924\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(924\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total pretax income\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>733\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>621\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,354\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,362\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>634\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,996\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,507\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,507\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe MidCarolina acquisition was effective July 1, 2011. The MainStreet acquisition was effective January 1, 2015. Management expects that the fair value accounting financial impact of both acquisitions will continue to decline in subsequent quarters.\nImpact of Inflation and Changing Prices\nThe majority of assets and liabilities of a financial institution are monetary in nature and therefore differ greatly from most commercial and industrial companies that have significant investments in fixed assets or inventories. The most significant effect of inflation is on noninterest expenses that tend to rise during periods of inflation. Changes in interest rates have a greater impact on a financial institution's profitability than do the effects of higher costs for goods and services. Through its balance sheet management practices, the Company has the ability to react to those changes and measure and monitor its interest rate and liquidity risk.\nMarket Risk Management\nEffectively managing market risk is essential to achieving the Company's financial objectives. Market risk reflects the risk of economic loss resulting from changes in interest rates and market prices. The Company is generally not subject to currency exchange risk or commodity price risk. The Company's primary market risk exposure is interest rate risk; however, market risk also includes liquidity risk. Both are discussed in the following sections.\nInterest Rate Risk Management\nInterest rate risk and its impact on net interest income is a primary market risk exposure. The Company manages its exposure to fluctuations in interest rates through policies approved by its Asset Liability Committee (\"ALCO\") and Board of Directors, both of which receive and review periodic reports of the Company's interest rate risk position.\nThe Company uses computer simulation analysis to measure the sensitivity of projected earnings to changes in interest rates. Simulation takes into account current balance sheet volumes and the scheduled repricing dates, instrument level optionality, and maturities of assets and liabilities. It incorporates numerous assumptions including growth, changes in the mix of assets and liabilities, prepayments, and average rates earned and paid. Based on this information, management uses the model to project net interest income under multiple interest rate scenarios.\nA balance sheet is considered asset sensitive when its earning assets (loans and securities) reprice faster or to a greater extent than its liabilities (deposits and borrowings). An asset sensitive balance sheet will produce relatively more net interest income when interest rates rise and less net interest income when they decline. Based on the Company's simulation analysis, management believes the Company's interest sensitivity position at December 31, 2016 is asset sensitive. As of early 2017, management expects that the general direction of market interest rates will be stable to up, though volatility, sometimes substantial, is anticipated in the short-term.\nEarnings Simulation\nThe table below shows the estimated impact of changes in interest rates on net interest income as of December 31, 2016 (dollars in thousands), assuming gradual and parallel changes in interest rates, and consistent levels of assets and liabilities. Net interest income for the following twelve months is projected to increase when interest rates are higher than current rates.\nEstimated Changes in Net Interest Income\nTable 37: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>December 31, 2016\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Change in net interest income\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Change in interest rates\n</td> <td>Amount\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Percent\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Up 4.0%\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>6,565\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12.3\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Up 3.0%\n</td> <td>5,114\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Up 2.0%\n</td> <td>3,548\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Up 1.0%\n</td> <td>1,813\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Flat\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Down 0.25%\n</td> <td>(716\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1.3\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Down 0.50%\n</td> <td>(1,730\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(3.2\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nManagement cannot predict future interest rates or their exact effect on net interest income. Computations of future effects of hypothetical interest rate changes are based on numerous assumptions and should not be relied upon as indicative of actual results. Certain limitations are inherent in such computations. Assets and liabilities may react differently than projected to changes in market interest rates. The interest rates on certain types of assets and liabilities may fluctuate in advance of changes in market interest rates, while rates on other types of assets and liabilities may lag changes in market interest rates. Interest rate shifts may not be parallel.\nChanges in interest rates can cause substantial changes in the amount of prepayments of loans and mortgage-backed securities, which may in turn affect the Company's interest rate sensitivity position. Additionally, credit risk may rise if an interest rate increase adversely affects the ability of borrowers to service their debt.\nEconomic Value Simulation\nEconomic value simulation is used to calculate the estimated fair value of assets and liabilities over different interest rate environments. Economic values are calculated based on discounted cash flow analysis. The net economic value of equity is the economic value of all assets minus the economic value of all liabilities. The change in net economic value over different rate environments is an indication of the longer-term earnings capability of the balance sheet. The same assumptions are used in the economic value simulation as in the earnings simulation. The economic value simulation uses instantaneous rate shocks to the balance sheet.\nThe following table reflects the estimated change in net economic value over different rate environments using economic value simulation for the balances at the period ended December 31, 2016 (dollars in thousands):\nEstimated Changes in Economic Value of Equity\nTable 38: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>December 31, 2016\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Change in interest rates\n</td> <td>Amount\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$ Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>% Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Up 4%\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>272,633\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>40,063\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>17.2\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Up 3%\n</td> <td>271,710\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>39,140\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>16.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Up 2%\n</td> <td>267,298\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>34,728\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>14.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Up 1%\n</td> <td>255,244\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>22,674\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Flat\n</td> <td>232,570\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Down 0.25%\n</td> <td>224,551\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(8,019\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(3.4\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Down 0.50%\n</td> <td>215,626\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(16,944\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(7.3\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nLiquidity Risk Management\nLiquidity is the ability of the Company in a timely manner to convert assets into cash or cash equivalents without significant loss and to raise additional funds by increasing liabilities. Liquidity management involves maintaining the Company's ability to meet the daily cash flow requirements of its customers, whether they are borrowers requiring funds or depositors desiring to withdraw funds. Additionally, the Company requires cash for various operating needs including dividends to shareholders, the servicing of debt, and the payment of general corporate expenses. The Company manages its exposure to fluctuations in interest rates and liquidity needs through policies approved by the ALCO and Board of Directors, both of which receive periodic reports of the Company's interest rate risk and liquidity position. The Company uses a computer simulation model to assist in the management of the future liquidity needs of the Company.\nLiquidity sources include on balance sheet and off balance sheet sources.\nBalance sheet liquidity sources include cash, amounts due from banks, loan repayments, bond maturities and calls, and increases in deposits. Further, the Company maintains a large, high quality, very liquid bond portfolio, which is generally 50% to 60% unpledged and would, accordingly, be available for sale if necessary.\nOff balance sheet sources include lines of credit from the Federal Home Loan Bank of Atlanta (\"FHLB\"), federal funds lines of credit, and access to the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond's discount window.\nThe Company has a line of credit with the FHLB, equal to 30% of the Company's assets, subject to the amount of collateral pledged. Under the terms of its collateral agreement with the FHLB, the Company provides a blanket lien covering all of its residential first mortgage loans, home equity lines of credit, commercial real estate loans and commercial construction loans. In addition, the Company pledges as collateral its capital stock in and deposits with the FHLB. At December 31, 2016, principal advance obligations to the FHLB consisted of $9,980,000 in fixed-rate, long-term advances and $20,000,000 in variable-rate, short-term advances compared to $9,958,000 in long-term advances and no short-term advances at December 31, 2015. The Company also had outstanding $130,700,000 in letters of credit at December 31, 2016 compared to $70,700,000 in letters of credit at December 31, 2015. The letters of credit provide the Bank with additional collateral for securing public entity deposits above FDIC insurance levels, thereby providing less need for collateral pledging from the securities portfolio and accordingly increasing our balance sheet liquidity.\nShort-term borrowing is discussed in Note 10 and long-term borrowing is discussed in Note 11 of the Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Item 8 of this Form 10-K.\nThe Company has federal funds lines of credit established with two correspondent banks in the amounts of $15,000,000 each and has access to the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond's discount window. There were no amounts outstanding under these facilities at December 31, 2016. The Company, through its subsidiary bank, has a relationship with Promontory Network, the sponsoring entity for the Certificate of Deposit Account Registry Service\u00ae (\"CDARS\"). Through CDARS, the Company is able to provide deposit customers with access to aggregate FDIC insurance in amounts far exceeding $250,000. This gives the Company the ability, as and when needed, to attract and retain large deposits from insurance sensitive customers. CDARS are classified as brokered deposits, however they are generally derived from customers with whom our institution has or wishes to have a direct and ongoing core deposit relationship. As a result, management considers these deposits functionally, though not technically, in the same category as core deposits. With CDARS, the Company has the option to keep deposits on balance sheet or sell them to other members of the network. Additionally, subject to certain limits, the Company can use CDARS to purchase\ncost-effective funding without collateralization and in lieu of generating funds through traditional brokered CDs or the FHLB. Thus, CDARS serves as a deposit-gathering tool and an additional liquidity management tool. Deposits through the CDARS program as of December 31, 2016 and 2015 were $23,445,000 and $23,633,000, respectively.\nThe Bank also participates with the Promontory Network using Insured Cash Sweep\u00ae, a product which provides the Bank the capability of providing additional deposit insurance to customers in the context of a money market account arrangement. The product is analogous to the CDARS product discussed above.\nManagement believes that these sources provide sufficient and timely liquidity, both on and off balance sheet.\nBALANCE SHEET ANALYSIS\nSecurities\nThe securities portfolio generates income, plays a strategic role in the management of interest rate sensitivity, provides a source of liquidity, and is used to meet collateral requirements. The securities portfolio consists of high quality investments, mostly federal agency, mortgage-backed, and state and municipal securities.\nThe Company is cognizant of the continuing historically low and recently volatile interest rate environment and has elected to maintain a defensive asset liability strategy of purchasing high quality taxable securities of relatively short duration and somewhat longer term tax exempt securities, whose market values are not as volatile in rising rate environments as similar termed taxable investments. The Company is aware that possible changes in corporate tax rates could have a negative impact on our municipal portfolio valuation.\nThe following table presents information on the amortized cost, maturities, and taxable equivalent yields of securities at the end of the last three years (dollars in thousands):\nTable 39: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>

These lessees and lessors are engaged in a variety of industries.\nThe following table presents the maturity schedule of selected loan types (dollars in thousands):\nMaturities of Selected Loan Types\nDecember 31, 2016\nTable 42: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Commercial\nand\nIndustrial (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Construction\nand Land\nDevelopment\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Total\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>1 year or less\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>47,940\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>26,657\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>74,597\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>1 to 5 years (2)\n</td> <td>111,506\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>56,134\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>167,640\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>After 5 years (2)\n</td> <td>49,271\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>31,467\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>80,738\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>208,717\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>114,258\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>322,975\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n (1) Includes agricultural loans. \n (2) Of the loans due after one year, $147,520 have predetermined interest rates and $100,858 have floating or adjustable interest rates.  Provision for Loan Losses\nThe provision for loan losses was $250,000, $950,000, and $400,000 for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015, and 2014, respectively.\nThe smaller provision expense in 2016 related to improvement in various qualitative factors, notably asset quality, local economic conditions and continued decline in historical loss factors. Improvements in asset quality were apparent in declines in past due and nonaccrual loans, as well as, in qualitative factors for asset quality and economic conditions, which were somewhat offset by additional factors assigned to unseasoned loans in new markets. The larger provision expense in 2015 related to the increase in organic loan growth and the relatively rapid maturities and renewals of the performing acquired loan portfolio of MainStreet and their resulting transfer to the regular loan portfolio.\nAllowance for Loan Losses\nThe purpose of the ALLL is to provide for probable losses inherent in the loan portfolio. The allowance is increased by the provision for loan losses and by recoveries of previously charged-off loans. Loan charge-offs decrease the allowance.\nThe ALLL was $12,801,000, $12,601,000, and $12,427,000 at December 31, 2016, 2015, and 2014, respectively. The ALLL as a percentage of loans at each of those dates were 1.10%, 1.25%, and 1.48%, respectively.\nThe decrease in the allowance as a percentage of loans during 2016 was primarily due to continued high asset quality, low charge offs, and improvement in various qualitative factors, notably economic and legal, used in the determination of the allowance. The decrease in the allowance as a percentage of loans during 2015 was primarily impacted by the January 2015 acquisition of MainStreet.\nIn an effort to better evaluate the adequacy of its ALLL, the Company computes its ASC 450, Contingencies, loan balance by reducing total loans by acquired loans and loans that were evaluated for impairment individually or smaller balance nonaccrual loans evaluated for impairment in homogeneous pools. It also adjusts its ASC 450 loan loss reserve balance total by removing allowances associated with these other pools of loans.\nThe general allowance, ASC 450 (FAS 5) reserves to ASC 450 loans, was 1.17% at December 31, 2016, compared to 1.40% at December 31, 2015. On a dollar basis, the reserve was $12,429,000 at December 31, 2016, compared to $12,159,000 at December 31, 2015. The percentage of the reserve to total loans has declined due to improving local and national economic conditions and continued improvement in asset quality metrics. This segment of the allowance represents by far the largest portion of the loan portfolio and the largest aggregate risk.\nThe specific allowance, ASC 310-40 (FAS 114) reserves to ASC 310-40 loans, was 0.47% at December 31, 2016, compared to 1.17% at December 31, 2015. On a dollar basis, the reserve was $23,000 at December 31, 2016, compared to $35,000 at December 31, 2015. The decrease in the dollar amount of the reserve was related to changes in characteristics of\nloans reviewed individually for impairment and charge-offs of specific reserves in 2016 that were recorded in the prior year. There is ongoing turnover in the composition of the impaired loan population, which increased $137,000 over December 31, 2015.\nThe specific allowance does not include reserves related to acquired loans with deteriorated credit quality. This reserve was $349,000 at December 31, 2016, compared to $407,000 at December 31, 2015. This is the only portion of the reserve related to acquired loans. Cash flow expectations for these loans are reviewed on a quarterly basis and unfavorable changes in those estimates relative to the initial estimates can result in the need for specific loan loss provision.\nThe following table presents the Company's loan loss and recovery experience for the past five years (dollars in thousands):\nSummary of Loan Loss Experience\nTable 45: <table><tr><td>

Nonperforming loans include loans originated and loans acquired.\nNonperforming loans to total loans were 0.30% at December 31, 2016 compared to 0.52% at December 31, 2015. The decrease in nonperforming loans during 2016 was $1,653,000.\nNonperforming assets include nonperforming loans and foreclosed real estate. Nonperforming assets represented 0.29% at December 31, 2016 compared to 0.48% of total assets at December 31, 2015.\nIn most cases, it is the policy of the Company that any loan that becomes 90 days past due will automatically be placed on nonaccrual loan status, accrued interest reversed out of income, and further interest accrual ceased. Any payments received on such loans will be credited to principal. In some cases a loan in process of renewal may become 90 days past due. In these instances the loan may still be accruing because of a delayed renewal process in which the customer has not been billed. In accounting for acquired impaired loans, such loans are not classified as nonaccrual when they become 90 days past due. They are considered to be accruing because their interest income relates to the accretable yield and not to contractual interest payments.\nLoans will only be restored to full accrual status after six consecutive months of payments that were each less than 30 days delinquent. The Company strictly adheres with this policy before restoring a loan to normal accrual status.\nThe following table presents the Company's nonperforming asset history, including acquired impaired loans as of the dates indicated (dollars in thousands):\nNonperforming Assets\nTable 48: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>As of December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2013\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2012\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Nonaccrual loans:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Real estate\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,928\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>5,022\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>4,111\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>5,060\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>5,261\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Commercial\n</td> <td>19\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>90\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>52\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Agricultural\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Consumer\n</td> <td>18\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total nonaccrual loans\n</td> <td>2,965\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5,114\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,112\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5,071\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5,316\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Loans past due 90 days and accruing interest:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Real estate\n</td> <td>587\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>84\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Commercial\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Agricultural\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Consumer\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total past due loans\n</td> <td>587\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>91\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total nonperforming loans\n</td> <td>3,552\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5,205\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,112\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5,071\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5,316\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other real estate owned, net\n</td> <td>1,328\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,184\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,119\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,422\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6,193\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total nonperforming assets\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>4,880\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>7,389\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>6,231\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>8,493\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>11,509\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nImpaired Loans\nA loan is considered impaired when, based on current information and events, it is probable that the Company will be unable to collect the scheduled payments of principal or interest when due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement.

Foreclosed assets are initially recorded at fair value, less estimated costs to sell, at the date of foreclosure. Loan losses resulting from foreclosure are charged against the ALLL at that time. Subsequent to foreclosure, valuations are periodically performed by management and the assets are carried at the lower of the new cost basis or fair value, less estimated costs to sell with any additional write-downs charged against earnings. For significant assets, these valuations are typically outside annual appraisals.

Average deposits increased $68,844,000 or 5.6% in 2016, after increasing $179,669,000 or 17.1% in 2015. The increase in 2015 was primarily related to the MainStreet acquisition.\nPeriod-end total deposits increased $107,980,000 or 8.6% during 2016. The increase was primarily related to steady growth in core deposits, which is consistent with the Company's asset liability strategy. The Company has only a relatively small portion of its time deposits provided by wholesale sources. These include brokered time deposits, of which there were none at year end 2016, 2015, and 2014, and time deposits through the CDARS program, which at year end totaled $23,445,000 for 2016, $23,633,000 for 2015, and $22,255,000 for 2014. Management considers the CDARS deposits the functional, though not regulatory, equivalent of core deposits, because they relate to balances derived from customers with long standing relationships with the Company.\nAverage deposits and rates for the years indicated (dollars in thousands):\nDeposits\nTable 51: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Average\nBalance\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Rate\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Average\nBalance\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Rate\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Average\nBalance\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Rate\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Noninterest bearing deposits\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>330,315\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>297,483\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>234,149\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest bearing accounts:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>NOW accounts\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>216,521\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.05\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>223,825\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.04\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>183,994\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.04\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Money market\n</td> <td>239,262\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.18\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>196,828\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.13\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>177,046\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.13\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Savings\n</td> <td>118,144\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.04\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>109,697\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.05\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>88,629\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.05\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Time\n</td> <td>396,801\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.14\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>404,366\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.09\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>368,712\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.17\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total interest bearing deposits\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>970,728\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.53\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>934,716\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.51\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>818,381\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.57\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Average total deposits\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,301,043\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.40\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,232,199\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.39\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,052,530\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.44\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nCertificates of Deposit of $100,000 or More\nCertificates of deposit at December 31, 2016 in amounts of $100,000 or more were classified by maturity as follows (dollars in thousands):\nTable 52: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>December 31, 2016\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>3 months or less\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>50,256\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Over 3 through 6 months\n</td> <td>12,636\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Over 6 through 12 months\n</td> <td>29,221\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Over 12 months\n</td> <td>152,271\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>244,384\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nCertificates of Deposit of $250,000 or More\nCertificates of deposit at December 31, 2016 in amounts of $250,000 or more were classified by maturity as follows (dollars in thousands):\nTable 53: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>December 31, 2016\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>3 months or less\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>18,704\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Over 3 through 6 months\n</td> <td>4,653\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Over 6 through 12 months\n</td> <td>12,391\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Over 12 months\n</td> <td>106,779\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>142,527\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nBorrowed Funds\nIn addition to internal deposit generation, the Company also relies on borrowed funds as a supplemental source of funding. Borrowed funds consist of customer repurchase agreements, overnight borrowings from the FHLB and longer-term FHLB advances, and trust preferred capital notes. Customer repurchase agreements are borrowings collateralized by securities of the U.S. Government, its agencies, or Government Sponsored Enterprises (\"GSEs\") and generally mature daily. The Company considers these accounts to be a stable and low cost source of funds. The securities underlying these agreements remain under the Company's control.

At December 31, 2016, the Bank's public deposits totaled $207,740,000. The Company is legally required to provide collateral to secure the deposits that exceed the insurance coverage provided by the FDIC. This collateral\ncan be provided in the form of certain types of government agency bonds or letters of credit from the FHLB. At year-end 2016, the Company had $130,000,000 in letters of credit with the FHLB outstanding to supplement collateral for such deposits.\nShareholders' Equity\nThe Company's goal with capital management is to be classified as \"well capitalized\" under regulatory capital ratios and to support growth, while generating acceptable returns on equity and paying a high rate of dividends.\nShareholders' equity was $201,380,000 at December 31, 2016 and $197,835,000 at December 31, 2015.\nThe Company declared and paid quarterly dividends totaling $0.96 per share for 2016, $0.93 per share for 2015, and $0.92 per share for 2014. Cash dividends in 2016 totaled $8,266,000 and represented a 50.7% payout of 2016 net income, compared to a 53.6% payout in 2015, and a 56.8% payout in 2014.\nIn July 2013, the FRB issued final rules that make technical changes to its capital rules to align them with the Basel III regulatory capital framework and meet certain requirements of the Dodd-Frank Act. The final rules maintain the general structure of the prompt corrective action framework in effect at such time while incorporating certain increased minimum requirements. Effective January 1, 2015, the final rules require the Company and the Bank to comply with the following minimum capital ratios: (i) a new common equity Tier 1 capital ratio of 4.5% of risk-weighted assets; (ii) a Tier 1 capital ratio of 6.0% of risk-weighted assets (increased from the prior requirement of 4.0%); (iii) a total capital ratio of 8.0% of risk-weighted assets (unchanged from the prior requirement); and (iv) a leverage ratio of 4.0% of total assets (unchanged from the prior requirement). These are the initial capital requirements, which will be phased in over a four-year period. When fully phased in on January 1, 2019, the rules will require the Company and the Bank to maintain such minimum ratios plus a 2.5% \"capital conservation buffer\" (other than for the leverage ratio). The phase in of the capital conservation buffer requirement began on January 1, 2016, at 0.625% of risk-weighted assets, increasing by the same amount each year until fully implemented at 2.5% on January 1, 2019. Management believes the Company and the Bank will be compliant with the fully phased-in requirements when they become effective January 1, 2019.\nThe following table represents the major regulatory capital ratios for the Company as of the dates indicated:\nTable 55: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>As of December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2013\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2012\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Risk-Based Capital Ratios:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Common equity tier 1 capital ratio\n</td> <td>11.77\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12.88\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>NA\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>NA\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>NA\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Tier 1 capital ratio\n</td> <td>13.83\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>15.23\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>16.59\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>16.88\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>15.75\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total capital ratio\n</td> <td>14.81\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>16.34\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>17.86\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>18.14\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>17.00\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Leverage Capital Ratios:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Tier 1 leverage ratio\n</td> <td>11.67\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12.05\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12.16\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11.81\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11.27\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nManagement believes the Company and the Bank meet the requirements to be considered \"well capitalized\" for all regulatory capital ratios as of December 31, 2016 and 2015.\nStock Repurchase Programs\nIn years prior to 2014 the Company had, in the normal course of business, operated certain stock repurchase programs. Authority to repurchase shares under these programs had been expired for some time.\nOn April 17, 2014, the Company filed a Form 8-K with the SEC to announce the approval by its Board of Directors (the \"Board\") of a stock repurchase program. The program authorized the repurchase of up to 250,000 shares of the Company's common stock over a two year period. The share purchase limit was established at such number of shares equal to approximately 3% of the 7,900,000 common shares then outstanding at the time the Board approved the program.\nOn November 19, 2015, the Company filed a Form 8-K with the SEC to announce the approval by its Board of another stock repurchase program. The program authorizes the repurchase of up to 300,000 shares of the Company's common stock over a two year period. The share purchase limit was established at such number of shares equal to approximately 3.5% of the 8,622,000 common shares then outstanding at the time the Board approved the program.\nDuring 2016, the Company repurchased 51,384 shares at an average cost of $25.14 per share, for a total cost of $1,292,000. In 2015, the Company repurchased 150,656 shares at an average cost of $23.27 per share, for a total cost of $3,506,000.\nCONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS\nThe following items are contractual obligations of the Company as of December 31, 2016 (dollars in thousands):\nTable 56: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Payments Due By Period\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Under 1 Year\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1-3 Years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3-5 Years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>More than 5 years\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Time deposits\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>378,855\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>160,219\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>89,170\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>124,759\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>4,707\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Repurchase agreements\n</td> <td>39,166\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>39,166\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>FHLB borrowings\n</td> <td>29,980\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>20,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9,980\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating leases\n</td> <td>1,755\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>878\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>806\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>49\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>22\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Junior subordinated debt\n</td> <td>27,724\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>27,724\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOFF-BALANCE SHEET ACTIVITIES\nThe Company enters into certain financial transactions in the ordinary course of performing traditional banking services that result in off-balance sheet transactions. Other than AMNB Statutory Trust I, formed in 2006 to issue trust preferred securities, and the MidCarolina Trust I and MidCarolina Trust II, the Company does not have any off-balance sheet subsidiaries. Refer to Note 12 of the Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Item 8 of this Form 10-K for a discussion of junior subordinated debt. Off-balance sheet transactions were as follows as of the dates indicated (dollars in thousands):\nTable 57: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Off-Balance Sheet Commitments\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Commitments to extend credit\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>345,803\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>301,360\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Standby letters of credit\n</td> <td>4,088\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,286\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Mortgage loan rate-lock commitments\n</td> <td>12,839\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5,365\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTotal off-balance sheet transaction volume increased significantly due to the demand from the de novo branches in Roanoke, Virginia and Winston-Salem, North Carolina.\nCommitments to extend credit to customers represent legally binding agreements with fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses. Since many of the commitments are expected to expire without being funded, the total commitment amounts do not necessarily represent future funding requirements. Standby letters of credit are conditional commitments issued by the Company guaranteeing the performance of a customer to a third party. Those guarantees are primarily issued to support public and private borrowing arrangements.", "item_7_text": "ITEM 7 - MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe purpose of this discussion is to focus on significant changes in the financial condition and results of operations of the Company during the past three years. The discussion and analysis are intended to supplement and highlight information contained in the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements and the selected financial data presented elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nRECLASSIFICATION\nIn certain circumstances, reclassifications have been made to prior period information to conform to the 2016 presentation. There were no material reclassifications.\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES\nThe accounting and reporting policies followed by the Company conform with GAAP and they conform to general practices within the banking industry. The Company's critical accounting policies, which are summarized below, relate to (1) the allowance for loan losses, (2) mergers and acquisitions, (3) acquired loans with specific credit-related deterioration, (4) goodwill and intangible assets, (5) other real estate owned, (6) deferred tax assets and liabilities, (7) other-than-temporary impairment of securities and (8) the unfunded pension liability. A summary of the Company's significant accounting policies is set forth in Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nThe financial information contained within the Company's financial statements is, to a significant extent, financial information that is based on measures of the financial effects of transactions and events that have already occurred. A variety of factors could affect the ultimate value that is obtained when earning income, recognizing an expense, recovering an asset, or relieving a liability. In addition, GAAP itself may change from one previously acceptable method to another method.\nAllowance for Loan Losses\nThe purpose of the allowance for loan losses (\"ALLL\") is to provide for probable losses inherent in the loan portfolio. The allowance is increased by the provision for loan losses and by recoveries of previously charged-off loans. Loan charge-offs decrease the allowance.\nThe goal of the Company is to maintain an appropriate, systematic, and consistently applied process to determine the amounts of the ALLL and the provision for loan loss expense.\nThe Company uses certain practices to manage its credit risk. These practices include (1) appropriate lending limits for loan officers, (2) a loan approval process, (3) careful underwriting of loan requests, including analysis of borrowers, cash flows, collateral, and market risks, (4) regular monitoring of the portfolio, including diversification by type and geography, (5) review of loans by the Loan Review department, which operates independently of loan production (the Loan Review function consists of a co-sourced arrangement using both internal personnel and external vendors to provide the Company with a more robust review function of the loan portfolio), (6) regular meetings of the Credit Committee to discuss portfolio and policy changes and make decisions on large or unusual loan requests, and (7) regular meetings of the Asset Quality Committee which reviews the status of individual loans.\nRisk grades are assigned as part of the loan origination process. From time to time, risk grades may be modified as warranted by the facts and circumstances surrounding the credit.\nCalculation and analysis of the ALLL is prepared quarterly by the Finance Department. The Company's Credit Committee, Capital Management Committee, Audit Committee, and the Board of Directors review the allowance for adequacy.\nThe Company's ALLL has two basic components: the formula allowance and the specific allowance. Each of these components is determined based upon estimates and judgments.\nThe formula allowance uses historical loss experience as an indicator of future losses, along with various qualitative factors, including levels and trends in delinquencies, nonaccrual loans, charge-offs and recoveries, trends in volume and terms of loans, effects of changes in underwriting standards, experience of lending staff, economic conditions, and portfolio concentrations, regulatory, legal, competition, quality of loan review system, and value of underlying collateral. In the formula allowance for commercial and commercial real estate loans, the historical loss rate is combined with the qualitative factors, resulting in an adjusted loss factor for each risk-grade category of loans. The period-end balances for each loan risk-grade category are multiplied by the adjusted loss factor. Allowance calculations for residential real estate and consumer loans are calculated based on historical losses for each product category without regard to risk grade. This loss rate is combined with qualitative factors resulting in an adjusted loss factor for each product category.\nThe specific allowance uses various techniques to arrive at an estimate of loss for specifically identified impaired loans. These include:\n \u2022 The present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan's effective interest rate. The effective interest rate on a loan is the rate of return implicit in the loan (that is, the contractual interest rate adjusted for any net deferred loan fees or costs and any premium or discount existing at the origination or acquisition of the loan); \n \u2022 The loan's observable market price, or \n \u2022 The fair value of the collateral, net of estimated costs to dispose, if the loan is collateral dependent. \nThe use of these computed values is inherently subjective and actual losses could be greater or less than the estimates.\nNo single statistic, formula, or measurement determines the adequacy of the allowance. Management makes subjective and complex judgments about matters that are inherently uncertain, and different amounts would be reported under different conditions or using different assumptions. For analytical purposes, management allocates a portion of the allowance to specific loan categories and specific loans. However, the entire allowance is used to absorb credit losses inherent in the loan portfolio, including identified and unidentified losses.\nThe relationships and ratios used in calculating the allowance, including the qualitative factors, may change from period to period as facts and circumstances evolve. Furthermore, management cannot provide assurance that in any particular period the Bank will not have sizeable credit losses in relation to the amount reserved. Management may find it necessary to significantly adjust the allowance, considering current factors at the time.\nMergers and Acquisitions\nBusiness combinations are accounted for under the Financial Accounting Standards Board (the \"FASB\") Accounting Standards Codification (\"ASC\") 805, Business Combinations, using the acquisition method of accounting. The acquisition method of accounting requires an acquirer to recognize the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed at the acquisition date measured at their fair values as of that date. To determine the fair values, the Company will rely on third party valuations, such as appraisals, or internal valuations based on discounted cash flow analysis or other valuation techniques. Under the acquisition method of accounting, the Company will identify the acquirer and the closing date and apply applicable recognition principles and conditions.\nAcquisition-related costs are costs the Company incurs to effect a business combination. Those costs include advisory, legal, accounting, valuation, and other professional or consulting fees. Some other examples of costs to the Company include systems conversions, integration planning, consultants, and advertising costs. The Company will account for acquisition-related costs as expenses in the periods in which the costs are incurred and the services are received, with one exception. The costs to issue debt or equity securities will be recognized in accordance with other applicable GAAP. These acquisition-related costs have been and will be included within the Consolidated Statements of Income classified within the noninterest expense caption.\nAcquired Loans with Specific Credit-Related Deterioration\nAcquired loans with specific credit deterioration are accounted for by the Company in accordance with FASB ASC 310-30, Receivables - Loans and Debt Securities Acquired with Deteriorated Credit Quality. Certain acquired loans, those for which specific credit-related deterioration, since origination, is identified, are recorded at fair value reflecting the present value of the amounts expected to be collected. Income recognition on these loans is based on a reasonable expectation about the timing and amount of cash flows to be collected. Acquired loans deemed impaired and considered collateral dependent, with the timing of the sale of loan collateral indeterminate, remain on non-accrual status and have no accretable yield.\nGoodwill and Intangible Assets\nThe Company follows ASC 350, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, which prescribes the accounting for goodwill and intangible assets subsequent to initial recognition. Goodwill resulting from business combinations prior to January 1, 2009 represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net assets of businesses acquired. Goodwill resulting from business combinations after January 1, 2009 is generally determined as the excess of the fair value of the consideration transferred, plus the fair value of any noncontrolling interests in the acquiree, over the fair value of the net assets acquired and liabilities assumed as of the acquisition date. Goodwill and intangible assets acquired in a purchase business combination and determined to have an indefinite useful life are not amortized, but tested for impairment at least annually or more frequently if events and circumstances exists that indicate that a goodwill impairment test should be performed. The Company has selected June 30 as the date to perform the annual impairment test. Intangible assets with definite useful lives are amortized over their estimated useful lives, which range from 8.25 to 10 years, to their estimated residual values. Goodwill is the only intangible asset with an indefinite life on the Company's consolidated balance sheets. No indicators of impairment were identified during the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015, and 2014.\nOther Real Estate Owned\nAssets acquired through, or in lieu of, loan foreclosure are held for sale and are initially recorded at fair value less costs to sell at the date of foreclosure. Subsequent to foreclosure, management periodically performs valuations of the foreclosed assets based on updated appraisals, general market conditions, recent sales of similar properties, length of time the properties have been held, and our ability and intention with regard to continued ownership of the properties. The Company may incur additional write-downs of foreclosed assets to fair value less costs to sell if valuations indicate a further deterioration in market conditions.\nDeferred Tax Assets and Liabilities\nThe realization of deferred income tax assets is assessed and a valuation allowance is recorded if it is more likely than not\u201d that all or a portion of the deferred tax asset will not be realized. More likely than not\u201d is defined as greater than a 50% chance. Management considers all available evidence, both positive and negative, to determine whether, based on the weight of that evidence, a valuation allowance is needed.\nOther-than-temporary Impairment of Securities\nImpairment of securities occurs when the fair value of a security is less than its amortized cost. For debt securities, impairment is considered other-than-temporary and recognized in its entirety in net income if either (i) we intend to sell the security or (ii) it is more-likely-than-not that we will be required to sell the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis. If, however, we do not intend to sell the security and it is not more-likely-than-not that we will be required to sell the security before recovery, we must determine what portion of the impairment is attributable to a credit loss, which occurs when the amortized cost basis of the security exceeds the present value of the cash flows expected to be collected from the security. If there is no credit loss, there is no other-than-temporary impairment. If there is a credit loss, other-than-temporary impairment exists, and the credit loss must be recognized in net income and the remaining portion of impairment must be recognized in other comprehensive income. For equity securities, impairment is considered to be other-than-temporary based on our ability and intent to hold the investment until a recovery of fair value. Other-than-temporary impairment of an equity security results in a write-down that must be included in net income. We regularly review each investment security for other-than-temporary impairment based on criteria that includes the extent to which cost exceeds market price, the duration of that market decline, the financial health of and specific prospects for the issuer, our best estimate of the present value of cash flows expected to be collected from debt securities, our intention with regard to holding the security to maturity and the likelihood that we would be required to sell the security before recovery.\nUnfunded Pension Liability\nThe Company previously maintained a non-contributory, defined benefit pension plan for eligible full-time employees as specified by the plan. The Company froze its pension plan to new participants and converted its pension plan to a cash balance plan effective December 31, 2009. Plan assets, which consist primarily of mutual funds invested in marketable equity securities and corporate and government fixed income securities, are valued using market quotations. The Company's actuary determines plan obligations and annual pension expense using a number of key assumptions. Key assumptions may include the discount rate, the interest crediting rate, the estimated future return on plan assets and the anticipated rate of future salary increases. Changes in these assumptions in the future, if any, or in the method under which benefits are calculated may impact pension assets, liabilities or expense.\nNON-GAAP PRESENTATIONS\nNon-GAAP presentations are provided because the Company believes these may be valuable to investors. These include (1) the analysis of net interest income presented on a taxable equivalent basis to facilitate performance comparisons among various taxable and tax-exempt assets and (2) the calculation of the efficiency ratio.\nThe efficiency ratio is calculated by dividing noninterest expense excluding gains or losses on the sale of other real estate owned (\"OREO\") by net interest income including tax equivalent income on nontaxable loans and securities and noninterest income and excluding (i) gains or losses on securities and (ii) gains or losses on sale of premises and equipment. The efficiency ratio for 2016, 2015, and 2014 was 61.47%, 63.81%, and 63.41%, respectively. The Company expects continued improvement in this ratio in 2017. This is a non-GAAP financial measure that the Company believes provides investors with important information regarding operational efficiency. Such information is not prepared in accordance with GAAP and should not be construed as such. Management believes, however, such financial information is meaningful to the reader in understanding operating performance, but cautions that such information not be viewed as a substitute for GAAP. The Company, in referring to its net income, is referring to income under GAAP. The components of the efficiency ratio calculation are summarized in the following table (dollars in thousands): \nNet interest margin is calculated by dividing tax equivalent net interest income by total average earning assets. Because a portion of interest income earned by the Company is nontaxable, the tax equivalent net interest income is considered in the calculation of this ratio. Tax equivalent net interest income is calculated by adding the tax benefit realized from interest income that is nontaxable to total interest income then subtracting total interest expense. The tax rate utilized in calculating the tax benefit for 2016, 2015, and 2014 is 35%. The reconciliation of tax equivalent net interest income, which is not a measurement under GAAP, to net interest income, is reflected in the table below (in thousands):\n\nINTERNET ACCESS TO CORPORATE DOCUMENTS\nThe Company provides access to its SEC filings through a link on the Investor Relations page of the Company's website at www.amnb.com. Reports available include annual reports on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K, and all amendments to those reports as soon as reasonably practicable after the reports are filed electronically with the SEC. The information on the Company's website is not incorporated into this report or any other filing the Company makes with the SEC. The SEC maintains an Internet site that contains reports, proxy and information statements, and other information regarding issuers that file electronically with the SEC at www.sec.gov.\nACQUISITION OF MAINSTREET BANKSHARES, INC.\nOn January 1, 2015, the Company completed its acquisition of MainStreet. The merger of MainStreet with and into the Company was effected pursuant to the terms and conditions of the Agreement and Plan of Reorganization, dated as of August 24, 2014, between the Company and MainStreet. Immediately after the merger of MainStreet into the Company, Franklin Bank, MainStreet's wholly-owned bank subsidiary, merged with and into the Bank.\nPursuant to the MainStreet merger agreement, the former holders of shares of MainStreet common stock received $3.46 in cash and 0.482 shares of the Company's common stock for each share of MainStreet common stock held immediately prior to the effective date of the merger, plus cash in lieu of fractional shares. Each option to purchase shares of MainStreet common stock that was outstanding immediately prior to the effective date of the merger vested upon the merger and was converted into an option to purchase shares of the Company's common stock, adjusted based on a 0.643 exchange ratio. Each share of the Company's common stock outstanding immediately prior to the merger remained outstanding and was unaffected by the merger. The cash portion of the merger consideration was funded through a cash dividend of $6,000,000 from the Bank to the Company, and no borrowing was incurred by the Company or the Bank in connection with the merger.\nMainStreet was the holding company for Franklin Bank. Immediately prior to the Company's acquisition of MainStreet on January 1, 2015, MainStreet had net loans of approximately $122,000,000, total assets of approximately $164,000,000, and total deposits of approximately $137,000,000. Franklin Community Bank, N.A. provided banking services to its customers from three banking offices located in Rocky Mount, Hardy, and Union Hall, Virginia, which are now branch offices of the Bank.\nSTRATEGIC EVENT\nThe Company announced in September 2016 its plans to form a de novo branch in each of Roanoke, Virginia, and Winston-Salem, North Carolina. Initial staffing for Roanoke included fifteeen full-time equivalent employees. Initial staffing for Winston-Salem included five full-time equivalent employees. Initial operations from both offices impacted the fourth quarter of 2016 earning assets and operating results.\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nNet Income\nNet income for 2016 was $16,301,000 compared to $15,039,000 for 2015, an increase of $1,262,000 or 8.4%. Basic and diluted earnings per share were $1.89 for 2016 compared to $1.73 for 2015. This net income produced for 2016 a return on average assets of 1.02%, a return on average equity of 8.07%, and a return on average tangible equity of 10.85%.\nNet income for 2015 was $15,039,000 compared to $12,741,000 for 2014, an increase of $2,298,000 or 18.0%. Basic and diluted earnings per share were $1.73 for 2015 compared to $1.62 for 2014. This net income produced for 2015 a return on average assets of 0.99%, a return on average equity of 7.65%, and a return on average tangible equity of 10.62%.\nEarnings for 2016, 2015, and 2014 were favorably impacted by the 2011 acquisition of MidCarolina and the 2015 acquisition of MainStreet. The financial impact of the mergers was mostly a significant increase in earning assets.\nNet Interest Income\nNet interest income is the difference between interest income on earning assets, primarily loans and securities, and interest expense on interest bearing liabilities, primarily deposits. Fluctuations in interest rates as well as volume and mix changes in earning assets and interest bearing liabilities can materially impact net interest income. The 2011 acquisition of MidCarolina and the 2015 acquisition of MainStreet impacted net interest income positively for 2016 and 2015, through increased earning assets.\nThe following discussion of net interest income is presented on a taxable equivalent basis to facilitate performance comparisons among various taxable and tax-exempt assets, such as certain state and municipal securities. A tax rate of 35% was used in adjusting interest on tax-exempt assets to a fully taxable equivalent basis. Net interest income divided by average earning assets is referred to as the net interest margin. The net interest spread represents the difference between the average rate earned on earning assets and the average rate paid on interest bearing liabilities. All references in this section relate to average yields and rates and average asset and liability balances during the periods discussed.\nNet interest income on a taxable equivalent basis increased $421,000 or 0.8% in 2016 from 2015, following a $7,466,000 or 17.0% increase in 2015 from 2014. The increase in net interest income in 2016 was primarily due to increased volumes of earning assets related to organic growth.\nYields on loans were 4.54% in 2016 compared to 4.81% in 2015. Cost of funds was 0.60% in 2016 compared to 0.58% in 2015. Between 2016 and 2015, deposit rates for demand accounts increased to 0.05% from 0.04%, money market accounts increased to 0.18% from 0.13%, and time deposits increased to 1.14% from 1.09%. Management regularly reviews deposit pricing and attempts to keep costs as low as possible, while remaining competitive. The net interest margin was 3.52% for 2016, 3.69% for 2015, and 3.66% for 2014.\nDuring 2008, the Federal Open Market Committee (\"FOMC\") of the FRB reduced the federal funds rate seven times from 4.25% to 0.25%, where it remained, unchanged, through mid December 2015. On December 17, 2015, the FOMC raised the target federal funds rate from 0.25% to 0.50%. On December 15, 2016, the FOMC raised the target federal funds rate from 0.50% to 0.75%. The increase in rates is expected to have a nominal positive impact on net interest income. Given recent economic and geopolitical events in 2016 and early 2017, the federal funds rate may be higher at year end 2017, but there is considerable uncertainty as to how much higher it may be.\nNet interest income on a taxable equivalent basis increased $7,466,000 or 17.0% in 2015 from 2014, following a $4,819,000 or 9.9% decrease in 2014 from 2013. The increase in net interest income in 2015 was primarily due to increased volumes of earning assets and accretion income related to the MainStreet acquired loan portfolio, and accounted for $6,430,000 or 86% of the total increase.\nYields on loans were 4.81% in 2015 compared to 4.88% in 2014. Cost of funds was 0.58% in 2015 compared to 0.64% in 2014. Between 2015 and 2014, deposit rates for demand, money market, and savings accounts remained basically stable while time deposit rates decreased to 1.09% from 1.17%. Management regularly reviews deposit pricing and attempts to keep costs\nas low as possible, while remaining competitive. The net interest margin was 3.69% for 2015, 3.66% for 2014, and 4.10% for 2013.\nThe following presentation is an analysis of net interest income and related yields and rates, on a taxable equivalent basis, for the last three years. Nonaccrual loans are included in average balances. Interest income on nonaccrual loans, if recognized, is recorded on a cash basis or when the loan returns to accrual status.\nNet Interest Income Analysis\n(in thousands, except yields and rates)\n\nThe following table presents the dollar amount of changes in interest income and interest expense, and distinguishes between changes resulting from fluctuations in average balances of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities (volume), and changes resulting from fluctuations in average interest rates on such assets and liabilities (rate). Changes attributable to both volume and rate have been allocated proportionately (dollars in thousands):\nChanges in Net Interest Income (Rate / Volume Analysis)\n\nNoninterest Income\nFor the year ended December 31, 2016, noninterest income increased $218,000 or 1.6% compared to the year ended December 31, 2015. Details of individual accounts are shown in the table on the following page.\n\nA substantial portion of trust fees are earned based on account fair values, so changes in the equity markets may have a large and potentially volatile impact on revenue. Trust income and service charge income decreased slightly for 2016 compared to 2015. Other fees and commissions were positively impacted by higher levels of debit card transaction volume. Mortgage banking income increased significantly in 2016 as a result of increases in the volume of originations. Secondary market mortgage loan volume for 2016 was $78,330,000 compared to $59,030,000 for 2015. Income from Small Business Investment Company (\"SBIC\") investments, which is volatile and difficult to predict, decreased $449,000 or 49.2% for 2016 compared to 2015. Other income increased $267,000 for 2016 compared to 2015 primarily due to the additional income from investments in limited partnerships.\n\nA substantial portion of trust fees are earned based on account fair values, so changes in the equity markets may have a large and potentially volatile impact on revenue. Trust income decreased for 2015 compared to 2014, largely related to the 2014 recognition of a one-time estate fee revenue of approximately $110,000. Trust income was not immediately impacted by the MainStreet acquisition. Service charge income was positively impacted by increases in overdraft and returned check fee income and higher fee income from debit card activity. These categories were higher based on larger transaction volume. Mortgage banking income was higher in 2015 based on greater loan demand volume in existing markets and the impact of the MainStreet acquisition. Secondary market mortgage loan volume for 2015 was $59,030,000 compared to $49,565,000 for 2014. Securities gains also increased, which related to the Company's decision to reduce its exposure to states with unusually large unfunded pension obligations and states sensitive to the large decline in the price of oil, notably Texas. Income from SBIC investments, which is volatile and difficult to predict, increased $736,000 or 418.2% for 2015 compared to 2014.\nNoninterest Expense\nFor the year ended December 31, 2016, noninterest expense decreased $742,000 or 1.8% as compared to the year ended December 31, 2015.\n\nSalaries expense increased $1,014,000, or 6.1%, in 2016 compared to 2015. The major driver of this increase is additional compensation expense related to the de novo efforts in Roanoke, Virginia and Winston-Salem, North Carolina. The expense for FDIC assessment decreased in 2016 due to the reduction in FDIC assessment rates effective the third quarter of 2016. Other real estate owned expense includes gains and losses on sale of foreclosed properties, adjustments related to re-appraisals of foreclosed properties, and operating expenses related to maintaining foreclosed properties. It is inherently volatile from period to period. The change in other real estate owned expense during 2016 was primarily a result of the gain on the sale of one foreclosed property in the amount of $183,000 during 2015. The largest component of the decrease in noninterest expense in 2016 was the 2015 nonrecurring merger related expenses of $1,998,000.\n\nSalaries expense increased significantly in 2015 compared to 2014 primarily related to the MainStreet acquisition. The increase in salaries expense represents 31.2% of the total increase in noninterest expense between 2015 and 2014. Total full time equivalent employees increased to 303 in 2015 from 284 in 2014. Employee benefits were impacted by the acquisition and also increased health care and pension settlement expense. Data processing expense increased due to higher transaction volumes, increased usage of the Company's core information management system, and also a delay in the operational conversion for MainStreet from March to May 2015. Other real estate owned expense includes gains and losses on sale of foreclosed properties, adjustments related to re-appraisals of foreclosed properties, and operating expenses related to maintaining foreclosed properties. It is inherently volatile from period to period. Nonrecurring MainStreet acquisition related expenses represent 20.4% of the total increase in noninterest expense between 2015 and 2014.\nOREO expense, includes gains and losses on sale of foreclosed properties, adjustments related to re-appraisals of foreclosed properties, and operating expenses related to maintaining foreclosed properties. The activity related to this noninterest expense for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015, and 2014 are shown below (dollars in thousands):\n\nIncome Taxes\nIncome taxes on 2016 earnings amounted to $7,007,000, resulting in an effective tax rate of 30.1%, compared to 28.6% in 2015 and 29.0% in 2014. The effective tax rate is lower than the statutory rate of 35% due to income that is not taxable for federal income tax purposes. The primary non-taxable income is that of state and municipal securities and loans. The increase in the effective tax rate is primarily related to a lower level of tax exempt municipal securities income.\nFair Value Impact to Pretax Income\nThe July 2011 merger with MidCarolina and the January 2015 merger with MainStreet had a material and positive impact on earnings. The ongoing financial impact of the mergers was mostly the result of the increase in earnings assets. However, the specific financial impact of the fair value related accounting adjustments is reflected in the following tables. The tables present the actual effect of the accretable and amortizable fair value adjustments attributable to the mergers on net interest income and pretax income for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015, and 2014, respectively (dollars in thousands): \n(1) Remaining discount balance includes $2,197,000 in reclassifications from the non-accretable difference.\n\n(1) Remaining discount balance includes $238,000 in reclassifications from the non-accretable difference.\n\n(1) Remaining discount balance includes $35,000 of mark moved to OREO and $9,000 of charge-offs against the mark.\n(2) Remaining discount balance includes $579,000 in reclassifications from the non-accretable difference.\nGenerally accepted accounting principles for business combinations require the acquired balance sheet to be valued at fair value at the time of the merger. In the context of acquiring a commercial bank, most of the balance sheet is interest rate sensitive and this can generate significant discounts or premiums to contractual values. These discounts or premiums will have potentially significant impact to net interest income and to net income.\nThe table below summarizes the impact of the fair value merger related accounting impact to net interest income and impact to pretax income of the MidCarolina (\"MC\") and MainStreet (\"MS\") acquisitions (dollars in thousands):\n\nThe MidCarolina acquisition was effective July 1, 2011. The MainStreet acquisition was effective January 1, 2015. Management expects that the fair value accounting financial impact of both acquisitions will continue to decline in subsequent quarters.\nImpact of Inflation and Changing Prices\nThe majority of assets and liabilities of a financial institution are monetary in nature and therefore differ greatly from most commercial and industrial companies that have significant investments in fixed assets or inventories. The most significant effect of inflation is on noninterest expenses that tend to rise during periods of inflation. Changes in interest rates have a greater impact on a financial institution's profitability than do the effects of higher costs for goods and services. Through its balance sheet management practices, the Company has the ability to react to those changes and measure and monitor its interest rate and liquidity risk.\nMarket Risk Management\nEffectively managing market risk is essential to achieving the Company's financial objectives. Market risk reflects the risk of economic loss resulting from changes in interest rates and market prices. The Company is generally not subject to currency exchange risk or commodity price risk. The Company's primary market risk exposure is interest rate risk; however, market risk also includes liquidity risk. Both are discussed in the following sections.\nInterest Rate Risk Management\nInterest rate risk and its impact on net interest income is a primary market risk exposure. The Company manages its exposure to fluctuations in interest rates through policies approved by its Asset Liability Committee (\"ALCO\") and Board of Directors, both of which receive and review periodic reports of the Company's interest rate risk position.\nThe Company uses computer simulation analysis to measure the sensitivity of projected earnings to changes in interest rates. Simulation takes into account current balance sheet volumes and the scheduled repricing dates, instrument level optionality, and maturities of assets and liabilities. It incorporates numerous assumptions including growth, changes in the mix of assets and liabilities, prepayments, and average rates earned and paid. Based on this information, management uses the model to project net interest income under multiple interest rate scenarios.\nA balance sheet is considered asset sensitive when its earning assets (loans and securities) reprice faster or to a greater extent than its liabilities (deposits and borrowings). An asset sensitive balance sheet will produce relatively more net interest income when interest rates rise and less net interest income when they decline. Based on the Company's simulation analysis, management believes the Company's interest sensitivity position at December 31, 2016 is asset sensitive. As of early 2017, management expects that the general direction of market interest rates will be stable to up, though volatility, sometimes substantial, is anticipated in the short-term.\nEarnings Simulation\nThe table below shows the estimated impact of changes in interest rates on net interest income as of December 31, 2016 (dollars in thousands), assuming gradual and parallel changes in interest rates, and consistent levels of assets and liabilities. Net interest income for the following twelve months is projected to increase when interest rates are higher than current rates.\nEstimated Changes in Net Interest Income\n\nManagement cannot predict future interest rates or their exact effect on net interest income. Computations of future effects of hypothetical interest rate changes are based on numerous assumptions and should not be relied upon as indicative of actual results. Certain limitations are inherent in such computations. Assets and liabilities may react differently than projected to changes in market interest rates. The interest rates on certain types of assets and liabilities may fluctuate in advance of changes in market interest rates, while rates on other types of assets and liabilities may lag changes in market interest rates. Interest rate shifts may not be parallel.\nChanges in interest rates can cause substantial changes in the amount of prepayments of loans and mortgage-backed securities, which may in turn affect the Company's interest rate sensitivity position. Additionally, credit risk may rise if an interest rate increase adversely affects the ability of borrowers to service their debt.\nEconomic Value Simulation\nEconomic value simulation is used to calculate the estimated fair value of assets and liabilities over different interest rate environments. Economic values are calculated based on discounted cash flow analysis. The net economic value of equity is the economic value of all assets minus the economic value of all liabilities. The change in net economic value over different rate environments is an indication of the longer-term earnings capability of the balance sheet. The same assumptions are used in the economic value simulation as in the earnings simulation. The economic value simulation uses instantaneous rate shocks to the balance sheet.\nThe following table reflects the estimated change in net economic value over different rate environments using economic value simulation for the balances at the period ended December 31, 2016 (dollars in thousands):\nEstimated Changes in Economic Value of Equity\n\nLiquidity Risk Management\nLiquidity is the ability of the Company in a timely manner to convert assets into cash or cash equivalents without significant loss and to raise additional funds by increasing liabilities. Liquidity management involves maintaining the Company's ability to meet the daily cash flow requirements of its customers, whether they are borrowers requiring funds or depositors desiring to withdraw funds. Additionally, the Company requires cash for various operating needs including dividends to shareholders, the servicing of debt, and the payment of general corporate expenses. The Company manages its exposure to fluctuations in interest rates and liquidity needs through policies approved by the ALCO and Board of Directors, both of which receive periodic reports of the Company's interest rate risk and liquidity position. The Company uses a computer simulation model to assist in the management of the future liquidity needs of the Company.\nLiquidity sources include on balance sheet and off balance sheet sources.\nBalance sheet liquidity sources include cash, amounts due from banks, loan repayments, bond maturities and calls, and increases in deposits. Further, the Company maintains a large, high quality, very liquid bond portfolio, which is generally 50% to 60% unpledged and would, accordingly, be available for sale if necessary.\nOff balance sheet sources include lines of credit from the Federal Home Loan Bank of Atlanta (\"FHLB\"), federal funds lines of credit, and access to the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond's discount window.\nThe Company has a line of credit with the FHLB, equal to 30% of the Company's assets, subject to the amount of collateral pledged. Under the terms of its collateral agreement with the FHLB, the Company provides a blanket lien covering all of its residential first mortgage loans, home equity lines of credit, commercial real estate loans and commercial construction loans. In addition, the Company pledges as collateral its capital stock in and deposits with the FHLB. At December 31, 2016, principal advance obligations to the FHLB consisted of $9,980,000 in fixed-rate, long-term advances and $20,000,000 in variable-rate, short-term advances compared to $9,958,000 in long-term advances and no short-term advances at December 31, 2015. The Company also had outstanding $130,700,000 in letters of credit at December 31, 2016 compared to $70,700,000 in letters of credit at December 31, 2015. The letters of credit provide the Bank with additional collateral for securing public entity deposits above FDIC insurance levels, thereby providing less need for collateral pledging from the securities portfolio and accordingly increasing our balance sheet liquidity.\nShort-term borrowing is discussed in Note 10 and long-term borrowing is discussed in Note 11 of the Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Item 8 of this Form 10-K.\nThe Company has federal funds lines of credit established with two correspondent banks in the amounts of $15,000,000 each and has access to the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond's discount window. There were no amounts outstanding under these facilities at December 31, 2016. The Company, through its subsidiary bank, has a relationship with Promontory Network, the sponsoring entity for the Certificate of Deposit Account Registry Service\u00ae (\"CDARS\"). Through CDARS, the Company is able to provide deposit customers with access to aggregate FDIC insurance in amounts far exceeding $250,000. This gives the Company the ability, as and when needed, to attract and retain large deposits from insurance sensitive customers. CDARS are classified as brokered deposits, however they are generally derived from customers with whom our institution has or wishes to have a direct and ongoing core deposit relationship. As a result, management considers these deposits functionally, though not technically, in the same category as core deposits. With CDARS, the Company has the option to keep deposits on balance sheet or sell them to other members of the network. Additionally, subject to certain limits, the Company can use CDARS to purchase\ncost-effective funding without collateralization and in lieu of generating funds through traditional brokered CDs or the FHLB. Thus, CDARS serves as a deposit-gathering tool and an additional liquidity management tool. Deposits through the CDARS program as of December 31, 2016 and 2015 were $23,445,000 and $23,633,000, respectively.\nThe Bank also participates with the Promontory Network using Insured Cash Sweep\u00ae, a product which provides the Bank the capability of providing additional deposit insurance to customers in the context of a money market account arrangement. The product is analogous to the CDARS product discussed above.\nManagement believes that these sources provide sufficient and timely liquidity, both on and off balance sheet.\nBALANCE SHEET ANALYSIS\nSecurities\nThe securities portfolio generates income, plays a strategic role in the management of interest rate sensitivity, provides a source of liquidity, and is used to meet collateral requirements. The securities portfolio consists of high quality investments, mostly federal agency, mortgage-backed, and state and municipal securities.\nThe Company is cognizant of the continuing historically low and recently volatile interest rate environment and has elected to maintain a defensive asset liability strategy of purchasing high quality taxable securities of relatively short duration and somewhat longer term tax exempt securities, whose market values are not as volatile in rising rate environments as similar termed taxable investments. The Company is aware that possible changes in corporate tax rates could have a negative impact on our municipal portfolio valuation.\nThe following table presents information on the amortized cost, maturities, and taxable equivalent yields of securities at the end of the last three years (dollars in thousands):\n\nDuring 2016, the Company's investment in preferred stock was converted to common stock. At December 31, 2016, the Company had two common stock investments, neither of which was paying dividends, with a total amortized cost of $1,288,000.\nLoans\nThe loan portfolio consists primarily of commercial and residential real estate loans, commercial loans to small and medium-sized businesses, construction and land development loans, and home equity loans.\nAverage loans increased $87,417,000 or 9.0% from 2015 to 2016. Average loans increased $171,001,000 or 21.2% from 2014 to 2015, mostly impacted by the MainStreet merger.\nAt December 31, 2016, total loans were $1,164,821,000, an increase of $159,296,000 or 15.8% from the prior year. The increase is the result of broad based organic loan growth and the de novo branch start-ups in Roanoke, Virginia and Winston-Salem, North Carolina.\nLoans held for sale totaled $5,996,000 at December 31, 2016 and $3,266,000 at December 31, 2015. Loan production volume was $78,330,000 and $59,030,000 for 2016 and 2015, respectively. These loans were approximately 60% purchase, 40% refinancing.\nManagement of the loan portfolio is organized around portfolio segments. Each segment is comprised of various loan types that are reflective of operational and regulatory reporting requirements. The following table presents the Company's portfolio as of the dates indicated by segment (dollars in thousands):\nLoans\n\nThe following table provides loan balance information by geographic regions. In some circumstances, loans may be originated in one region for borrowers located in other regions (dollars in thousands):\nLoans by Geographic Region\n\nThe large year over year increase in the Guilford region was the result of a convergence of improving business conditions in the Greensboro, North Carolina market and an ongoing, active program of customer outreach conducted by the Bank's market area lenders.\nThe Danville region consists of offices in Danville, Virginia and Yanceyville, North Carolina. The Central region consists of offices in Bedford, Lynchburg, and the counties of Bedford, Campbell, and Nelson, Virginia. The Southside region consists of offices in Martinsville and Henry County, Virginia. The Eastern region consists of offices in South Boston and the counties of Halifax and Pittsylvania, Virginia. The Franklin region consists of offices in Rocky Mount, Union Hall, and Hardy, Virginia. The Roanoke region consists of an office in Roanoke County, Virginia. The Alamance region consists of offices in Burlington, Graham, and Mebane, North Carolina. The Guilford region consists of offices in Greensboro, North Carolina. The Winston-Salem region consists of an office in Winston-Salem, North Carolina.\nThe Company does not participate in or have any highly leveraged lending transactions, as defined by bank regulations. The Company has no foreign loans. While there were no concentrations of loans to any individual, group of individuals, business, or industry that exceeded 10% of total loans at December 31, 2016 or 2015, loans to lessors of nonresidential buildings represented 18.9% of total loans at December 31, 2016 and 19.5% at December 31, 2015. These lessees and lessors are engaged in a variety of industries.\nThe following table presents the maturity schedule of selected loan types (dollars in thousands):\nMaturities of Selected Loan Types\nDecember 31, 2016\n\n (1) Includes agricultural loans. \n (2) Of the loans due after one year, $147,520 have predetermined interest rates and $100,858 have floating or adjustable interest rates.  Provision for Loan Losses\nThe provision for loan losses was $250,000, $950,000, and $400,000 for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015, and 2014, respectively.\nThe smaller provision expense in 2016 related to improvement in various qualitative factors, notably asset quality, local economic conditions and continued decline in historical loss factors. Improvements in asset quality were apparent in declines in past due and nonaccrual loans, as well as, in qualitative factors for asset quality and economic conditions, which were somewhat offset by additional factors assigned to unseasoned loans in new markets. The larger provision expense in 2015 related to the increase in organic loan growth and the relatively rapid maturities and renewals of the performing acquired loan portfolio of MainStreet and their resulting transfer to the regular loan portfolio.\nAllowance for Loan Losses\nThe purpose of the ALLL is to provide for probable losses inherent in the loan portfolio. The allowance is increased by the provision for loan losses and by recoveries of previously charged-off loans. Loan charge-offs decrease the allowance.\nThe ALLL was $12,801,000, $12,601,000, and $12,427,000 at December 31, 2016, 2015, and 2014, respectively. The ALLL as a percentage of loans at each of those dates were 1.10%, 1.25%, and 1.48%, respectively.\nThe decrease in the allowance as a percentage of loans during 2016 was primarily due to continued high asset quality, low charge offs, and improvement in various qualitative factors, notably economic and legal, used in the determination of the allowance. The decrease in the allowance as a percentage of loans during 2015 was primarily impacted by the January 2015 acquisition of MainStreet.\nIn an effort to better evaluate the adequacy of its ALLL, the Company computes its ASC 450, Contingencies, loan balance by reducing total loans by acquired loans and loans that were evaluated for impairment individually or smaller balance nonaccrual loans evaluated for impairment in homogeneous pools. It also adjusts its ASC 450 loan loss reserve balance total by removing allowances associated with these other pools of loans.\nThe general allowance, ASC 450 (FAS 5) reserves to ASC 450 loans, was 1.17% at December 31, 2016, compared to 1.40% at December 31, 2015. On a dollar basis, the reserve was $12,429,000 at December 31, 2016, compared to $12,159,000 at December 31, 2015. The percentage of the reserve to total loans has declined due to improving local and national economic conditions and continued improvement in asset quality metrics. This segment of the allowance represents by far the largest portion of the loan portfolio and the largest aggregate risk.\nThe specific allowance, ASC 310-40 (FAS 114) reserves to ASC 310-40 loans, was 0.47% at December 31, 2016, compared to 1.17% at December 31, 2015. On a dollar basis, the reserve was $23,000 at December 31, 2016, compared to $35,000 at December 31, 2015. The decrease in the dollar amount of the reserve was related to changes in characteristics of\nloans reviewed individually for impairment and charge-offs of specific reserves in 2016 that were recorded in the prior year. There is ongoing turnover in the composition of the impaired loan population, which increased $137,000 over December 31, 2015.\nThe specific allowance does not include reserves related to acquired loans with deteriorated credit quality. This reserve was $349,000 at December 31, 2016, compared to $407,000 at December 31, 2015. This is the only portion of the reserve related to acquired loans. Cash flow expectations for these loans are reviewed on a quarterly basis and unfavorable changes in those estimates relative to the initial estimates can result in the need for specific loan loss provision.\nThe following table presents the Company's loan loss and recovery experience for the past five years (dollars in thousands):\nSummary of Loan Loss Experience\n\nThe following table summarizes the allocation of the allowance for loan losses by major portfolio segments for the past five years (dollars in thousands):\nAllocation of Allowance for Loan Losses\n\n% - represents the percentage of loans in each category to total loans.\nAsset Quality Indicators\nThe following table provides certain qualitative indicators relevant to the Company's loan portfolio for the past five years.\n\n* - at year end.\nNonperforming Assets (Loans and Other Real Estate Owned)\nNonperforming loans include loans on which interest is no longer accrued and accruing loans that are contractually past due 90 days or more. Nonperforming loans include loans originated and loans acquired.\nNonperforming loans to total loans were 0.30% at December 31, 2016 compared to 0.52% at December 31, 2015. The decrease in nonperforming loans during 2016 was $1,653,000.\nNonperforming assets include nonperforming loans and foreclosed real estate. Nonperforming assets represented 0.29% at December 31, 2016 compared to 0.48% of total assets at December 31, 2015.\nIn most cases, it is the policy of the Company that any loan that becomes 90 days past due will automatically be placed on nonaccrual loan status, accrued interest reversed out of income, and further interest accrual ceased. Any payments received on such loans will be credited to principal. In some cases a loan in process of renewal may become 90 days past due. In these instances the loan may still be accruing because of a delayed renewal process in which the customer has not been billed. In accounting for acquired impaired loans, such loans are not classified as nonaccrual when they become 90 days past due. They are considered to be accruing because their interest income relates to the accretable yield and not to contractual interest payments.\nLoans will only be restored to full accrual status after six consecutive months of payments that were each less than 30 days delinquent. The Company strictly adheres with this policy before restoring a loan to normal accrual status.\nThe following table presents the Company's nonperforming asset history, including acquired impaired loans as of the dates indicated (dollars in thousands):\nNonperforming Assets\n\nImpaired Loans\nA loan is considered impaired when, based on current information and events, it is probable that the Company will be unable to collect the scheduled payments of principal or interest when due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement. The following table shows loans that were considered impaired, exclusive of acquired impaired loans, as of the dates indicated (dollars in thousands):\nImpaired Loans\n\nTroubled Debt Restructurings (\"TDRs\")\nTDRs exist whenever the Company makes a concession to a customer based on the customer's financial distress that would not have otherwise been made in the normal course of business.\nThere was $2,670,000 in TDRs at December 31, 2016 compared to $1,958,000 at December 31, 2015.\nOther Real Estate Owned\nOther real estate owned is carried on the consolidated balance sheets at $1,328,000 and $2,184,000 as of December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Foreclosed assets are initially recorded at fair value, less estimated costs to sell, at the date of foreclosure. Loan losses resulting from foreclosure are charged against the ALLL at that time. Subsequent to foreclosure, valuations are periodically performed by management and the assets are carried at the lower of the new cost basis or fair value, less estimated costs to sell with any additional write-downs charged against earnings. For significant assets, these valuations are typically outside annual appraisals. The following table shows OREO as of the dates indicated (dollars in thousands): \nDeposits\nThe Company's deposits consist primarily of checking, money market, savings, and consumer and commercial time deposits. Average deposits increased $68,844,000 or 5.6% in 2016, after increasing $179,669,000 or 17.1% in 2015. The increase in 2015 was primarily related to the MainStreet acquisition.\nPeriod-end total deposits increased $107,980,000 or 8.6% during 2016. The increase was primarily related to steady growth in core deposits, which is consistent with the Company's asset liability strategy. The Company has only a relatively small portion of its time deposits provided by wholesale sources. These include brokered time deposits, of which there were none at year end 2016, 2015, and 2014, and time deposits through the CDARS program, which at year end totaled $23,445,000 for 2016, $23,633,000 for 2015, and $22,255,000 for 2014. Management considers the CDARS deposits the functional, though not regulatory, equivalent of core deposits, because they relate to balances derived from customers with long standing relationships with the Company.\nAverage deposits and rates for the years indicated (dollars in thousands):\nDeposits\n\nCertificates of Deposit of $100,000 or More\nCertificates of deposit at December 31, 2016 in amounts of $100,000 or more were classified by maturity as follows (dollars in thousands):\n\nCertificates of Deposit of $250,000 or More\nCertificates of deposit at December 31, 2016 in amounts of $250,000 or more were classified by maturity as follows (dollars in thousands):\n\nBorrowed Funds\nIn addition to internal deposit generation, the Company also relies on borrowed funds as a supplemental source of funding. Borrowed funds consist of customer repurchase agreements, overnight borrowings from the FHLB and longer-term FHLB advances, and trust preferred capital notes. Customer repurchase agreements are borrowings collateralized by securities of the U.S. Government, its agencies, or Government Sponsored Enterprises (\"GSEs\") and generally mature daily. The Company considers these accounts to be a stable and low cost source of funds. The securities underlying these agreements remain under the Company's control. Refer to Notes 11 and 12 of the Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Item 8 of this Form 10-K for a discussion of long-term debt.\nThe following table presents information pertaining to the Company's short-term borrowed funds as of the dates indicated (dollars in thousands):\nShort-Term Borrowings\n\nIn the regular course of conducting its business, the Company takes deposits from political subdivisions of the states of Virginia and North Carolina. At December 31, 2016, the Bank's public deposits totaled $207,740,000. The Company is legally required to provide collateral to secure the deposits that exceed the insurance coverage provided by the FDIC. This collateral\ncan be provided in the form of certain types of government agency bonds or letters of credit from the FHLB. At year-end 2016, the Company had $130,000,000 in letters of credit with the FHLB outstanding to supplement collateral for such deposits.\nShareholders' Equity\nThe Company's goal with capital management is to be classified as \"well capitalized\" under regulatory capital ratios and to support growth, while generating acceptable returns on equity and paying a high rate of dividends.\nShareholders' equity was $201,380,000 at December 31, 2016 and $197,835,000 at December 31, 2015.\nThe Company declared and paid quarterly dividends totaling $0.96 per share for 2016, $0.93 per share for 2015, and $0.92 per share for 2014. Cash dividends in 2016 totaled $8,266,000 and represented a 50.7% payout of 2016 net income, compared to a 53.6% payout in 2015, and a 56.8% payout in 2014.\nIn July 2013, the FRB issued final rules that make technical changes to its capital rules to align them with the Basel III regulatory capital framework and meet certain requirements of the Dodd-Frank Act. The final rules maintain the general structure of the prompt corrective action framework in effect at such time while incorporating certain increased minimum requirements. Effective January 1, 2015, the final rules require the Company and the Bank to comply with the following minimum capital ratios: (i) a new common equity Tier 1 capital ratio of 4.5% of risk-weighted assets; (ii) a Tier 1 capital ratio of 6.0% of risk-weighted assets (increased from the prior requirement of 4.0%); (iii) a total capital ratio of 8.0% of risk-weighted assets (unchanged from the prior requirement); and (iv) a leverage ratio of 4.0% of total assets (unchanged from the prior requirement). These are the initial capital requirements, which will be phased in over a four-year period. When fully phased in on January 1, 2019, the rules will require the Company and the Bank to maintain such minimum ratios plus a 2.5% \"capital conservation buffer\" (other than for the leverage ratio). The phase in of the capital conservation buffer requirement began on January 1, 2016, at 0.625% of risk-weighted assets, increasing by the same amount each year until fully implemented at 2.5% on January 1, 2019. Management believes the Company and the Bank will be compliant with the fully phased-in requirements when they become effective January 1, 2019.\nThe following table represents the major regulatory capital ratios for the Company as of the dates indicated:\n\nManagement believes the Company and the Bank meet the requirements to be considered \"well capitalized\" for all regulatory capital ratios as of December 31, 2016 and 2015.\nStock Repurchase Programs\nIn years prior to 2014 the Company had, in the normal course of business, operated certain stock repurchase programs. Authority to repurchase shares under these programs had been expired for some time.\nOn April 17, 2014, the Company filed a Form 8-K with the SEC to announce the approval by its Board of Directors (the \"Board\") of a stock repurchase program. The program authorized the repurchase of up to 250,000 shares of the Company's common stock over a two year period. The share purchase limit was established at such number of shares equal to approximately 3% of the 7,900,000 common shares then outstanding at the time the Board approved the program.\nOn November 19, 2015, the Company filed a Form 8-K with the SEC to announce the approval by its Board of another stock repurchase program. The program authorizes the repurchase of up to 300,000 shares of the Company's common stock over a two year period. The share purchase limit was established at such number of shares equal to approximately 3.5% of the 8,622,000 common shares then outstanding at the time the Board approved the program.\nDuring 2016, the Company repurchased 51,384 shares at an average cost of $25.14 per share, for a total cost of $1,292,000. In 2015, the Company repurchased 150,656 shares at an average cost of $23.27 per share, for a total cost of $3,506,000.\nCONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS\nThe following items are contractual obligations of the Company as of December 31, 2016 (dollars in thousands):\n\nOFF-BALANCE SHEET ACTIVITIES\nThe Company enters into certain financial transactions in the ordinary course of performing traditional banking services that result in off-balance sheet transactions. Other than AMNB Statutory Trust I, formed in 2006 to issue trust preferred securities, and the MidCarolina Trust I and MidCarolina Trust II, the Company does not have any off-balance sheet subsidiaries. Refer to Note 12 of the Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Item 8 of this Form 10-K for a discussion of junior subordinated debt. Off-balance sheet transactions were as follows as of the dates indicated (dollars in thousands):\n\nTotal off-balance sheet transaction volume increased significantly due to the demand from the de novo branches in Roanoke, Virginia and Winston-Salem, North Carolina.\nCommitments to extend credit to customers represent legally binding agreements with fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses. Since many of the commitments are expected to expire without being funded, the total commitment amounts do not necessarily represent future funding requirements. Standby letters of credit are conditional commitments issued by the Company guaranteeing the performance of a customer to a third party. Those guarantees are primarily issued to support public and private borrowing arrangements.", "item_7_tables": "Table 24: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td>

2015, primarily due to increased earning assets from organic growth and new de novo branches. \n\n- Net interest income increased 0.8% in 2016 compared to 2015. Net interest margin decreased to 3.52% in 2016 from 3.69% in 2015 due to lower yields on loans and securities.\n\n- Noninterest income increased 1.6% in 2016 compared to 2015, primarily due to higher mortgage banking income and income from limited partnerships. \n\n- Noninterest expense decreased 1.8% in 2016 compared to 2015, primarily due to lower core deposit intangible amortization and the absence of 2015 merger expenses.\n\n- Average loans increased 9.0% and average deposits increased 5.6% in 2016 compared to 2015. \n\n- Asset quality improved with decreases in nonperforming assets and net charge-offs. The allowance for loan losses decreased to 1.10% of total loans.\n\n- Capital levels remained strong with all regulatory capital ratios exceeding required minimums for \"well capitalized\" status. \n\n- The Company paid dividends of $0.96 per share in 2016, representing a 50.7% payout of net income.\n\nIn summary, the Company reported improved financial performance in 2016 driven by organic balance sheet growth, positive operating leverage, strong asset quality, and maintenance of a solid capital position."}
