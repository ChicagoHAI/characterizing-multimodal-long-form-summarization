Under this segmentation, the SunPower Energy Services Segment (\"SunPower Energy Services\" or \"Downstream\") refers to sales of solar energy solutions in the North America region previously included in the legacy Residential Segment and Commercial Segment (collectively previously referred to as \"Distributed Generation\" or \"DG\") including direct sales of turn-key engineering, procurement and construction (\"EPC\") services, sales to our third-party dealer network, sales of energy under power purchase agreements (\"PPAs\"), storage solutions, cash sales and long-term leases directly to end customers, and sales to resellers. SunPower Energy Services Segment also includes sales of our global Operations and Maintenance (\"O&M\") services. The SunPower Technologies Segment (\"SunPower Technologies\" or \"Upstream\") refers to our technology development, worldwide solar panel manufacturing operations, equipment supply to resellers, commercial and residential end-customers outside of North America (\"International DG\"), and worldwide power plant project development and project sales. Some support functions and responsibilities have been shifted to each segment, including financial planning and analysis, legal, treasury, tax and accounting support and services, among others.\nThe operating structure provides our management with a comprehensive financial overview of our key businesses. The application of this structure permits us to align our strategic business initiatives and corporate goals in a manner that best focuses our businesses and support operations for success.\nOur Chief Executive Officer, as the chief operating decision maker ( CODM\u201d), reviews our business, manages resource allocations and measures performance of our activities between the SunPower Energy Services Segment and SunPower Technologies Segment.\nFor more information about our business segments, see the section titled \"Part I. Item 1. Business\" of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 29, 2019. For more segment information, see \"Item 1. Financial Statements-Note 17. Segment Information and Geographical Information\" in the notes to the consolidated financial statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nFiscal Years\nWe have a 52 to 53 week fiscal year that ends on the Sunday closest to December 31. Accordingly, every fifth or sixth year will be a 53 week fiscal year. Fiscal 2019, 2018 and 2017 are 52 week fiscal years. Our fiscal 2019 ended on December 29, 2019, fiscal 2018 ended on December 30, 2018 and fiscal 2017 ended on December 31, 2017.\nOutlook\nDemand\nDuring fiscal 2019, we faced market challenges, including competitive solar product pricing pressure and the impact of tariffs imposed pursuant to Section 201 and Section 301 of the Trade Act of 1974. On February 7, 2018, tariffs went into effect pursuant to Proclamation 9693, which approved recommendations to provide relief to U.S. manufacturers and imposed safeguard tariffs on imported solar cells and modules, based on the investigations, findings, and recommendations of the International Trade Commission. While solar cells and modules based on interdigitated back contact (\"IBC\") technology, like our X-Series (Maxeon 3), E-Series (Maxeon 2)A-Series (Maxeon 5) panels and related products, were granted exclusion from these safeguard tariffs on September 19, 2018, our solar products based on other technologies continue to be subject to the safeguard tariffs. On June 13, 2019, the Office of the United States Trade Representative ( USTR\u201d) published a notice describing its grant of exclusion requests for three additional categories of solar products. Beginning on June 13, 2019, the following categories of solar products are not subject to the Section 201 safeguard tariffs: (i) bifacial solar panels that absorb light and generate electricity on each side of the panel and that consist of only bifacial solar cells that absorb light and generate electricity on each side of the cells; (ii) flexible fiberglass solar panels without glass components other than fiberglass, such panels having power outputs ranging from 250 to 900 watts; and (iii) solar panels consisting of solar cells arranged in rows that are laminated in the panel and that are separated by more than 10 mm, with an optical film spanning the gaps between all rows that is designed to direct sunlight onto the solar cells, and not including panels that lack said optical film or only have a white or other backing layer that absorbs or scatters sunlight. We are working to understand the opportunities and challenges created by the exclusion of these products, as well as the impact of the exclusions on the demand and availability of competing products. However, the excluded technologies currently represent a small percentage of the global solar market.\nAdditionally, the USTR initiated an investigation under Section 301 of the Trade Act of 1974 into the government of China's acts, policies, and practices related to technology transfer, intellectual property, and innovation. The USTR imposed additional import duties of up to 25% on certain Chinese products covered by the Section 301 remedy. These tariffs include certain solar power system components and finished products, including those purchased from our suppliers for use in our products and used in our business. In the near term, imposition of these tariffs - on top of anti-dumping and countervailing duties on Chinese solar cells and modules, imposed under the prior administration - is likely to result in a wide range of impacts to the U.S. solar industry, global manufacturing market and our business. Such tariffs could cause market volatility, price fluctuations, and demand reduction. Uncertainties associated with the Section 201 and Section 301 trade cases prompted us to adopt a restructuring plan and implement initiatives to reduce operating expenses and cost of revenue overhead and improve cash flow. During fiscal 2019 and 2018, we incurred total tariffs charges of approximately $6.5 million and $42.5 million, respectively.\nIn fiscal 2019, focused on investments that we expected would offer the best opportunities for growth including our industry-leading A-Series (Maxeon 5) cell and panel technology, solar-plus-storage solutions and digital platform to improve customer service and satisfaction in our SunPower Energy Services offerings. We believe that our strategic decision to re-segment our business into an upstream and downstream structure, to focus our downstream efforts on our leading U.S. DG business while growing global sales of our upstream solar panel business through our SunPower Technologies business segment, will improve transparency and enable us to regain profitability.\nIn late fiscal 2015, the U.S. government enacted a budget bill that extended the solar commercial investment tax credit (the \"Commercial ITC\") under Section 48(c) of the Code, and the individual solar investment tax credit under Section 25D of the Code (together with the Commercial ITC, the \"ITC\") for five years, at rates gradually decreasing from 30% through 2019 to 22% in 2021. After 2021, the Commercial ITC is retained at 10% while the individual solar investment tax credit is reduced to 0%. In fiscal 2019 we completed a transaction to purchase solar equipment in accordance with IRS safe harbor guidance, allowing us to preserve the current ITC rates for solar projects that are completed after the scheduled reduction in rates. During December 2017, the current administration and Congress passed comprehensive reform of the Code which resulted in the reduction or elimination of various industry-specific tax incentives in return for an overall reduction in corporate tax rates. These changes are likely to result in a wide range of impacts to the U.S. solar industry and our business. For more information about how we avail ourselves of the benefits of public policies and the risks related to public policies, please see the risk factors set forth under the caption \"Part I. Item 1A. Risk Factors-Risks Related to Our Sales Channels,\" including \"-The reduction, modification or elimination of government incentives could cause our revenue to decline and harm our financial results\" and \"-Existing regulations and policies and changes to these regulations and policies may present technical, regulatory, and economic barriers to the purchase and use of solar power products, which may significantly reduce demand for our products and services.\"\nSupply\nWe are focused on delivering complete solar power generation solutions to our customers. As part of our solutions-focused approach, we launched our SunPower Helix product for our commercial business customers during fiscal 2015 and our SunPower Equinox product for our residential business customers during fiscal 2016. The Equinox and Helix systems are pre-engineered modular solutions for residential and commercial applications, respectively, that combine our high-efficiency solar module technology with integrated plug-and-play power stations, cable management systems, and mounting hardware that enable our customers to quickly and easily complete system installations and manage their energy production. Our Equinox systems utilize our latest Maxeon Gen 3 cell and ACPV technology for residential applications, where we are also expanding our initiatives on storage and Smart Energy solutions. Additionally, we continue to focus on producing our new lower cost, high efficiency P-Series product line and our A-Series (Maxeon 5) product line, which will enhance our ability to rapidly expand our global footprint with minimal capital cost.\nWe continue to see significant and increasing opportunities in technologies and capabilities adjacent to our core product offerings that can significantly reduce our customers' CCOE, including the integration of energy storage and energy management functionality into our systems, and have made investments to realize those opportunities, enabling our customers to make intelligent energy choices by addressing how they buy energy, how they use energy, and when they use it. We have added advanced module-level control electronics to our portfolio of technology designed to enable longer series strings and significant balance of system components cost reductions in large arrays. We currently offer solar panels that use microinverters designed to eliminate the need to mount or assemble additional components on the roof or the side of a building and enable optimization and monitoring at the solar panel level to ensure maximum energy production by the solar system.\nWe continue to improve our unique, differentiated solar cell and panel technology. We emphasize improvement of our solar cell efficiency and LCOE and CCOE performance through enhancement of our existing products, development of new products and reduction of manufacturing cost and complexity in conjunction with our overall cost-control strategies. We are now producing production efficiencies for our solar cells of over 25% and our solar panels of over 22%.\nWe monitor and change our overall solar cell manufacturing output in an ongoing effort to match profitable demand\nlevels, with increasing bias toward our highest efficiency X-Series (Maxeon 3) product platform, which utilizes our latest solar cell technology, and our P-Series product, which utilizes conventional cell technology that we purchase from third parties in low-cost supply chain ecosystems such as China. We are focusing on our latest generation, lower cost panel assembly facilities in Mexico. We are also increasing production of our new P-Series technology at our newly-acquired U.S. manufacturing facility.\nWe are focused on reducing the cost of our solar panels and systems, including working with our suppliers and partners along all steps of the value chain to reduce costs by improving manufacturing technologies, expanding economies of scale and reducing manufacturing cost and complexity in conjunction with our overall cost-control strategies. We believe that the global demand for solar systems is highly elastic and that our current aggressive, but achievable, cost reduction roadmap will reduce installed costs for our customers across both of our business segments and drive increased demand for our solar solutions.\nWe also work with our suppliers and partners to ensure the reliability of our supply chain. We have contracted with some of our suppliers for multi-year supply agreements, under which we have annual minimum purchase obligations. For more information about our purchase commitments and obligations, see \"Liquidity and Capital Resources-Contractual Obligations\" and \"Item 1. Financial Statements-Note 4. Business Divestiture and Sale of Assets\" and \"Note 9. Commitments and Contingencies.\"\nWe currently believe our supplier relationships and various short- and long-term contracts will afford us the volume of material and services required to meet our planned output; however, we face the risk that the pricing of our long-term supply contracts may exceed market value. For example, we purchase our polysilicon under fixed-price long-term supply agreements. The pricing under these agreements significantly in excess of market value results in inventory write-downs based on expected net realizable value. Additionally, existing arrangements from prior years have resulted in above current market pricing for purchasing polysilicon, resulting in inventory losses we have realized. For several years now, we have elected to sell polysilicon inventory in excess of short-term needs to third parties at a loss, and may enter into further similar transactions in future periods. For more information about these risks, see the risk factors set forth under the caption \"Part 1. Item 1A. Risk Factors-Risks Related to Our Supply Chain,\" including \"-Our long-term, firm commitment supply agreements could result in excess or insufficient inventory, place us at a competitive disadvantage on pricing, or lead to disputes, each of which could impair our ability to meet our cost reduction roadmap, and in some circumstances may force us to take a significant accounting charge\" and \"-We will continue to be dependent on a limited number of third-party suppliers for certain raw materials and\ncomponents for our products, which could prevent us from delivering our products to our customers within required time frames and could in turn result in sales and installation delays, cancellations, penalty payments and loss of market share.\"\nResults of Operations\nResults of

Increase and decrease by segments is further discussed below.\nOur total revenue decreased by 4% during fiscal 2018 as compared to fiscal 2017, primarily due to reduced sales in our SunPower Technologies Segment in the U.S. and in Asia as result of our decision to cease the development of large-scale solar power projects. We sold our remaining U.S. power plant development portfolio in the third quarter of fiscal 2018. This was partially offset by an increase in our SunPower Energy Services Segment in the proportion of capital leases placed in service relative to total leases placed in service under our residential leasing program within the U.S., as well as stronger sales of solar power systems and components to residential customers in all regions, and stronger sales of commercial solar power projects in all regions.\nWe did not have customers that accounted for greater than 10% of total revenue in the years ended December 29, 2019 and December 30, 2018.\nRevenue - by Segment:\nA description of our segments, along with other required information can be found in Note 17, \"Segment and Geographical Information\" of the consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of Part II, which is incorporated herein by reference.\nBelow, we have further discussed increase and decrease in revenue for each segment.\nTable 14: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Fiscal Year </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(In thousands, except percentages) </td> <td> </td> <td>December 29, 2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>% Change </td> <td> </td> <td>December 30, 2018 </td> <td> </td> <td>% Change </td> <td> </td> <td>December 31, 2017 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>SunPower Energy Services </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,148,006 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,143,967 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(2) </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,170,253 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>SunPower Technologies1\n</td> <td> </td> <td>1,314,076 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>24 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>1,059,506 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(26) </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>1,425,254 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Intersegment Eliminations and other </td> <td> </td> <td>(597,857) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>25 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>(477,388) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(40) </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>(801,460) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total Revenue </td> <td> </td> <td>1,864,225 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>8 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>1,726,085 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(4) </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>1,794,047 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nSunPower Energy Services\nOverall, revenue for the segment remained flat during fiscal 2019 as compared to fiscal 2018. Higher volume of sales to our residential customers, was partially offset by a decrease in our commercial business.\nRevenue from residential customers increased 10% during fiscal 2019 as compared to fiscal 2018, primarily due to a higher volume in residential deals, as well as an increase in the sales of solar power components and systems to our residential customers in the U.S., partially offset by lower third-party dealer cash transactions. Revenue from commercial customers decreased 24% during fiscal 2019 as compared to fiscal 2018 primarily due to reduction in power generation revenue due to sale of our commercial sale-leaseback portfolio in the first and second quarters of fiscal 2019, and lower volume of systems sales and EPC contracts.\nRevenue from residential customers increased 28% during fiscal 2018 as compared to fiscal 2017, primarily due to a higher volume in residential deals together with the increased proportion of capital leases placed in service relative to total leases placed in service under our residential leasing program within the U.S., as well as an increase in the sales of solar power components and systems to our residential customers in the U.S., partially offset by lower third-party dealer cash transactions. Revenue from commercial customers decreased 57% during fiscal 2018 as compared to fiscal 2017 primarily because of weaker sales of EPC and PPA commercial systems.\nSunPower Technologies\nRevenue for the segment increased 24% during fiscal 2019 as compared to fiscal 2018, primarily due to higher volume of module sales in Europe and Asia, as well as revenue from sale of development projects in Japan, Chile, and Mexico.\nRevenue for the segment decreased 26% during fiscal 2018 as compared to fiscal 2017, primarily due to divesting our U.S. power plant development portfolio during the third quarter of fiscal 2018 partially offset by increased sales of power plant development and solar power solutions sales in regions outside of the U.S.\nConcentrations:\nOur SunPower Energy Services Segment as a percentage of total revenue recognized was 62% during fiscal 2019 as compared to 66% during fiscal 2018. The relative change in revenue for SunPower Energy Services Segment as a percentage of total revenue recognized reflects the impact of a significant increase in revenue in SunPower Technologies Segment. Our SunPower Technologies Segment as a percentage of total revenue recognized was 70% during fiscal 2019, as compared to 61% during fiscal 2018. The relative change in revenue for SunPower Technologies Segment as a percentage of total revenue recognized reflects higher volume of module sales in Europe and Asia, as well as revenue from sale of development projects in Japan, Chile, and Mexico.\nTable 15: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Fiscal Year </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(As a percentage of total revenue) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>2018 </td> <td> </td> <td>2017 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Significant Customer: </td> <td>Business Segment: </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Actis GP LLP </td> <td>Power Plant </td> <td> </td> <td>n/a </td> <td> </td> <td>* </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>13 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table>\n* percentage is less than 10%.\nTotal Cost of Revenue:\nOur total cost of revenue decreased 14% during fiscal 2019 as compared to fiscal 2018, primarily due to the non-cash impairment charge of $355.1 million during fiscal 2018, offset by increases in cost of revenue in both SunPower Energy Services segment and SunPower Technology segment. Increase and decrease by segments is discussed below in detail.\nOur total cost of revenue increased 12% during fiscal 2018 as compared to fiscal 2017, primarily as a result of a non-cash impairment charge of $355.1 million, total tariffs charge of approximately $42.5 million, higher volume in U.S. residential deals, and increased cost in solar power solutions in our sales to commercial customers. The increase was partially offset by lower project cost in our sales to power plant following our decision to cease the development of large-scale power projects. During fiscal 2018, we incurred a write-down of $24.7 million on certain solar development projects which we sold during the third quarter of fiscal 2018. In addition, we incurred charges totaling $31.6 million recorded in connection with the contracted sale of raw material inventory to third parties during 2018.\nTable 16: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Fiscal Year </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(In thousands, except percentages) </td> <td> </td> <td>December 29, 2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>% Change </td> <td> </td> <td>December 30, 2018 </td> <td> </td> <td>% Change </td> <td> </td> <td>December 31, 2017 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>SunPower Energy Services </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,026,832 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,001,879 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(4) </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,040,885 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>SunPower Technologies1\n</td> <td> </td> <td>1,142,671 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>10 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>1,040,456 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(19) </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>1,289,681 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Intersegment elimination and other </td> <td> </td> <td>(431,183) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,149 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>(19,169) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(96) </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>(517,874) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total Cost of Revenue </td> <td> </td> <td>1,738,320 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(14) </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>2,023,166 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>12 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>1,812,692 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\n1 Balance is net of intersegment elimination\nCost of Revenue - by Segment:\nBelow, we have further discussed increase and decrease in cost of revenue for each segment.\nSunPower Energy Services\nCost of revenue for the segment increased by 2% during fiscal 2019 as compared to fiscal 2018, primarily due to a higher volume of sales to our residential customers, partially offset by a decrease in our commercial business as a result of sale of commercial sale-leaseback portfolio in the first and second quarter of fiscal 2019.\nCost of revenue for the segment decreased by 4% during fiscal 2018 as compared to fiscal 2017, primarily due to a higher volume of sales to our residential customers.\nSunPower Technologies\nCost of revenue for the segment increased by 10% during fiscal 2019 as compared to fiscal 2018, primarily due to higher volume of module sales in Europe and Asia, offset by a gain on the sale and leaseback of our Oregon manufacturing facility, (refer to Note 4 Business Divestiture and Sale of Assets for further details), as well as a reduction in cost of revenues relating to power plant development as we ceased the development of large-scale solar power projects in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018.\nCost of revenue for the segment decreased by 19% during fiscal 2018 as compared to fiscal 2017, primarily due to divesting our U.S. power plant development portfolio during the third quarter of fiscal 2018 partially offset by increased sales of power plant development and solar power solutions sales in regions outside of the U.S.\nGross Margin\nOur gross margin increased from (17%) in fiscal 2018 to 7% in fiscal 2019, primarily due to non-cash impairment charges on certain property, plant and equipment recorded in fiscal 2018.\nOur gross margin decreased from (1%) in fiscal 2017 to (17%) in fiscal 2018, primarily due to non-cash impairment charges on certain property, plant and equipment recorded in fiscal 2018.\nGross Margin -

Gross margin improved primarily due to a higher volume in residential deals together with the increased proportion of capital leases placed in service on residential sales, offset by lower margin on sales to residential customers and higher cost incurred related to solar power solutions deals.\nSunPower Technologies\nGross margin for the segment increased by 11%, during fiscal 2019 as compared to fiscal 2018, primarily due to higher volume of module sales in Europe and Asia, as well as the sale of development projects in Japan and Chile, and profit contributed by the gain on sale and leaseback of our Oregon manufacturing facility.\nGross margin for our SunPower Technologies Segment decreased by 8% during fiscal 2018 as compared to fiscal 2017, primarily as a result of lower volume in sales, and reduction due to pressure on project pricing due to increased global competition and other factors.\nResearch and Development (\"R&D\")\nTable 18: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Fiscal Year </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(In thousands, except percentages) </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>2018 </td> <td> </td> <td>2017 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>R&D </td> <td> </td> <td>67,515 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>81,705 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>82,247 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>As a percentage of revenue </td> <td> </td> <td>4 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>5 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>5 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table>\nR&D expense decreased by $14.2 million during the fiscal 2019 as compared to fiscal 2018, primarily due to a decrease in labor and facility costs as a result of reductions in headcount driven by our February 2018 restructuring plan.\nR&D expense decreased by $0.5 million during fiscal 2018 as compared to fiscal 2017. The decrease was primarily due to a decrease in labor costs as a result of reductions in headcount and salary expenses driven by our February 2018 restructuring plan.

During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019, we adopted a restructuring plan (\"December 2019 Restructuring Plan\") to realign and optimize workforce requirements in light of recent changes to its business, including the previously announced planned spin-off of Maxeon Solar. Total costs incurred under the December 2019 Plan during fiscal 2019 was $7.4 million. See \"Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data-Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements-Note 8 Restructuring\" in the Notes to the consolidated financial statements in this annual report on Form 10-K for further information regarding our restructuring plans. As a result of the December 2019 Restructuring Plan, we expect to generate total cost savings of $1.3 million of operating expenses and $1.3 million of cost of goods sold, which are expected to be cash savings, primarily from a reduction in U.S. workforce, with effects beginning the first quarter of 2020. Actual savings realized may, however, differ if our assumptions are incorrect or if other unanticipated events occur.\nRestructuring charges decreased by $3.5 million during fiscal 2018 as compared to fiscal 2017, primarily because we have incurred slightly lower severance and benefits charges in connection with the February 2018 restructuring plan compared to the facilities related expenses in the prior periods in connection with our December 2016 restructuring plan. See \"Item 8. Financial Statements-Note 9. Restructuring\" in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further information regarding our restructuring plans. As a result of the February 2018 restructuring plan, we expected to generate annual cost savings of approximately $20.5 million in operating expenses, which are expected to be cash savings primarily from a reduction in global workforce, and the effects commenced in the first quarter of fiscal 2018. Actual savings realized may, however, differ if our assumptions are incorrect or if other unanticipated events occur.\nLoss on sale and impairment of residential lease assets\nTable 21: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Fiscal Year </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(In thousands, except percentages) </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>2018 </td> <td> </td> <td>2017 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Loss on sale and impairment of residential lease assets </td> <td> </td> <td>25,352 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>251,984 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>624,335 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>As a percentage of revenue </td> <td> </td> <td>1 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>15 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>35 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table>\nLoss on sale and impairment of residential lease assets decreased by $226.6 million during the fiscal 2019 as compared to fiscal 2018, primarily due to the sale of a majority of our residential lease assets portfolio in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018. During fiscal year 2019, we sold the remaining portion of the portfolio of residential lease assets to SunStrong Capital Holdings, LLC, and recorded a loss on sale of $7.2 million.\nIn the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017, in conjunction with our efforts to generate more available liquid funds in the near-term, we made the decision to sell a portion of our interest in our Residential Lease Portfolio. As a result, in the fourth quarter\nof fiscal 2017, we determined it was necessary to evaluate the potential for impairment in our ability to recover the carrying amount of our Residential Lease Portfolio. As a result of our evaluation, we recognized noncash impairment charges of $624.3 million. In fiscal 2018, we continued recording additional non-cash impairment charges through the sale of a portion of our equity interests in SunStrong, our previously wholly-owned subsidiary, to Hannon Armstrong in November 2018. During the year ended December 30, 2018, we recognized, in aggregate, loss on sale and impairment of residential lease assets of $252.0 million on the consolidated statements of operations for fiscal 2018.

The change is primarily due to a $54.2 million gain on the sale of our equity method investments in fiscal 2018, a $73.0 million impairment charge in fiscal 2017 in our 8point3 Energy Partners LP equity investment balance due to the adoption of ASC 606 which materially increased the investment balance and consequently, led to the recognition of an other-than-temporary impairment in the first quarter of fiscal 2017.\nIncome Taxes\nTable 24: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Fiscal Year </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(In thousands, except percentages) </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>2018 </td> <td> </td> <td>2017 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Benefit from (provision for) income taxes </td> <td> </td> <td>(26,631) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(1,010) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3,944 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>As a percentage of revenue </td> <td> </td> <td>(1) </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table>\nIn the year ended December 29, 2019, our income tax provision of $26.6 million on a profit before income taxes and equity in earnings (losses) of unconsolidated investees of $26.0 million was primarily due to related tax expense in foreign jurisdictions that were profitable. In the year ended December 30, 2018, our income tax provision of $1.0 million on a loss before income taxes and equity in earnings of unconsolidated investees of $898.7 million was also primarily due to tax expense in foreign jurisdictions that were profitable, offset by tax benefit related to release of valuation allowance in a foreign jurisdiction and release of tax reserve due to lapse of statutes of limitation. The income tax benefit of $3.9 million in the year ended December 31, 2017 on a loss before income taxes and equity in earnings of unconsolidated investees of $1,200.8 million, was primarily due to the related tax effects of the carryback of fiscal 2016 net operating losses to fiscal 2015 domestic tax returns, partially offset by tax expense in profitable jurisdictions.\nWe record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets in the U.S., Malta, South Africa, Spain, and Mexico to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized. In assessing the need for a valuation allowance, we consider historical levels of income, expectations and risks associated with the estimates of future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies. In the event we determine that we would be able to realize additional deferred tax assets in the future in excess of the net recorded amount, or if we subsequently determine that realization of an amount previously recorded is unlikely, we would record an adjustment to the deferred tax asset valuation allowance, which would change income tax in the period of adjustment.\nA material amount of our total revenue is generated from customers located outside of the United States, and a substantial portion of our assets and employees are located outside of the United States. Because of the one-time transition tax related to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act enacted in 2017, a significant portion of the accumulated foreign earnings were deemed to have been repatriated, and accordingly taxed, and were no longer subject to the U.S. federal deferred tax liability, and the post-2017 accumulated foreign-sourced earnings are generally not taxed in the U.S. upon repatriation. Foreign withholding taxes have not been provided on the existing undistributed earnings of our non-U.S. subsidiaries as of December 29, 2019 as these are intended to be indefinitely reinvested in operations outside the United States.\nIn June 2019, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit overturned the 2015 U.S. tax court decision in Altera Co v. Commissioner, regarding the inclusion of stock-based compensation costs under cost sharing agreements. In July 2019, Altera Corp., a subsidiary of Intel Inc., requested en banc review of the decision from the Ninth Circuit panel and the request was denied in November 2019. In February 2020, Altera Corp. petitioned the U.S. Supreme Court for review. While a final decision remains outstanding, we quantified and recorded the impact of the case of $5.8 million as a reduction to deferred tax asset, fully offset by a reduction to valuation allowance of the same amount, without any income tax expense impact. If the Altera Ninth Circuit opinion is reversed by the U.S. Supreme Court, we would anticipate unwinding the reduction to both deferred tax asset and valuation allowance impact as aforementioned. We will continue to monitor the effects of the case's outcome on our tax provision and related disclosures once more information becomes available.\nEquity in Earnings (Losses) of Unconsolidated Investees\nTable 25: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Fiscal Year </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(In thousands, except percentages) </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>2018 </td> <td> </td> <td>2017 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Equity in earnings (losses) of unconsolidated investees </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(7,058) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(17,815) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>25,938 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>As a percentage of revenue </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>(1) </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>1 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table>\nOur equity in losses of unconsolidated investees decreased by $10.8 million in fiscal 2019 as compared to fiscal 2018, primarily driven by a decrease in our share of losses of unconsolidated investees, specifically, 8point3 Energy Partners and its affiliates (the \"8point3 Group\") which we divested in June 2018.\nOur equity in earnings (losses) of unconsolidated investees decreased $43.8 million in fiscal 2018 as compared to fiscal 2017, primarily driven by the activities of the 8point3 Group, which we divested in June 2018. As a result of this transaction, we received, after the payment of fees and expenses, merger proceeds of approximately $359.9 million in cash and no longer\ndirectly or indirectly owns any equity interests in the 8point3 Group. In connection with the sale, we recognized a $34.4 million gain within \"Other, net\" in \"Other income (expense), net\" of our consolidated statements of operations for fiscal 2018.\nNet Loss Attributable to Noncontrolling Interests and Redeemable Noncontrolling Interests\nTable 26: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Fiscal Year </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(In thousands, except percentages) </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>2018 </td> <td> </td> <td>2017 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net loss attributable to noncontrolling interests and redeemable noncontrolling interests </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>29,880 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>106,405 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>241,747 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe have entered into facilities with third-party tax equity investors under which the investors invest in a structure known as a partnership flip. We determined that we hold controlling interests in these less-than-wholly-owned entities and therefore we have fully consolidated these entities. We apply the HLBV method in allocating recorded net income (loss) to each investor based on the change in the reporting period, of the amount of net assets of the entity to which each investor would be entitled to under the governing contractual arrangements in a liquidation scenario.\nIn fiscal 2019, we attributed $29.9 million of net losses primarily to the third-party investors as a result of allocating certain assets, including tax credits and accelerated tax depreciation benefits, to the investors. The $76.5 million decrease in net loss attributable to noncontrolling interests and redeemable noncontrolling interests is primarily due to the deconsolidation of a majority of our residential lease assets in the last quarter of fiscal 2018 and during the third quarter of fiscal 2019, and partially offset by an increase in contributions by Hannon Armstrong for the equity interest in a new joint venture formed during the third quarter of fiscal 2019.\nIn fiscal 2018 and 2017, we attributed $106.4 million and $241.7 million, respectively, of net losses primarily to the third-party investors as a result of allocating certain assets, including tax credits and accelerated tax depreciation benefits, to the investors. The $135.3 million increase in net loss attributable to noncontrolling interests and redeemable noncontrolling interests is primarily attributable to the allocated portion of the impairment charge related to our residential lease assets of $150.6 million (see \"Item 1. Financial Statements-Note 7. Leasing\"), and an increase in total number of leases placed in service under new and existing facilities with third-party investors.\nCritical Accounting Estimates\nWe prepare our consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, which requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, and expenses recorded in our financial statements. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions and conditions. In addition to our most critical estimates discussed below, we also have other key accounting policies that are less subjective and, therefore, judgments involved in their application would not have a material impact on our reported results of operations (See \"Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data-Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements-Note 1. Organization and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\").\nRevenue Recognition\nModule and Component Sales\nWe sell our solar panels and balance of system components primarily to dealers, system integrators and distributors, and recognizes revenue at a point in time when control of such products transfers to the customer, which generally occurs upon shipment or delivery depending on the terms of the contracts with the customer. There are no rights of return. Other than standard warranty obligations, there are no significant post-shipment obligations (including installation, training or customer acceptance clauses) with any of our customers that could have an impact on revenue recognition. Our revenue recognition policy is consistent across all geographic areas.\nSolar Power System Sales and Engineering, Procurement, and Construction Services\nWe design, manufacture and sell rooftop and ground-mounted solar power systems under construction and development agreements, to our residential and commercial customers. In contracts where we sell completed systems as a single performance obligation, primarily to our joint venture for residential projects, we recognize revenue at the point-in-time when such systems are placed in service. Any advance payments received before control is transferred is classified as \"contract liabilities.\"\nEngineering, procurement and construction (\"EPC\") projects governed by customer contracts that require us to deliver functioning solar power systems are generally completed within three to twelve months from commencement of construction. Construction on large projects may be completed within eighteen to thirty-six months, depending on the size and location. We recognize revenue from EPC services over time as our performance creates or enhances an energy generation asset controlled by the customer. We use an input method based on cost incurred as we believe that this method most accurately reflects our progress toward satisfaction of the performance obligation. Under this method, revenue arising from fixed-price construction contracts is recognized as work is performed based on the ratio of costs incurred to date to the total estimated costs at completion of the performance obligations.\nIncurred costs include all direct material, labor and subcontract costs, and those indirect costs related to contract performance, such as indirect labor, supplies, and tools. Project material costs are included in incurred costs when the project materials have been installed by being permanently attached or fitted to the solar power system as required by the project's engineering design. Cost-based input methods of revenue recognition require us to make estimates of net contract revenues and costs to complete the projects. In making such estimates, significant judgment is required to evaluate assumptions related to the amount of net contract revenues, including the impact of any performance incentives, liquidated damages, and other payments to customers. Significant judgment is also required to evaluate assumptions related to the costs to complete the projects, including materials, labor, contingencies, and other system costs. If the estimated total costs on any contract are greater than the net contract revenues, we recognize the entire estimated loss in the period the loss becomes known and can be reasonably estimated.\nOur arrangements may contain clauses such as contingent repurchase options, delay liquidated damages or early performance bonus, most favorable pricing, or other provisions that can either increase or decrease the transaction price. These variable amounts generally are awarded upon achievement of certain performance metrics or milestones. Variable consideration is estimated at each measurement date at its most likely amount to the extent that it is probable that a significant reversal of cumulative revenue recognized will not occur and true-ups are applied prospectively as such estimates change.\nChanges in estimates for sales of systems and EPC services occur for a variety of reasons, including but not limited to (i) construction plan accelerations or delays, (ii) product cost forecast changes, (iii) change orders, or (iv) changes in other information used to estimate costs. The cumulative effect of revisions to transaction prices or input cost estimates are recorded in the period in which the revisions to estimates are identified and the amounts can be reasonably estimated.\nOperations and Maintenance\nWe offer our customers various levels of post-installation operations and maintenance (\"O&M\") services with the objective of optimizing our customers' electrical energy production over the life of the system. We determine that the post-installation systems monitoring and maintenance qualifies as a separate performance obligation. Post-installation monitoring and maintenance is deferred at the time the contract is executed, based on the estimate of selling price on a standalone basis, and is recognized to revenue over time as customers receive and consume benefits of such services. The non-cancellable term of the O&M contracts are typically 90 days for commercial and residential customers and 180 days for power plant customers.\nWe typically provide a system output performance warranty, separate from our standard solar panel product warranty, to customers that have subscribed to our post-installation O&M services. In connection with system output performance warranties, we agree to pay liquidated damages in the event the system does not perform to the stated specifications, with certain exclusions. The warranty excludes system output shortfalls attributable to force majeure events, customer curtailment, irregular weather, and other similar factors. In the event that the system output falls below the warrantied performance level during the applicable warranty period, and provided that the shortfall is not caused by a factor that is excluded from the performance warranty, the warranty provides that we will pay the customer an amount based on the value of the shortfall of energy produced relative to the applicable warrantied performance level. Such liquidated damages represent a form of variable consideration and are estimated at contract inception and updated at each reporting period and recognized over time as customers receive and consume the benefits of the O&M services.\nLease Accounting\nEffective December 31, 2018, we adopted Accounting Standards Update (\"ASU\") No. 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842), as amended (\"ASC 842\"). For additional information on the changes resulting from the new standard and the impact to our financial results on adoption, refer to the section Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements below.\nArrangements with SunPower as a lessee\nWe determine if an arrangement is a lease at inception. Our operating lease agreements are primarily for real estate and are included within operating lease right-of-use (\"ROU\") assets and operating lease liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets. We elected the practical expedient to combine our lease and related non-lease components for all our leases.\nROU assets represent our right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and lease liabilities represent our obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease. ROU assets and lease liabilities are recognized at the commencement date based on the present value of lease payments over the lease term. Variable lease payments are excluded from the ROU assets and lease liabilities and are recognized in the period in which the obligation for those payments is incurred. As most of our leases do not provide an implicit rate, we use our incremental borrowing rate based on the information available at commencement date in determining the present value of lease payments. ROU assets also include any lease prepayments made and exclude lease incentives. Many of our lessee agreements include options to extend the lease, which we do not include in our minimum lease terms unless they are reasonably certain to be exercised. Rental expense for lease payments related to operating leases is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term.\nSale-Leaseback Arrangements\nWe enter into sale-leaseback arrangements under which solar power systems are sold to third parties and subsequently leased back by us over lease terms of up to 25 years.\nWe classify our initial sale-leaseback arrangements of solar power systems as operating leases or sales-type leases, in accordance with the underlying accounting guidance on leases. We may sell our lessee interests in these arrangements in entirety before the end of the underlying term of the leaseback.\nFor all sale-leaseback arrangements classified as operating leases, the profit related to the excess of the proceeds compared to the fair value of the solar power systems is deferred and recognized over the term of the lease. Sale-leaseback arrangements classified as finance leases or failed sale, are accounted for under the financing method, the proceeds received from the sale of the solar power systems are recorded as financing liabilities. The financing liabilities are subsequently reduced by our payments to lease back the solar power systems, less interest expense calculated based on our incremental borrowing rate adjusted to the rate required to prevent negative amortization. Refer to Note 4. Business Divestiture and Sale of Assets, for details of the sale of our commercial sale-leaseback portfolio during fiscal 2019.\nArrangements with SunPower as a lessor\nSolar Services\nWe offer solar services, in partnership with third-party financial institutions, which allows our residential customers to obtain continuous access to SunPower solar power systems under contracts for terms of up to 20 years. Solar services revenue is primarily comprised of revenue from such contracts wherein we provide continuous access to an operating solar system to third parties.\nWe begin to recognize revenue on solar services when permission to operate (\"PTO\") is given by the local utility company, the system is interconnected and operation commences. We recognize revenue evenly over the time that we satisfy our performance obligations over the initial term of the solar services contracts. Solar services contracts typically have an initial term of 20 years. After the initial contract term, our customers may request an extension of the term of the contract on prevailing market terms, or request to remove the system. Otherwise, the contract will automatically renew and continue on a month-to-month basis.\nWe also apply for and receive Solar Renewable Energy Credits (\"SRECs\") associated with the energy generated by our solar energy systems and sell them to third parties in certain jurisdictions. SREC revenue is estimated net of any variable consideration related to possible liquidated damages if we were to deliver fewer SRECs than contractually committed, and is generally recognized upon delivery of the SRECs to the counterparty.\nWe typically provide a system output performance warranty, separate from our standard solar panel product warranty, to our solar services customers. In connection with system output performance warranties, we agree to pay liquidated damages in the event the system does not perform to the stated specifications, with certain exclusions. The warranty excludes system output shortfalls attributable to force majeure events, customer curtailment, irregular weather, and other similar factors. In the event that the system output falls below the warrantied performance level during the applicable warranty period, and provided that the shortfall is not caused by a factor that is excluded from the performance warranty, the warranty provides that we will pay the customer an amount based on the value of the shortfall of energy produced relative to the applicable warrantied performance level. Such liquidated damages represent a form of variable consideration and are estimated at contract inception and updated at each reporting period and recognized over time as customers receive and consume the benefits of the solar services.\nThere are rebate programs offered by utilities in various jurisdictions and are issued directly to homeowners, based on the lease agreements, the homeowners assign these rights to rebate to us. These rights to rebate are considered non-cash consideration, measured based on the utilities' rebates from the installed solar panels on the homeowners' roofs and recognized over the lease term.\nRevenue from solar services contracts entered into prior to the adoption of ASC 842 were accounted for as leases under the superseded lease accounting guidance and reported within \"Residential leasing\" on the consolidated statement of operations.\nShipping and Handling Costs\nWe account for shipping and handling activities related to contracts with customers as costs to fulfill our promise to transfer goods and, accordingly, records such costs in cost of revenue.\nTaxes Collected from Customers and Remitted to Governmental Authorities\nWe exclude from our measurement of transaction prices all taxes assessed by governmental authorities that are both (i) imposed on and concurrent with a specific revenue-producing transaction and (ii) collected from customers. Accordingly, such tax amounts are not included as a component of revenue or cost of revenue.\nImpairment of Residential Lease Assets\nWe evaluate our long-lived assets, including property, plant and equipment, solar power systems leased and to be leased, and other intangible assets with finite lives, for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of such assets may not be recoverable. Factors considered important that could result in an impairment review include significant under-performance relative to expected historical or projected future operating results, significant changes in the manner of use of acquired assets, and significant negative industry or economic trends. Our impairment evaluation of long-lived assets includes an analysis of estimated future undiscounted net cash flows expected to be generated by the assets over their remaining estimated useful lives. If our estimate of future undiscounted net cash flows is insufficient to recover the carrying value of the assets over the remaining estimated useful lives, we record an impairment loss in the amount by which the carrying value of the assets exceeds the fair value. Fair value is generally measured based on either quoted market prices, if available, or discounted cash flow analysis.\nFinancing receivables are generated by solar power systems leased to residential customers under sales-type leases. Financing receivables represent gross minimum lease payments to be received from customers over a period commensurate with the remaining lease term and the system's estimated residual value, net of unearned income and allowance for estimated losses. Our evaluation of the recoverability of these financing receivables is based on evaluation of the likelihood, based on current information and events, and whether we will be able to collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the underlying lease agreements. In accordance with this evaluation, we recognize an allowance for losses on financing receivables based on our estimate of the amount equal to the probable losses net of recoveries. The combination of the leased solar power systems discussed in the preceding paragraph together with the lease financing receivables is referred to as the \"Residential Lease Portfolio.\"\nWe performed a recoverability test for assets in the residential assets by estimating future undiscounted net cash flows\nexpected to be generated by the assets, based on our own specific alternative courses of action under consideration. The\nalternative courses were either to sell or refinance the assets, or hold the assets until the end of their previously estimated useful\nlives. Upon consideration of the alternatives, we determined that market value, in the form of indicative purchase price from a\nthird-party investor was available for a portion of our residential assets. As we intend to sell these remaining residential portfolio assets, we used the indicative purchase price from a third-party investor as fair value of the underlying net assets in our impairment evaluation.\nAllowance for Doubtful Accounts and Sales Returns\nWe maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments. A considerable amount of judgment is required to assess the likelihood of the ultimate realization of accounts receivable. We make our estimates of the collectability of our accounts receivable by analyzing historical bad debts, specific customer creditworthiness and current economic trends.\nIn addition, at the time revenue is recognized from the sale of solar panels and balance of system components, we record estimates for sales returns which reduce revenue. These estimates are based on historical sales returns and analysis of credit memo data, among other known factors.\nProduct Warranties\nWe generally provide a 25-year standard warranty for solar panels that we manufacture for defects in materials and workmanship. The warranty provides that we will repair or replace any defective solar panels during the warranty period. In addition, we pass through to customers' long-term warranties from the original equipment manufacturers of certain system components, such as inverters. Warranties of 25 years from solar panel suppliers are standard in the solar industry, while certain system components carry warranty periods ranging from five to 20 years.\nIn addition, we generally warrant our workmanship on installed systems for periods ranging up to 25 years and also provide a separate system output performance warranty to customers that have subscribed to our post-installation monitoring and maintenance services which expires upon termination of the post-installation monitoring and maintenance services related to the system. The warrantied system output performance level varies by system depending on the characteristics of the system and the negotiated agreement with the customer, and the level declines over time to account for the expected degradation of the system. Actual system output is typically measured annually for purposes of determining whether warrantied performance levels have been met. The warranty excludes system output shortfalls attributable to force majeure events, customer curtailment, irregular weather, and other similar factors. In the event that the system output falls below the warrantied performance level during the applicable warranty period, and provided that the shortfall is not caused by a factor that is excluded from the performance warranty, the warranty provides that we will pay the customer a liquidated damage based on the value of the shortfall of energy produced relative to the applicable warrantied performance level.\nWe maintain reserves to cover the expected costs that could result from these warranties. Our expected costs are generally in the form of product replacement or repair. Warranty reserves are based on our best estimate of such costs and are recognized as a cost of revenue. We continuously monitor product returns for warranty failures and maintain a reserve for the related warranty expenses based on various factors including historical warranty claims, results of accelerated lab testing, field monitoring, vendor reliability estimates, and data on industry averages for similar products. Due to the potential for variability in these underlying factors, the difference between our estimated costs and our actual costs could be material to our consolidated financial statements. If actual product failure rates or the frequency or severity of reported claims differ from our estimates or if there are delays in our responsiveness to outages, we may be required to revise our estimated warranty liability. Historically, warranty costs have been within management's expectations.\nInventories\nInventories are accounted for on a first-in-first-out basis and are valued at the lower of cost or net realizable value. We evaluate the realizability of our inventories, including future purchase commitments under fixed-price long-term supply agreements, based on assumptions about expected demand and market conditions. Our assumption of expected demand is developed based on our analysis of bookings, sales backlog, sales pipeline, market forecast and competitive intelligence. Our assumption of expected demand is compared to available inventory, production capacity, future polysilicon purchase commitments, available third-party inventory and growth plans. Our factory production plans, which drive materials requirement planning, are established based on our assumptions of expected demand. We respond to reductions in expected demand by temporarily reducing manufacturing output and adjusting expected valuation assumptions as necessary. In addition, expected demand by geography has changed historically due to changes in the availability and size of government mandates and economic incentives.\nWe evaluate the terms of our long-term inventory purchase agreements with suppliers for the procurement of polysilicon, ingots, wafers, and solar cells and establish accruals for estimated losses on adverse purchase commitments as necessary, such as lower of cost or net realizable value adjustments, forfeiture of advanced deposits and liquidated damages. Obligations related to non-cancellable purchase orders for inventories match current and forecasted sales orders that will consume these ordered materials and actual consumption of these ordered materials are compared to expected demand regularly. We anticipate total obligations related to long-term supply agreements for inventories will be realized because quantities are less than management's expected demand for its solar power products over a period of years; however, if raw materials inventory balances temporarily exceed near-term demand, we may elect to sell such inventory to third parties to optimize working capital needs. In addition, because the purchase prices required by our long-term polysilicon agreements are significantly higher than current market prices for similar materials, if we are not able to profitably utilize this material in our operations or elect to sell near-term excess, we may incur additional losses. Other market conditions that could affect the realizable value of our inventories and are periodically evaluated by management include the aging of inventories on hand, historical inventory turnover ratio, anticipated sales price, new product development schedules, the effect new products might have on the sale of existing products, product obsolescence, customer concentrations, the current market price of polysilicon as compared to the price in our fixed-price arrangements, and product merchantability, among other factors. If, based on assumptions about expected demand and market conditions, we determine that the cost of inventories exceeds its net realizable value or inventory is excess or obsolete, or we enter into arrangements with third parties for the sale of raw materials that do not allow us to recover our current contractually committed price for such raw materials, we record a write-down or accrual, which may be material, equal to the difference between the cost of inventories and the estimated net realizable value. If actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management, additional inventory write-downs may be required that could negatively affect our gross margin and operating results. If actual market conditions are more favorable, we may have higher gross margin when products that have been previously written down are sold in the normal course of business. Additionally, the Company's classification of its inventory as either current or long-term inventory requires it to estimate the portion of on-hand inventory that we estimate will be realized over the next 12 months.\nStock-Based Compensation\nWe provide stock-based awards to our employees, executive officers and directors through various equity compensation plans including our employee stock option and restricted stock plans. We measure and record compensation expense for all stock-based payment awards based on estimated fair values. The fair value of restricted stock awards and units is based on the market price of our common stock on the date of grant. We have not granted stock options since fiscal 2008. We are required under current accounting guidance to estimate forfeitures at the date of grant. Our estimate of forfeitures is based on our historical activity, which we believe is indicative of expected forfeitures. In subsequent periods if the actual rate of forfeitures differs from our estimate, the forfeiture rates are required to be revised, as necessary. Changes in the estimated forfeiture rates can have a significant effect on stock-based compensation expense since the effect of adjusting the rate is recognized in the period the forfeiture estimate is changed.\nWe also grant performance share units to executive officers and certain employees that require us to estimate expected achievement of performance targets over the performance period. This estimate involves judgment regarding future expectations of various financial performance measures. If there are changes in our estimate of the level of financial performance measures expected to be achieved, the related stock-based compensation expense may be significantly increased or reduced in the period that our estimate changes.\nVariable Interest Entities (\"VIE\")\nWe regularly evaluate our relationships and involvement with unconsolidated VIEs and our other equity and cost method investments, to determine whether we have a controlling financial interest in them or have become the primary beneficiary, thereby requiring us to consolidate their financial results into our financial statements. In connection with the sale of the equity interests in the entities that hold solar power plants, we also consider whether we retain a variable interest in the entity sold, either through retaining a financial interest or by contractual means. If we determine that the entity sold is a VIE and that we hold a variable interest, we then evaluate whether we are the primary beneficiary. If we determine that we are the primary beneficiary, we will consolidate the VIE. The determination of whether we are the primary beneficiary is based upon whether we have the power to direct the activities that most directly impact the economic performance of the VIE and whether we absorb any losses or benefits that would be potentially significant to the VIE.\nAccounting for Business Divestitures\nFrom time to time, we may dispose of significant assets or portion of our business by sale or exchange for other assets. In accounting for such transactions, we apply the applicable guidance of U.S. GAAP pertaining to discontinued operations and disposals of components of an entity. We assess such transaction as regards specified significance measures to determine whether a disposal qualifies as a discontinuance of operations verses a sale of asset components of our entity. Our assessment includes how such a disposal may represent a significant strategic shift in our operations and its impact on our continuing involvement as regards that portion of our business. Instances where disposals do not remove our ability to participate in a significant portion of our business are accounted as disposal of assets. Instances where disposals remove our ability to participate in a significant portion of our business are accounted as discontinued operations. For additional details see Note 4. Business Combinations and Divestitures\" under \"Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data-Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\" We charge disposal related costs that are not part of the consideration to general and administrative expense as they are incurred. These costs typically include transaction and disposal costs, such as legal, accounting, and other professional fees.\nLong-Lived Assets\nOur long-lived assets include property, plant and equipment, solar power systems leased and to be leased, and other intangible assets with finite lives. We evaluate our long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of such assets may not be recoverable. Factors considered important that could result in an impairment review include significant under-performance relative to expected historical or projected future operating results, significant changes in the manner of use of acquired assets and significant negative industry or economic trends. Our impairment evaluation of long-lived assets includes an analysis of estimated future undiscounted net cash flows expected to be generated by the assets over their remaining estimated useful lives. If our estimate of future undiscounted net cash flows is insufficient to recover the carrying value of the assets over the remaining estimated useful lives, we record an impairment loss in the amount by which the carrying value of the assets exceeds the fair value. Fair value is generally measured based on either quoted market prices, if available, or discounted cash flow analyses.\nAccounting for Income Taxes\nOur global operations involve manufacturing, research and development, and selling and project development activities. Profit from non-U.S. activities is subject to local country taxation. It is our intention to indefinitely reinvest these earnings outside the United States. We record a valuation allowance to reduce our U.S., Malta, South Africa, Mexico, and Spain entities' deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized. In assessing the need for a valuation allowance, we consider historical levels of income, expectations and risks associated with the estimates of future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies. In the event we determine that we would be able to realize additional deferred tax assets in the future in excess of the net recorded amount, or if we subsequently determine that realization of an amount previously recorded is unlikely, we would record an adjustment to the deferred tax asset valuation allowance, which would change income tax in the period of adjustment. As of December 29, 2019, we believe there is insufficient evidence to realize additional deferred tax assets beyond the U.S. net operating losses that can be benefited through a carryback election; however, the reversal of the valuation allowance, which could be material, could occur in a future period.\nThe calculation of tax expense and liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex global tax regulations, including in the tax valuation of projects sold to tax equity partnerships and other third parties. We recognize potential liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues in the United States and other tax jurisdictions based on our estimate of whether, and the extent to which, additional taxes will be due. If payment of these amounts ultimately proves to be unnecessary, the reversal of the liabilities would result in tax benefits being recognized in the period in which we determine the liabilities are\nno longer necessary. If the estimate of tax liabilities proves to be less than the ultimate tax assessment, a further charge to expense would result. We accrue interest and penalties on tax contingencies which are classified as \"Provision for income taxes\" in our Consolidated Statements of Operations and are not considered material. In addition, foreign exchange gains (losses) may result from estimated tax liabilities which are expected to be realized in currencies other than the U.S. dollar.\nPursuant to the Tax Sharing Agreement with Cypress, our former parent company, we are obligated to indemnify Cypress upon current utilization of carryforward tax attributes generated while we were part of the Cypress consolidated or combined group. Further, to the extent Cypress experiences any tax examination assessments attributable to our operations while part of the Cypress consolidated or combined group, Cypress will require an indemnification from us for those aspects of the assessment that relate to our operations. See also \"Item 1A. Risk Factors - Risks Related to Our Operations-Our agreements with Cypress require us to indemnify Cypress for certain tax liabilities. These indemnification obligations and related contractual restrictions may limit our ability to pursue certain business initiatives.\"\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nCash Flows\nA summary of the sources and uses of cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash and restricted cash equivalents is as follows:\nTable 27: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Fiscal Year Ended </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(In thousands) </td> <td> </td> <td>December 29, 2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>December 30, 2018 </td> <td> </td> <td>December 31, 2017 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash used in operating activities </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(270,413) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(543,389) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(267,412) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash provided by (used in) investing activities </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>21,366 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>274,900 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(293,084) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash provided by financing activities </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>344,314 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>85,847 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>589,932 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nOperating Activities\nNet cash used in operating activities for the year ended December 29, 2019 was $270.4 million and was primarily the result of: (i) $158.3 million mark-to-market gain on equity investments with readily determinable fair value; (ii) $143.4 million gain on business divestiture; (iii) $128.4 million increase in inventories to support the construction of our solar energy projects; (iv) $66.2 million increase in accounts receivable, primarily driven by billings in excess of collections; (v) $38.2 million increase in contract assets driven by construction activities; (vi) $25.2 million gain on sale of assets; (vii) $17.3 million gain on sale of equity investments without readily determinable fair value; (viii) $8.9 million decrease in operating lease liabilities; (ix) $8.8 million increase in prepaid expenses and other assets, primarily related to movements in prepaid inventory; (x) net loss of $7.7 million; and (xi) $2.2 million increase in project assets, primarily related to the construction of our commercial solar energy projects.

As a result of these factoring arrangements, title of certain accounts receivable balances was transferred to third-party vendors, and both arrangements were accounted for as a sale of financial assets given effective control over these financial assets has been surrendered. As a result, these financial assets have been excluded from our consolidated balance sheets. In connection with the factoring arrangements, we sold accounts receivable invoices amounting to $119.4 million and $26.3 million in fiscal 2019 and 2018, respectively. As of December 29, 2019 and December 30, 2018, total uncollected accounts receivable from end customers under both arrangements were $11.6 million and $21.0 million, respectively.\nNet cash used in operating activities in fiscal 2018 was $543.4 million and was primarily the result of: (i) net loss of $917.5 million; (ii) $182.9 million increase in long-term financing receivables related to our net investment in sales-type leases; (iii) $127.3 million decrease in accounts payable and other accrued liabilities, primarily attributable to payments of accrued expenses; (iv) $59.3 million gain on business divestiture; (v) $54.2 million gain on the sale of equity investments; (vi) $43.5 million increase in contract assets driven by construction activities; (vii) $39.2 million increase in inventories due to the support of various construction projects; (viii) $30.5 million decrease in contract liabilities driven by construction activities; (ix) $6.9 million increase in deferred income taxes; (x) $6.8 million increase due to other various activities; and (xi) $0.2 million increase in accounts receivable, primarily driven by billings. This was partially offset by: (i) impairment of property, plant and equipment of $369.2 million; (ii) impairment of residential lease assets of $189.7 million; (iii) net non-cash charges of $162.1 million related to depreciation, stock-based compensation and other non-cash charges; (iv) loss on sale of residential lease assets of $62.2 million; (v) $44.4 million decrease in advance payments made to suppliers; (vi) $39.5 million decrease in project assets, primarily related to the construction of our Commercial solar energy projects; (vii) $22.8 million decrease in prepaid expenses and other assets, primarily related to the receipt of prepaid inventory; (viii) $17.8 million decrease in equity in earnings of unconsolidated investees; (ix) $6.9 million net change in income taxes; (x) $6.4 million unrealized loss on equity investments with readily determinable fair value; and (xi) $3.9 million dividend from equity method investees.\nNet cash used in operating activities in fiscal 2017 was $267.4 million and was primarily the result of: (i) net loss of $1,170.9 million; (ii) $216.3 million decrease in accounts payable and other accrued liabilities, primarily attributable to payment of accrued expenses; (iii) $123.7 million increase in long-term financing receivables related to our net investment in\nsales-type leases; (iv) $38.2 million increase in inventories to support the construction of our solar energy projects; (vi) $25.9 million increase in equity in earnings of unconsolidated investees; (vii) $7.0 million net change in income taxes; (viii) $5.3 million gain on sale of equity method investment; and (ix) $1.2 million decrease in accounts receivable, primarily driven by collections; This was partially offset by: (i) $624.3 million impairment of residential lease assets; (ii) other net non-cash charges of $239.6 million related to depreciation, stock-based compensation and other non-cash charges; (iii) $145.2 million increase in contract liabilities driven by construction activities; (iv) $110.5 million decrease in prepaid expenses and other assets, primarily related to the receipt of prepaid inventory; (v) $89.6 million impairment of 8point3 Energy Partners investment balance; (vi) $68.8 million decrease in advance payments made to suppliers; (vii) $30.1 million dividend from 8point3 Energy Partners; (viii) $10.7 million decrease in contract assets driven by milestone billings; (ix) $2.3 million decrease in project assets, primarily related to the construction of our commercial and power plant solar energy projects\nInvesting Activities\nNet cash provided by investing activities in the year ended December 29, 2019 was $21.4 million, which included (i) proceeds of $60.0 million from sale of property, plant, and equipment; (ii) $42.9 million proceeds from sale of investments; (iii) net proceeds of $40.5 million from business divestiture; and (iv) $2.0 million of proceeds resulting from realization of estimated receivables from a business divestiture.

This was partially offset by: (i) $167.0 million in capital expenditures primarily related to the expansion of our solar cell manufacturing capacity and costs associated with solar power systems, leased and to be leased; and (ii) $14.7 million paid for investments in consolidated and unconsolidated investees.\nNet cash used in investing activities in fiscal 2017 was $293.1 million, which included (i) $283.0 million in capital expenditures primarily related to the expansion of our solar cell manufacturing capacity and costs associated with solar power systems, leased and to be leased; (ii) $18.6 million paid for investments in consolidated and unconsolidated investees; and (iii) $1.3 million purchase of marketable securities. This was partially offset by proceeds from the sale of investment in joint ventures of $6.0 million and a $3.8 million dividend from equity method investees.\nFinancing Activities\nNet cash provided by financing activities in the year ended December 29, 2019 was $344.3 million, which included: (i) $171.9 million from the common stock offering; (ii) $110.9 million in net proceeds of bank loans and other debt; (iii) $69.2 million net proceeds from the issuance of non-recourse residential financing, net of issuance costs; (iv) $35.5 million of net contributions from noncontrolling interests and redeemable noncontrolling interests related to residential lease projects; (v) $3.0 million of proceeds from issuance of non-recourse power plant and commercial financing, net of issuance costs.

This was partially offset by: (i) 19.1 million in net repayments of bank loans and other debt; and (ii) $4.7 million in purchases of treasury stock for tax withholding obligations on vested restricted stock.\nDebt and Credit Sources\nConvertible Debentures\nAs of December 29, 2019, an aggregate principal amount of $425.0 million of the 4.00% senior convertible debentures due 2023 (the \"4.00% debentures due 2023\") remained issued and outstanding. The 4.00% debentures due 2023 were issued on December 15, 2015. Interest on the 4.00% debentures due 2023 is payable on January 15 and July 15 of each year, beginning on July 15, 2016. Holders are able to exercise their right to convert the debentures at any time into shares of our common stock at an initial conversion price approximately equal to $30.53 per share, subject to adjustment in certain circumstances. If not earlier repurchased or converted, the 4.00% debentures due 2023 mature on January 15, 2023. Holders may require us to repurchase all or a portion of their 4.00% debentures due 2023, upon a fundamental change, as described in the related indenture, at a cash repurchase price equal to 100% of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest. If we undergo a non-stock change of control, as described in the related indenture, the 4.00% debentures due 2023 will be subject to redemption at our option, in whole but not in part, for a period of 30 calendar days following a repurchase date relating to the non-stock change of control, at a cash redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest. Otherwise, the 4.00% debentures due 2023 are not redeemable at our option prior to the maturity date. In the event of certain events of default, Wells Fargo Bank, National Association (\"Wells Fargo\"), the trustee, or the holders of a specified amount of then-outstanding 4.00% debentures due 2023 will have the right to declare all amounts then outstanding due and payable.\nAs of December 29, 2019, an aggregate principal amount of $400.0 million of the 0.875% senior convertible debentures due 2021 (the 0.875% debentures due 2021\u201d) remained issued and outstanding. The 0.875% debentures due 2021 were issued on June 11, 2014. Interest on the 0.875% debentures due 2021 is payable on June 1 and December 1 of each year. Holders are able to exercise their right to convert the debentures at any time into shares of our common stock at an initial conversion price approximately equal to $48.76 per share, subject to adjustment in certain circumstances. If not earlier repurchased or converted, the 0.875% debentures due 2021 mature on June 1, 2021. Holders may require us to repurchase all or a portion of their 0.875% debentures due 2021, upon a fundamental change, as described in the related indenture, at a cash repurchase price equal to 100% of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest. If we undergo a non-stock change of control, as described in the related indenture, the 0.875% debentures due 2021 will be subject to redemption at our option, in whole but not in part, for a period of 30 calendar days following a repurchase date relating to the non-stock change of control, at a cash redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest. Otherwise, the 0.875% debentures due 2021 are not redeemable at our option prior to the maturity date. In the event of certain events of default, Wells Fargo, the trustee, or the holders of a specified amount of then-outstanding 0.875% debentures due 2021 will have the right to declare all amounts then outstanding due and payable. (See \"Item 8. Financial Statements - Note 18. Subsequent Event\")\nLoan Agreement with California Enterprise Development Authority (\"CEDA\")\nOn December 29, 2010, we borrowed from CEDA the proceeds of the $30.0 million aggregate principal amount of CEDA's tax-exempt Recovery Zone Facility Revenue Bonds (SunPower Corporation - Headquarters Project) Series 2010 (the \"Bonds\") maturing April 1, 2031 under a loan agreement with CEDA. Certain of our obligations under the loan agreement were contained in a promissory note dated December 29, 2010 issued by us to CEDA, which assigned the promissory note, along with all right, title and interest in the loan agreement, to Wells Fargo, as trustee, with respect to the Bonds for the benefit of the holders of the Bonds. The Bonds bear interest at a fixed-rate of 8.50% per annum. As of December 29, 2019, the fair value of the Bonds was $32.1 million, determined by using Level 2 inputs based on quarterly market prices as reported by an independent pricing source.\nAs of December 29, 2019, the $30.0 million aggregate principal amount of the Bonds was classified as \"Long-term debt\" in our consolidated balance sheets.\nRevolving Credit Facility with Credit Agricole\nOn October 29, 2019, we entered into a new Green Revolving Credit Agreement (the 2019 Revolver\u201d) with Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Corporate and Investment Bank ( Credit Agricole\u201d), as lender, with a revolving credit commitment of $55.0 million. The 2019 Revolver contains affirmative covenants, events of default and repayment provisions customarily applicable to similar facilities and has a per annum commitment fee of 0.05% on the daily unutilized amount, payable quarterly. Loans under the 2019 Revolver bear either an adjusted LIBOR interest rate for the period elected for such loan or a floating interest rate of the higher of prime rate, federal funds effective rate, or LIBOR for an interest period of one month, plus an applicable margin, ranging from 0.25% to 0.60%, depending on the base interest rate applied, and each matures on the earlier of April 29, 2021, or the termination of commitments thereunder. Our payment obligations under the 2019 Revolver are guaranteed by Total S.A. up to the maximum aggregate principal amount of $55.0 million. In consideration of the commitments of Total S.A., we are required\nto pay them a guaranty fee of 0.25% per annum on any amounts borrowed under the 2019 Revolver and to reimburse Total S.A. for any amounts paid by them under the parent guaranty. We have pledged the equity of a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company that holds our shares of Enphase Energy, Inc. common stock to secure our reimbursement obligation under the 2019 Revolver. We have also agreed to limit our ability to draw funds under the 2019 Revolver, to no more than 67% of the fair market value of the common stock held by our subsidiary at the time of the draw.\nAs of December 29, 2019, we had no outstanding borrowings under the 2019 Revolver.\nSeptember 2011 Letter of Credit Facility with Deutsche Bank and Deutsche Bank Trust Company Americas (together, \"Deutsche Bank Trust\")\nOn September 27, 2011, we entered into a letter of credit facility with Deutsche Bank Trust which provides for the issuance, upon request by us, of letters of credit to support our obligations in an aggregate amount not to exceed $200.0 million. Each letter of credit issued under the facility is fully cash-collateralized and we have entered into a security agreement with Deutsche Bank Trust, granting them a security interest in a cash collateral account established for this purpose.\nAs of December 29, 2019, letters of credit issued under the Deutsche Bank Trust facility totaled $3.6 million, which was fully collateralized with restricted cash as classified on the consolidated balance sheets.\nOther Facilities\nAsset-Backed Loan with Bank of America\nOn March 29, 2019, we entered in a Loan and Security Agreement with Bank of America, N.A., which provides a revolving credit facility secured by certain inventory and accounts receivable in the maximum aggregate principal amount of $50.0 million. The Loan and Security Agreement contains negative and affirmative covenants, events of default and repayment and prepayment provisions customarily applicable to asset-backed credit facilities. The facility bears a floating interest rate of LIBOR plus an applicable margin, and matures on the earlier of March 29, 2022, a date that is 91 days prior to the maturity of our 2021 convertible debentures, or the termination of the commitments thereunder. During fiscal 2019, we drew loans totaling $31.3 million, under this facility and we repaid loans of $12.2 million, leaving a balance outstanding of $19.2 million as of December 29, 2019.\nSunTrust Facility\nOn June 28, 2018, we entered into a Financing Agreement with SunTrust Bank, which provides a revolving credit facility in the maximum aggregate principal amount of $75.0 million. Each loan draw from the facility bears interest at either a base rate or federal funds rate plus an applicable margin or a floating interest rate of LIBOR plus an applicable margin, and matures no later than three years following the date of the draw. As of December 29, 2019, we had $75.0 million in borrowing capacity under this limited recourse construction financing facility.\nNon-recourse Financing and Other Debt\nIn order to facilitate the construction, sale or ongoing operation of certain solar projects, including our residential leasing program, we regularly obtain project-level financing. These financings are secured either by the assets of the specific project being financed or by our equity in the relevant project entity and the lenders do not have recourse to our general assets for repayment of such debt obligations, and hence the financings are referred to as non-recourse. Non-recourse financing is typically in the form of loans from third-party financial institutions, but also takes other forms, including \"flip partnership\" structures, sale-leaseback arrangements, or other forms commonly used in the solar or similar industries. We may seek non-recourse financing covering solely the construction period of the solar project or may also seek financing covering part or all of the operating life of the solar project. We classify non-recourse financings in our consolidated balance sheets in accordance with their terms; however, in certain circumstances, we may repay or refinance these financings prior to stated maturity dates in connection with the sale of the related project or similar circumstances. In addition, in certain instances, the customer may assume the loans at the time that the project entity is sold to the customer. In these instances, subsequent debt assumption is reflected as a financing outflow and operating inflow in the consolidated statements of cash flows to reflect the substance of the assumption as a facilitation of customer financing from a third party.\nLiquidity\nAs of December 29, 2019, we had unrestricted cash and cash equivalents of $423.0 million as compared to $309.4 million as of December 30, 2018. Our cash balances are held in numerous locations throughout the world, and as of December 29, 2019, we had approximately $79.6 million held outside of the United States. This offshore cash is used to fund operations of our business in the Europe and Asia Pacific regions as well as non-U.S. manufacturing operations, which require local payment for product materials and other expenses. The amounts held outside of the United States represent the earnings of our foreign subsidiaries which under the enacted Tax Act, incurred a one-time transition tax (such amounts were previously tax deferred), however, would not result in a cash payment due to our cumulative net operating loss position. We expect total capital expenditures related to purchases of property, plant and equipment of approximately $96.8 million in fiscal 2020 in order to increase our manufacturing capacity for our highest efficiency A-Series (Maxeon 5) product platform and our P-Series technology, improve our current and next generation solar cell manufacturing technology, and other projects. In addition, while we have begun the transition away from our project development business, we still expect to invest capital to develop solar power systems and plants for sale to customers. The development of solar power plants can require long periods of time and substantial initial investments. Our efforts in this area may consist of all stages of development, including land acquisition, permitting, financing, construction, operation and the eventual sale of the projects. We often choose to bear the costs of such efforts prior to the final sale to a customer, which involves significant upfront investments of resources (including, for example, large transmission deposits or other payments, which may be non-refundable), land acquisition, permitting, legal and other costs, and in some cases the actual costs of constructing a project, in advance of the signing of PPAs and EPC contracts and the receipt of any revenue, much of which is not recognized for several additional months or years following contract signing. Any delays in disposition of one or more projects could have a negative impact on our liquidity.\nCertain of our customers also require performance bonds issued by a bonding agency or letters of credit issued by financial institutions, which are returned to us upon satisfaction of contractual requirements. If there is a contractual dispute with the customer, the customer may withhold the security or make a draw under such security, which could have an adverse impact on our liquidity. Obtaining letters of credit may require adequate collateral. All letters of credit issued under our 2016 Guaranteed LC Facilities are guaranteed by Total S.A. pursuant to the Credit Support Agreement. Our September 2011 letter of credit facility with Deutsche Bank Trust is fully collateralized by restricted cash, which reduces the amount of cash available for operations. As of December 29, 2019, letters of credit issued under the Deutsche Bank Trust facility amounted to $3.6 million which were fully collateralized with restricted cash on our consolidated balance sheets.\nSolar power plant projects often require significant up-front investments. These include payments for preliminary engineering, permitting, legal, and other expenses before we can determine whether a project is feasible. We often make arrangements with third-party financiers to acquire and build solar power systems or to fund project construction using non-recourse project debt. As of December 29, 2019, outstanding amounts related to our project financing totaled $9.1 million.\nThere are no assurances, however, that we will have sufficient available cash to repay our indebtedness or that we will be able to refinance such indebtedness on similar terms to the expiring indebtedness. If our capital resources are insufficient to satisfy our liquidity requirements, we may seek to sell additional equity investments or debt securities or obtain other debt financing. The current economic environment, however, could limit our ability to raise capital by issuing new equity or debt securities on acceptable terms, and lenders may be unwilling to lend funds on acceptable terms in the amounts that would be required to supplement cash flows to support operations. The sale of additional equity investments or convertible debt securities would result in additional dilution to our stockholders (and the potential for further dilution upon the exercise of warrants or the conversion of convertible debt) and may not be available on favorable terms or at all, particularly in light of the current conditions in the financial and credit markets. Additional debt would result in increased expenses and would likely impose new restrictive covenants which may be similar or different than those restrictions contained in the covenants under our current loan agreements and debentures. In addition, financing arrangements, including project financing for our solar power plants and letters of credit facilities, may not be available to us, or may not be available in amounts or on terms acceptable to us.\nWhile challenging industry conditions and a competitive environment extended throughout fiscal 2019, we believe that our total cash and cash equivalents, including cash expected to be generated from operations, will be sufficient to meet our obligations over the next 12 months from the date of issuance of our consolidated financial statements. Also, we have been successful in our ability to divest certain investments and non-core assets, such as the sale of membership interests in our Commercial Sale-Leaseback Portfolio, and the sale and leaseback of Hillsboro facility (Note 4. Business Divestiture and Sale of Assets). Additionally, we have secured other sources of financing to satisfy our liquidity needs such as the issuance of common stock through the public offering completed in November 2019 and realizing cash savings resulting from restructuring actions and cost reduction initiatives (Note 14. Common Stock and Note 8. Restructuring). We continue to focus on improving our overall operating performance and liquidity, including managing cash flows and working capital.\nWhile we have not drawn on it, we also have the ability to enhance our available cash by borrowing up to $55 million under our 2019 Revolver. See Note 11. Debt and Credit Sources.\nAlthough we have historically been able to generate liquidity, we cannot predict, with certainty, the outcome of our actions to generate liquidity as planned.\nContractual Obligations\nThe following table summarizes our contractual obligations as of December 29, 2019:\nTable 28: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Payments Due by Fiscal Period </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(In thousands) </td> <td> </td> <td>Total </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2021-2022 </td> <td> </td> <td>2023-2024 </td> <td> </td> <td>Beyond 2024 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Convertible debt, including interest1\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>881,958 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>20,500 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>435,750 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>425,708 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>CEDA loan, including interest2\n</td> <td> </td> <td>59,325 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,550 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5,100 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5,100 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>46,575 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other debt, including interest3\n</td> <td> </td> <td>209,283 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>114,437 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>89,153 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,048 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3,645 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Future financing commitments4\n</td> <td> </td> <td>2,900 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,900 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating lease commitments5\n</td> <td> </td> <td>110,312 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>15,390 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>29,189 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>17,902 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>47,831 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Finance lease commitments6\n</td> <td> </td> <td>2,087 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>627 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,282 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>178 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Non-cancellable purchase orders7\n</td> <td> </td> <td>154,653 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>154,653 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Purchase commitments under agreements8\n</td> <td> </td> <td>513,803 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>354,666 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>119,197 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>33,858 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6,082 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Deferred purchase consideration in connection with acquisition9\n</td> <td> </td> <td>30,000 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>30,000 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,964,321 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>695,723 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>679,671 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>484,794 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>104,133 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\n1Convertible debt, including interest, relates to the aggregate of $825.0 million in outstanding principal amount of our senior convertible debentures on December 29, 2019. For the purpose of the table above, we assume that all holders of the outstanding debentures will hold the debentures through the date of maturity, and upon conversion, the values of the senior convertible debentures will be equal to the aggregate principal amount with no premiums.\n2CEDA loan, including interest, relates to the proceeds of the $30.0 million aggregate principal amount of the Bonds. The Bonds mature on April 1, 2031 and bear interest at a fixed rate of 8.50% through maturity.\n3Other debt, including interest, primarily relates to non-recourse finance projects and solar power systems and leases under our residential lease program as described in \"Item 1. Financial Statements-Note 9. Commitments and Contingencies\" in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\n4In connection with purchase and joint venture agreements with non-public companies, we will be required to provide additional financing to such parties of up to $2.9 million, subject to certain conditions.\n5Operating lease commitments primarily relate to certain solar power systems leased from unaffiliated third parties over minimum lease terms of up to 20 years as of December 29, 2019, and various facility lease agreements including leases entered into that have not yet commenced.\n6Finance lease commitments primarily relate to certain buildings, manufacturing and equipment under capital leases in Europe for terms of up to 6 years.\n7Non-cancellable purchase orders relate to purchases of raw materials for inventory and manufacturing equipment from a variety of vendors.\n8Purchase commitments under agreements primarily relate to arrangements entered into with several suppliers, including some of our unconsolidated investees, for polysilicon, ingots, wafers, and module-level power electronics and alternating current cables, among others. These agreements specify future quantities and pricing of products to be supplied by the vendors for periods up to 5 years and there are certain consequences, such as forfeiture of advanced deposits and liquidated damages relating to previous purchases, in the event we terminate these arrangements.\n9In connection with the acquisition of AUO SunPower Sdn. Bhd. in 2016, we are required to make noncancellable annual installment payments during 2019 and 2020. The payment due in fiscal 2019 was made on the first day of the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019.\nLiabilities Associated with Uncertain Tax Positions\nDue to the complexity and uncertainty associated with our tax positions, we cannot make a reasonably reliable estimate of the period in which cash settlement will be made for our liabilities associated with uncertain tax positions in other long-term liabilities. Therefore, they have been excluded from the table above. As of December 29, 2019 and December 30, 2018, total liabilities associated with uncertain tax positions were $20.1 million and $16.8 million, respectively, and are included within \"Other long-term liabilities\" in our consolidated balance sheets as they are not expected to be paid within the next twelve months.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nAs of December 29, 2019, we did not have any significant off-balance sheet arrangements, as defined in Item 303(a)(4)(ii) of SEC Regulation S-K.", "item_7_truncated": "ITEM 7: MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nCautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\nYou should read the following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 29, 2019.\nThis Annual Report on Form 10-K contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.

For more information about our business, please refer to the section titled \"Part I. Item 1. Business\" in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 29, 2019.\nRecent Developments\nEffective December 31, 2018, we adopted Accounting Standards Update ( ASU\u201d) No. 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842), as amended (\"ASC 842\") using the optional transition method as discussed in \"Part I-Item 1. Financial Statements-Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements-Note 1. Organization and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\" of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nKey transactions during the fiscal quarter ended December 29, 2019 include the following:\nAnnouncement of Separation Transaction\nOn November 8, 2019, we entered into the Separation and Distribution Agreement with Maxeon Solar. The Separation and Distribution Agreement governs the principal corporate transactions required to effect the separation and the Spin-Off distribution, and provides for the allocation between SunPower and Maxeon Solar of the assets, liabilities, and obligations of the respective companies as of the separation. In addition, the Separation and Distribution Agreement, together with certain Ancillary Agreements, provide a framework for the relationship between SunPower and Maxeon Solar subsequent to the completion of the Spin-Off. Also on November 8, 2019, we entered into the Investment Agreement with Maxeon Solar, TZS, and, for the limited purposes set forth therein, Total. Pursuant to the Investment Agreement, we, Maxeon Solar, TZS and, with respect to certain provisions, Total have agreed to certain customary representations, warranties and covenants, including\ncertain representations and warranties as to the financial statements, contracts, liabilities, and other attributes of Maxeon Solar, certain business conduct restrictions and covenants requiring efforts to complete the transactions. The Spin-Off is intended to be tax-free to SunPower stockholders.\nCommon Stock Offering\nOn November 20, 2019, we completed an offering of 25,300,000 shares of the Company's common stock at a price of $7.00 per share, which included 3,300,000 shares issued and sold pursuant to the underwriter's exercise in full of its option to purchase additional shares, for gross proceeds of $177.1 million. We received net proceeds of $171.8 million from the offering, after deducting underwriter discounts which were recorded as a reduction of additional paid in capital. We incurred other expenses of $1.1 million for the transaction which was recorded in additional paid in capital (\"APIC\"). In addition, we incurred incremental organization costs in connection with the offering of $1.3 million which was recorded in the consolidated statement of operations. We intend to use the net proceeds from the offering for general corporate purposes, including partially funding the repayment of our senior convertible debentures. Refer to \"Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data-Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements- Note 18. Subsequent Events\" for further details.\nSegments Overview\nConsistent with fiscal 2018, our segment reporting consists of upstream and downstream structure. Under this segmentation, the SunPower Energy Services Segment (\"SunPower Energy Services\" or \"Downstream\") refers to sales of solar energy solutions in the North America region previously included in the legacy Residential Segment and Commercial Segment (collectively previously referred to as \"Distributed Generation\" or \"DG\") including direct sales of turn-key engineering, procurement and construction (\"EPC\") services, sales to our third-party dealer network, sales of energy under power purchase agreements (\"PPAs\"), storage solutions, cash sales and long-term leases directly to end customers, and sales to resellers. SunPower Energy Services Segment also includes sales of our global Operations and Maintenance (\"O&M\") services. The SunPower Technologies Segment (\"SunPower Technologies\" or \"Upstream\") refers to our technology development, worldwide solar panel manufacturing operations, equipment supply to resellers, commercial and residential end-customers outside of North America (\"International DG\"), and worldwide power plant project development and project sales. Some support functions and responsibilities have been shifted to each segment, including financial planning and analysis, legal, treasury, tax and accounting support and services, among others.\nThe operating structure provides our management with a comprehensive financial overview of our key businesses. The application of this structure permits us to align our strategic business initiatives and corporate goals in a manner that best focuses our businesses and support operations for success.\nOur Chief Executive Officer, as the chief operating decision maker ( CODM\u201d), reviews our business, manages resource allocations and measures performance of our activities between the SunPower Energy Services Segment and SunPower Technologies Segment.\nFor more information about our business segments, see the section titled \"Part I. Item 1. Business\" of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 29, 2019. For more segment information, see \"Item 1. Financial Statements-Note 17. Segment Information and Geographical Information\" in the notes to the consolidated financial statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nFiscal Years\nWe have a 52 to 53 week fiscal year that ends on the Sunday closest to December 31. Accordingly, every fifth or sixth year will be a 53 week fiscal year. Fiscal 2019, 2018 and 2017 are 52 week fiscal years. Our fiscal 2019 ended on December 29, 2019, fiscal 2018 ended on December 30, 2018 and fiscal 2017 ended on December 31, 2017.\nOutlook\nDemand\nDuring fiscal 2019, we faced market challenges, including competitive solar product pricing pressure and the impact of tariffs imposed pursuant to Section 201 and Section 301 of the Trade Act of 1974. On February 7, 2018, tariffs went into effect pursuant to Proclamation 9693, which approved recommendations to provide relief to U.S. manufacturers and imposed safeguard tariffs on imported solar cells and modules, based on the investigations, findings, and recommendations of the International Trade Commission. While solar cells and modules based on interdigitated back contact (\"IBC\") technology, like our X-Series (Maxeon 3), E-Series (Maxeon 2)A-Series (Maxeon 5) panels and related products, were granted exclusion from these safeguard tariffs on September 19, 2018, our solar products based on other technologies continue to be subject to the safeguard tariffs. On June 13, 2019, the Office of the United States Trade Representative ( USTR\u201d) published a notice describing its grant of exclusion requests for three additional categories of solar products. Beginning on June 13, 2019, the following categories of solar products are not subject to the Section 201 safeguard tariffs: (i) bifacial solar panels that absorb light and generate electricity on each side of the panel and that consist of only bifacial solar cells that absorb light and generate electricity on each side of the cells; (ii) flexible fiberglass solar panels without glass components other than fiberglass, such panels having power outputs ranging from 250 to 900 watts; and (iii) solar panels consisting of solar cells arranged in rows that are laminated in the panel and that are separated by more than 10 mm, with an optical film spanning the gaps between all rows that is designed to direct sunlight onto the solar cells, and not including panels that lack said optical film or only have a white or other backing layer that absorbs or scatters sunlight. We are working to understand the opportunities and challenges created by the exclusion of these products, as well as the impact of the exclusions on the demand and availability of competing products. However, the excluded technologies currently represent a small percentage of the global solar market.\nAdditionally, the USTR initiated an investigation under Section 301 of the Trade Act of 1974 into the government of China's acts, policies, and practices related to technology transfer, intellectual property, and innovation. The USTR imposed additional import duties of up to 25% on certain Chinese products covered by the Section 301 remedy. These tariffs include certain solar power system components and finished products, including those purchased from our suppliers for use in our products and used in our business. In the near term, imposition of these tariffs - on top of anti-dumping and countervailing duties on Chinese solar cells and modules, imposed under the prior administration - is likely to result in a wide range of impacts to the U.S. solar industry, global manufacturing market and our business. Such tariffs could cause market volatility, price fluctuations, and demand reduction. Uncertainties associated with the Section 201 and Section 301 trade cases prompted us to adopt a restructuring plan and implement initiatives to reduce operating expenses and cost of revenue overhead and improve cash flow. During fiscal 2019 and 2018, we incurred total tariffs charges of approximately $6.5 million and $42.5 million, respectively.\nIn fiscal 2019, focused on investments that we expected would offer the best opportunities for growth including our industry-leading A-Series (Maxeon 5) cell and panel technology, solar-plus-storage solutions and digital platform to improve customer service and satisfaction in our SunPower Energy Services offerings. We believe that our strategic decision to re-segment our business into an upstream and downstream structure, to focus our downstream efforts on our leading U.S. DG business while growing global sales of our upstream solar panel business through our SunPower Technologies business segment, will improve transparency and enable us to regain profitability.\nIn late fiscal 2015, the U.S. government enacted a budget bill that extended the solar commercial investment tax credit (the \"Commercial ITC\") under Section 48(c) of the Code, and the individual solar investment tax credit under Section 25D of the Code (together with the Commercial ITC, the \"ITC\") for five years, at rates gradually decreasing from 30% through 2019 to 22% in 2021. After 2021, the Commercial ITC is retained at 10% while the individual solar investment tax credit is reduced to 0%. In fiscal 2019 we completed a transaction to purchase solar equipment in accordance with IRS safe harbor guidance, allowing us to preserve the current ITC rates for solar projects that are completed after the scheduled reduction in rates. During December 2017, the current administration and Congress passed comprehensive reform of the Code which resulted in the reduction or elimination of various industry-specific tax incentives in return for an overall reduction in corporate tax rates. These changes are likely to result in a wide range of impacts to the U.S. solar industry and our business. For more information about how we avail ourselves of the benefits of public policies and the risks related to public policies, please see the risk factors set forth under the caption \"Part I. Item 1A. Risk Factors-Risks Related to Our Sales Channels,\" including \"-The reduction, modification or elimination of government incentives could cause our revenue to decline and harm our financial results\" and \"-Existing regulations and policies and changes to these regulations and policies may present technical, regulatory, and economic barriers to the purchase and use of solar power products, which may significantly reduce demand for our products and services.\"\nSupply\nWe are focused on delivering complete solar power generation solutions to our customers. As part of our solutions-focused approach, we launched our SunPower Helix product for our commercial business customers during fiscal 2015 and our SunPower Equinox product for our residential business customers during fiscal 2016. The Equinox and Helix systems are pre-engineered modular solutions for residential and commercial applications, respectively, that combine our high-efficiency solar module technology with integrated plug-and-play power stations, cable management systems, and mounting hardware that enable our customers to quickly and easily complete system installations and manage their energy production. Our Equinox systems utilize our latest Maxeon Gen 3 cell and ACPV technology for residential applications, where we are also expanding our initiatives on storage and Smart Energy solutions. Additionally, we continue to focus on producing our new lower cost, high efficiency P-Series product line and our A-Series (Maxeon 5) product line, which will enhance our ability to rapidly expand our global footprint with minimal capital cost.\nWe continue to see significant and increasing opportunities in technologies and capabilities adjacent to our core product offerings that can significantly reduce our customers' CCOE, including the integration of energy storage and energy management functionality into our systems, and have made investments to realize those opportunities, enabling our customers to make intelligent energy choices by addressing how they buy energy, how they use energy, and when they use it. We have added advanced module-level control electronics to our portfolio of technology designed to enable longer series strings and significant balance of system components cost reductions in large arrays. We currently offer solar panels that use microinverters designed to eliminate the need to mount or assemble additional components on the roof or the side of a building and enable optimization and monitoring at the solar panel level to ensure maximum energy production by the solar system.\nWe continue to improve our unique, differentiated solar cell and panel technology. We emphasize improvement of our solar cell efficiency and LCOE and CCOE performance through enhancement of our existing products, development of new products and reduction of manufacturing cost and complexity in conjunction with our overall cost-control strategies. We are now producing production efficiencies for our solar cells of over 25% and our solar panels of over 22%.\nWe monitor and change our overall solar cell manufacturing output in an ongoing effort to match profitable demand\nlevels, with increasing bias toward our highest efficiency X-Series (Maxeon 3) product platform, which utilizes our latest solar cell technology, and our P-Series product, which utilizes conventional cell technology that we purchase from third parties in low-cost supply chain ecosystems such as China. We are focusing on our latest generation, lower cost panel assembly facilities in Mexico. We are also increasing production of our new P-Series technology at our newly-acquired U.S. manufacturing facility.\nWe are focused on reducing the cost of our solar panels and systems, including working with our suppliers and partners along all steps of the value chain to reduce costs by improving manufacturing technologies, expanding economies of scale and reducing manufacturing cost and complexity in conjunction with our overall cost-control strategies. We believe that the global demand for solar systems is highly elastic and that our current aggressive, but achievable, cost reduction roadmap will reduce installed costs for our customers across both of our business segments and drive increased demand for our solar solutions.\nWe also work with our suppliers and partners to ensure the reliability of our supply chain. We have contracted with some of our suppliers for multi-year supply agreements, under which we have annual minimum purchase obligations. For more information about our purchase commitments and obligations, see \"Liquidity and Capital Resources-Contractual Obligations\" and \"Item 1. Financial Statements-Note 4. Business Divestiture and Sale of Assets\" and \"Note 9. Commitments and Contingencies.\"\nWe currently believe our supplier relationships and various short- and long-term contracts will afford us the volume of material and services required to meet our planned output; however, we face the risk that the pricing of our long-term supply contracts may exceed market value. For example, we purchase our polysilicon under fixed-price long-term supply agreements. The pricing under these agreements significantly in excess of market value results in inventory write-downs based on expected net realizable value. Additionally, existing arrangements from prior years have resulted in above current market pricing for purchasing polysilicon, resulting in inventory losses we have realized. For several years now, we have elected to sell polysilicon inventory in excess of short-term needs to third parties at a loss, and may enter into further similar transactions in future periods. For more information about these risks, see the risk factors set forth under the caption \"Part 1. Item 1A. Risk Factors-Risks Related to Our Supply Chain,\" including \"-Our long-term, firm commitment supply agreements could result in excess or insufficient inventory, place us at a competitive disadvantage on pricing, or lead to disputes, each of which could impair our ability to meet our cost reduction roadmap, and in some circumstances may force us to take a significant accounting charge\" and \"-We will continue to be dependent on a limited number of third-party suppliers for certain raw materials and\ncomponents for our products, which could prevent us from delivering our products to our customers within required time frames and could in turn result in sales and installation delays, cancellations, penalty payments and loss of market share.\"\nResults of Operations\nResults of

Technologies Segment. Increase and decrease by segments is further discussed below.\nOur total revenue decreased by 4% during fiscal 2018 as compared to fiscal 2017, primarily due to reduced sales in our SunPower Technologies Segment in the U.S. and in Asia as result of our decision to cease the development of large-scale solar power projects. We sold our remaining U.S. power plant development portfolio in the third quarter of fiscal 2018. This was partially offset by an increase in our SunPower Energy Services Segment in the proportion of capital leases placed in service relative to total leases placed in service under our residential leasing program within the U.S., as well as stronger sales of solar power systems and components to residential customers in all regions, and stronger sales of commercial solar power projects in all regions.\nWe did not have customers that accounted for greater than 10% of total revenue in the years ended December 29, 2019 and December 30, 2018.\nRevenue - by Segment:\nA description of our segments, along with other required information can be found in Note 17, \"Segment and Geographical Information\" of the consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of Part II, which is incorporated herein by reference.\nBelow, we have further discussed increase and decrease in revenue for each segment.\nTable 14: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Fiscal Year </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(In thousands, except percentages) </td> <td> </td> <td>December 29, 2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>% Change </td> <td> </td> <td>December 30, 2018 </td> <td> </td> <td>% Change </td> <td> </td> <td>December 31, 2017 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>SunPower Energy Services </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,148,006 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,143,967 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(2) </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,170,253 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>SunPower Technologies1\n</td> <td> </td> <td>1,314,076 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>24 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>1,059,506 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(26) </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>1,425,254 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Intersegment Eliminations and other </td> <td> </td> <td>(597,857) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>25 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>(477,388) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(40) </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>(801,460) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total Revenue </td> <td> </td> <td>1,864,225 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>8 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>1,726,085 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(4) </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>1,794,047 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nSunPower Energy Services\nOverall, revenue for the segment remained flat during fiscal 2019 as compared to fiscal 2018. Higher volume of sales to our residential customers, was partially offset by a decrease in our commercial business.\nRevenue from residential customers increased 10% during fiscal 2019 as compared to fiscal 2018, primarily due to a higher volume in residential deals, as well as an increase in the sales of solar power components and systems to our residential customers in the U.S., partially offset by lower third-party dealer cash transactions. Revenue from commercial customers decreased 24% during fiscal 2019 as compared to fiscal 2018 primarily due to reduction in power generation revenue due to sale of our commercial sale-leaseback portfolio in the first and second quarters of fiscal 2019, and lower volume of systems sales and EPC contracts.\nRevenue from residential customers increased 28% during fiscal 2018 as compared to fiscal 2017, primarily due to a higher volume in residential deals together with the increased proportion of capital leases placed in service relative to total leases placed in service under our residential leasing program within the U.S., as well as an increase in the sales of solar power components and systems to our residential customers in the U.S., partially offset by lower third-party dealer cash transactions. Revenue from commercial customers decreased 57% during fiscal 2018 as compared to fiscal 2017 primarily because of weaker sales of EPC and PPA commercial systems.\nSunPower Technologies\nRevenue for the segment increased 24% during fiscal 2019 as compared to fiscal 2018, primarily due to higher volume of module sales in Europe and Asia, as well as revenue from sale of development projects in Japan, Chile, and Mexico.\nRevenue for the segment decreased 26% during fiscal 2018 as compared to fiscal 2017, primarily due to divesting our U.S. power plant development portfolio during the third quarter of fiscal 2018 partially offset by increased sales of power plant development and solar power solutions sales in regions outside of the U.S.\nConcentrations:\nOur SunPower Energy Services Segment as a percentage of total revenue recognized was 62% during fiscal 2019 as compared to 66% during fiscal 2018. The relative change in revenue for SunPower Energy Services Segment as a percentage of total revenue recognized reflects the impact of a significant increase in revenue in SunPower Technologies Segment. Our SunPower Technologies Segment as a percentage of total revenue recognized was 70% during fiscal 2019, as compared to 61% during fiscal 2018. The relative change in revenue for SunPower Technologies Segment as a percentage of total revenue recognized reflects higher volume of module sales in Europe and Asia, as well as revenue from sale of development projects in Japan, Chile, and Mexico.\nTable 15: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Fiscal Year </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(As a percentage of total revenue) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>2018 </td> <td> </td> <td>2017 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Significant Customer: </td> <td>Business Segment: </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Actis GP LLP </td> <td>Power Plant </td> <td> </td> <td>n/a </td> <td> </td> <td>* </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>13 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table>\n* percentage is less than 10%.\nTotal Cost of Revenue:\nOur total cost of revenue decreased 14% during fiscal 2019 as compared to fiscal 2018, primarily due to the non-cash impairment charge of $355.1 million during fiscal 2018, offset by increases in cost of revenue in both SunPower Energy Services segment and SunPower Technology segment. Increase and decrease by segments is discussed below in detail.\nOur total cost of revenue increased 12% during fiscal 2018 as compared to fiscal 2017, primarily as a result of a non-cash impairment charge of $355.1 million, total tariffs charge of approximately $42.5 million, higher volume in U.S. residential deals, and increased cost in solar power solutions in our sales to commercial customers. The increase was partially offset by lower project cost in our sales to power plant following our decision to cease the development of large-scale power projects. During fiscal 2018, we incurred a write-down of $24.7 million on certain solar development projects which we sold during the third quarter of fiscal 2018. In addition, we incurred charges totaling $31.6 million recorded in connection with the contracted sale of raw material inventory to third parties during 2018.\nTable 16: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Fiscal Year </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(In thousands, except percentages) </td> <td> </td> <td>December 29, 2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>% Change </td> <td> </td> <td>December 30, 2018 </td> <td> </td> <td>% Change </td> <td> </td> <td>December 31, 2017 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>SunPower Energy Services </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,026,832 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,001,879 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(4) </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,040,885 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>SunPower Technologies1\n</td> <td> </td> <td>1,142,671 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>10 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>1,040,456 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(19) </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>1,289,681 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Intersegment elimination and other </td> <td> </td> <td>(431,183) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,149 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>(19,169) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(96) </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>(517,874) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total Cost of Revenue </td> <td> </td> <td>1,738,320 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(14) </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>2,023,166 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>12 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>1,812,692 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\n1 Balance is net of intersegment elimination\nCost of Revenue -

During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019, we adopted a restructuring plan (\"December 2019 Restructuring Plan\") to realign and optimize workforce requirements in light of recent changes to its business, including the previously announced planned spin-off of Maxeon Solar. Total costs incurred under the December 2019 Plan during fiscal 2019 was $7.4 million. See \"Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data-Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements-Note 8 Restructuring\" in the Notes to the consolidated financial statements in this annual report on Form 10-K for further information regarding our restructuring plans. As a result of the December 2019 Restructuring Plan, we expect to generate total cost savings of $1.3 million of operating expenses and $1.3 million of cost of goods sold, which are expected to be cash savings, primarily from a reduction in U.S. workforce, with effects beginning the first quarter of 2020. Actual savings realized may, however, differ if our assumptions are incorrect or if other unanticipated events occur.\nRestructuring charges decreased by $3.5 million during fiscal 2018 as compared to fiscal 2017, primarily because we have incurred slightly lower severance and benefits charges in connection with the February 2018 restructuring plan compared to the facilities related expenses in the prior periods in connection with our December 2016 restructuring plan. See \"Item 8. Financial Statements-Note 9. Restructuring\" in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further information regarding our restructuring plans. As a result of the February 2018 restructuring plan, we expected to generate annual cost savings of approximately $20.5 million in operating expenses, which are expected to be cash savings primarily from a reduction in global workforce, and the effects commenced in the first quarter of fiscal 2018. Actual savings realized may, however, differ if our assumptions are incorrect or if other unanticipated events occur.\nLoss on sale and impairment of residential lease assets\nTable 21: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Fiscal Year </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(In thousands, except percentages) </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>2018 </td> <td> </td> <td>2017 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Loss on sale and impairment of residential lease assets </td> <td> </td> <td>25,352 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>251,984 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>624,335 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>As a percentage of revenue </td> <td> </td> <td>1 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>15 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>35 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table>\nLoss on sale and impairment of residential lease assets decreased by $226.6 million during the fiscal 2019 as compared to fiscal 2018, primarily due to the sale of a majority of our residential lease assets portfolio in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018. During fiscal year 2019, we sold the remaining portion of the portfolio of residential lease assets to SunStrong Capital Holdings, LLC, and recorded a loss on sale of $7.2 million.\nIn the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017, in conjunction with our efforts to generate more available liquid funds in the near-term, we made the decision to sell a portion of our interest in our Residential Lease Portfolio. As a result, in the fourth quarter\nof fiscal 2017, we determined it was necessary to evaluate the potential for impairment in our ability to recover the carrying amount of our Residential Lease Portfolio. As a result of our evaluation, we recognized noncash impairment charges of $624.3 million. In fiscal 2018, we continued recording additional non-cash impairment charges through the sale of a portion of our equity interests in SunStrong, our previously wholly-owned subsidiary, to Hannon Armstrong in November 2018. During the year ended December 30, 2018, we recognized, in aggregate, loss on sale and impairment of residential lease assets of $252.0 million on the consolidated statements of operations for fiscal 2018.

Additionally, gain on sale of equity investments during fiscal 2019 was $17.7 million, compared to $54.2 million in fiscal 2018.\nOther income increased by $143.0 million in fiscal 2018 as compared to fiscal 2017. The change is primarily due to a $54.2 million gain on the sale of our equity method investments in fiscal 2018, a $73.0 million impairment charge in fiscal 2017 in our 8point3 Energy Partners LP equity investment balance due to the adoption of ASC 606 which materially increased the investment balance and consequently, led to the recognition of an other-than-temporary impairment in the first quarter of fiscal 2017.\nIncome Taxes\nTable 24: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Fiscal Year </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(In thousands, except percentages) </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>2018 </td> <td> </td> <td>2017 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Benefit from (provision for) income taxes </td> <td> </td> <td>(26,631) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(1,010) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3,944 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>As a percentage of revenue </td> <td> </td> <td>(1) </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table>\nIn the year ended December 29, 2019, our income tax provision of $26.6 million on a profit before income taxes and equity in earnings (losses) of unconsolidated investees of $26.0 million was primarily due to related tax expense in foreign jurisdictions that were profitable. In the year ended December 30, 2018, our income tax provision of $1.0 million on a loss before income taxes and equity in earnings of unconsolidated investees of $898.7 million was also primarily due to tax expense in foreign jurisdictions that were profitable, offset by tax benefit related to release of valuation allowance in a foreign jurisdiction and release of tax reserve due to lapse of statutes of limitation. The income tax benefit of $3.9 million in the year ended December 31, 2017 on a loss before income taxes and equity in earnings of unconsolidated investees of $1,200.8 million, was primarily due to the related tax effects of the carryback of fiscal 2016 net operating losses to fiscal 2015 domestic tax returns, partially offset by tax expense in profitable jurisdictions.\nWe record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets in the U.S., Malta, South Africa, Spain, and Mexico to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized. In assessing the need for a valuation allowance, we consider historical levels of income, expectations and risks associated with the estimates of future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies. In the event we determine that we would be able to realize additional deferred tax assets in the future in excess of the net recorded amount, or if we subsequently determine that realization of an amount previously recorded is unlikely, we would record an adjustment to the deferred tax asset valuation allowance, which would change income tax in the period of adjustment.\nA material amount of our total revenue is generated from customers located outside of the United States, and a substantial portion of our assets and employees are located outside of the United States. Because of the one-time transition tax related to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act enacted in 2017, a significant portion of the accumulated foreign earnings were deemed to have been repatriated, and accordingly taxed, and were no longer subject to the U.S. federal deferred tax liability, and the post-2017 accumulated foreign-sourced earnings are generally not taxed in the U.S. upon repatriation. Foreign withholding taxes have not been provided on the existing undistributed earnings of our non-U.S. subsidiaries as of December 29, 2019 as these are intended to be indefinitely reinvested in operations outside the United States.\nIn June 2019, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit overturned the 2015 U.S. tax court decision in Altera Co v. Commissioner, regarding the inclusion of stock-based compensation costs under cost sharing agreements. In July 2019, Altera Corp., a subsidiary of Intel Inc., requested en banc review of the decision from the Ninth Circuit panel and the request was denied in November 2019. In February 2020, Altera Corp. petitioned the U.S. Supreme Court for review. While a final decision remains outstanding, we quantified and recorded the impact of the case of $5.8 million as a reduction to deferred tax asset, fully offset by a reduction to valuation allowance of the same amount, without any income tax expense impact. If the Altera Ninth Circuit opinion is reversed by the U.S. Supreme Court, we would anticipate unwinding the reduction to both deferred tax asset and valuation allowance impact as aforementioned. We will continue to monitor the effects of the case's outcome on our tax provision and related disclosures once more information becomes available.\nEquity in Earnings (Losses) of Unconsolidated Investees\nTable 25: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Fiscal Year </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(In thousands, except percentages) </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>2018 </td> <td> </td> <td>2017 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Equity in earnings (losses) of unconsolidated investees </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(7,058) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(17,815) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>25,938 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>As a percentage of revenue </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>(1) </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>1 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table>\nOur equity in losses of unconsolidated investees decreased by $10.8 million in fiscal 2019 as compared to fiscal 2018, primarily driven by a decrease in our share of losses of unconsolidated investees, specifically, 8point3 Energy Partners and its affiliates (the \"8point3 Group\") which we divested in June 2018.\nOur equity in earnings (losses) of unconsolidated investees decreased $43.8 million in fiscal 2018 as compared to fiscal 2017, primarily driven by the activities of the 8point3 Group, which we divested in June 2018. As a result of this transaction, we received, after the payment of fees and expenses, merger proceeds of approximately $359.9 million in cash and no longer\ndirectly or indirectly owns any equity interests in the 8point3 Group. In connection with the sale, we recognized a $34.4 million gain within \"Other, net\" in \"Other income (expense), net\" of our consolidated statements of operations for fiscal 2018.\nNet Loss Attributable to Noncontrolling Interests and Redeemable Noncontrolling Interests\nTable 26: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Fiscal Year </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(In thousands, except percentages) </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>2018 </td> <td> </td> <td>2017 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net loss attributable to noncontrolling interests and redeemable noncontrolling interests </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>29,880 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>106,405 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>241,747 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe have entered into facilities with third-party tax equity investors under which the investors invest in a structure known as a partnership flip. We determined that we hold controlling interests in these less-than-wholly-owned entities and therefore we have fully consolidated these entities. We apply the HLBV method in allocating recorded net income (loss) to each investor based on the change in the reporting period, of the amount of net assets of the entity to which each investor would be entitled to under the governing contractual arrangements in a liquidation scenario.\nIn fiscal 2019, we attributed $29.9 million of net losses primarily to the third-party investors as a result of allocating certain assets, including tax credits and accelerated tax depreciation benefits, to the investors. The $76.5 million decrease in net loss attributable to noncontrolling interests and redeemable noncontrolling interests is primarily due to the deconsolidation of a majority of our residential lease assets in the last quarter of fiscal 2018 and during the third quarter of fiscal 2019, and partially offset by an increase in contributions by Hannon Armstrong for the equity interest in a new joint venture formed during the third quarter of fiscal 2019.\nIn fiscal 2018 and 2017, we attributed $106.4 million and $241.7 million, respectively, of net losses primarily to the third-party investors as a result of allocating certain assets, including tax credits and accelerated tax depreciation benefits, to the investors. The $135.3 million increase in net loss attributable to noncontrolling interests and redeemable noncontrolling interests is primarily attributable to the allocated portion of the impairment charge related to our residential lease assets of $150.6 million (see \"Item 1. Financial Statements-Note 7. Leasing\"), and an increase in total number of leases placed in service under new and existing facilities with third-party investors.\nCritical Accounting Estimates\nWe prepare our consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, which requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, and expenses recorded in our financial statements. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions and conditions. In addition to our most critical estimates discussed below, we also have other key accounting policies that are less subjective and, therefore, judgments involved in their application would not have a material impact on our reported results of operations (See \"Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data-Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements-Note 1. Organization and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\").\nRevenue Recognition\nModule and Component Sales\nWe sell our solar panels and balance of system components primarily to dealers, system integrators and distributors, and recognizes revenue at a point in time when control of such products transfers to the customer, which generally occurs upon shipment or delivery depending on the terms of the contracts with the customer. There are no rights of return. Other than standard warranty obligations, there are no significant post-shipment obligations (including installation, training or customer acceptance clauses) with any of our customers that could have an impact on revenue recognition. Our revenue recognition policy is consistent across all geographic areas.\nSolar Power System Sales and Engineering, Procurement, and Construction Services\nWe design, manufacture and sell rooftop and ground-mounted solar power systems under construction and development agreements, to our residential and commercial customers. In contracts where we sell completed systems as a single performance obligation, primarily to our joint venture for residential projects, we recognize revenue at the point-in-time when such systems are placed in service. Any advance payments received before control is transferred is classified as \"contract liabilities.\"\nEngineering, procurement and construction (\"EPC\") projects governed by customer contracts that require us to deliver functioning solar power systems are generally completed within three to twelve months from commencement of construction. Construction on large projects may be completed within eighteen to thirty-six months, depending on the size and location. We recognize revenue from EPC services over time as our performance creates or enhances an energy generation asset controlled by the customer. We use an input method based on cost incurred as we believe that this method most accurately reflects our progress toward satisfaction of the performance obligation. Under this method, revenue arising from fixed-price construction contracts is recognized as work is performed based on the ratio of costs incurred to date to the total estimated costs at completion of the performance obligations.\nIncurred costs include all direct material, labor and subcontract costs, and those indirect costs related to contract performance, such as indirect labor, supplies, and tools. Project material costs are included in incurred costs when the project materials have been installed by being permanently attached or fitted to the solar power system as required by the project's engineering design. Cost-based input methods of revenue recognition require us to make estimates of net contract revenues and costs to complete the projects. In making such estimates, significant judgment is required to evaluate assumptions related to the amount of net contract revenues, including the impact of any performance incentives, liquidated damages, and other payments to customers. Significant judgment is also required to evaluate assumptions related to the costs to complete the projects, including materials, labor, contingencies, and other system costs. If the estimated total costs on any contract are greater than the net contract revenues, we recognize the entire estimated loss in the period the loss becomes known and can be reasonably estimated.\nOur arrangements may contain clauses such as contingent repurchase options, delay liquidated damages or early performance bonus, most favorable pricing, or other provisions that can either increase or decrease the transaction price. These variable amounts generally are awarded upon achievement of certain performance metrics or milestones. Variable consideration is estimated at each measurement date at its most likely amount to the extent that it is probable that a significant reversal of cumulative revenue recognized will not occur and true-ups are applied prospectively as such estimates change.\nChanges in estimates for sales of systems and EPC services occur for a variety of reasons, including but not limited to (i) construction plan accelerations or delays, (ii) product cost forecast changes, (iii) change orders, or (iv) changes in other information used to estimate costs. The cumulative effect of revisions to transaction prices or input cost estimates are recorded in the period in which the revisions to estimates are identified and the amounts can be reasonably estimated.\nOperations and Maintenance\nWe offer our customers various levels of post-installation operations and maintenance (\"O&M\") services with the objective of optimizing our customers' electrical energy production over the life of the system. We determine that the post-installation systems monitoring and maintenance qualifies as a separate performance obligation. Post-installation monitoring and maintenance is deferred at the time the contract is executed, based on the estimate of selling price on a standalone basis, and is recognized to revenue over time as customers receive and consume benefits of such services. The non-cancellable term of the O&M contracts are typically 90 days for commercial and residential customers and 180 days for power plant customers.\nWe typically provide a system output performance warranty, separate from our standard solar panel product warranty, to customers that have subscribed to our post-installation O&M services. In connection with system output performance warranties, we agree to pay liquidated damages in the event the system does not perform to the stated specifications, with certain exclusions. The warranty excludes system output shortfalls attributable to force majeure events, customer curtailment, irregular weather, and other similar factors. In the event that the system output falls below the warrantied performance level during the applicable warranty period, and provided that the shortfall is not caused by a factor that is excluded from the performance warranty, the warranty provides that we will pay the customer an amount based on the value of the shortfall of energy produced relative to the applicable warrantied performance level. Such liquidated damages represent a form of variable consideration and are estimated at contract inception and updated at each reporting period and recognized over time as customers receive and consume the benefits of the O&M services.\nLease Accounting\nEffective December 31, 2018, we adopted Accounting Standards Update (\"ASU\") No. 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842), as amended (\"ASC 842\"). For additional information on the changes resulting from the new standard and the impact to our financial results on adoption, refer to the section Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements below.\nArrangements with SunPower as a lessee\nWe determine if an arrangement is a lease at inception. Our operating lease agreements are primarily for real estate and are included within operating lease right-of-use (\"ROU\") assets and operating lease liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets. We elected the practical expedient to combine our lease and related non-lease components for all our leases.\nROU assets represent our right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and lease liabilities represent our obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease. ROU assets and lease liabilities are recognized at the commencement date based on the present value of lease payments over the lease term. Variable lease payments are excluded from the ROU assets and lease liabilities and are recognized in the period in which the obligation for those payments is incurred. As most of our leases do not provide an implicit rate, we use our incremental borrowing rate based on the information available at commencement date in determining the present value of lease payments. ROU assets also include any lease prepayments made and exclude lease incentives. Many of our lessee agreements include options to extend the lease, which we do not include in our minimum lease terms unless they are reasonably certain to be exercised. Rental expense for lease payments related to operating leases is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term.\nSale-Leaseback Arrangements\nWe enter into sale-leaseback arrangements under which solar power systems are sold to third parties and subsequently leased back by us over lease terms of up to 25 years.\nWe classify our initial sale-leaseback arrangements of solar power systems as operating leases or sales-type leases, in accordance with the underlying accounting guidance on leases. We may sell our lessee interests in these arrangements in entirety before the end of the underlying term of the leaseback.\nFor all sale-leaseback arrangements classified as operating leases, the profit related to the excess of the proceeds compared to the fair value of the solar power systems is deferred and recognized over the term of the lease. Sale-leaseback arrangements classified as finance leases or failed sale, are accounted for under the financing method, the proceeds received from the sale of the solar power systems are recorded as financing liabilities. The financing liabilities are subsequently reduced by our payments to lease back the solar power systems, less interest expense calculated based on our incremental borrowing rate adjusted to the rate required to prevent negative amortization. Refer to Note 4. Business Divestiture and Sale of Assets, for details of the sale of our commercial sale-leaseback portfolio during fiscal 2019.\nArrangements with SunPower as a lessor\nSolar Services\nWe offer solar services, in partnership with third-party financial institutions, which allows our residential customers to obtain continuous access to SunPower solar power systems under contracts for terms of up to 20 years. Solar services revenue is primarily comprised of revenue from such contracts wherein we provide continuous access to an operating solar system to third parties.\nWe begin to recognize revenue on solar services when permission to operate (\"PTO\") is given by the local utility company, the system is interconnected and operation commences. We recognize revenue evenly over the time that we satisfy our performance obligations over the initial term of the solar services contracts. Solar services contracts typically have an initial term of 20 years. After the initial contract term, our customers may request an extension of the term of the contract on prevailing market terms, or request to remove the system. Otherwise, the contract will automatically renew and continue on a month-to-month basis.\nWe also apply for and receive Solar Renewable Energy Credits (\"SRECs\") associated with the energy generated by our solar energy systems and sell them to third parties in certain jurisdictions. SREC revenue is estimated net of any variable consideration related to possible liquidated damages if we were to deliver fewer SRECs than contractually committed, and is generally recognized upon delivery of the SRECs to the counterparty.\nWe typically provide a system output performance warranty, separate from our standard solar panel product warranty, to our solar services customers. In connection with system output performance warranties, we agree to pay liquidated damages in the event the system does not perform to the stated specifications, with certain exclusions. The warranty excludes system output shortfalls attributable to force majeure events, customer curtailment, irregular weather, and other similar factors. In the event that the system output falls below the warrantied performance level during the applicable warranty period, and provided that the shortfall is not caused by a factor that is excluded from the performance warranty, the warranty provides that we will pay the customer an amount based on the value of the shortfall of energy produced relative to the applicable warrantied performance level. Such liquidated damages represent a form of variable consideration and are estimated at contract inception and updated at each reporting period and recognized over time as customers receive and consume the benefits of the solar services.\nThere are rebate programs offered by utilities in various jurisdictions and are issued directly to homeowners, based on the lease agreements, the homeowners assign these rights to rebate to us. These rights to rebate are considered non-cash consideration, measured based on the utilities' rebates from the installed solar panels on the homeowners' roofs and recognized over the lease term.\nRevenue from solar services contracts entered into prior to the adoption of ASC 842 were accounted for as leases under the superseded lease accounting guidance and reported within \"Residential leasing\" on the consolidated statement of operations.\nShipping and Handling Costs\nWe account for shipping and handling activities related to contracts with customers as costs to fulfill our promise to transfer goods and, accordingly, records such costs in cost of revenue.\nTaxes Collected from Customers and Remitted to Governmental Authorities\nWe exclude from our measurement of transaction prices all taxes assessed by governmental authorities that are both (i) imposed on and concurrent with a specific revenue-producing transaction and (ii) collected from customers. Accordingly, such tax amounts are not included as a component of revenue or cost of revenue.\nImpairment of Residential Lease Assets\nWe evaluate our long-lived assets, including property, plant and equipment, solar power systems leased and to be leased, and other intangible assets with finite lives, for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of such assets may not be recoverable. Factors considered important that could result in an impairment review include significant under-performance relative to expected historical or projected future operating results, significant changes in the manner of use of acquired assets, and significant negative industry or economic trends. Our impairment evaluation of long-lived assets includes an analysis of estimated future undiscounted net cash flows expected to be generated by the assets over their remaining estimated useful lives. If our estimate of future undiscounted net cash flows is insufficient to recover the carrying value of the assets over the remaining estimated useful lives, we record an impairment loss in the amount by which the carrying value of the assets exceeds the fair value. Fair value is generally measured based on either quoted market prices, if available, or discounted cash flow analysis.\nFinancing receivables are generated by solar power systems leased to residential customers under sales-type leases. Financing receivables represent gross minimum lease payments to be received from customers over a period commensurate with the remaining lease term and the system's estimated residual value, net of unearned income and allowance for estimated losses. Our evaluation of the recoverability of these financing receivables is based on evaluation of the likelihood, based on current information and events, and whether we will be able to collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the underlying lease agreements. In accordance with this evaluation, we recognize an allowance for losses on financing receivables based on our estimate of the amount equal to the probable losses net of recoveries. The combination of the leased solar power systems discussed in the preceding paragraph together with the lease financing receivables is referred to as the \"Residential Lease Portfolio.\"\nWe performed a recoverability test for assets in the residential assets by estimating future undiscounted net cash flows\nexpected to be generated by the assets, based on our own specific alternative courses of action under consideration. The\nalternative courses were either to sell or refinance the assets, or hold the assets until the end of their previously estimated useful\nlives. Upon consideration of the alternatives, we determined that market value, in the form of indicative purchase price from a\nthird-party investor was available for a portion of our residential assets. As we intend to sell these remaining residential portfolio assets, we used the indicative purchase price from a third-party investor as fair value of the underlying net assets in our impairment evaluation.\nAllowance for Doubtful Accounts and Sales Returns\nWe maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments. A considerable amount of judgment is required to assess the likelihood of the ultimate realization of accounts receivable. We make our estimates of the collectability of our accounts receivable by analyzing historical bad debts, specific customer creditworthiness and current economic trends.\nIn addition, at the time revenue is recognized from the sale of solar panels and balance of system components, we record estimates for sales returns which reduce revenue. These estimates are based on historical sales returns and analysis of credit memo data, among other known factors.\nProduct Warranties\nWe generally provide a 25-year standard warranty for solar panels that we manufacture for defects in materials and workmanship. The warranty provides that we will repair or replace any defective solar panels during the warranty period. In addition, we pass through to customers' long-term warranties from the original equipment manufacturers of certain system components, such as inverters. Warranties of 25 years from solar panel suppliers are standard in the solar industry, while certain system components carry warranty periods ranging from five to 20 years.\nIn addition, we generally warrant our workmanship on installed systems for periods ranging up to 25 years and also provide a separate system output performance warranty to customers that have subscribed to our post-installation monitoring and maintenance services which expires upon termination of the post-installation monitoring and maintenance services related to the system. The warrantied system output performance level varies by system depending on the characteristics of the system and the negotiated agreement with the customer, and the level declines over time to account for the expected degradation of the system. Actual system output is typically measured annually for purposes of determining whether warrantied performance levels have been met. The warranty excludes system output shortfalls attributable to force majeure events, customer curtailment, irregular weather, and other similar factors. In the event that the system output falls below the warrantied performance level during the applicable warranty period, and provided that the shortfall is not caused by a factor that is excluded from the performance warranty, the warranty provides that we will pay the customer a liquidated damage based on the value of the shortfall of energy produced relative to the applicable warrantied performance level.\nWe maintain reserves to cover the expected costs that could result from these warranties. Our expected costs are generally in the form of product replacement or repair. Warranty reserves are based on our best estimate of such costs and are recognized as a cost of revenue. We continuously monitor product returns for warranty failures and maintain a reserve for the related warranty expenses based on various factors including historical warranty claims, results of accelerated lab testing, field monitoring, vendor reliability estimates, and data on industry averages for similar products. Due to the potential for variability in these underlying factors, the difference between our estimated costs and our actual costs could be material to our consolidated financial statements. If actual product failure rates or the frequency or severity of reported claims differ from our estimates or if there are delays in our responsiveness to outages, we may be required to revise our estimated warranty liability. Historically, warranty costs have been within management's expectations.\nInventories\nInventories are accounted for on a first-in-first-out basis and are valued at the lower of cost or net realizable value. We evaluate the realizability of our inventories, including future purchase commitments under fixed-price long-term supply agreements, based on assumptions about expected demand and market conditions. Our assumption of expected demand is developed based on our analysis of bookings, sales backlog, sales pipeline, market forecast and competitive intelligence. Our assumption of expected demand is compared to available inventory, production capacity, future polysilicon purchase commitments, available third-party inventory and growth plans. Our factory production plans, which drive materials requirement planning, are established based on our assumptions of expected demand. We respond to reductions in expected demand by temporarily reducing manufacturing output and adjusting expected valuation assumptions as necessary. In addition, expected demand by geography has changed historically due to changes in the availability and size of government mandates and economic incentives.\nWe evaluate the terms of our long-term inventory purchase agreements with suppliers for the procurement of polysilicon, ingots, wafers, and solar cells and establish accruals for estimated losses on adverse purchase commitments as necessary, such as lower of cost or net realizable value adjustments, forfeiture of advanced deposits and liquidated damages. Obligations related to non-cancellable purchase orders for inventories match current and forecasted sales orders that will consume these ordered materials and actual consumption of these ordered materials are compared to expected demand regularly. We anticipate total obligations related to long-term supply agreements for inventories will be realized because quantities are less than management's expected demand for its solar power products over a period of years; however, if raw materials inventory balances temporarily exceed near-term demand, we may elect to sell such inventory to third parties to optimize working capital needs. In addition, because the purchase prices required by our long-term polysilicon agreements are significantly higher than current market prices for similar materials, if we are not able to profitably utilize this material in our operations or elect to sell near-term excess, we may incur additional losses. Other market conditions that could affect the realizable value of our inventories and are periodically evaluated by management include the aging of inventories on hand, historical inventory turnover ratio, anticipated sales price, new product development schedules, the effect new products might have on the sale of existing products, product obsolescence, customer concentrations, the current market price of polysilicon as compared to the price in our fixed-price arrangements, and product merchantability, among other factors. If, based on assumptions about expected demand and market conditions, we determine that the cost of inventories exceeds its net realizable value or inventory is excess or obsolete, or we enter into arrangements with third parties for the sale of raw materials that do not allow us to recover our current contractually committed price for such raw materials, we record a write-down or accrual, which may be material, equal to the difference between the cost of inventories and the estimated net realizable value. If actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management, additional inventory write-downs may be required that could negatively affect our gross margin and operating results. If actual market conditions are more favorable, we may have higher gross margin when products that have been previously written down are sold in the normal course of business. Additionally, the Company's classification of its inventory as either current or long-term inventory requires it to estimate the portion of on-hand inventory that we estimate will be realized over the next 12 months.\nStock-Based Compensation\nWe provide stock-based awards to our employees, executive officers and directors through various equity compensation plans including our employee stock option and restricted stock plans. We measure and record compensation expense for all stock-based payment awards based on estimated fair values. The fair value of restricted stock awards and units is based on the market price of our common stock on the date of grant. We have not granted stock options since fiscal 2008. We are required under current accounting guidance to estimate forfeitures at the date of grant. Our estimate of forfeitures is based on our historical activity, which we believe is indicative of expected forfeitures. In subsequent periods if the actual rate of forfeitures differs from our estimate, the forfeiture rates are required to be revised, as necessary. Changes in the estimated forfeiture rates can have a significant effect on stock-based compensation expense since the effect of adjusting the rate is recognized in the period the forfeiture estimate is changed.\nWe also grant performance share units to executive officers and certain employees that require us to estimate expected achievement of performance targets over the performance period. This estimate involves judgment regarding future expectations of various financial performance measures. If there are changes in our estimate of the level of financial performance measures expected to be achieved, the related stock-based compensation expense may be significantly increased or reduced in the period that our estimate changes.\nVariable Interest Entities (\"VIE\")\nWe regularly evaluate our relationships and involvement with unconsolidated VIEs and our other equity and cost method investments, to determine whether we have a controlling financial interest in them or have become the primary beneficiary, thereby requiring us to consolidate their financial results into our financial statements. In connection with the sale of the equity interests in the entities that hold solar power plants, we also consider whether we retain a variable interest in the entity sold, either through retaining a financial interest or by contractual means. If we determine that the entity sold is a VIE and that we hold a variable interest, we then evaluate whether we are the primary beneficiary. If we determine that we are the primary beneficiary, we will consolidate the VIE. The determination of whether we are the primary beneficiary is based upon whether we have the power to direct the activities that most directly impact the economic performance of the VIE and whether we absorb any losses or benefits that would be potentially significant to the VIE.\nAccounting for Business Divestitures\nFrom time to time, we may dispose of significant assets or portion of our business by sale or exchange for other assets. In accounting for such transactions, we apply the applicable guidance of U.S. GAAP pertaining to discontinued operations and disposals of components of an entity. We assess such transaction as regards specified significance measures to determine whether a disposal qualifies as a discontinuance of operations verses a sale of asset components of our entity. Our assessment includes how such a disposal may represent a significant strategic shift in our operations and its impact on our continuing involvement as regards that portion of our business. Instances where disposals do not remove our ability to participate in a significant portion of our business are accounted as disposal of assets. Instances where disposals remove our ability to participate in a significant portion of our business are accounted as discontinued operations. For additional details see Note 4. Business Combinations and Divestitures\" under \"Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data-Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\" We charge disposal related costs that are not part of the consideration to general and administrative expense as they are incurred. These costs typically include transaction and disposal costs, such as legal, accounting, and other professional fees.\nLong-Lived Assets\nOur long-lived assets include property, plant and equipment, solar power systems leased and to be leased, and other intangible assets with finite lives. We evaluate our long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of such assets may not be recoverable. Factors considered important that could result in an impairment review include significant under-performance relative to expected historical or projected future operating results, significant changes in the manner of use of acquired assets and significant negative industry or economic trends. Our impairment evaluation of long-lived assets includes an analysis of estimated future undiscounted net cash flows expected to be generated by the assets over their remaining estimated useful lives. If our estimate of future undiscounted net cash flows is insufficient to recover the carrying value of the assets over the remaining estimated useful lives, we record an impairment loss in the amount by which the carrying value of the assets exceeds the fair value. Fair value is generally measured based on either quoted market prices, if available, or discounted cash flow analyses.\nAccounting for Income Taxes\nOur global operations involve manufacturing, research and development, and selling and project development activities. Profit from non-U.S. activities is subject to local country taxation. It is our intention to indefinitely reinvest these earnings outside the United States. We record a valuation allowance to reduce our U.S., Malta, South Africa, Mexico, and Spain entities' deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized. In assessing the need for a valuation allowance, we consider historical levels of income, expectations and risks associated with the estimates of future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies. In the event we determine that we would be able to realize additional deferred tax assets in the future in excess of the net recorded amount, or if we subsequently determine that realization of an amount previously recorded is unlikely, we would record an adjustment to the deferred tax asset valuation allowance, which would change income tax in the period of adjustment. As of December 29, 2019, we believe there is insufficient evidence to realize additional deferred tax assets beyond the U.S. net operating losses that can be benefited through a carryback election; however, the reversal of the valuation allowance, which could be material, could occur in a future period.\nThe calculation of tax expense and liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex global tax regulations, including in the tax valuation of projects sold to tax equity partnerships and other third parties. We recognize potential liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues in the United States and other tax jurisdictions based on our estimate of whether, and the extent to which, additional taxes will be due. If payment of these amounts ultimately proves to be unnecessary, the reversal of the liabilities would result in tax benefits being recognized in the period in which we determine the liabilities are\nno longer necessary. If the estimate of tax liabilities proves to be less than the ultimate tax assessment, a further charge to expense would result. We accrue interest and penalties on tax contingencies which are classified as \"Provision for income taxes\" in our Consolidated Statements of Operations and are not considered material. In addition, foreign exchange gains (losses) may result from estimated tax liabilities which are expected to be realized in currencies other than the U.S. dollar.\nPursuant to the Tax Sharing Agreement with Cypress, our former parent company, we are obligated to indemnify Cypress upon current utilization of carryforward tax attributes generated while we were part of the Cypress consolidated or combined group. Further, to the extent Cypress experiences any tax examination assessments attributable to our operations while part of the Cypress consolidated or combined group, Cypress will require an indemnification from us for those aspects of the assessment that relate to our operations. See also \"Item 1A. Risk Factors - Risks Related to Our Operations-Our agreements with Cypress require us to indemnify Cypress for certain tax liabilities. These indemnification obligations and related contractual restrictions may limit our ability to pursue certain business initiatives.\"\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nCash Flows\nA summary of the sources and uses of cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash and restricted cash equivalents is as follows:\nTable 27: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Fiscal Year Ended </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(In thousands) </td> <td> </td> <td>December 29, 2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>December 30, 2018 </td> <td> </td> <td>December 31, 2017 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash used in operating activities </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(270,413) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(543,389) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(267,412) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash provided by (used in) investing activities </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>21,366 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>274,900 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(293,084) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash provided by financing activities </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>344,314 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>85,847 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>589,932 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nOperating Activities\nNet cash used in operating activities for the year ended December 29, 2019 was $270.4 million and was primarily the result of: (i) $158.3 million mark-to-market gain on equity investments with readily determinable fair value; (ii) $143.4 million gain on business divestiture; (iii) $128.4 million increase in inventories to support the construction of our solar energy projects; (iv) $66.2 million increase in accounts receivable, primarily driven by billings in excess of collections; (v) $38.2 million increase in contract assets driven by construction activities; (vi) $25.2 million gain on sale of assets; (vii) $17.3 million gain on sale of equity investments without readily determinable fair value; (viii) $8.9 million decrease in operating lease liabilities; (ix) $8.8 million increase in prepaid expenses and other assets, primarily related to movements in prepaid inventory; (x) net loss of $7.7 million; and (xi) $2.2 million increase in project assets, primarily related to the construction of our commercial solar energy projects.

As a result of these factoring arrangements, title of certain accounts receivable balances was transferred to third-party vendors, and both arrangements were accounted for as a sale of financial assets given effective control over these financial assets has been surrendered. As a result, these financial assets have been excluded from our consolidated balance sheets. In connection with the factoring arrangements, we sold accounts receivable invoices amounting to $119.4 million and $26.3 million in fiscal 2019 and 2018, respectively. As of December 29, 2019 and December 30, 2018, total uncollected accounts receivable from end customers under both arrangements were $11.6 million and $21.0 million, respectively.\nNet cash used in operating activities in fiscal 2018 was $543.4 million and was primarily the result of: (i) net loss of $917.5 million; (ii) $182.9 million increase in long-term financing receivables related to our net investment in sales-type leases; (iii) $127.3 million decrease in accounts payable and other accrued liabilities, primarily attributable to payments of accrued expenses; (iv) $59.3 million gain on business divestiture; (v) $54.2 million gain on the sale of equity investments; (vi) $43.5 million increase in contract assets driven by construction activities; (vii) $39.2 million increase in inventories due to the support of various construction projects; (viii) $30.5 million decrease in contract liabilities driven by construction activities; (ix) $6.9 million increase in deferred income taxes; (x) $6.8 million increase due to other various activities; and (xi) $0.2 million increase in accounts receivable, primarily driven by billings.

The 4.00% debentures due 2023 were issued on December 15, 2015. Interest on the 4.00% debentures due 2023 is payable on January 15 and July 15 of each year, beginning on July 15, 2016. Holders are able to exercise their right to convert the debentures at any time into shares of our common stock at an initial conversion price approximately equal to $30.53 per share, subject to adjustment in certain circumstances. If not earlier repurchased or converted, the 4.00% debentures due 2023 mature on January 15, 2023. Holders may require us to repurchase all or a portion of their 4.00% debentures due 2023, upon a fundamental change, as described in the related indenture, at a cash repurchase price equal to 100% of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest. If we undergo a non-stock change of control, as described in the related indenture, the 4.00% debentures due 2023 will be subject to redemption at our option, in whole but not in part, for a period of 30 calendar days following a repurchase date relating to the non-stock change of control, at a cash redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest. Otherwise, the 4.00% debentures due 2023 are not redeemable at our option prior to the maturity date. In the event of certain events of default, Wells Fargo Bank, National Association (\"Wells Fargo\"), the trustee, or the holders of a specified amount of then-outstanding 4.00% debentures due 2023 will have the right to declare all amounts then outstanding due and payable.\nAs of December 29, 2019, an aggregate principal amount of $400.0 million of the 0.875% senior convertible debentures due 2021 (the 0.875% debentures due 2021\u201d) remained issued and outstanding. The 0.875% debentures due 2021 were issued on June 11, 2014. Interest on the 0.875% debentures due 2021 is payable on June 1 and December 1 of each year. Holders are able to exercise their right to convert the debentures at any time into shares of our common stock at an initial conversion price approximately equal to $48.76 per share, subject to adjustment in certain circumstances. If not earlier repurchased or converted, the 0.875% debentures due 2021 mature on June 1, 2021. Holders may require us to repurchase all or a portion of their 0.875% debentures due 2021, upon a fundamental change, as described in the related indenture, at a cash repurchase price equal to 100% of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest. If we undergo a non-stock change of control, as described in the related indenture, the 0.875% debentures due 2021 will be subject to redemption at our option, in whole but not in part, for a period of 30 calendar days following a repurchase date relating to the non-stock change of control, at a cash redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest. Otherwise, the 0.875% debentures due 2021 are not redeemable at our option prior to the maturity date. In the event of certain events of default, Wells Fargo, the trustee, or the holders of a specified amount of then-outstanding 0.875% debentures due 2021 will have the right to declare all amounts then outstanding due and payable. (See \"Item 8. Financial Statements - Note 18. Subsequent Event\")\nLoan Agreement with California Enterprise Development Authority (\"CEDA\")\nOn December 29, 2010, we borrowed from CEDA the proceeds of the $30.0 million aggregate principal amount of CEDA's tax-exempt Recovery Zone Facility Revenue Bonds (SunPower Corporation - Headquarters Project) Series 2010 (the \"Bonds\") maturing April 1, 2031 under a loan agreement with CEDA. Certain of our obligations under the loan agreement were contained in a promissory note dated December 29, 2010 issued by us to CEDA, which assigned the promissory note, along with all right, title and interest in the loan agreement, to Wells Fargo, as trustee, with respect to the Bonds for the benefit of the holders of the Bonds. The Bonds bear interest at a fixed-rate of 8.50% per annum. As of December 29, 2019, the fair value of the Bonds was $32.1 million, determined by using Level 2 inputs based on quarterly market prices as reported by an independent pricing source.\nAs of December 29, 2019, the $30.0 million aggregate principal amount of the Bonds was classified as \"Long-term debt\" in our consolidated balance sheets.\nRevolving Credit Facility with Credit Agricole\nOn October 29, 2019, we entered into a new Green Revolving Credit Agreement (the 2019 Revolver\u201d) with Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Corporate and Investment Bank ( Credit Agricole\u201d), as lender, with a revolving credit commitment of $55.0 million. The 2019 Revolver contains affirmative covenants, events of default and repayment provisions customarily applicable to similar facilities and has a per annum commitment fee of 0.05% on the daily unutilized amount, payable quarterly. Loans under the 2019 Revolver bear either an adjusted LIBOR interest rate for the period elected for such loan or a floating interest rate of the higher of prime rate, federal funds effective rate, or LIBOR for an interest period of one month, plus an applicable margin, ranging from 0.25% to 0.60%, depending on the base interest rate applied, and each matures on the earlier of April 29, 2021, or the termination of commitments thereunder. Our payment obligations under the 2019 Revolver are guaranteed by Total S.A. up to the maximum aggregate principal amount of $55.0 million. In consideration of the commitments of Total S.A., we are required\nto pay them a guaranty fee of 0.25% per annum on any amounts borrowed under the 2019 Revolver and to reimburse Total S.A. for any amounts paid by them under the parent guaranty. We have pledged the equity of a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company that holds our shares of Enphase Energy, Inc. common stock to secure our reimbursement obligation under the 2019 Revolver. We have also agreed to limit our ability to draw funds under the 2019 Revolver, to no more than 67% of the fair market value of the common stock held by our subsidiary at the time of the draw.\nAs of December 29, 2019, we had no outstanding borrowings under the 2019 Revolver.\nSeptember 2011 Letter of Credit Facility with Deutsche Bank and Deutsche Bank Trust Company Americas (together, \"Deutsche Bank Trust\")\nOn September 27, 2011, we entered into a letter of credit facility with Deutsche Bank Trust which provides for the issuance, upon request by us, of letters of credit to support our obligations in an aggregate amount not to exceed $200.0 million. Each letter of credit issued under the facility is fully cash-collateralized and we have entered into a security agreement with Deutsche Bank Trust, granting them a security interest in a cash collateral account established for this purpose.\nAs of December 29, 2019, letters of credit issued under the Deutsche Bank Trust facility totaled $3.6 million, which was fully collateralized with restricted cash as classified on the consolidated balance sheets.\nOther Facilities\nAsset-Backed Loan with Bank of America\nOn March 29, 2019, we entered in a Loan and Security Agreement with Bank of America, N.A., which provides a revolving credit facility secured by certain inventory and accounts receivable in the maximum aggregate principal amount of $50.0 million. The Loan and Security Agreement contains negative and affirmative covenants, events of default and repayment and prepayment provisions customarily applicable to asset-backed credit facilities. The facility bears a floating interest rate of LIBOR plus an applicable margin, and matures on the earlier of March 29, 2022, a date that is 91 days prior to the maturity of our 2021 convertible debentures, or the termination of the commitments thereunder. During fiscal 2019, we drew loans totaling $31.3 million, under this facility and we repaid loans of $12.2 million, leaving a balance outstanding of $19.2 million as of December 29, 2019.\nSunTrust Facility\nOn June 28, 2018, we entered into a Financing Agreement with SunTrust Bank, which provides a revolving credit facility in the maximum aggregate principal amount of $75.0 million. Each loan draw from the facility bears interest at either a base rate or federal funds rate plus an applicable margin or a floating interest rate of LIBOR plus an applicable margin, and matures no later than three years following the date of the draw. As of December 29, 2019, we had $75.0 million in borrowing capacity under this limited recourse construction financing facility.\nNon-recourse Financing and Other Debt\nIn order to facilitate the construction, sale or ongoing operation of certain solar projects, including our residential leasing program, we regularly obtain project-level financing. These financings are secured either by the assets of the specific project being financed or by our equity in the relevant project entity and the lenders do not have recourse to our general assets for repayment of such debt obligations, and hence the financings are referred to as non-recourse. Non-recourse financing is typically in the form of loans from third-party financial institutions, but also takes other forms, including \"flip partnership\" structures, sale-leaseback arrangements, or other forms commonly used in the solar or similar industries. We may seek non-recourse financing covering solely the construction period of the solar project or may also seek financing covering part or all of the operating life of the solar project. We classify non-recourse financings in our consolidated balance sheets in accordance with their terms; however, in certain circumstances, we may repay or refinance these financings prior to stated maturity dates in connection with the sale of the related project or similar circumstances. In addition, in certain instances, the customer may assume the loans at the time that the project entity is sold to the customer. In these instances, subsequent debt assumption is reflected as a financing outflow and operating inflow in the consolidated statements of cash flows to reflect the substance of the assumption as a facilitation of customer financing from a third party.\nLiquidity\nAs of December 29, 2019, we had unrestricted cash and cash equivalents of $423.0 million as compared to $309.4 million as of December 30, 2018. Our cash balances are held in numerous locations throughout the world, and as of December 29, 2019, we had approximately $79.6 million held outside of the United States. This offshore cash is used to fund operations of our business in the Europe and Asia Pacific regions as well as non-U.S. manufacturing operations, which require local payment for product materials and other expenses. The amounts held outside of the United States represent the earnings of our foreign subsidiaries which under the enacted Tax Act, incurred a one-time transition tax (such amounts were previously tax deferred), however, would not result in a cash payment due to our cumulative net operating loss position. We expect total capital expenditures related to purchases of property, plant and equipment of approximately $96.8 million in fiscal 2020 in order to increase our manufacturing capacity for our highest efficiency A-Series (Maxeon 5) product platform and our P-Series technology, improve our current and next generation solar cell manufacturing technology, and other projects. In addition, while we have begun the transition away from our project development business, we still expect to invest capital to develop solar power systems and plants for sale to customers. The development of solar power plants can require long periods of time and substantial initial investments. Our efforts in this area may consist of all stages of development, including land acquisition, permitting, financing, construction, operation and the eventual sale of the projects. We often choose to bear the costs of such efforts prior to the final sale to a customer, which involves significant upfront investments of resources (including, for example, large transmission deposits or other payments, which may be non-refundable), land acquisition, permitting, legal and other costs, and in some cases the actual costs of constructing a project, in advance of the signing of PPAs and EPC contracts and the receipt of any revenue, much of which is not recognized for several additional months or years following contract signing. Any delays in disposition of one or more projects could have a negative impact on our liquidity.\nCertain of our customers also require performance bonds issued by a bonding agency or letters of credit issued by financial institutions, which are returned to us upon satisfaction of contractual requirements. If there is a contractual dispute with the customer, the customer may withhold the security or make a draw under such security, which could have an adverse impact on our liquidity. Obtaining letters of credit may require adequate collateral. All letters of credit issued under our 2016 Guaranteed LC Facilities are guaranteed by Total S.A. pursuant to the Credit Support Agreement. Our September 2011 letter of credit facility with Deutsche Bank Trust is fully collateralized by restricted cash, which reduces the amount of cash available for operations. As of December 29, 2019, letters of credit issued under the Deutsche Bank Trust facility amounted to $3.6 million which were fully collateralized with restricted cash on our consolidated balance sheets.\nSolar power plant projects often require significant up-front investments. These include payments for preliminary engineering, permitting, legal, and other expenses before we can determine whether a project is feasible. We often make arrangements with third-party financiers to acquire and build solar power systems or to fund project construction using non-recourse project debt. As of December 29, 2019, outstanding amounts related to our project financing totaled $9.1 million.\nThere are no assurances, however, that we will have sufficient available cash to repay our indebtedness or that we will be able to refinance such indebtedness on similar terms to the expiring indebtedness. If our capital resources are insufficient to satisfy our liquidity requirements, we may seek to sell additional equity investments or debt securities or obtain other debt financing. The current economic environment, however, could limit our ability to raise capital by issuing new equity or debt securities on acceptable terms, and lenders may be unwilling to lend funds on acceptable terms in the amounts that would be required to supplement cash flows to support operations. The sale of additional equity investments or convertible debt securities would result in additional dilution to our stockholders (and the potential for further dilution upon the exercise of warrants or the conversion of convertible debt) and may not be available on favorable terms or at all, particularly in light of the current conditions in the financial and credit markets. Additional debt would result in increased expenses and would likely impose new restrictive covenants which may be similar or different than those restrictions contained in the covenants under our current loan agreements and debentures. In addition, financing arrangements, including project financing for our solar power plants and letters of credit facilities, may not be available to us, or may not be available in amounts or on terms acceptable to us.\nWhile challenging industry conditions and a competitive environment extended throughout fiscal 2019, we believe that our total cash and cash equivalents, including cash expected to be generated from operations, will be sufficient to meet our obligations over the next 12 months from the date of issuance of our consolidated financial statements. Also, we have been successful in our ability to divest certain investments and non-core assets, such as the sale of membership interests in our Commercial Sale-Leaseback Portfolio, and the sale and leaseback of Hillsboro facility (Note 4. Business Divestiture and Sale of Assets). Additionally, we have secured other sources of financing to satisfy our liquidity needs such as the issuance of common stock through the public offering completed in November 2019 and realizing cash savings resulting from restructuring actions and cost reduction initiatives (Note 14. Common Stock and Note 8. Restructuring). We continue to focus on improving our overall operating performance and liquidity, including managing cash flows and working capital.\nWhile we have not drawn on it, we also have the ability to enhance our available cash by borrowing up to $55 million under our 2019 Revolver. See Note 11. Debt and Credit Sources.\nAlthough we have historically been able to generate liquidity, we cannot predict, with certainty, the outcome of our actions to generate liquidity as planned.\nContractual Obligations\nThe following table summarizes our contractual obligations as of December 29, 2019:\nTable 28: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Payments Due by Fiscal Period </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(In thousands) </td> <td> </td> <td>Total </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2021-2022 </td> <td> </td> <td>2023-2024 </td> <td> </td> <td>Beyond 2024 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Convertible debt, including interest1\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>881,958 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>20,500 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>435,750 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>425,708 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>CEDA loan, including interest2\n</td> <td> </td> <td>59,325 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,550 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5,100 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5,100 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>46,575 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other debt, including interest3\n</td> <td> </td> <td>209,283 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>114,437 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>89,153 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,048 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3,645 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Future financing commitments4\n</td> <td> </td> <td>2,900 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,900 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating lease commitments5\n</td> <td> </td> <td>110,312 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>15,390 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>29,189 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>17,902 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>47,831 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Finance lease commitments6\n</td> <td> </td> <td>2,087 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>627 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,282 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>178 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Non-cancellable purchase orders7\n</td> <td> </td> <td>154,653 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>154,653 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Purchase commitments under agreements8\n</td> <td> </td> <td>513,803 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>354,666 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>119,197 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>33,858 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6,082 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Deferred purchase consideration in connection with acquisition9\n</td> <td> </td> <td>30,000 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>30,000 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,964,321 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>695,723 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>679,671 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>484,794 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>104,133 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\n1Convertible debt, including interest, relates to the aggregate of $825.0 million in outstanding principal amount of our senior convertible debentures on December 29, 2019. For the purpose of the table above, we assume that all holders of the outstanding debentures will hold the debentures through the date of maturity, and upon conversion, the values of the senior convertible debentures will be equal to the aggregate principal amount with no premiums.\n2CEDA loan, including interest, relates to the proceeds of the $30.0 million aggregate principal amount of the Bonds. The Bonds mature on April 1, 2031 and bear interest at a fixed rate of 8.50% through maturity.\n3Other debt, including interest, primarily relates to non-recourse finance projects and solar power systems and leases under our residential lease program as described in \"Item 1. Financial Statements-Note 9. Commitments and Contingencies\" in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\n4In connection with purchase and joint venture agreements with non-public companies, we will be required to provide additional financing to such parties of up to $2.9 million, subject to certain conditions.\n5Operating lease commitments primarily relate to certain solar power systems leased from unaffiliated third parties over minimum lease terms of up to 20 years as of December 29, 2019, and various facility lease agreements including leases entered into that have not yet commenced.\n6Finance lease commitments primarily relate to certain buildings, manufacturing and equipment under capital leases in Europe for terms of up to 6 years.\n7Non-cancellable purchase orders relate to purchases of raw materials for inventory and manufacturing equipment from a variety of vendors.\n8Purchase commitments under agreements primarily relate to arrangements entered into with several suppliers, including some of our unconsolidated investees, for polysilicon, ingots, wafers, and module-level power electronics and alternating current cables, among others. These agreements specify future quantities and pricing of products to be supplied by the vendors for periods up to 5 years and there are certain consequences, such as forfeiture of advanced deposits and liquidated damages relating to previous purchases, in the event we terminate these arrangements.\n9In connection with the acquisition of AUO SunPower Sdn. Bhd. in 2016, we are required to make noncancellable annual installment payments during 2019 and 2020. The payment due in fiscal 2019 was made on the first day of the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019.\nLiabilities Associated with Uncertain Tax Positions\nDue to the complexity and uncertainty associated with our tax positions, we cannot make a reasonably reliable estimate of the period in which cash settlement will be made for our liabilities associated with uncertain tax positions in other long-term liabilities. Therefore, they have been excluded from the table above. As of December 29, 2019 and December 30, 2018, total liabilities associated with uncertain tax positions were $20.1 million and $16.8 million, respectively, and are included within \"Other long-term liabilities\" in our consolidated balance sheets as they are not expected to be paid within the next twelve months.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nAs of December 29, 2019, we did not have any significant off-balance sheet arrangements, as defined in Item 303(a)(4)(ii) of SEC Regulation S-K.", "item_7_text": "ITEM 7: MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nCautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\nYou should read the following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 29, 2019.\nThis Annual Report on Form 10-K contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.

For more information about our business, please refer to the section titled \"Part I. Item 1. Business\" in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 29, 2019.\nRecent Developments\nEffective December 31, 2018, we adopted Accounting Standards Update ( ASU\u201d) No. 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842), as amended (\"ASC 842\") using the optional transition method as discussed in \"Part I-Item 1. Financial Statements-Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements-Note 1. Organization and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\" of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nKey transactions during the fiscal quarter ended December 29, 2019 include the following:\nAnnouncement of Separation Transaction\nOn November 8, 2019, we entered into the Separation and Distribution Agreement with Maxeon Solar. The Separation and Distribution Agreement governs the principal corporate transactions required to effect the separation and the Spin-Off distribution, and provides for the allocation between SunPower and Maxeon Solar of the assets, liabilities, and obligations of the respective companies as of the separation. In addition, the Separation and Distribution Agreement, together with certain Ancillary Agreements, provide a framework for the relationship between SunPower and Maxeon Solar subsequent to the completion of the Spin-Off. Also on November 8, 2019, we entered into the Investment Agreement with Maxeon Solar, TZS, and, for the limited purposes set forth therein, Total. Pursuant to the Investment Agreement, we, Maxeon Solar, TZS and, with respect to certain provisions, Total have agreed to certain customary representations, warranties and covenants, including\ncertain representations and warranties as to the financial statements, contracts, liabilities, and other attributes of Maxeon Solar, certain business conduct restrictions and covenants requiring efforts to complete the transactions. The Spin-Off is intended to be tax-free to SunPower stockholders.\nCommon Stock Offering\nOn November 20, 2019, we completed an offering of 25,300,000 shares of the Company's common stock at a price of $7.00 per share, which included 3,300,000 shares issued and sold pursuant to the underwriter's exercise in full of its option to purchase additional shares, for gross proceeds of $177.1 million. We received net proceeds of $171.8 million from the offering, after deducting underwriter discounts which were recorded as a reduction of additional paid in capital. We incurred other expenses of $1.1 million for the transaction which was recorded in additional paid in capital (\"APIC\"). In addition, we incurred incremental organization costs in connection with the offering of $1.3 million which was recorded in the consolidated statement of operations. We intend to use the net proceeds from the offering for general corporate purposes, including partially funding the repayment of our senior convertible debentures. Refer to \"Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data-Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements- Note 18. Subsequent Events\" for further details.\nSegments Overview\nConsistent with fiscal 2018, our segment reporting consists of upstream and downstream structure. Under this segmentation, the SunPower Energy Services Segment (\"SunPower Energy Services\" or \"Downstream\") refers to sales of solar energy solutions in the North America region previously included in the legacy Residential Segment and Commercial Segment (collectively previously referred to as \"Distributed Generation\" or \"DG\") including direct sales of turn-key engineering, procurement and construction (\"EPC\") services, sales to our third-party dealer network, sales of energy under power purchase agreements (\"PPAs\"), storage solutions, cash sales and long-term leases directly to end customers, and sales to resellers. SunPower Energy Services Segment also includes sales of our global Operations and Maintenance (\"O&M\") services. The SunPower Technologies Segment (\"SunPower Technologies\" or \"Upstream\") refers to our technology development, worldwide solar panel manufacturing operations, equipment supply to resellers, commercial and residential end-customers outside of North America (\"International DG\"), and worldwide power plant project development and project sales. Some support functions and responsibilities have been shifted to each segment, including financial planning and analysis, legal, treasury, tax and accounting support and services, among others.\nThe operating structure provides our management with a comprehensive financial overview of our key businesses. The application of this structure permits us to align our strategic business initiatives and corporate goals in a manner that best focuses our businesses and support operations for success.\nOur Chief Executive Officer, as the chief operating decision maker ( CODM\u201d), reviews our business, manages resource allocations and measures performance of our activities between the SunPower Energy Services Segment and SunPower Technologies Segment.\nFor more information about our business segments, see the section titled \"Part I. Item 1. Business\" of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 29, 2019. For more segment information, see \"Item 1. Financial Statements-Note 17. Segment Information and Geographical Information\" in the notes to the consolidated financial statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nFiscal Years\nWe have a 52 to 53 week fiscal year that ends on the Sunday closest to December 31. Accordingly, every fifth or sixth year will be a 53 week fiscal year. Fiscal 2019, 2018 and 2017 are 52 week fiscal years. Our fiscal 2019 ended on December 29, 2019, fiscal 2018 ended on December 30, 2018 and fiscal 2017 ended on December 31, 2017.\nOutlook\nDemand\nDuring fiscal 2019, we faced market challenges, including competitive solar product pricing pressure and the impact of tariffs imposed pursuant to Section 201 and Section 301 of the Trade Act of 1974. On February 7, 2018, tariffs went into effect pursuant to Proclamation 9693, which approved recommendations to provide relief to U.S. manufacturers and imposed safeguard tariffs on imported solar cells and modules, based on the investigations, findings, and recommendations of the International Trade Commission. While solar cells and modules based on interdigitated back contact (\"IBC\") technology, like our X-Series (Maxeon 3), E-Series (Maxeon 2)A-Series (Maxeon 5) panels and related products, were granted exclusion from these safeguard tariffs on September 19, 2018, our solar products based on other technologies continue to be subject to the safeguard tariffs. On June 13, 2019, the Office of the United States Trade Representative ( USTR\u201d) published a notice describing its grant of exclusion requests for three additional categories of solar products. Beginning on June 13, 2019, the following categories of solar products are not subject to the Section 201 safeguard tariffs: (i) bifacial solar panels that absorb light and generate electricity on each side of the panel and that consist of only bifacial solar cells that absorb light and generate electricity on each side of the cells; (ii) flexible fiberglass solar panels without glass components other than fiberglass, such panels having power outputs ranging from 250 to 900 watts; and (iii) solar panels consisting of solar cells arranged in rows that are laminated in the panel and that are separated by more than 10 mm, with an optical film spanning the gaps between all rows that is designed to direct sunlight onto the solar cells, and not including panels that lack said optical film or only have a white or other backing layer that absorbs or scatters sunlight. We are working to understand the opportunities and challenges created by the exclusion of these products, as well as the impact of the exclusions on the demand and availability of competing products. However, the excluded technologies currently represent a small percentage of the global solar market.\nAdditionally, the USTR initiated an investigation under Section 301 of the Trade Act of 1974 into the government of China's acts, policies, and practices related to technology transfer, intellectual property, and innovation. The USTR imposed additional import duties of up to 25% on certain Chinese products covered by the Section 301 remedy. These tariffs include certain solar power system components and finished products, including those purchased from our suppliers for use in our products and used in our business. In the near term, imposition of these tariffs - on top of anti-dumping and countervailing duties on Chinese solar cells and modules, imposed under the prior administration - is likely to result in a wide range of impacts to the U.S. solar industry, global manufacturing market and our business. Such tariffs could cause market volatility, price fluctuations, and demand reduction. Uncertainties associated with the Section 201 and Section 301 trade cases prompted us to adopt a restructuring plan and implement initiatives to reduce operating expenses and cost of revenue overhead and improve cash flow. During fiscal 2019 and 2018, we incurred total tariffs charges of approximately $6.5 million and $42.5 million, respectively.\nIn fiscal 2019, focused on investments that we expected would offer the best opportunities for growth including our industry-leading A-Series (Maxeon 5) cell and panel technology, solar-plus-storage solutions and digital platform to improve customer service and satisfaction in our SunPower Energy Services offerings. We believe that our strategic decision to re-segment our business into an upstream and downstream structure, to focus our downstream efforts on our leading U.S. DG business while growing global sales of our upstream solar panel business through our SunPower Technologies business segment, will improve transparency and enable us to regain profitability.\nIn late fiscal 2015, the U.S. government enacted a budget bill that extended the solar commercial investment tax credit (the \"Commercial ITC\") under Section 48(c) of the Code, and the individual solar investment tax credit under Section 25D of the Code (together with the Commercial ITC, the \"ITC\") for five years, at rates gradually decreasing from 30% through 2019 to 22% in 2021. After 2021, the Commercial ITC is retained at 10% while the individual solar investment tax credit is reduced to 0%. In fiscal 2019 we completed a transaction to purchase solar equipment in accordance with IRS safe harbor guidance, allowing us to preserve the current ITC rates for solar projects that are completed after the scheduled reduction in rates. During December 2017, the current administration and Congress passed comprehensive reform of the Code which resulted in the reduction or elimination of various industry-specific tax incentives in return for an overall reduction in corporate tax rates. These changes are likely to result in a wide range of impacts to the U.S. solar industry and our business. For more information about how we avail ourselves of the benefits of public policies and the risks related to public policies, please see the risk factors set forth under the caption \"Part I. Item 1A. Risk Factors-Risks Related to Our Sales Channels,\" including \"-The reduction, modification or elimination of government incentives could cause our revenue to decline and harm our financial results\" and \"-Existing regulations and policies and changes to these regulations and policies may present technical, regulatory, and economic barriers to the purchase and use of solar power products, which may significantly reduce demand for our products and services.\"\nSupply\nWe are focused on delivering complete solar power generation solutions to our customers. As part of our solutions-focused approach, we launched our SunPower Helix product for our commercial business customers during fiscal 2015 and our SunPower Equinox product for our residential business customers during fiscal 2016. The Equinox and Helix systems are pre-engineered modular solutions for residential and commercial applications, respectively, that combine our high-efficiency solar module technology with integrated plug-and-play power stations, cable management systems, and mounting hardware that enable our customers to quickly and easily complete system installations and manage their energy production. Our Equinox systems utilize our latest Maxeon Gen 3 cell and ACPV technology for residential applications, where we are also expanding our initiatives on storage and Smart Energy solutions. Additionally, we continue to focus on producing our new lower cost, high efficiency P-Series product line and our A-Series (Maxeon 5) product line, which will enhance our ability to rapidly expand our global footprint with minimal capital cost.\nWe continue to see significant and increasing opportunities in technologies and capabilities adjacent to our core product offerings that can significantly reduce our customers' CCOE, including the integration of energy storage and energy management functionality into our systems, and have made investments to realize those opportunities, enabling our customers to make intelligent energy choices by addressing how they buy energy, how they use energy, and when they use it. We have added advanced module-level control electronics to our portfolio of technology designed to enable longer series strings and significant balance of system components cost reductions in large arrays. We currently offer solar panels that use microinverters designed to eliminate the need to mount or assemble additional components on the roof or the side of a building and enable optimization and monitoring at the solar panel level to ensure maximum energy production by the solar system.\nWe continue to improve our unique, differentiated solar cell and panel technology. We emphasize improvement of our solar cell efficiency and LCOE and CCOE performance through enhancement of our existing products, development of new products and reduction of manufacturing cost and complexity in conjunction with our overall cost-control strategies. We are now producing production efficiencies for our solar cells of over 25% and our solar panels of over 22%.\nWe monitor and change our overall solar cell manufacturing output in an ongoing effort to match profitable demand\nlevels, with increasing bias toward our highest efficiency X-Series (Maxeon 3) product platform, which utilizes our latest solar cell technology, and our P-Series product, which utilizes conventional cell technology that we purchase from third parties in low-cost supply chain ecosystems such as China. We are focusing on our latest generation, lower cost panel assembly facilities in Mexico. We are also increasing production of our new P-Series technology at our newly-acquired U.S. manufacturing facility.\nWe are focused on reducing the cost of our solar panels and systems, including working with our suppliers and partners along all steps of the value chain to reduce costs by improving manufacturing technologies, expanding economies of scale and reducing manufacturing cost and complexity in conjunction with our overall cost-control strategies. We believe that the global demand for solar systems is highly elastic and that our current aggressive, but achievable, cost reduction roadmap will reduce installed costs for our customers across both of our business segments and drive increased demand for our solar solutions.\nWe also work with our suppliers and partners to ensure the reliability of our supply chain. We have contracted with some of our suppliers for multi-year supply agreements, under which we have annual minimum purchase obligations. For more information about our purchase commitments and obligations, see \"Liquidity and Capital Resources-Contractual Obligations\" and \"Item 1. Financial Statements-Note 4. Business Divestiture and Sale of Assets\" and \"Note 9. Commitments and Contingencies.\"\nWe currently believe our supplier relationships and various short- and long-term contracts will afford us the volume of material and services required to meet our planned output; however, we face the risk that the pricing of our long-term supply contracts may exceed market value. For example, we purchase our polysilicon under fixed-price long-term supply agreements. The pricing under these agreements significantly in excess of market value results in inventory write-downs based on expected net realizable value. Additionally, existing arrangements from prior years have resulted in above current market pricing for purchasing polysilicon, resulting in inventory losses we have realized. For several years now, we have elected to sell polysilicon inventory in excess of short-term needs to third parties at a loss, and may enter into further similar transactions in future periods. For more information about these risks, see the risk factors set forth under the caption \"Part 1. Item 1A. Risk Factors-Risks Related to Our Supply Chain,\" including \"-Our long-term, firm commitment supply agreements could result in excess or insufficient inventory, place us at a competitive disadvantage on pricing, or lead to disputes, each of which could impair our ability to meet our cost reduction roadmap, and in some circumstances may force us to take a significant accounting charge\" and \"-We will continue to be dependent on a limited number of third-party suppliers for certain raw materials and\ncomponents for our products, which could prevent us from delivering our products to our customers within required time frames and could in turn result in sales and installation delays, cancellations, penalty payments and loss of market share.\"\nResults of Operations\nResults of operations in dollars and as a percentage of net revenue were as follows:\n\nTotal Revenue:\nOur total revenue increased by 8% during fiscal 2019 as compared to 2018, primarily due to an increase in our SunPower Technologies Segment. Increase and decrease by segments is further discussed below.\nOur total revenue decreased by 4% during fiscal 2018 as compared to fiscal 2017, primarily due to reduced sales in our SunPower Technologies Segment in the U.S. and in Asia as result of our decision to cease the development of large-scale solar power projects. We sold our remaining U.S. power plant development portfolio in the third quarter of fiscal 2018. This was partially offset by an increase in our SunPower Energy Services Segment in the proportion of capital leases placed in service relative to total leases placed in service under our residential leasing program within the U.S., as well as stronger sales of solar power systems and components to residential customers in all regions, and stronger sales of commercial solar power projects in all regions.\nWe did not have customers that accounted for greater than 10% of total revenue in the years ended December 29, 2019 and December 30, 2018.\nRevenue - by Segment:\nA description of our segments, along with other required information can be found in Note 17, \"Segment and Geographical Information\" of the consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of Part II, which is incorporated herein by reference.\nBelow, we have further discussed increase and decrease in revenue for each segment.\n\nSunPower Energy Services\nOverall, revenue for the segment remained flat during fiscal 2019 as compared to fiscal 2018. Higher volume of sales to our residential customers, was partially offset by a decrease in our commercial business.\nRevenue from residential customers increased 10% during fiscal 2019 as compared to fiscal 2018, primarily due to a higher volume in residential deals, as well as an increase in the sales of solar power components and systems to our residential customers in the U.S., partially offset by lower third-party dealer cash transactions. Revenue from commercial customers decreased 24% during fiscal 2019 as compared to fiscal 2018 primarily due to reduction in power generation revenue due to sale of our commercial sale-leaseback portfolio in the first and second quarters of fiscal 2019, and lower volume of systems sales and EPC contracts.\nRevenue from residential customers increased 28% during fiscal 2018 as compared to fiscal 2017, primarily due to a higher volume in residential deals together with the increased proportion of capital leases placed in service relative to total leases placed in service under our residential leasing program within the U.S., as well as an increase in the sales of solar power components and systems to our residential customers in the U.S., partially offset by lower third-party dealer cash transactions. Revenue from commercial customers decreased 57% during fiscal 2018 as compared to fiscal 2017 primarily because of weaker sales of EPC and PPA commercial systems.\nSunPower Technologies\nRevenue for the segment increased 24% during fiscal 2019 as compared to fiscal 2018, primarily due to higher volume of module sales in Europe and Asia, as well as revenue from sale of development projects in Japan, Chile, and Mexico.\nRevenue for the segment decreased 26% during fiscal 2018 as compared to fiscal 2017, primarily due to divesting our U.S. power plant development portfolio during the third quarter of fiscal 2018 partially offset by increased sales of power plant development and solar power solutions sales in regions outside of the U.S.\nConcentrations:\nOur SunPower Energy Services Segment as a percentage of total revenue recognized was 62% during fiscal 2019 as compared to 66% during fiscal 2018. The relative change in revenue for SunPower Energy Services Segment as a percentage of total revenue recognized reflects the impact of a significant increase in revenue in SunPower Technologies Segment. Our SunPower Technologies Segment as a percentage of total revenue recognized was 70% during fiscal 2019, as compared to 61% during fiscal 2018. The relative change in revenue for SunPower Technologies Segment as a percentage of total revenue recognized reflects higher volume of module sales in Europe and Asia, as well as revenue from sale of development projects in Japan, Chile, and Mexico.\n\n* percentage is less than 10%.\nTotal Cost of Revenue:\nOur total cost of revenue decreased 14% during fiscal 2019 as compared to fiscal 2018, primarily due to the non-cash impairment charge of $355.1 million during fiscal 2018, offset by increases in cost of revenue in both SunPower Energy Services segment and SunPower Technology segment. Increase and decrease by segments is discussed below in detail.\nOur total cost of revenue increased 12% during fiscal 2018 as compared to fiscal 2017, primarily as a result of a non-cash impairment charge of $355.1 million, total tariffs charge of approximately $42.5 million, higher volume in U.S. residential deals, and increased cost in solar power solutions in our sales to commercial customers. The increase was partially offset by lower project cost in our sales to power plant following our decision to cease the development of large-scale power projects. During fiscal 2018, we incurred a write-down of $24.7 million on certain solar development projects which we sold during the third quarter of fiscal 2018. In addition, we incurred charges totaling $31.6 million recorded in connection with the contracted sale of raw material inventory to third parties during 2018.\n\n1 Balance is net of intersegment elimination\nCost of Revenue - by Segment:\nBelow, we have further discussed increase and decrease in cost of revenue for each segment.\nSunPower Energy Services\nCost of revenue for the segment increased by 2% during fiscal 2019 as compared to fiscal 2018, primarily due to a higher volume of sales to our residential customers, partially offset by a decrease in our commercial business as a result of sale of commercial sale-leaseback portfolio in the first and second quarter of fiscal 2019.\nCost of revenue for the segment decreased by 4% during fiscal 2018 as compared to fiscal 2017, primarily due to a higher volume of sales to our residential customers.\nSunPower Technologies\nCost of revenue for the segment increased by 10% during fiscal 2019 as compared to fiscal 2018, primarily due to higher volume of module sales in Europe and Asia, offset by a gain on the sale and leaseback of our Oregon manufacturing facility, (refer to Note 4 Business Divestiture and Sale of Assets for further details), as well as a reduction in cost of revenues relating to power plant development as we ceased the development of large-scale solar power projects in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018.\nCost of revenue for the segment decreased by 19% during fiscal 2018 as compared to fiscal 2017, primarily due to divesting our U.S. power plant development portfolio during the third quarter of fiscal 2018 partially offset by increased sales of power plant development and solar power solutions sales in regions outside of the U.S.\nGross Margin\nOur gross margin increased from (17%) in fiscal 2018 to 7% in fiscal 2019, primarily due to non-cash impairment charges on certain property, plant and equipment recorded in fiscal 2018.\nOur gross margin decreased from (1%) in fiscal 2017 to (17%) in fiscal 2018, primarily due to non-cash impairment charges on certain property, plant and equipment recorded in fiscal 2018.\nGross Margin - by Segment\n\nSunPower Energy Services\nGross margin for the segment decreased by 1% during fiscal 2019 as compared to fiscal 2018, primarily as a result of lower margin on sales in our residential business and higher project costs in our commercial business.\nGross margin for our SunPower Energy Services Segment increased by 1% during fiscal 2018 as compared to fiscal 2017. Gross margin improved primarily due to a higher volume in residential deals together with the increased proportion of capital leases placed in service on residential sales, offset by lower margin on sales to residential customers and higher cost incurred related to solar power solutions deals.\nSunPower Technologies\nGross margin for the segment increased by 11%, during fiscal 2019 as compared to fiscal 2018, primarily due to higher volume of module sales in Europe and Asia, as well as the sale of development projects in Japan and Chile, and profit contributed by the gain on sale and leaseback of our Oregon manufacturing facility.\nGross margin for our SunPower Technologies Segment decreased by 8% during fiscal 2018 as compared to fiscal 2017, primarily as a result of lower volume in sales, and reduction due to pressure on project pricing due to increased global competition and other factors.\nResearch and Development (\"R&D\")\n\nR&D expense decreased by $14.2 million during the fiscal 2019 as compared to fiscal 2018, primarily due to a decrease in labor and facility costs as a result of reductions in headcount driven by our February 2018 restructuring plan.\nR&D expense decreased by $0.5 million during fiscal 2018 as compared to fiscal 2017. The decrease was primarily due to a decrease in labor costs as a result of reductions in headcount and salary expenses driven by our February 2018 restructuring plan. The decrease was partially offset by the impairment of property, plant and equipment related to R&D facilities of $12.8 million.\nSales, General and Administrative (\"SG&A\")\n\nSG&A expense increased by $0.3 million during fiscal 2019 as compared to fiscal 2018 primarily due to an increase in transaction expenses incurred as a result of the proposed spin-off, as well as organization expenses incurred as a result of the equity offering in the fourth quarter of 2019, offset by reductions in headcount and salary expenses driven by our February 2018 restructuring plan and ongoing cost reduction efforts.\nSG&A expense decreased by $18.5 million during fiscal 2018 as compared to fiscal 2017 primarily due to reductions in headcount and salary expenses driven by our February 2018 restructuring plan and ongoing cost reduction efforts.\nRestructuring Charges\n\nRestructuring charges decreased by $3.4 million during fiscal 2019 as compared to fiscal 2018, due to lower severance charges incurred in fiscal 2019 in connection with the newly implemented December 2019 restructuring plan compared to February 2018 restructuring plan. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019, we adopted a restructuring plan (\"December 2019 Restructuring Plan\") to realign and optimize workforce requirements in light of recent changes to its business, including the previously announced planned spin-off of Maxeon Solar. Total costs incurred under the December 2019 Plan during fiscal 2019 was $7.4 million. See \"Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data-Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements-Note 8 Restructuring\" in the Notes to the consolidated financial statements in this annual report on Form 10-K for further information regarding our restructuring plans. As a result of the December 2019 Restructuring Plan, we expect to generate total cost savings of $1.3 million of operating expenses and $1.3 million of cost of goods sold, which are expected to be cash savings, primarily from a reduction in U.S. workforce, with effects beginning the first quarter of 2020. Actual savings realized may, however, differ if our assumptions are incorrect or if other unanticipated events occur.\nRestructuring charges decreased by $3.5 million during fiscal 2018 as compared to fiscal 2017, primarily because we have incurred slightly lower severance and benefits charges in connection with the February 2018 restructuring plan compared to the facilities related expenses in the prior periods in connection with our December 2016 restructuring plan. See \"Item 8. Financial Statements-Note 9. Restructuring\" in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further information regarding our restructuring plans. As a result of the February 2018 restructuring plan, we expected to generate annual cost savings of approximately $20.5 million in operating expenses, which are expected to be cash savings primarily from a reduction in global workforce, and the effects commenced in the first quarter of fiscal 2018. Actual savings realized may, however, differ if our assumptions are incorrect or if other unanticipated events occur.\nLoss on sale and impairment of residential lease assets\n\nLoss on sale and impairment of residential lease assets decreased by $226.6 million during the fiscal 2019 as compared to fiscal 2018, primarily due to the sale of a majority of our residential lease assets portfolio in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018. During fiscal year 2019, we sold the remaining portion of the portfolio of residential lease assets to SunStrong Capital Holdings, LLC, and recorded a loss on sale of $7.2 million.\nIn the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017, in conjunction with our efforts to generate more available liquid funds in the near-term, we made the decision to sell a portion of our interest in our Residential Lease Portfolio. As a result, in the fourth quarter\nof fiscal 2017, we determined it was necessary to evaluate the potential for impairment in our ability to recover the carrying amount of our Residential Lease Portfolio. As a result of our evaluation, we recognized noncash impairment charges of $624.3 million. In fiscal 2018, we continued recording additional non-cash impairment charges through the sale of a portion of our equity interests in SunStrong, our previously wholly-owned subsidiary, to Hannon Armstrong in November 2018. During the year ended December 30, 2018, we recognized, in aggregate, loss on sale and impairment of residential lease assets of $252.0 million on the consolidated statements of operations for fiscal 2018. See Note 4. Business Divestitures and Sale of Assets for further details.\nGain on business divestiture\n\nGain on business divestiture increased by $84.1 million during the fiscal 2019 as compared to fiscal 2018, primarily due to the gain on the sale of our commercial sale-leaseback portfolio of $143.4 million, compared to the gain on sale of $59.3 million for the sale of our microinverter business recorded during fiscal 2018.\nGain on business divestiture increased by $59.3 million during the fiscal 2018 as compared to fiscal 2017, primarily due to the gain on sale of $59.3 million for sale of our microinverter business recorded in fiscal 2018.\nOther Income (Expense), Net\n\nInterest expense decreased $54.7 million during fiscal 2019 as compared to fiscal 2018, primarily due to elimination of the non-recourse residential financing obligations in connection with the sale of the Residential Lease Portfolio in November 2018, as well as the elimination of the sales-leaseback financing obligations in connection with the sale of the commercial sale-leaseback portfolio during the first and second quarters of fiscal 2019.\nInterest expense increased $17.7 million in fiscal 2018 as compared to fiscal 2017 primarily due to new debt and new commercial sale-leaseback arrangements.\nOther income increased by $119.4 million during fiscal 2019 as compared to fiscal 2018, primarily due to a $158.3 million gain on an equity investment with readily determinable fair value in fiscal 2019, as compared to a loss of $6.4 million in fiscal 2018. Additionally, gain on sale of equity investments during fiscal 2019 was $17.7 million, compared to $54.2 million in fiscal 2018.\nOther income increased by $143.0 million in fiscal 2018 as compared to fiscal 2017. The change is primarily due to a $54.2 million gain on the sale of our equity method investments in fiscal 2018, a $73.0 million impairment charge in fiscal 2017 in our 8point3 Energy Partners LP equity investment balance due to the adoption of ASC 606 which materially increased the investment balance and consequently, led to the recognition of an other-than-temporary impairment in the first quarter of fiscal 2017.\nIncome Taxes\n\nIn the year ended December 29, 2019, our income tax provision of $26.6 million on a profit before income taxes and equity in earnings (losses) of unconsolidated investees of $26.0 million was primarily due to related tax expense in foreign jurisdictions that were profitable. In the year ended December 30, 2018, our income tax provision of $1.0 million on a loss before income taxes and equity in earnings of unconsolidated investees of $898.7 million was also primarily due to tax expense in foreign jurisdictions that were profitable, offset by tax benefit related to release of valuation allowance in a foreign jurisdiction and release of tax reserve due to lapse of statutes of limitation. The income tax benefit of $3.9 million in the year ended December 31, 2017 on a loss before income taxes and equity in earnings of unconsolidated investees of $1,200.8 million, was primarily due to the related tax effects of the carryback of fiscal 2016 net operating losses to fiscal 2015 domestic tax returns, partially offset by tax expense in profitable jurisdictions.\nWe record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets in the U.S., Malta, South Africa, Spain, and Mexico to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized. In assessing the need for a valuation allowance, we consider historical levels of income, expectations and risks associated with the estimates of future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies. In the event we determine that we would be able to realize additional deferred tax assets in the future in excess of the net recorded amount, or if we subsequently determine that realization of an amount previously recorded is unlikely, we would record an adjustment to the deferred tax asset valuation allowance, which would change income tax in the period of adjustment.\nA material amount of our total revenue is generated from customers located outside of the United States, and a substantial portion of our assets and employees are located outside of the United States. Because of the one-time transition tax related to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act enacted in 2017, a significant portion of the accumulated foreign earnings were deemed to have been repatriated, and accordingly taxed, and were no longer subject to the U.S. federal deferred tax liability, and the post-2017 accumulated foreign-sourced earnings are generally not taxed in the U.S. upon repatriation. Foreign withholding taxes have not been provided on the existing undistributed earnings of our non-U.S. subsidiaries as of December 29, 2019 as these are intended to be indefinitely reinvested in operations outside the United States.\nIn June 2019, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit overturned the 2015 U.S. tax court decision in Altera Co v. Commissioner, regarding the inclusion of stock-based compensation costs under cost sharing agreements. In July 2019, Altera Corp., a subsidiary of Intel Inc., requested en banc review of the decision from the Ninth Circuit panel and the request was denied in November 2019. In February 2020, Altera Corp. petitioned the U.S. Supreme Court for review. While a final decision remains outstanding, we quantified and recorded the impact of the case of $5.8 million as a reduction to deferred tax asset, fully offset by a reduction to valuation allowance of the same amount, without any income tax expense impact. If the Altera Ninth Circuit opinion is reversed by the U.S. Supreme Court, we would anticipate unwinding the reduction to both deferred tax asset and valuation allowance impact as aforementioned. We will continue to monitor the effects of the case's outcome on our tax provision and related disclosures once more information becomes available.\nEquity in Earnings (Losses) of Unconsolidated Investees\n\nOur equity in losses of unconsolidated investees decreased by $10.8 million in fiscal 2019 as compared to fiscal 2018, primarily driven by a decrease in our share of losses of unconsolidated investees, specifically, 8point3 Energy Partners and its affiliates (the \"8point3 Group\") which we divested in June 2018.\nOur equity in earnings (losses) of unconsolidated investees decreased $43.8 million in fiscal 2018 as compared to fiscal 2017, primarily driven by the activities of the 8point3 Group, which we divested in June 2018. As a result of this transaction, we received, after the payment of fees and expenses, merger proceeds of approximately $359.9 million in cash and no longer\ndirectly or indirectly owns any equity interests in the 8point3 Group. In connection with the sale, we recognized a $34.4 million gain within \"Other, net\" in \"Other income (expense), net\" of our consolidated statements of operations for fiscal 2018.\nNet Loss Attributable to Noncontrolling Interests and Redeemable Noncontrolling Interests\n\nWe have entered into facilities with third-party tax equity investors under which the investors invest in a structure known as a partnership flip. We determined that we hold controlling interests in these less-than-wholly-owned entities and therefore we have fully consolidated these entities. We apply the HLBV method in allocating recorded net income (loss) to each investor based on the change in the reporting period, of the amount of net assets of the entity to which each investor would be entitled to under the governing contractual arrangements in a liquidation scenario.\nIn fiscal 2019, we attributed $29.9 million of net losses primarily to the third-party investors as a result of allocating certain assets, including tax credits and accelerated tax depreciation benefits, to the investors. The $76.5 million decrease in net loss attributable to noncontrolling interests and redeemable noncontrolling interests is primarily due to the deconsolidation of a majority of our residential lease assets in the last quarter of fiscal 2018 and during the third quarter of fiscal 2019, and partially offset by an increase in contributions by Hannon Armstrong for the equity interest in a new joint venture formed during the third quarter of fiscal 2019.\nIn fiscal 2018 and 2017, we attributed $106.4 million and $241.7 million, respectively, of net losses primarily to the third-party investors as a result of allocating certain assets, including tax credits and accelerated tax depreciation benefits, to the investors. The $135.3 million increase in net loss attributable to noncontrolling interests and redeemable noncontrolling interests is primarily attributable to the allocated portion of the impairment charge related to our residential lease assets of $150.6 million (see \"Item 1. Financial Statements-Note 7. Leasing\"), and an increase in total number of leases placed in service under new and existing facilities with third-party investors.\nCritical Accounting Estimates\nWe prepare our consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, which requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, and expenses recorded in our financial statements. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions and conditions. In addition to our most critical estimates discussed below, we also have other key accounting policies that are less subjective and, therefore, judgments involved in their application would not have a material impact on our reported results of operations (See \"Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data-Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements-Note 1. Organization and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\").\nRevenue Recognition\nModule and Component Sales\nWe sell our solar panels and balance of system components primarily to dealers, system integrators and distributors, and recognizes revenue at a point in time when control of such products transfers to the customer, which generally occurs upon shipment or delivery depending on the terms of the contracts with the customer. There are no rights of return. Other than standard warranty obligations, there are no significant post-shipment obligations (including installation, training or customer acceptance clauses) with any of our customers that could have an impact on revenue recognition. Our revenue recognition policy is consistent across all geographic areas.\nSolar Power System Sales and Engineering, Procurement, and Construction Services\nWe design, manufacture and sell rooftop and ground-mounted solar power systems under construction and development agreements, to our residential and commercial customers. In contracts where we sell completed systems as a single performance obligation, primarily to our joint venture for residential projects, we recognize revenue at the point-in-time when such systems are placed in service. Any advance payments received before control is transferred is classified as \"contract liabilities.\"\nEngineering, procurement and construction (\"EPC\") projects governed by customer contracts that require us to deliver functioning solar power systems are generally completed within three to twelve months from commencement of construction. Construction on large projects may be completed within eighteen to thirty-six months, depending on the size and location. We recognize revenue from EPC services over time as our performance creates or enhances an energy generation asset controlled by the customer. We use an input method based on cost incurred as we believe that this method most accurately reflects our progress toward satisfaction of the performance obligation. Under this method, revenue arising from fixed-price construction contracts is recognized as work is performed based on the ratio of costs incurred to date to the total estimated costs at completion of the performance obligations.\nIncurred costs include all direct material, labor and subcontract costs, and those indirect costs related to contract performance, such as indirect labor, supplies, and tools. Project material costs are included in incurred costs when the project materials have been installed by being permanently attached or fitted to the solar power system as required by the project's engineering design. Cost-based input methods of revenue recognition require us to make estimates of net contract revenues and costs to complete the projects. In making such estimates, significant judgment is required to evaluate assumptions related to the amount of net contract revenues, including the impact of any performance incentives, liquidated damages, and other payments to customers. Significant judgment is also required to evaluate assumptions related to the costs to complete the projects, including materials, labor, contingencies, and other system costs. If the estimated total costs on any contract are greater than the net contract revenues, we recognize the entire estimated loss in the period the loss becomes known and can be reasonably estimated.\nOur arrangements may contain clauses such as contingent repurchase options, delay liquidated damages or early performance bonus, most favorable pricing, or other provisions that can either increase or decrease the transaction price. These variable amounts generally are awarded upon achievement of certain performance metrics or milestones. Variable consideration is estimated at each measurement date at its most likely amount to the extent that it is probable that a significant reversal of cumulative revenue recognized will not occur and true-ups are applied prospectively as such estimates change.\nChanges in estimates for sales of systems and EPC services occur for a variety of reasons, including but not limited to (i) construction plan accelerations or delays, (ii) product cost forecast changes, (iii) change orders, or (iv) changes in other information used to estimate costs. The cumulative effect of revisions to transaction prices or input cost estimates are recorded in the period in which the revisions to estimates are identified and the amounts can be reasonably estimated.\nOperations and Maintenance\nWe offer our customers various levels of post-installation operations and maintenance (\"O&M\") services with the objective of optimizing our customers' electrical energy production over the life of the system. We determine that the post-installation systems monitoring and maintenance qualifies as a separate performance obligation. Post-installation monitoring and maintenance is deferred at the time the contract is executed, based on the estimate of selling price on a standalone basis, and is recognized to revenue over time as customers receive and consume benefits of such services. The non-cancellable term of the O&M contracts are typically 90 days for commercial and residential customers and 180 days for power plant customers.\nWe typically provide a system output performance warranty, separate from our standard solar panel product warranty, to customers that have subscribed to our post-installation O&M services. In connection with system output performance warranties, we agree to pay liquidated damages in the event the system does not perform to the stated specifications, with certain exclusions. The warranty excludes system output shortfalls attributable to force majeure events, customer curtailment, irregular weather, and other similar factors. In the event that the system output falls below the warrantied performance level during the applicable warranty period, and provided that the shortfall is not caused by a factor that is excluded from the performance warranty, the warranty provides that we will pay the customer an amount based on the value of the shortfall of energy produced relative to the applicable warrantied performance level. Such liquidated damages represent a form of variable consideration and are estimated at contract inception and updated at each reporting period and recognized over time as customers receive and consume the benefits of the O&M services.\nLease Accounting\nEffective December 31, 2018, we adopted Accounting Standards Update (\"ASU\") No. 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842), as amended (\"ASC 842\"). For additional information on the changes resulting from the new standard and the impact to our financial results on adoption, refer to the section Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements below.\nArrangements with SunPower as a lessee\nWe determine if an arrangement is a lease at inception. Our operating lease agreements are primarily for real estate and are included within operating lease right-of-use (\"ROU\") assets and operating lease liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets. We elected the practical expedient to combine our lease and related non-lease components for all our leases.\nROU assets represent our right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and lease liabilities represent our obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease. ROU assets and lease liabilities are recognized at the commencement date based on the present value of lease payments over the lease term. Variable lease payments are excluded from the ROU assets and lease liabilities and are recognized in the period in which the obligation for those payments is incurred. As most of our leases do not provide an implicit rate, we use our incremental borrowing rate based on the information available at commencement date in determining the present value of lease payments. ROU assets also include any lease prepayments made and exclude lease incentives. Many of our lessee agreements include options to extend the lease, which we do not include in our minimum lease terms unless they are reasonably certain to be exercised. Rental expense for lease payments related to operating leases is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term.\nSale-Leaseback Arrangements\nWe enter into sale-leaseback arrangements under which solar power systems are sold to third parties and subsequently leased back by us over lease terms of up to 25 years.\nWe classify our initial sale-leaseback arrangements of solar power systems as operating leases or sales-type leases, in accordance with the underlying accounting guidance on leases. We may sell our lessee interests in these arrangements in entirety before the end of the underlying term of the leaseback.\nFor all sale-leaseback arrangements classified as operating leases, the profit related to the excess of the proceeds compared to the fair value of the solar power systems is deferred and recognized over the term of the lease. Sale-leaseback arrangements classified as finance leases or failed sale, are accounted for under the financing method, the proceeds received from the sale of the solar power systems are recorded as financing liabilities. The financing liabilities are subsequently reduced by our payments to lease back the solar power systems, less interest expense calculated based on our incremental borrowing rate adjusted to the rate required to prevent negative amortization. Refer to Note 4. Business Divestiture and Sale of Assets, for details of the sale of our commercial sale-leaseback portfolio during fiscal 2019.\nArrangements with SunPower as a lessor\nSolar Services\nWe offer solar services, in partnership with third-party financial institutions, which allows our residential customers to obtain continuous access to SunPower solar power systems under contracts for terms of up to 20 years. Solar services revenue is primarily comprised of revenue from such contracts wherein we provide continuous access to an operating solar system to third parties.\nWe begin to recognize revenue on solar services when permission to operate (\"PTO\") is given by the local utility company, the system is interconnected and operation commences. We recognize revenue evenly over the time that we satisfy our performance obligations over the initial term of the solar services contracts. Solar services contracts typically have an initial term of 20 years. After the initial contract term, our customers may request an extension of the term of the contract on prevailing market terms, or request to remove the system. Otherwise, the contract will automatically renew and continue on a month-to-month basis.\nWe also apply for and receive Solar Renewable Energy Credits (\"SRECs\") associated with the energy generated by our solar energy systems and sell them to third parties in certain jurisdictions. SREC revenue is estimated net of any variable consideration related to possible liquidated damages if we were to deliver fewer SRECs than contractually committed, and is generally recognized upon delivery of the SRECs to the counterparty.\nWe typically provide a system output performance warranty, separate from our standard solar panel product warranty, to our solar services customers. In connection with system output performance warranties, we agree to pay liquidated damages in the event the system does not perform to the stated specifications, with certain exclusions. The warranty excludes system output shortfalls attributable to force majeure events, customer curtailment, irregular weather, and other similar factors. In the event that the system output falls below the warrantied performance level during the applicable warranty period, and provided that the shortfall is not caused by a factor that is excluded from the performance warranty, the warranty provides that we will pay the customer an amount based on the value of the shortfall of energy produced relative to the applicable warrantied performance level. Such liquidated damages represent a form of variable consideration and are estimated at contract inception and updated at each reporting period and recognized over time as customers receive and consume the benefits of the solar services.\nThere are rebate programs offered by utilities in various jurisdictions and are issued directly to homeowners, based on the lease agreements, the homeowners assign these rights to rebate to us. These rights to rebate are considered non-cash consideration, measured based on the utilities' rebates from the installed solar panels on the homeowners' roofs and recognized over the lease term.\nRevenue from solar services contracts entered into prior to the adoption of ASC 842 were accounted for as leases under the superseded lease accounting guidance and reported within \"Residential leasing\" on the consolidated statement of operations.\nShipping and Handling Costs\nWe account for shipping and handling activities related to contracts with customers as costs to fulfill our promise to transfer goods and, accordingly, records such costs in cost of revenue.\nTaxes Collected from Customers and Remitted to Governmental Authorities\nWe exclude from our measurement of transaction prices all taxes assessed by governmental authorities that are both (i) imposed on and concurrent with a specific revenue-producing transaction and (ii) collected from customers. Accordingly, such tax amounts are not included as a component of revenue or cost of revenue.\nImpairment of Residential Lease Assets\nWe evaluate our long-lived assets, including property, plant and equipment, solar power systems leased and to be leased, and other intangible assets with finite lives, for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of such assets may not be recoverable. Factors considered important that could result in an impairment review include significant under-performance relative to expected historical or projected future operating results, significant changes in the manner of use of acquired assets, and significant negative industry or economic trends. Our impairment evaluation of long-lived assets includes an analysis of estimated future undiscounted net cash flows expected to be generated by the assets over their remaining estimated useful lives. If our estimate of future undiscounted net cash flows is insufficient to recover the carrying value of the assets over the remaining estimated useful lives, we record an impairment loss in the amount by which the carrying value of the assets exceeds the fair value. Fair value is generally measured based on either quoted market prices, if available, or discounted cash flow analysis.\nFinancing receivables are generated by solar power systems leased to residential customers under sales-type leases. Financing receivables represent gross minimum lease payments to be received from customers over a period commensurate with the remaining lease term and the system's estimated residual value, net of unearned income and allowance for estimated losses. Our evaluation of the recoverability of these financing receivables is based on evaluation of the likelihood, based on current information and events, and whether we will be able to collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the underlying lease agreements. In accordance with this evaluation, we recognize an allowance for losses on financing receivables based on our estimate of the amount equal to the probable losses net of recoveries. The combination of the leased solar power systems discussed in the preceding paragraph together with the lease financing receivables is referred to as the \"Residential Lease Portfolio.\"\nWe performed a recoverability test for assets in the residential assets by estimating future undiscounted net cash flows\nexpected to be generated by the assets, based on our own specific alternative courses of action under consideration. The\nalternative courses were either to sell or refinance the assets, or hold the assets until the end of their previously estimated useful\nlives. Upon consideration of the alternatives, we determined that market value, in the form of indicative purchase price from a\nthird-party investor was available for a portion of our residential assets. As we intend to sell these remaining residential portfolio assets, we used the indicative purchase price from a third-party investor as fair value of the underlying net assets in our impairment evaluation.\nAllowance for Doubtful Accounts and Sales Returns\nWe maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments. A considerable amount of judgment is required to assess the likelihood of the ultimate realization of accounts receivable. We make our estimates of the collectability of our accounts receivable by analyzing historical bad debts, specific customer creditworthiness and current economic trends.\nIn addition, at the time revenue is recognized from the sale of solar panels and balance of system components, we record estimates for sales returns which reduce revenue. These estimates are based on historical sales returns and analysis of credit memo data, among other known factors.\nProduct Warranties\nWe generally provide a 25-year standard warranty for solar panels that we manufacture for defects in materials and workmanship. The warranty provides that we will repair or replace any defective solar panels during the warranty period. In addition, we pass through to customers' long-term warranties from the original equipment manufacturers of certain system components, such as inverters. Warranties of 25 years from solar panel suppliers are standard in the solar industry, while certain system components carry warranty periods ranging from five to 20 years.\nIn addition, we generally warrant our workmanship on installed systems for periods ranging up to 25 years and also provide a separate system output performance warranty to customers that have subscribed to our post-installation monitoring and maintenance services which expires upon termination of the post-installation monitoring and maintenance services related to the system. The warrantied system output performance level varies by system depending on the characteristics of the system and the negotiated agreement with the customer, and the level declines over time to account for the expected degradation of the system. Actual system output is typically measured annually for purposes of determining whether warrantied performance levels have been met. The warranty excludes system output shortfalls attributable to force majeure events, customer curtailment, irregular weather, and other similar factors. In the event that the system output falls below the warrantied performance level during the applicable warranty period, and provided that the shortfall is not caused by a factor that is excluded from the performance warranty, the warranty provides that we will pay the customer a liquidated damage based on the value of the shortfall of energy produced relative to the applicable warrantied performance level.\nWe maintain reserves to cover the expected costs that could result from these warranties. Our expected costs are generally in the form of product replacement or repair. Warranty reserves are based on our best estimate of such costs and are recognized as a cost of revenue. We continuously monitor product returns for warranty failures and maintain a reserve for the related warranty expenses based on various factors including historical warranty claims, results of accelerated lab testing, field monitoring, vendor reliability estimates, and data on industry averages for similar products. Due to the potential for variability in these underlying factors, the difference between our estimated costs and our actual costs could be material to our consolidated financial statements. If actual product failure rates or the frequency or severity of reported claims differ from our estimates or if there are delays in our responsiveness to outages, we may be required to revise our estimated warranty liability. Historically, warranty costs have been within management's expectations.\nInventories\nInventories are accounted for on a first-in-first-out basis and are valued at the lower of cost or net realizable value. We evaluate the realizability of our inventories, including future purchase commitments under fixed-price long-term supply agreements, based on assumptions about expected demand and market conditions. Our assumption of expected demand is developed based on our analysis of bookings, sales backlog, sales pipeline, market forecast and competitive intelligence. Our assumption of expected demand is compared to available inventory, production capacity, future polysilicon purchase commitments, available third-party inventory and growth plans. Our factory production plans, which drive materials requirement planning, are established based on our assumptions of expected demand. We respond to reductions in expected demand by temporarily reducing manufacturing output and adjusting expected valuation assumptions as necessary. In addition, expected demand by geography has changed historically due to changes in the availability and size of government mandates and economic incentives.\nWe evaluate the terms of our long-term inventory purchase agreements with suppliers for the procurement of polysilicon, ingots, wafers, and solar cells and establish accruals for estimated losses on adverse purchase commitments as necessary, such as lower of cost or net realizable value adjustments, forfeiture of advanced deposits and liquidated damages. Obligations related to non-cancellable purchase orders for inventories match current and forecasted sales orders that will consume these ordered materials and actual consumption of these ordered materials are compared to expected demand regularly. We anticipate total obligations related to long-term supply agreements for inventories will be realized because quantities are less than management's expected demand for its solar power products over a period of years; however, if raw materials inventory balances temporarily exceed near-term demand, we may elect to sell such inventory to third parties to optimize working capital needs. In addition, because the purchase prices required by our long-term polysilicon agreements are significantly higher than current market prices for similar materials, if we are not able to profitably utilize this material in our operations or elect to sell near-term excess, we may incur additional losses. Other market conditions that could affect the realizable value of our inventories and are periodically evaluated by management include the aging of inventories on hand, historical inventory turnover ratio, anticipated sales price, new product development schedules, the effect new products might have on the sale of existing products, product obsolescence, customer concentrations, the current market price of polysilicon as compared to the price in our fixed-price arrangements, and product merchantability, among other factors. If, based on assumptions about expected demand and market conditions, we determine that the cost of inventories exceeds its net realizable value or inventory is excess or obsolete, or we enter into arrangements with third parties for the sale of raw materials that do not allow us to recover our current contractually committed price for such raw materials, we record a write-down or accrual, which may be material, equal to the difference between the cost of inventories and the estimated net realizable value. If actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management, additional inventory write-downs may be required that could negatively affect our gross margin and operating results. If actual market conditions are more favorable, we may have higher gross margin when products that have been previously written down are sold in the normal course of business. Additionally, the Company's classification of its inventory as either current or long-term inventory requires it to estimate the portion of on-hand inventory that we estimate will be realized over the next 12 months.\nStock-Based Compensation\nWe provide stock-based awards to our employees, executive officers and directors through various equity compensation plans including our employee stock option and restricted stock plans. We measure and record compensation expense for all stock-based payment awards based on estimated fair values. The fair value of restricted stock awards and units is based on the market price of our common stock on the date of grant. We have not granted stock options since fiscal 2008. We are required under current accounting guidance to estimate forfeitures at the date of grant. Our estimate of forfeitures is based on our historical activity, which we believe is indicative of expected forfeitures. In subsequent periods if the actual rate of forfeitures differs from our estimate, the forfeiture rates are required to be revised, as necessary. Changes in the estimated forfeiture rates can have a significant effect on stock-based compensation expense since the effect of adjusting the rate is recognized in the period the forfeiture estimate is changed.\nWe also grant performance share units to executive officers and certain employees that require us to estimate expected achievement of performance targets over the performance period. This estimate involves judgment regarding future expectations of various financial performance measures. If there are changes in our estimate of the level of financial performance measures expected to be achieved, the related stock-based compensation expense may be significantly increased or reduced in the period that our estimate changes.\nVariable Interest Entities (\"VIE\")\nWe regularly evaluate our relationships and involvement with unconsolidated VIEs and our other equity and cost method investments, to determine whether we have a controlling financial interest in them or have become the primary beneficiary, thereby requiring us to consolidate their financial results into our financial statements. In connection with the sale of the equity interests in the entities that hold solar power plants, we also consider whether we retain a variable interest in the entity sold, either through retaining a financial interest or by contractual means. If we determine that the entity sold is a VIE and that we hold a variable interest, we then evaluate whether we are the primary beneficiary. If we determine that we are the primary beneficiary, we will consolidate the VIE. The determination of whether we are the primary beneficiary is based upon whether we have the power to direct the activities that most directly impact the economic performance of the VIE and whether we absorb any losses or benefits that would be potentially significant to the VIE.\nAccounting for Business Divestitures\nFrom time to time, we may dispose of significant assets or portion of our business by sale or exchange for other assets. In accounting for such transactions, we apply the applicable guidance of U.S. GAAP pertaining to discontinued operations and disposals of components of an entity. We assess such transaction as regards specified significance measures to determine whether a disposal qualifies as a discontinuance of operations verses a sale of asset components of our entity. Our assessment includes how such a disposal may represent a significant strategic shift in our operations and its impact on our continuing involvement as regards that portion of our business. Instances where disposals do not remove our ability to participate in a significant portion of our business are accounted as disposal of assets. Instances where disposals remove our ability to participate in a significant portion of our business are accounted as discontinued operations. For additional details see Note 4. Business Combinations and Divestitures\" under \"Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data-Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\" We charge disposal related costs that are not part of the consideration to general and administrative expense as they are incurred. These costs typically include transaction and disposal costs, such as legal, accounting, and other professional fees.\nLong-Lived Assets\nOur long-lived assets include property, plant and equipment, solar power systems leased and to be leased, and other intangible assets with finite lives. We evaluate our long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of such assets may not be recoverable. Factors considered important that could result in an impairment review include significant under-performance relative to expected historical or projected future operating results, significant changes in the manner of use of acquired assets and significant negative industry or economic trends. Our impairment evaluation of long-lived assets includes an analysis of estimated future undiscounted net cash flows expected to be generated by the assets over their remaining estimated useful lives. If our estimate of future undiscounted net cash flows is insufficient to recover the carrying value of the assets over the remaining estimated useful lives, we record an impairment loss in the amount by which the carrying value of the assets exceeds the fair value. Fair value is generally measured based on either quoted market prices, if available, or discounted cash flow analyses.\nAccounting for Income Taxes\nOur global operations involve manufacturing, research and development, and selling and project development activities. Profit from non-U.S. activities is subject to local country taxation. It is our intention to indefinitely reinvest these earnings outside the United States. We record a valuation allowance to reduce our U.S., Malta, South Africa, Mexico, and Spain entities' deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized. In assessing the need for a valuation allowance, we consider historical levels of income, expectations and risks associated with the estimates of future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies. In the event we determine that we would be able to realize additional deferred tax assets in the future in excess of the net recorded amount, or if we subsequently determine that realization of an amount previously recorded is unlikely, we would record an adjustment to the deferred tax asset valuation allowance, which would change income tax in the period of adjustment. As of December 29, 2019, we believe there is insufficient evidence to realize additional deferred tax assets beyond the U.S. net operating losses that can be benefited through a carryback election; however, the reversal of the valuation allowance, which could be material, could occur in a future period.\nThe calculation of tax expense and liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex global tax regulations, including in the tax valuation of projects sold to tax equity partnerships and other third parties. We recognize potential liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues in the United States and other tax jurisdictions based on our estimate of whether, and the extent to which, additional taxes will be due. If payment of these amounts ultimately proves to be unnecessary, the reversal of the liabilities would result in tax benefits being recognized in the period in which we determine the liabilities are\nno longer necessary. If the estimate of tax liabilities proves to be less than the ultimate tax assessment, a further charge to expense would result. We accrue interest and penalties on tax contingencies which are classified as \"Provision for income taxes\" in our Consolidated Statements of Operations and are not considered material. In addition, foreign exchange gains (losses) may result from estimated tax liabilities which are expected to be realized in currencies other than the U.S. dollar.\nPursuant to the Tax Sharing Agreement with Cypress, our former parent company, we are obligated to indemnify Cypress upon current utilization of carryforward tax attributes generated while we were part of the Cypress consolidated or combined group. Further, to the extent Cypress experiences any tax examination assessments attributable to our operations while part of the Cypress consolidated or combined group, Cypress will require an indemnification from us for those aspects of the assessment that relate to our operations. See also \"Item 1A. Risk Factors - Risks Related to Our Operations-Our agreements with Cypress require us to indemnify Cypress for certain tax liabilities. These indemnification obligations and related contractual restrictions may limit our ability to pursue certain business initiatives.\"\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nCash Flows\nA summary of the sources and uses of cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash and restricted cash equivalents is as follows:\n\nOperating Activities\nNet cash used in operating activities for the year ended December 29, 2019 was $270.4 million and was primarily the result of: (i) $158.3 million mark-to-market gain on equity investments with readily determinable fair value; (ii) $143.4 million gain on business divestiture; (iii) $128.4 million increase in inventories to support the construction of our solar energy projects; (iv) $66.2 million increase in accounts receivable, primarily driven by billings in excess of collections; (v) $38.2 million increase in contract assets driven by construction activities; (vi) $25.2 million gain on sale of assets; (vii) $17.3 million gain on sale of equity investments without readily determinable fair value; (viii) $8.9 million decrease in operating lease liabilities; (ix) $8.8 million increase in prepaid expenses and other assets, primarily related to movements in prepaid inventory; (x) net loss of $7.7 million; and (xi) $2.2 million increase in project assets, primarily related to the construction of our commercial solar energy projects.

As a result of these factoring arrangements, title of certain accounts receivable balances was transferred to third-party vendors, and both arrangements were accounted for as a sale of financial assets given effective control over these financial assets has been surrendered. As a result, these financial assets have been excluded from our consolidated balance sheets. In connection with the factoring arrangements, we sold accounts receivable invoices amounting to $119.4 million and $26.3 million in fiscal 2019 and 2018, respectively. As of December 29, 2019 and December 30, 2018, total uncollected accounts receivable from end customers under both arrangements were $11.6 million and $21.0 million, respectively.\nNet cash used in operating activities in fiscal 2018 was $543.4 million and was primarily the result of: (i) net loss of $917.5 million; (ii) $182.9 million increase in long-term financing receivables related to our net investment in sales-type leases; (iii) $127.3 million decrease in accounts payable and other accrued liabilities, primarily attributable to payments of accrued expenses; (iv) $59.3 million gain on business divestiture; (v) $54.2 million gain on the sale of equity investments; (vi) $43.5 million increase in contract assets driven by construction activities; (vii) $39.2 million increase in inventories due to the support of various construction projects; (viii) $30.5 million decrease in contract liabilities driven by construction activities; (ix) $6.9 million increase in deferred income taxes; (x) $6.8 million increase due to other various activities; and (xi) $0.2 million increase in accounts receivable, primarily driven by billings.

This was offset by (i) cash paid for solar power systems of $53.3 million; (ii) $47.4 million of purchases of property, plant and equipment; (iii) cash paid for investments in unconsolidated investees of $12.4 million; and (iv) $10.9 million of cash de-consolidated from the sale of residential lease assets.\nNet cash provided by investing activities in fiscal 2018 was $274.9 million, which included (i) proceeds from the sale of investment in joint ventures and non-public companies of $420.3 million; (ii) proceeds of $23.3 million from business divestiture; and (iii) a $13.0 million dividend from equity method investees. This was partially offset by: (i) $167.0 million in capital expenditures primarily related to the expansion of our solar cell manufacturing capacity and costs associated with solar power systems, leased and to be leased; and (ii) $14.7 million paid for investments in consolidated and unconsolidated investees.\nNet cash used in investing activities in fiscal 2017 was $293.1 million, which included (i) $283.0 million in capital expenditures primarily related to the expansion of our solar cell manufacturing capacity and costs associated with solar power systems, leased and to be leased; (ii) $18.6 million paid for investments in consolidated and unconsolidated investees; and (iii) $1.3 million purchase of marketable securities. This was partially offset by proceeds from the sale of investment in joint ventures of $6.0 million and a $3.8 million dividend from equity method investees.\nFinancing Activities\nNet cash provided by financing activities in the year ended December 29, 2019 was $344.3 million, which included: (i) $171.9 million from the common stock offering; (ii) $110.9 million in net proceeds of bank loans and other debt; (iii) $69.2 million net proceeds from the issuance of non-recourse residential financing, net of issuance costs; (iv) $35.5 million of net contributions from noncontrolling interests and redeemable noncontrolling interests related to residential lease projects; (v) $3.0 million of proceeds from issuance of non-recourse power plant and commercial financing, net of issuance costs.

This was partially offset by: (i) 19.1 million in net repayments of bank loans and other debt; and (ii) $4.7 million in purchases of treasury stock for tax withholding obligations on vested restricted stock.\nDebt and Credit Sources\nConvertible Debentures\nAs of December 29, 2019, an aggregate principal amount of $425.0 million of the 4.00% senior convertible debentures due 2023 (the \"4.00% debentures due 2023\") remained issued and outstanding. The 4.00% debentures due 2023 were issued on December 15, 2015. Interest on the 4.00% debentures due 2023 is payable on January 15 and July 15 of each year, beginning on July 15, 2016. Holders are able to exercise their right to convert the debentures at any time into shares of our common stock at an initial conversion price approximately equal to $30.53 per share, subject to adjustment in certain circumstances. If not earlier repurchased or converted, the 4.00% debentures due 2023 mature on January 15, 2023. Holders may require us to repurchase all or a portion of their 4.00% debentures due 2023, upon a fundamental change, as described in the related indenture, at a cash repurchase price equal to 100% of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest. If we undergo a non-stock change of control, as described in the related indenture, the 4.00% debentures due 2023 will be subject to redemption at our option, in whole but not in part, for a period of 30 calendar days following a repurchase date relating to the non-stock change of control, at a cash redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest. Otherwise, the 4.00% debentures due 2023 are not redeemable at our option prior to the maturity date. In the event of certain events of default, Wells Fargo Bank, National Association (\"Wells Fargo\"), the trustee, or the holders of a specified amount of then-outstanding 4.00% debentures due 2023 will have the right to declare all amounts then outstanding due and payable.\nAs of December 29, 2019, an aggregate principal amount of $400.0 million of the 0.875% senior convertible debentures due 2021 (the 0.875% debentures due 2021\u201d) remained issued and outstanding. The 0.875% debentures due 2021 were issued on June 11, 2014. Interest on the 0.875% debentures due 2021 is payable on June 1 and December 1 of each year. Holders are able to exercise their right to convert the debentures at any time into shares of our common stock at an initial conversion price approximately equal to $48.76 per share, subject to adjustment in certain circumstances. If not earlier repurchased or converted, the 0.875% debentures due 2021 mature on June 1, 2021. Holders may require us to repurchase all or a portion of their 0.875% debentures due 2021, upon a fundamental change, as described in the related indenture, at a cash repurchase price equal to 100% of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest. If we undergo a non-stock change of control, as described in the related indenture, the 0.875% debentures due 2021 will be subject to redemption at our option, in whole but not in part, for a period of 30 calendar days following a repurchase date relating to the non-stock change of control, at a cash redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest. Otherwise, the 0.875% debentures due 2021 are not redeemable at our option prior to the maturity date. In the event of certain events of default, Wells Fargo, the trustee, or the holders of a specified amount of then-outstanding 0.875% debentures due 2021 will have the right to declare all amounts then outstanding due and payable. (See \"Item 8. Financial Statements - Note 18. Subsequent Event\")\nLoan Agreement with California Enterprise Development Authority (\"CEDA\")\nOn December 29, 2010, we borrowed from CEDA the proceeds of the $30.0 million aggregate principal amount of CEDA's tax-exempt Recovery Zone Facility Revenue Bonds (SunPower Corporation - Headquarters Project) Series 2010 (the \"Bonds\") maturing April 1, 2031 under a loan agreement with CEDA. Certain of our obligations under the loan agreement were contained in a promissory note dated December 29, 2010 issued by us to CEDA, which assigned the promissory note, along with all right, title and interest in the loan agreement, to Wells Fargo, as trustee, with respect to the Bonds for the benefit of the holders of the Bonds. The Bonds bear interest at a fixed-rate of 8.50% per annum. As of December 29, 2019, the fair value of the Bonds was $32.1 million, determined by using Level 2 inputs based on quarterly market prices as reported by an independent pricing source.\nAs of December 29, 2019, the $30.0 million aggregate principal amount of the Bonds was classified as \"Long-term debt\" in our consolidated balance sheets.\nRevolving Credit Facility with Credit Agricole\nOn October 29, 2019, we entered into a new Green Revolving Credit Agreement (the 2019 Revolver\u201d) with Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Corporate and Investment Bank ( Credit Agricole\u201d), as lender, with a revolving credit commitment of $55.0 million. The 2019 Revolver contains affirmative covenants, events of default and repayment provisions customarily applicable to similar facilities and has a per annum commitment fee of 0.05% on the daily unutilized amount, payable quarterly. Loans under the 2019 Revolver bear either an adjusted LIBOR interest rate for the period elected for such loan or a floating interest rate of the higher of prime rate, federal funds effective rate, or LIBOR for an interest period of one month, plus an applicable margin, ranging from 0.25% to 0.60%, depending on the base interest rate applied, and each matures on the earlier of April 29, 2021, or the termination of commitments thereunder. Our payment obligations under the 2019 Revolver are guaranteed by Total S.A. up to the maximum aggregate principal amount of $55.0 million. In consideration of the commitments of Total S.A., we are required\nto pay them a guaranty fee of 0.25% per annum on any amounts borrowed under the 2019 Revolver and to reimburse Total S.A. for any amounts paid by them under the parent guaranty. We have pledged the equity of a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company that holds our shares of Enphase Energy, Inc. common stock to secure our reimbursement obligation under the 2019 Revolver. We have also agreed to limit our ability to draw funds under the 2019 Revolver, to no more than 67% of the fair market value of the common stock held by our subsidiary at the time of the draw.\nAs of December 29, 2019, we had no outstanding borrowings under the 2019 Revolver.\nSeptember 2011 Letter of Credit Facility with Deutsche Bank and Deutsche Bank Trust Company Americas (together, \"Deutsche Bank Trust\")\nOn September 27, 2011, we entered into a letter of credit facility with Deutsche Bank Trust which provides for the issuance, upon request by us, of letters of credit to support our obligations in an aggregate amount not to exceed $200.0 million. Each letter of credit issued under the facility is fully cash-collateralized and we have entered into a security agreement with Deutsche Bank Trust, granting them a security interest in a cash collateral account established for this purpose.\nAs of December 29, 2019, letters of credit issued under the Deutsche Bank Trust facility totaled $3.6 million, which was fully collateralized with restricted cash as classified on the consolidated balance sheets.\nOther Facilities\nAsset-Backed Loan with Bank of America\nOn March 29, 2019, we entered in a Loan and Security Agreement with Bank of America, N.A., which provides a revolving credit facility secured by certain inventory and accounts receivable in the maximum aggregate principal amount of $50.0 million. The Loan and Security Agreement contains negative and affirmative covenants, events of default and repayment and prepayment provisions customarily applicable to asset-backed credit facilities. The facility bears a floating interest rate of LIBOR plus an applicable margin, and matures on the earlier of March 29, 2022, a date that is 91 days prior to the maturity of our 2021 convertible debentures, or the termination of the commitments thereunder. During fiscal 2019, we drew loans totaling $31.3 million, under this facility and we repaid loans of $12.2 million, leaving a balance outstanding of $19.2 million as of December 29, 2019.\nSunTrust Facility\nOn June 28, 2018, we entered into a Financing Agreement with SunTrust Bank, which provides a revolving credit facility in the maximum aggregate principal amount of $75.0 million. Each loan draw from the facility bears interest at either a base rate or federal funds rate plus an applicable margin or a floating interest rate of LIBOR plus an applicable margin, and matures no later than three years following the date of the draw. As of December 29, 2019, we had $75.0 million in borrowing capacity under this limited recourse construction financing facility.\nNon-recourse Financing and Other Debt\nIn order to facilitate the construction, sale or ongoing operation of certain solar projects, including our residential leasing program, we regularly obtain project-level financing. These financings are secured either by the assets of the specific project being financed or by our equity in the relevant project entity and the lenders do not have recourse to our general assets for repayment of such debt obligations, and hence the financings are referred to as non-recourse. Non-recourse financing is typically in the form of loans from third-party financial institutions, but also takes other forms, including \"flip partnership\" structures, sale-leaseback arrangements, or other forms commonly used in the solar or similar industries. We may seek non-recourse financing covering solely the construction period of the solar project or may also seek financing covering part or all of the operating life of the solar project. We classify non-recourse financings in our consolidated balance sheets in accordance with their terms; however, in certain circumstances, we may repay or refinance these financings prior to stated maturity dates in connection with the sale of the related project or similar circumstances. In addition, in certain instances, the customer may assume the loans at the time that the project entity is sold to the customer. In these instances, subsequent debt assumption is reflected as a financing outflow and operating inflow in the consolidated statements of cash flows to reflect the substance of the assumption as a facilitation of customer financing from a third party.\nLiquidity\nAs of December 29, 2019, we had unrestricted cash and cash equivalents of $423.0 million as compared to $309.4 million as of December 30, 2018. Our cash balances are held in numerous locations throughout the world, and as of December 29, 2019, we had approximately $79.6 million held outside of the United States. This offshore cash is used to fund operations of our business in the Europe and Asia Pacific regions as well as non-U.S. manufacturing operations, which require local payment for product materials and other expenses. The amounts held outside of the United States represent the earnings of our foreign subsidiaries which under the enacted Tax Act, incurred a one-time transition tax (such amounts were previously tax deferred), however, would not result in a cash payment due to our cumulative net operating loss position. We expect total capital expenditures related to purchases of property, plant and equipment of approximately $96.8 million in fiscal 2020 in order to increase our manufacturing capacity for our highest efficiency A-Series (Maxeon 5) product platform and our P-Series technology, improve our current and next generation solar cell manufacturing technology, and other projects. In addition, while we have begun the transition away from our project development business, we still expect to invest capital to develop solar power systems and plants for sale to customers. The development of solar power plants can require long periods of time and substantial initial investments. Our efforts in this area may consist of all stages of development, including land acquisition, permitting, financing, construction, operation and the eventual sale of the projects. We often choose to bear the costs of such efforts prior to the final sale to a customer, which involves significant upfront investments of resources (including, for example, large transmission deposits or other payments, which may be non-refundable), land acquisition, permitting, legal and other costs, and in some cases the actual costs of constructing a project, in advance of the signing of PPAs and EPC contracts and the receipt of any revenue, much of which is not recognized for several additional months or years following contract signing. Any delays in disposition of one or more projects could have a negative impact on our liquidity.\nCertain of our customers also require performance bonds issued by a bonding agency or letters of credit issued by financial institutions, which are returned to us upon satisfaction of contractual requirements. If there is a contractual dispute with the customer, the customer may withhold the security or make a draw under such security, which could have an adverse impact on our liquidity. Obtaining letters of credit may require adequate collateral. All letters of credit issued under our 2016 Guaranteed LC Facilities are guaranteed by Total S.A. pursuant to the Credit Support Agreement. Our September 2011 letter of credit facility with Deutsche Bank Trust is fully collateralized by restricted cash, which reduces the amount of cash available for operations. As of December 29, 2019, letters of credit issued under the Deutsche Bank Trust facility amounted to $3.6 million which were fully collateralized with restricted cash on our consolidated balance sheets.\nSolar power plant projects often require significant up-front investments. These include payments for preliminary engineering, permitting, legal, and other expenses before we can determine whether a project is feasible. We often make arrangements with third-party financiers to acquire and build solar power systems or to fund project construction using non-recourse project debt. As of December 29, 2019, outstanding amounts related to our project financing totaled $9.1 million.\nThere are no assurances, however, that we will have sufficient available cash to repay our indebtedness or that we will be able to refinance such indebtedness on similar terms to the expiring indebtedness. If our capital resources are insufficient to satisfy our liquidity requirements, we may seek to sell additional equity investments or debt securities or obtain other debt financing. The current economic environment, however, could limit our ability to raise capital by issuing new equity or debt securities on acceptable terms, and lenders may be unwilling to lend funds on acceptable terms in the amounts that would be required to supplement cash flows to support operations. The sale of additional equity investments or convertible debt securities would result in additional dilution to our stockholders (and the potential for further dilution upon the exercise of warrants or the conversion of convertible debt) and may not be available on favorable terms or at all, particularly in light of the current conditions in the financial and credit markets. Additional debt would result in increased expenses and would likely impose new restrictive covenants which may be similar or different than those restrictions contained in the covenants under our current loan agreements and debentures. In addition, financing arrangements, including project financing for our solar power plants and letters of credit facilities, may not be available to us, or may not be available in amounts or on terms acceptable to us.\nWhile challenging industry conditions and a competitive environment extended throughout fiscal 2019, we believe that our total cash and cash equivalents, including cash expected to be generated from operations, will be sufficient to meet our obligations over the next 12 months from the date of issuance of our consolidated financial statements. Also, we have been successful in our ability to divest certain investments and non-core assets, such as the sale of membership interests in our Commercial Sale-Leaseback Portfolio, and the sale and leaseback of Hillsboro facility (Note 4. Business Divestiture and Sale of Assets). Additionally, we have secured other sources of financing to satisfy our liquidity needs such as the issuance of common stock through the public offering completed in November 2019 and realizing cash savings resulting from restructuring actions and cost reduction initiatives (Note 14. Common Stock and Note 8. Restructuring). We continue to focus on improving our overall operating performance and liquidity, including managing cash flows and working capital.\nWhile we have not drawn on it, we also have the ability to enhance our available cash by borrowing up to $55 million under our 2019 Revolver. See Note 11. Debt and Credit Sources.\nAlthough we have historically been able to generate liquidity, we cannot predict, with certainty, the outcome of our actions to generate liquidity as planned.\nContractual Obligations\nThe following table summarizes our contractual obligations as of December 29, 2019:\n\n1Convertible debt, including interest, relates to the aggregate of $825.0 million in outstanding principal amount of our senior convertible debentures on December 29, 2019. For the purpose of the table above, we assume that all holders of the outstanding debentures will hold the debentures through the date of maturity, and upon conversion, the values of the senior convertible debentures will be equal to the aggregate principal amount with no premiums.\n2CEDA loan, including interest, relates to the proceeds of the $30.0 million aggregate principal amount of the Bonds. The Bonds mature on April 1, 2031 and bear interest at a fixed rate of 8.50% through maturity.\n3Other debt, including interest, primarily relates to non-recourse finance projects and solar power systems and leases under our residential lease program as described in \"Item 1. Financial Statements-Note 9. Commitments and Contingencies\" in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\n4In connection with purchase and joint venture agreements with non-public companies, we will be required to provide additional financing to such parties of up to $2.9 million, subject to certain conditions.\n5Operating lease commitments primarily relate to certain solar power systems leased from unaffiliated third parties over minimum lease terms of up to 20 years as of December 29, 2019, and various facility lease agreements including leases entered into that have not yet commenced.\n6Finance lease commitments primarily relate to certain buildings, manufacturing and equipment under capital leases in Europe for terms of up to 6 years.\n7Non-cancellable purchase orders relate to purchases of raw materials for inventory and manufacturing equipment from a variety of vendors.\n8Purchase commitments under agreements primarily relate to arrangements entered into with several suppliers, including some of our unconsolidated investees, for polysilicon, ingots, wafers, and module-level power electronics and alternating current cables, among others. These agreements specify future quantities and pricing of products to be supplied by the vendors for periods up to 5 years and there are certain consequences, such as forfeiture of advanced deposits and liquidated damages relating to previous purchases, in the event we terminate these arrangements.\n9In connection with the acquisition of AUO SunPower Sdn. Bhd. in 2016, we are required to make noncancellable annual installment payments during 2019 and 2020. The payment due in fiscal 2019 was made on the first day of the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019.\nLiabilities Associated with Uncertain Tax Positions\nDue to the complexity and uncertainty associated with our tax positions, we cannot make a reasonably reliable estimate of the period in which cash settlement will be made for our liabilities associated with uncertain tax positions in other long-term liabilities. Therefore, they have been excluded from the table above. As of December 29, 2019 and December 30, 2018, total liabilities associated with uncertain tax positions were $20.1 million and $16.8 million, respectively, and are included within \"Other long-term liabilities\" in our consolidated balance sheets as they are not expected to be paid within the next twelve months.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nAs of December 29, 2019, we did not have any significant off-balance sheet arrangements, as defined in Item 303(a)(4)(ii) of SEC Regulation S-K.", "item_7_tables": "Table 13: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>

key points from the MD&A report:\n\n- Total revenue in FY2019 increased 8% to $1.86 billion, driven by a 24% increase in the SunPower Technologies segment. Total revenue in FY2018 decreased 4% to $1.73 billion due to reduced sales in the SunPower Technologies segment.\n\n- Gross margin improved from -17% in FY2018 to 7% in FY2019, primarily due to non-cash impairment charges recorded in FY2018. \n\n- Operating loss narrowed from -$849 million in FY2018 to -$98 million in FY2019. This was driven by the gain on sale of the commercial sale-leaseback portfolio, lower impairment charges, and cost reductions.\n\n- Net loss attributable to shareholders was $22 million in FY2019, compared to a net loss of $811 million in FY2018. This was primarily due to the factors mentioned above.\n\n- Cash used in operations was $270 million in FY2019, compared to $543 million in FY2018, driven by changes in working capital. \n\n- Liquidity was $423 million at the end of FY2019. The company completed a common stock offering for net proceeds of $172 million in Q4 2019 to improve liquidity.\n\n- Key focuses are reducing costs, transitioning away from project development, and investing in new products like the A-Series solar panels. The planned spin-off of the Maxeon business is also mentioned.\n\nIn summary, SunPower improved its financial performance in FY2019 through divestitures, cost cuts, and new product initiatives, but continues to face an extremely challenging industry environment. Liquidity remains a concern despite recent capital raising."}
