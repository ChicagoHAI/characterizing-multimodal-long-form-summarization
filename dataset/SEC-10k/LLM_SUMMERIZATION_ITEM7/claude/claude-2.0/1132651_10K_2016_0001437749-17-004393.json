MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nOverview\nThe following discussion is provided for the consolidated operations of the Company and its Banks. The purpose of this discussion is to focus on significant factors affecting the Company's financial condition and results of operations.\nThe Company does not engage in any material business activities apart from its ownership of the Banks and the managing of its own loan portfolios. Products and services offered by the Banks are for commercial and consumer purposes, including loans, deposits and wealth management services. Some Banks also offer investment services through a third-party broker-dealer. The Company employs 14 individuals to assist with financial reporting, human resources, marketing, audit, compliance, technology systems, training and the coordination of management activities, in addition to 202 full-time equivalent individuals employed by the Banks.\nThe Company's primary competitive strategy is to utilize seasoned and competent Bank management and local decision-making authority to provide customers with prompt response times and flexibility in the products and services offered. This strategy is viewed as providing an opportunity to increase revenues through the creation of a competitive advantage over other financial institutions. The Company also strives to remain operationally efficient to improve profitability while enabling the Banks to offer more competitive loan and deposit rates.\nThe principal sources of Company revenues and cash flows are: (i) interest and fees earned on loans made or held by the Company and Banks; (ii) interest on investments, primarily on bonds, held by the Banks; (iii) fees on wealth management services; (iv) service charges on deposit accounts maintained at the Banks; (v) merchant and card fees; (vi) gain on the sale of loans held for sale; and (vii) securities gains. The Company's principal expenses are: (i) interest expense on deposit accounts and other borrowings; (ii) salaries and employee benefits; (iii) data processing costs primarily associated with maintaining the Banks' loan and deposit functions; (iv) occupancy expenses for maintaining the Banks' facilities; (v) professional fees; (vi) business development; and (vii) other real estate owned expenses. The largest component contributing to the Company's net income is net interest income, which is the difference between interest earned on earning assets (primarily loans and investments) and interest paid on interest bearing liabilities (primarily deposit accounts and other borrowings). One of management's principal functions is to manage the spread between interest earned on earning assets and interest paid on interest bearing liabilities in an effort to maximize net interest income while maintaining an appropriate level of interest rate risk.\nThe Company reported net income of $15,735,000 for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to $15,015,000 and $15,251,000 reported for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. This represents an increase in net income of 4.8% when comparing 2016 with 2015 and a decrease in net income of 1.5% when comparing 2015 with 2014. The increase in net income in 2016 from 2015 was primarily the result of increased loan interest income, lower provision for loan losses and lower other real estate owned expenses, offset in part by decreased security interest income, decreased securities gains and increased salaries and benefits expense. The decrease in net income in 2015 from 2014 was primarily the result of a one-time gain of the disposal of premises and equipment in 2014 and an increase in salaries and benefits and provision for loan losses, offset in part by an increase in net interest income and a decrease in other real estate expenses. The gain on the disposal of premises and equipment in 2014 was primarily due to the sale of First National's University office. The First Bank Acquisition, described in Item 1 of this Annual Report, contributed to increases in net interest income, noninterest income and noninterest expense in 2015. Earnings per share for 2016 were $1.69 compared to $1.61 in 2015 and $1.64 in 2014. All five Banks demonstrated profitable operations during 2016.\nThe Company's return on average equity for 2016 was 9.38% compared to 9.44% and 10.09% in 2015 and 2014, respectively, and the return on average assets for 2016 was 1.18% compared to 1.13% in 2015 and 1.21% in 2014. The decrease in return on average equity when comparing 2016 to 2015 was primarily a result of increased average equity, more than offsetting the increase in net income. The increase in return on average assets when comparing 2016 to 2015 was primarily a result of increased net income. The decrease in return on average equity and assets when comparing 2015 to 2014 was primarily a result of increased average equity and average assets, without a corresponding increase in net income.\nThe following discussion will provide a summary review of important items relating to:\nTable 39: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> \u25cf\n</td> <td> Challenges\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 40: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> \u25cf\n</td> <td> Key Performance Indicators\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 41: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> \u25cf\n</td> <td> Industry Results\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 42: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> \u25cf\n</td> <td> Critical Accounting Policies\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 43: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> \u25cf\n</td> <td> Income Statement Review\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 44: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> \u25cf\n</td> <td> Balance Sheet Review\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 45: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> \u25cf\n</td> <td> Asset Quality Review and Credit Risk Management\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 46: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> \u25cf\n</td> <td> Liquidity and Capital Resources\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 47: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> \u25cf\n</td> <td> Interest Rate Risk\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 48: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> \u25cf\n</td> <td> Inflation\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 49: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> \u25cf\n</td> <td> Forward-Looking Statements and Business Risks\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nChallenges\nManagement has identified certain events or circumstances that have the potential to negatively impact the Company's financial condition and results of operations in the future and is attempting to position the Company to best respond to those challenges.\nTable 50: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> \u25cf\n</td> <td> If interest rates increase significantly over a relatively short period of time due to improving national employment levels or higher inflationary numbers, the interest rate environment may present a challenge to the Company. Increases in interest rates may negatively impact the Company's net interest margin if interest expense increases more quickly than interest income, thus placing downward pressure on net interest income. The Company's earning assets (primarily its loan and investment portfolio) have longer maturities than its interest bearing liabilities (primarily deposits and other borrowings); therefore, in a rising interest rate environment, interest expense will tend to increase more quickly than interest income as the interest bearing liabilities reprice more quickly than earning assets. In response to this challenge, the Banks model quarterly the changes in income that would result from various changes in interest rates. Management believes Bank earning assets have the appropriate maturity and repricing characteristics to optimize earnings and the Banks' interest rate risk positions.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 51: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> \u25cf\n</td> <td> If market interest rates in the three to five year term remain at low levels as compared to the short term interest rates, the interest rate environment may present a challenge to the Company. The Company's earning assets (typically priced at market interest rates in the three to five year range) will reprice at lower interest rates, but the deposits will not reprice at significantly lower interest rates, therefore the net interest income may decrease. Management believes Bank earning assets have the appropriate maturity and repricing characteristics to optimize earnings and the Banks' interest rate risk positions.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 52: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> \u25cf\n</td> <td> The agricultural community is subject to commodity price fluctuations. Extended periods of low commodity prices, higher input costs or poor weather conditions could result in reduced profit margins, reducing demand for goods and services provided by agriculture-related businesses, which, in turn, could affect other businesses in the Company's market area. Any combination of these factors could produce losses within the Company's agricultural loan portfolios.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nKey Performance Indicators\nCertain key performance indicators for the Company and the industry are presented in the following chart. The industry figures are compiled by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) and are derived from 5,913 commercial banks and savings institutions insured by the FDIC. Management reviews these indicators on a quarterly basis for purposes of comparing the Company's performance from quarter to quarter against the industry as a whole.\nSelected Indicators for the Company and the Industry\nTable 53: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Years Ended December 31,\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Company\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Industry\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Company\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Industry\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Company\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Industry\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Return on assets\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1.18 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1.04 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1.13 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1.04 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1.21 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1.01 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Return on equity\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>9.38 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>9.32 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>9.44 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>9.31 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>10.09 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>9.03 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net interest margin\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3.36 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3.13 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3.33 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3.07 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3.31 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3.14 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Efficiency ratio\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>51.95 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>58.28 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>53.59 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>59.91 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>53.37 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>61.88 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Capital ratio\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>12.60 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>9.48 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>12.00 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>9.59 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>11.97 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>9.46 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table>\nKey performance indicators include:\nTable 54: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> \u25cf\n</td> <td> Return on Assets\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThis ratio is calculated by dividing net income by average assets. It is used to measure how effectively the assets of the Company are being utilized in generating income. The Company's return on assets ratio is higher than that of the industry, primarily as a result of the Company's net interest margin and noninterest expense relative to the industry.\nTable 55: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> \u25cf\n</td> <td> Return on Equity\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThis ratio is calculated by dividing net income by average equity. It is used to measure the net income or return the Company generated for the shareholders' equity investment in the Company. The Company's return on equity ratio is higher than the industry primarily as a result of the Company's net interest margin and noninterest expense relative to the industry, offset in part by a higher capital ratio.\nTable 56: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> \u25cf\n</td> <td> Net Interest Margin\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThis ratio is calculated by dividing net interest income by average earning assets. Earning assets consist primarily of loans and investments that earn interest. This ratio is used to measure how well the Company is able to maintain interest rates on earning assets above those of interest-bearing liabilities, which is the interest expense paid on deposit accounts and other borrowings. The Company's net interest margin is slightly higher than the industry, due primarily to a higher yields on earning assets at the Company as compared to the industry.\nTable 57: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> \u25cf\n</td> <td> Efficiency Ratio\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThis ratio is calculated by dividing noninterest expense by net interest income and noninterest income. The ratio is a measure of the Company's ability to manage noninterest expenses. The Company's efficiency ratio is lower than the industry average, primarily as a result of the Company's lower noninterest expense.\nTable 58: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> \u25cf\n</td> <td> Capital Ratio\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe capital ratio is calculated by dividing average total equity capital by average total assets. It measures the level of average assets that are funded by shareholders' equity. Given an equal level of risk in the financial condition of two companies, the higher the capital ratio, generally the more financially sound the company. The Company's capital ratio is significantly higher than the industry average.\nIndustry Results\nThe FDIC Quarterly Banking Profile reported the following results for the fourth quarter of 2016\nIncome Is $43.7 Billion in Fourth Quarter\nInsured institutions reported net income of $43.7 billion for the quarter, an increase of $3.1 billion (7.7%) compared with the year before. Almost 60% of all banks reported year-over-year increases in quarterly earnings. Only 8.1% of banks were unprofitable for the quarter, down from 9.6% the previous year. The average return on assets (ROA) rose slightly to 1.04%, from 1.02% in fourth quarter 2015.\nFull-Year 2016 Earnings Rise to $171.3 Billion\nThe industry reported $171.3 billion in net income for full-year 2016, $7.9 billion (4.9%) more than the industry earned in 2015. Almost two out of every three banks-65.2%-reported higher earnings in 2016 than in 2015. Only 4.2% of all banks had negative full-year net income. This is the lowest percentage of unprofitable banks for any year since 1995. Net operating revenue was $29 billion (4.2%) higher than in 2015, as net interest income increased by $29.8 billion (6.9%) and total noninterest income declined by $779 million (0.3%). The average net interest margin (NIM) rose to 3.13% from 3.07% in 2015. Total noninterest expenses were only $5.1 billion (1.2%) higher than a year earlier, as itemized litigation charges at a few large banks were $2.95 billion lower than in 2015. Loan-loss provisions totaled $47.8 billion, an increase of $10.7 billion (28.8%) from 2015. The average return on assets for 2016 was 1.04%, unchanged from the full-year average for 2015.\nNet Interest Income Growth Lifts Operating Revenues\nNet operating revenue totaled $181.8 billion in the fourth quarter, up $7.9 billion (4.6%) from the year before. Net interest income was $8.4 billion (7.6%) higher, while noninterest income declined by $480 million (0.8%). The increase in net interest income was attributable to growth in interest-bearing assets (up 5.2% over the past 12 months) and improvement in the industry's aggregate NIM, which rose to 3.16%, from 3.12% in fourth quarter 2015. The NIM improvement was not broad-based. A majority of banks-54.3%-reported lower NIMs than the year earlier. The decline in noninterest income was driven by a $950 million drop in income from changes in fair values of financial instruments and a $432 million decline in interchange fees. Both trading income and servicing income rose $1.7 billion (39.8% and 51.4%, respectively) from fourth quarter 2015.\nNoninterest Expenses Up 2.6% From a Year Before\nTotal noninterest expenses were $2.7 billion (2.6%) higher than the year before. Salary and employee benefit expenses rose $1.7 billion (3.4%), while goodwill impairment charges were $675 million higher. Expenses for premises and fixed assets were only $9 million (0.1%) higher than the year earlier.\nQuarterly Loss Provisions Decline From a Year Ago\nLoan-loss provisions totaled $12.2 billion in the fourth quarter, $3 million less than banks set aside a year earlier. This marks the first time since second quarter 2014 that quarterly provision expenses have not posted a year-over-year increase. For the industry, fourth-quarter provisions represented 6.7% of the quarter's net operating revenue, down from 7% in fourth quarter 2015.\nQuarterly Charge-Offs Rise for a Fifth Consecutive Quarter\nNet loan losses totaled $12.2 billion, up $1.5 billion (13.5%) from a year earlier. This is the fifth quarter in a row that net charge-offs have posted a year-over-year increase. Credit card charge-offs were $1.4 billion (24.8%) higher, while net charge-offs of loans to commercial and industrial (C&I) borrowers rose $666 million (37.9%). Charge-offs of residential mortgage loans were $576 million (75.1%) lower than in fourth quarter 2015. The average net charge-off rate rose to 0.53%, from 0.49% the year before. This is well below the high of 3.00% recorded in fourth quarter 2009.\nNoncurrent Loan Rate at Lowest Level Since 2007\nNoncurrent loans and leases-those 90 days or more past-due or in nonaccrual status-declined for the 26th time in the last 27 quarters, falling by $2.4 billion (1.8%) during the three months ended December 31. During the quarter, noncurrent C&I loans declined for the first time in eight quarters, falling by $1.4 billion (5.3%). Noncurrent residential mortgage loan balances fell by $2 billion (3%), while noncurrent home equity loans declined by $170 million (1.6%), and noncurrent nonfarm nonresidential real estate loans fell by $192 million (2%). These improvements exceeded the $1.1 billion (12.7%) increase in noncurrent credit card balances. The average noncurrent loan rate fell from 1.45% to 1.41%, the lowest level since year-end 2007.\nLoan-Loss Reserves Decline for the First Time in Five Quarters\nBanks reduced their reserves for loan and lease losses during the fourth quarter, as slightly lower loan-loss provisions were offset by higher net charge-offs. Loss reserves fell by $649 million (0.5%). At banks that itemize their reserves, which represent more than 90% of total industry reserves, the decline was driven by reductions in reserves for residential real estate loan losses, which fell by $1.2 billion (6.5%), and in reserves for commercial loan losses, which declined by $639 million (1.8%). Itemized reserves for losses on credit cards increased by $677 million (2.3%). Despite the small reduction in industry reserves, the larger decline in noncurrent loan balances caused the coverage ratio of reserves to noncurrent loans to rise from 91.1% to 92.3% in the quarter, the highest level since third quarter 2007.\nEquity Capital Posts a Quarterly Decline as the Market Value of Available-For-Sale Securities Falls\nTotal equity capital declined by $16.8 billion (0.9%) in fourth quarter 2016, as higher interest rates caused the market values of available-for-sale securities at banks to fall. Accumulated other comprehensive income declined by $39.5 billion in the quarter, mostly as a result of the drop in securities values. Retained earnings contributed $15.1 billion to equity growth, $1.8 billion (13.5%) more than a year earlier. Banks declared $28.6 billion in dividends, a $1.3 billion (4.8%) increase over fourth quarter 2015. The average equity-to-assets ratio for the industry declined from 11.22% to 11.11%. At the end of the quarter, 99.7% of all banks, representing 99.9% of industry assets, met or exceeded the requirements for the highest regulatory capital category as defined for Prompt Corrective Action purposes.\nLoan Balances Increase $72.3 Billion in the Fourth Quarter\nTotal assets rose by $13.7 billion (0.1%) during the fourth quarter. Total loan and lease balances increased by $72.3 billion (0.8%). Growth in loan balances was led by credit cards (up $38.2 billion, 5%), loans secured by nonfarm nonresidential real estate properties (up $22.8 billion, 1.7%), and real estate construction and development loans (up $10.1 billion, 3.3%). C&I loan balances fell for the first time in 26 quarters, declining $7.7 billion (0.4%). Investment securities portfolios rose by $52 billion (1.5%) during the quarter despite a $52.4 billion decline in the market values of securities available for sale. Assets in trading accounts declined by $27.3 billion (4.6%). Banks reduced their balances at Federal Reserve banks by $116.4 billion (9.6%).\nTotal Loan Balances Rise 5.3% During 2016\nFor full-year 2016, total assets increased $812.6 billion (5.1%). Total loans and leases increased by $466 billion (5.3%), as C&I loans rose by $94.2 billion (5.1%), loans secured by nonfarm nonresidential real estate were up by $92.6 billion (7.5%), and residential mortgages increased by $91.1 billion (4.8%). All major loan categories grew in 2016. Banks increased their investment securities by $205.9 billion (6.1%) in 2016, with mortgage-backed securities up $133.3 billion (7.1%) and U.S. Treasury securities up $97 billion (23%).\nDeposits Rise by $96 Billion\nDomestic deposit growth was relatively strong in the fourth quarter. Total deposits rose by $95.9 billion (0.7%), as deposits in domestic offices increased by $186.5 billion (1.6%), while foreign office deposits declined by $90.6 billion (6.8%). Balances in domestic interest-bearing accounts rose by $178.7 billion (2.1%), and balances in noninterest-bearing accounts grew by $7.7 billion (0.2%). Balances in consumer-oriented accounts increased by $120.5 billion (3%), while all other domestic office deposits rose by $62 billion (1%). Banks reduced their nondeposit liabilities by $65.4 billion (3.1%), as securities sold under repurchase agreements declined by $25.1 billion (10.9%), and trading account liabilities fell by $13 billion (5.1%).\nProblem Bank List\u201d Continues to Improve\nThe number of FDIC-insured commercial banks and savings institutions reporting quarterly financial results fell to 5,913 in the fourth quarter, from 5,980 in the third quarter of 2016. There were 65 mergers of insured institutions during the quarter, while no insured banks failed. No new charters were added during the quarter. Banks reported 2,052,504 full-time equivalent employees, an increase of 18,777 from fourth quarter 2015. The number of insured institutions on the FDIC's Problem Bank List\u201d declined from 132 to 123, as total assets of problem banks rose from $24.9 billion to $27.6 billion. For all of 2016, the number of insured institutions reporting declined by 269. Mergers absorbed 251 institutions, and 5 insured institutions failed. This is the smallest number of bank failures in a year since three FDIC-insured institutions failed in 2007. In 2015, there were eight failures.\nCritical Accounting Policies\nThe discussion contained in this Item 7 and other disclosures included within this Annual Report are based on the Company's audited consolidated financial statements which appear in Item 8 of this Annual Report. These statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The financial information contained in these statements is, for the most part, based on the financial effects of transactions and events that have already occurred. However, the preparation of these statements requires management to make certain estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses.\nThe Company's significant accounting policies are described in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\u201d accompanying the Company's audited financial statements. Based on its consideration of accounting policies that involve the most complex and subjective estimates and judgments, management has identified the allowance for loan losses, the assessment of other-than-temporary impairment for investment securities and the assessment of goodwill to be the Company's most critical accounting policies.\nAllowance for Loan Losses\nThe allowance for loan losses is established through a provision for loan losses that is treated as an expense and charged against earnings. Loans are charged against the allowance for loan losses when management believes that collectability of the principal is unlikely. The Company has policies and procedures for evaluating the overall credit quality of its loan portfolio, including timely identification of potential problem loans. On a quarterly basis, management reviews the appropriate level for the allowance for loan losses, incorporating a variety of risk considerations, both quantitative and qualitative. Quantitative factors include the Company's historical loss experience, delinquency and charge-off trends, collateral values, known information about individual loans and other factors. Qualitative factors include various considerations regarding the general economic environment in the Company's market area. To the extent actual results differ from forecasts and management's judgment, the allowance for loan losses may be greater or lesser than future charge-offs. Due to potential changes in conditions, it is at least reasonably possible that changes in estimates will occur in the near term and that such changes could be material to the amounts reported in the Company's financial statements.\nFor further discussion concerning the allowance for loan losses and the process of establishing specific reserves, see the section of this Annual Report entitled Asset Quality Review and Credit Risk Management\u201d and Analysis of the Allowance for Loan Losses\u201d.\nFair Value and Other-Than-Temporary Impairment of Investment Securities\nThe Company's securities available-for-sale portfolio is carried at fair value with fair value\u201d being defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants. A fair value measurement assumes that the transaction to sell the asset or transfer the liability occurs in the principal market for the asset or liability or, in the absence of a principal market, the most advantageous market for the asset or liability. The price in the principal (or most advantageous) market used to measure the fair value of the asset or liability is not adjusted for transaction costs. An orderly transaction is a transaction that assumes exposure to the market for a period prior to the measurement date to allow for marketing activities that are usual and customary for transactions involving such assets and liabilities; it is not a forced transaction. Market participants are buyers and sellers in the principal market that are (i) independent, (ii) knowledgeable, (iii) able to transact, and (iv) willing to transact.\nDeclines in the fair value of available-for-sale securities below their cost that are deemed to be other-than-temporary are reflected in earnings as realized losses. In estimating other-than-temporary impairment losses, management considers (1) the intent to sell the investment securities and the more likely than not requirement that the Company will be required to sell the investment securities prior to recovery (2) the length of time and the extent to which the fair value has been less than cost and (3) the financial condition and near-term prospects of the issuer. Due to potential changes in conditions, it is at least reasonably possible that changes in management's assessment of other-than-temporary impairment will occur in the near term and that such changes could be material to the amounts reported in the Company's financial statements.\nGoodwill\nGoodwill arose in connection with the First Bank Acquisition on August 29, 2014 and the Liberty Acquisition on April 27, 2012. Goodwill is tested annually for impairment or more often if conditions indicate a possible impairment. For the purposes of goodwill impairment testing, determination of the fair value of a reporting unit involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions. Impairment would arise if the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value. At December 31, 2016, Company's management has completed the goodwill impairment analysis and determined goodwill was not impaired. Actual future test results may differ from the present evaluation of impairment due to changes in the conditions used in the current evaluation.\nIncome Statement Review\nThe following highlights a comparative discussion of the major components of net income and their impact for the last three years.\nAverage Balances and Interest Rates\nThe following two tables are used to calculate the Company's net interest margin. The first table includes the Company's average assets and the related income to determine the average yield on earning assets. The second table includes the average liabilities and related expense to determine the average rate paid on interest bearing liabilities. The net interest margin is equal to the interest income less the interest expense divided by average earning assets. Refer to the net interest income discussion following the tables for additional detail.\nASSETS\nTable 59: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td>

the change in interest income or expense is the result of a change in volume or a change in interest rate. For example, real estate loan interest income increased $1,917,000 in 2016 compared to 2015. Increased volume of real estate loans increased interest income in 2016 by $2,362,000 and lower interest rates decreased interest income in 2016 by $445,000.\nThe following table sets forth, on a

to change due to volume and change due to yield/rate in proportion to the absolute value of the change in each.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nNet Interest Income\nThe Company's largest contributing component to net income is net interest income, which is the difference between interest earned on earning assets and interest paid on interest bearing liabilities. The volume of and yields earned on earning assets and the volume of and the rates paid on interest bearing liabilities determine net interest income. Refer to the tables preceding this paragraph for additional detail. Interest earned and interest paid is also affected by general economic conditions, particularly changes in market interest rates, by government policies and the action of regulatory authorities. Net interest income divided by average earning assets is referred to as net interest margin. For the years December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, the Company's net interest margin was 3.36%, 3.33% and 3.31%, respectively.\nNet interest income during 2016, 2015 and 2014 totaled $39,911,000, $38,965,000 and $36,417,000, respectively, representing a 2.4% increase in 2016 compared to 2015 and a 7.0% increase in 2015 from 2014. Net interest income increased in 2016 as compared to 2015 due primarily to increases in the average balance of real estate loans. Net interest income increased in 2015 as compared to 2014 due primarily to increases in the average balance of real estate loans.\nThe high level of competition in the local markets will continue to put downward pressure on the net interest margin of the Company. Currently, the Company's primary market in Ames, Iowa, has ten banks, six credit unions and several other financial investment companies. Multiple banks are also located in the Company's other market areas in central and north central Iowa creating similarly competitive environments.\nProvision for Loan Losses\nThe provision for loan losses reflects management's judgment of the expense to be recognized in order to maintain an adequate allowance for loan losses. The Company's provision for loan losses for the year ended December 31, 2016 was $524,000 compared to $1,099,000 for the previous year. The provision for loan losses in 2016 and 2015 were necessary to maintain an adequate allowance for loan loss on the outstanding loan portfolio, as net charge offs were not significant. The increase in the allowance for loan losses in 2016 was provided due to growth in the Company's loan portfolios and, to a lesser extent to provide for a specific reserve on impaired loans. The Company's provision for loan losses for the year ended December 31, 2015 was $1,099,000 compared to $429,000 for the previous year. The higher provision for loan losses in 2015 as compared to 2014 was due primarily to increases in the general allowance resulting from increased outstanding loans in the construction and commercial operating portfolios. Credit quality indicators such as classified assets and impaired loans have improved since 2014; while past due loans have risen slightly but remain at a favorable level as compared to peer banks. There was no significant change in the allowance for loan loss on impaired loans. Refer to the Asset Quality and Credit Risk Management\u201d discussion for additional details with regard to loan loss provision expense.\nManagement believes the allowance for loan losses is adequate to absorb probable losses in the current portfolio. This statement is based upon management's continuing evaluation of inherent risks in the current loan portfolio, current levels of classified assets and general economic factors. The Company will continue to monitor the allowance and make future adjustments to the allowance as conditions dictate. Due to potential changes in conditions, it is at least reasonably possible that change in estimates will occur in the near term and that such changes could be material to the amounts reported in the Company's financial statements.\nNoninterest Income and Expense\nTotal noninterest income is comprised primarily of fee-based revenues from wealth management and trust services, bank-related service charges on deposit activities, net securities gains, merchant and card fees related to electronic processing of merchant and cash transactions and gain on the sale of loans held for sale.\nNoninterest income during the years ended 2016, 2015 and 2014 totaled $8,088,000, $8,267,000 and $9,252,000, respectively. The lower noninterest income in 2016 as compared to 2015 related primarily to the lower security gains, offset in part by an increase in wealth management income. The increase in wealth management income is primarily due to increases in assets under management. The lower noninterest income in 2015 as compared to 2014 related primarily to the gain on the disposal of premises and equipment in 2014 and lower recognized securities gains, offset in part by higher gains on the sale of loans held for sale and merchant and card fees. The gain on the disposal of premises and equipment was due primarily to the sale of First National's University office in 2014 which resulted in a $1,257,000 gain. The increase in gain on sale of loans held for sale is due primarily to higher loan origination volume due to favorable economic conditions during 2015. The increase in merchant and card fees is due primarily to the First Bank Acquisition. Excluding securities gains, noninterest income increased 3.5% in 2016 as compared to 2015. Excluding securities gains and gain on disposal of premises and equipment in 2015 and 2014, noninterest income increased 7.0% in 2015 as compared to 2014.\nNoninterest expense for the Company consists of all operating expenses other than interest expense on deposits and other borrowed funds. Salaries and employee benefits are the largest component of the Company's operating expenses and comprise 63%, 60% and 58% of noninterest expense in 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively.\nNoninterest expense during the years ended 2016, 2015 and 2014 totaled $24,935,000, $25,312,000 and $24,373,000, respectively, representing a 1.5% decrease in 2016 compared to a 3.9% increase in 2015. The primary reason for the decrease in 2016 was lower other real estate owned expenses and FDIC insurance assessments, offset in part by increases in salaries and employee benefits and data processing costs. Other real estate owned expense declined primarily due to impairment losses in 2016 of $28,000 as compared to losses of $615,000 in 2015. To a lesser extent other real estate owned expense decreased due to gains on the sale of other real estate owned of $219,000 in 2016 as compared to gains of $100,000 in 2015. FDIC insurance assessment decreased primarily due to lower assessment rates in 2016 as compared to 2015. Salaries and employee benefits increased primarily due to normal salary increases and to a lesser extent normal increases in benefit costs. Data processing costs increased in 2016 primarily due to normal increases in our existing data processing contracts. The primary reason for the increase in noninterest expense in 2015 was higher salaries and employee benefit costs benefits and data processing costs, offset in part by a decrease in the other real estate owned expense. Salaries and employee benefits increased due primarily to additional payroll costs associated with the First Bank Acquisition and normal salary increases. Data processing costs increased due primarily to the First Bank Acquisition, equipping the West Ames Office and expenses related to the implementation of video banking services. Other real estate owned expenses decreased due to lower levels of impairment write-down in 2015 as compared to 2014. The percentage of noninterest expense to average assets was 1.87% in 2016, compared to 1.91% and 1.93% during 2015 and 2014, respectively.\nProvision for Income Taxes\nThe provision for income taxes for 2016, 2015 and 2014 was $6,805,000, $5,807,000 and $5,616,000, respectively. This amount represents an effective tax rate of 30%, 28% and 27% for 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. The Company's marginal federal income tax rate is currently 35%. The difference between the Company's effective and marginal tax rate is primarily related to investments made in tax exempt securities. The increase in the effective tax rate for 2016 is due primarily to an increase in income before income taxes; tax-exempt interest income decreasing as a percent of income before income taxes; and the recording of a $226,000 valuation allowance to fully reserve the deferred income tax asset associated with a state alternative minimum tax credit carryforward in 2016. The increase in the effective tax rate for 2015 is due primarily to tax-exempt interest income decreasing as a percent of income before income taxes.\nBalance Sheet Review\nThe Company's assets are comprised primarily of loans and investment securities. Average earning asset maturity or repricing dates are generally five years or less for the combined portfolios as the assets are funded for the most part by short term deposits with either immediate availability or less than one year average maturities. This exposes the Company to risk with regard to changes in interest rates that are more fully explained in", "item_7_truncated": "ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nOverview\nThe following discussion is provided for the consolidated operations of the Company and its Banks. The purpose of this discussion is to focus on significant factors affecting the Company's financial condition and results of operations.\nThe Company does not engage in any material business activities apart from its ownership of the Banks and the managing of its own loan portfolios. Products and services offered by the Banks are for commercial and consumer purposes, including loans, deposits and wealth management services. Some Banks also offer investment services through a third-party broker-dealer. The Company employs 14 individuals to assist with financial reporting, human resources, marketing, audit, compliance, technology systems, training and the coordination of management activities, in addition to 202 full-time equivalent individuals employed by the Banks.\nThe Company's primary competitive strategy is to utilize seasoned and competent Bank management and local decision-making authority to provide customers with prompt response times and flexibility in the products and services offered. This strategy is viewed as providing an opportunity to increase revenues through the creation of a competitive advantage over other financial institutions. The Company also strives to remain operationally efficient to improve profitability while enabling the Banks to offer more competitive loan and deposit rates.\nThe principal sources of Company revenues and cash flows are: (i) interest and fees earned on loans made or held by the Company and Banks; (ii) interest on investments, primarily on bonds, held by the Banks; (iii) fees on wealth management services; (iv) service charges on deposit accounts maintained at the Banks; (v) merchant and card fees; (vi) gain on the sale of loans held for sale; and (vii) securities gains. The Company's principal expenses are: (i) interest expense on deposit accounts and other borrowings; (ii) salaries and employee benefits; (iii) data processing costs primarily associated with maintaining the Banks' loan and deposit functions; (iv) occupancy expenses for maintaining the Banks' facilities; (v) professional fees; (vi) business development; and (vii) other real estate owned expenses. The largest component contributing to the Company's net income is net interest income, which is the difference between interest earned on earning assets (primarily loans and investments) and interest paid on interest bearing liabilities (primarily deposit accounts and other borrowings). One of management's principal functions is to manage the spread between interest earned on earning assets and interest paid on interest bearing liabilities in an effort to maximize net interest income while maintaining an appropriate level of interest rate risk.\nThe Company reported net income of $15,735,000 for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to $15,015,000 and $15,251,000 reported for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. This represents an increase in net income of 4.8% when comparing 2016 with 2015 and a decrease in net income of 1.5% when comparing 2015 with 2014. The increase in net income in 2016 from 2015 was primarily the result of increased loan interest income, lower provision for loan losses and lower other real estate owned expenses, offset in part by decreased security interest income, decreased securities gains and increased salaries and benefits expense. The decrease in net income in 2015 from 2014 was primarily the result of a one-time gain of the disposal of premises and equipment in 2014 and an increase in salaries and benefits and provision for loan losses, offset in part by an increase in net interest income and a decrease in other real estate expenses. The gain on the disposal of premises and equipment in 2014 was primarily due to the sale of First National's University office. The First Bank Acquisition, described in Item 1 of this Annual Report, contributed to increases in net interest income, noninterest income and noninterest expense in 2015. Earnings per share for 2016 were $1.69 compared to $1.61 in 2015 and $1.64 in 2014. All five Banks demonstrated profitable operations during 2016.\nThe Company's return on average equity for 2016 was 9.38% compared to 9.44% and 10.09% in 2015 and 2014, respectively, and the return on average assets for 2016 was 1.18% compared to 1.13% in 2015 and 1.21% in 2014. The decrease in return on average equity when comparing 2016 to 2015 was primarily a result of increased average equity, more than offsetting the increase in net income. The increase in return on average assets when comparing 2016 to 2015 was primarily a result of increased net income. The decrease in return on average equity and assets when comparing 2015 to 2014 was primarily a result of increased average equity and average assets, without a corresponding increase in net income.\nThe following discussion will provide a summary review of important items relating to:\n \u25cf Challenges \n \u25cf Key Performance Indicators \n \u25cf Industry Results \n \u25cf Critical Accounting Policies \n \u25cf Income Statement Review \n \u25cf Balance Sheet Review \n \u25cf Asset Quality Review and Credit Risk Management \n \u25cf Liquidity and Capital Resources \n \u25cf Interest Rate Risk \n \u25cf Inflation \n \u25cf Forward-Looking Statements and Business Risks \nChallenges\nManagement has identified certain events or circumstances that have the potential to negatively impact the Company's financial condition and results of operations in the future and is attempting to position the Company to best respond to those challenges.\n \u25cf If interest rates increase significantly over a relatively short period of time due to improving national employment levels or higher inflationary numbers, the interest rate environment may present a challenge to the Company. Increases in interest rates may negatively impact the Company's net interest margin if interest expense increases more quickly than interest income, thus placing downward pressure on net interest income. The Company's earning assets (primarily its loan and investment portfolio) have longer maturities than its interest bearing liabilities (primarily deposits and other borrowings); therefore, in a rising interest rate environment, interest expense will tend to increase more quickly than interest income as the interest bearing liabilities reprice more quickly than earning assets. In response to this challenge, the Banks model quarterly the changes in income that would result from various changes in interest rates. Management believes Bank earning assets have the appropriate maturity and repricing characteristics to optimize earnings and the Banks' interest rate risk positions. \n \u25cf If market interest rates in the three to five year term remain at low levels as compared to the short term interest rates, the interest rate environment may present a challenge to the Company. The Company's earning assets (typically priced at market interest rates in the three to five year range) will reprice at lower interest rates, but the deposits will not reprice at significantly lower interest rates, therefore the net interest income may decrease. Management believes Bank earning assets have the appropriate maturity and repricing characteristics to optimize earnings and the Banks' interest rate risk positions. \n \u25cf The agricultural community is subject to commodity price fluctuations. Extended periods of low commodity prices, higher input costs or poor weather conditions could result in reduced profit margins, reducing demand for goods and services provided by agriculture-related businesses, which, in turn, could affect other businesses in the Company's market area. Any combination of these factors could produce losses within the Company's agricultural loan portfolios. \nKey Performance Indicators\nCertain key performance indicators for the Company and the industry are presented in the following chart. The industry figures are compiled by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) and are derived from 5,913 commercial banks and savings institutions insured by the FDIC. Management reviews these indicators on a quarterly basis for purposes of comparing the Company's performance from quarter to quarter against the industry as a whole.\nSelected Indicators for the Company and the Industry\nTable 53: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Years Ended December 31,\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Company\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Industry\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Company\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Industry\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Company\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Industry\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Return on assets\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1.18 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1.04 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1.13 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1.04 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1.21 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1.01 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Return on equity\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>9.38 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>9.32 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>9.44 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>9.31 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>10.09 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>9.03 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net interest margin\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3.36 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3.13 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3.33 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3.07 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3.31 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3.14 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Efficiency ratio\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>51.95 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>58.28 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>53.59 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>59.91 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>53.37 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>61.88 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Capital ratio\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>12.60 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>9.48 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>12.00 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>9.59 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>11.97 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>9.46 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table>\nKey performance indicators include:\n \u25cf Return on Assets \nThis ratio is calculated by dividing net income by average assets. It is used to measure how effectively the assets of the Company are being utilized in generating income. The Company's return on assets ratio is higher than that of the industry, primarily as a result of the Company's net interest margin and noninterest expense relative to the industry.\n \u25cf Return on Equity \nThis ratio is calculated by dividing net income by average equity. It is used to measure the net income or return the Company generated for the shareholders' equity investment in the Company. The Company's return on equity ratio is higher than the industry primarily as a result of the Company's net interest margin and noninterest expense relative to the industry, offset in part by a higher capital ratio.\n \u25cf Net Interest Margin \nThis ratio is calculated by dividing net interest income by average earning assets. Earning assets consist primarily of loans and investments that earn interest. This ratio is used to measure how well the Company is able to maintain interest rates on earning assets above those of interest-bearing liabilities, which is the interest expense paid on deposit accounts and other borrowings. The Company's net interest margin is slightly higher than the industry, due primarily to a higher yields on earning assets at the Company as compared to the industry.\n \u25cf Efficiency Ratio \nThis ratio is calculated by dividing noninterest expense by net interest income and noninterest income. The ratio is a measure of the Company's ability to manage noninterest expenses. The Company's efficiency ratio is lower than the industry average, primarily as a result of the Company's lower noninterest expense.\n \u25cf Capital Ratio \nThe capital ratio is calculated by dividing average total equity capital by average total assets. It measures the level of average assets that are funded by shareholders' equity. Given an equal level of risk in the financial condition of two companies, the higher the capital ratio, generally the more financially sound the company. The Company's capital ratio is significantly higher than the industry average.\nIndustry Results\nThe FDIC Quarterly Banking Profile reported the following results for the fourth quarter of 2016\nIncome Is $43.7 Billion in Fourth Quarter\nInsured institutions reported net income of $43.7 billion for the quarter, an increase of $3.1 billion (7.7%) compared with the year before. Almost 60% of all banks reported year-over-year increases in quarterly earnings. Only 8.1% of banks were unprofitable for the quarter, down from 9.6% the previous year. The average return on assets (ROA) rose slightly to 1.04%, from 1.02% in fourth quarter 2015.\nFull-Year 2016 Earnings Rise to $171.3 Billion\nThe industry reported $171.3 billion in net income for full-year 2016, $7.9 billion (4.9%) more than the industry earned in 2015. Almost two out of every three banks-65.2%-reported higher earnings in 2016 than in 2015. Only 4.2% of all banks had negative full-year net income. This is the lowest percentage of unprofitable banks for any year since 1995. Net operating revenue was $29 billion (4.2%) higher than in 2015, as net interest income increased by $29.8 billion (6.9%) and total noninterest income declined by $779 million (0.3%). The average net interest margin (NIM) rose to 3.13% from 3.07% in 2015. Total noninterest expenses were only $5.1 billion (1.2%) higher than a year earlier, as itemized litigation charges at a few large banks were $2.95 billion lower than in 2015. Loan-loss provisions totaled $47.8 billion, an increase of $10.7 billion (28.8%) from 2015. The average return on assets for 2016 was 1.04%, unchanged from the full-year average for 2015.\nNet Interest Income Growth Lifts Operating Revenues\nNet operating revenue totaled $181.8 billion in the fourth quarter, up $7.9 billion (4.6%) from the year before. Net interest income was $8.4 billion (7.6%) higher, while noninterest income declined by $480 million (0.8%). The increase in net interest income was attributable to growth in interest-bearing assets (up 5.2% over the past 12 months) and improvement in the industry's aggregate NIM, which rose to 3.16%, from 3.12% in fourth quarter 2015. The NIM improvement was not broad-based. A majority of banks-54.3%-reported lower NIMs than the year earlier. The decline in noninterest income was driven by a $950 million drop in income from changes in fair values of financial instruments and a $432 million decline in interchange fees. Both trading income and servicing income rose $1.7 billion (39.8% and 51.4%, respectively) from fourth quarter 2015.\nNoninterest Expenses Up 2.6% From a Year Before\nTotal noninterest expenses were $2.7 billion (2.6%) higher than the year before. Salary and employee benefit expenses rose $1.7 billion (3.4%), while goodwill impairment charges were $675 million higher. Expenses for premises and fixed assets were only $9 million (0.1%) higher than the year earlier.\nQuarterly Loss Provisions Decline From a Year Ago\nLoan-loss provisions totaled $12.2 billion in the fourth quarter, $3 million less than banks set aside a year earlier. This marks the first time since second quarter 2014 that quarterly provision expenses have not posted a year-over-year increase. For the industry, fourth-quarter provisions represented 6.7% of the quarter's net operating revenue, down from 7% in fourth quarter 2015.\nQuarterly Charge-Offs Rise for a Fifth Consecutive Quarter\nNet loan losses totaled $12.2 billion, up $1.5 billion (13.5%) from a year earlier. This is the fifth quarter in a row that net charge-offs have posted a year-over-year increase. Credit card charge-offs were $1.4 billion (24.8%) higher, while net charge-offs of loans to commercial and industrial (C&I) borrowers rose $666 million (37.9%). Charge-offs of residential mortgage loans were $576 million (75.1%) lower than in fourth quarter 2015. The average net charge-off rate rose to 0.53%, from 0.49% the year before. This is well below the high of 3.00% recorded in fourth quarter 2009.\nNoncurrent Loan Rate at Lowest Level Since 2007\nNoncurrent loans and leases-those 90 days or more past-due or in nonaccrual status-declined for the 26th time in the last 27 quarters, falling by $2.4 billion (1.8%) during the three months ended December 31. During the quarter, noncurrent C&I loans declined for the first time in eight quarters, falling by $1.4 billion (5.3%). Noncurrent residential mortgage loan balances fell by $2 billion (3%), while noncurrent home equity loans declined by $170 million (1.6%), and noncurrent nonfarm nonresidential real estate loans fell by $192 million (2%). These improvements exceeded the $1.1 billion (12.7%) increase in noncurrent credit card balances. The average noncurrent loan rate fell from 1.45% to 1.41%, the lowest level since year-end 2007.\nLoan-Loss Reserves Decline for the First Time in Five Quarters\nBanks reduced their reserves for loan and lease losses during the fourth quarter, as slightly lower loan-loss provisions were offset by higher net charge-offs. Loss reserves fell by $649 million (0.5%). At banks that itemize their reserves, which represent more than 90% of total industry reserves, the decline was driven by reductions in reserves for residential real estate loan losses, which fell by $1.2 billion (6.5%), and in reserves for commercial loan losses, which declined by $639 million (1.8%). Itemized reserves for losses on credit cards increased by $677 million (2.3%). Despite the small reduction in industry reserves, the larger decline in noncurrent loan balances caused the coverage ratio of reserves to noncurrent loans to rise from 91.1% to 92.3% in the quarter, the highest level since third quarter 2007.\nEquity Capital Posts a Quarterly Decline as the Market Value of Available-For-Sale Securities Falls\nTotal equity capital declined by $16.8 billion (0.9%) in fourth quarter 2016, as higher interest rates caused the market values of available-for-sale securities at banks to fall. Accumulated other comprehensive income declined by $39.5 billion in the quarter, mostly as a result of the drop in securities values. Retained earnings contributed $15.1 billion to equity growth, $1.8 billion (13.5%) more than a year earlier. Banks declared $28.6 billion in dividends, a $1.3 billion (4.8%) increase over fourth quarter 2015. The average equity-to-assets ratio for the industry declined from 11.22% to 11.11%. At the end of the quarter, 99.7% of all banks, representing 99.9% of industry assets, met or exceeded the requirements for the highest regulatory capital category as defined for Prompt Corrective Action purposes.\nLoan Balances Increase $72.3 Billion in the Fourth Quarter\nTotal assets rose by $13.7 billion (0.1%) during the fourth quarter. Total loan and lease balances increased by $72.3 billion (0.8%). Growth in loan balances was led by credit cards (up $38.2 billion, 5%), loans secured by nonfarm nonresidential real estate properties (up $22.8 billion, 1.7%), and real estate construction and development loans (up $10.1 billion, 3.3%). C&I loan balances fell for the first time in 26 quarters, declining $7.7 billion (0.4%). Investment securities portfolios rose by $52 billion (1.5%) during the quarter despite a $52.4 billion decline in the market values of securities available for sale. Assets in trading accounts declined by $27.3 billion (4.6%). Banks reduced their balances at Federal Reserve banks by $116.4 billion (9.6%).\nTotal Loan Balances Rise 5.3% During 2016\nFor full-year 2016, total assets increased $812.6 billion (5.1%). Total loans and leases increased by $466 billion (5.3%), as C&I loans rose by $94.2 billion (5.1%), loans secured by nonfarm nonresidential real estate were up by $92.6 billion (7.5%), and residential mortgages increased by $91.1 billion (4.8%). All major loan categories grew in 2016. Banks increased their investment securities by $205.9 billion (6.1%) in 2016, with mortgage-backed securities up $133.3 billion (7.1%) and U.S. Treasury securities up $97 billion (23%).\nDeposits Rise by $96 Billion\nDomestic deposit growth was relatively strong in the fourth quarter. Total deposits rose by $95.9 billion (0.7%), as deposits in domestic offices increased by $186.5 billion (1.6%), while foreign office deposits declined by $90.6 billion (6.8%). Balances in domestic interest-bearing accounts rose by $178.7 billion (2.1%), and balances in noninterest-bearing accounts grew by $7.7 billion (0.2%). Balances in consumer-oriented accounts increased by $120.5 billion (3%), while all other domestic office deposits rose by $62 billion (1%). Banks reduced their nondeposit liabilities by $65.4 billion (3.1%), as securities sold under repurchase agreements declined by $25.1 billion (10.9%), and trading account liabilities fell by $13 billion (5.1%).\nProblem Bank List\u201d Continues to Improve\nThe number of FDIC-insured commercial banks and savings institutions reporting quarterly financial results fell to 5,913 in the fourth quarter, from 5,980 in the third quarter of 2016. There were 65 mergers of insured institutions during the quarter, while no insured banks failed. No new charters were added during the quarter. Banks reported 2,052,504 full-time equivalent employees, an increase of 18,777 from fourth quarter 2015. The number of insured institutions on the FDIC's Problem Bank List\u201d declined from 132 to 123, as total assets of problem banks rose from $24.9 billion to $27.6 billion. For all of 2016, the number of insured institutions reporting declined by 269. Mergers absorbed 251 institutions, and 5 insured institutions failed. This is the smallest number of bank failures in a year since three FDIC-insured institutions failed in 2007. In 2015, there were eight failures.\nCritical Accounting Policies\nThe discussion contained in this Item 7 and other disclosures included within this Annual Report are based on the Company's audited consolidated financial statements which appear in Item 8 of this Annual Report. These statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The financial information contained in these statements is, for the most part, based on the financial effects of transactions and events that have already occurred. However, the preparation of these statements requires management to make certain estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses.\nThe Company's significant accounting policies are described in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\u201d accompanying the Company's audited financial statements. Based on its consideration of accounting policies that involve the most complex and subjective estimates and judgments, management has identified the allowance for loan losses, the assessment of other-than-temporary impairment for investment securities and the assessment of goodwill to be the Company's most critical accounting policies.\nAllowance for Loan Losses\nThe allowance for loan losses is established through a provision for loan losses that is treated as an expense and charged against earnings. Loans are charged against the allowance for loan losses when management believes that collectability of the principal is unlikely. The Company has policies and procedures for evaluating the overall credit quality of its loan portfolio, including timely identification of potential problem loans. On a quarterly basis, management reviews the appropriate level for the allowance for loan losses, incorporating a variety of risk considerations, both quantitative and qualitative. Quantitative factors include the Company's historical loss experience, delinquency and charge-off trends, collateral values, known information about individual loans and other factors. Qualitative factors include various considerations regarding the general economic environment in the Company's market area. To the extent actual results differ from forecasts and management's judgment, the allowance for loan losses may be greater or lesser than future charge-offs. Due to potential changes in conditions, it is at least reasonably possible that changes in estimates will occur in the near term and that such changes could be material to the amounts reported in the Company's financial statements.\nFor further discussion concerning the allowance for loan losses and the process of establishing specific reserves, see the section of this Annual Report entitled Asset Quality Review and Credit Risk Management\u201d and Analysis of the Allowance for Loan Losses\u201d.\nFair Value and Other-Than-Temporary Impairment of Investment Securities\nThe Company's securities available-for-sale portfolio is carried at fair value with fair value\u201d being defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants. A fair value measurement assumes that the transaction to sell the asset or transfer the liability occurs in the principal market for the asset or liability or, in the absence of a principal market, the most advantageous market for the asset or liability. The price in the principal (or most advantageous) market used to measure the fair value of the asset or liability is not adjusted for transaction costs. An orderly transaction is a transaction that assumes exposure to the market for a period prior to the measurement date to allow for marketing activities that are usual and customary for transactions involving such assets and liabilities; it is not a forced transaction. Market participants are buyers and sellers in the principal market that are (i) independent, (ii) knowledgeable, (iii) able to transact, and (iv) willing to transact.\nDeclines in the fair value of available-for-sale securities below their cost that are deemed to be other-than-temporary are reflected in earnings as realized losses. In estimating other-than-temporary impairment losses, management considers (1) the intent to sell the investment securities and the more likely than not requirement that the Company will be required to sell the investment securities prior to recovery (2) the length of time and the extent to which the fair value has been less than cost and (3) the financial condition and near-term prospects of the issuer. Due to potential changes in conditions, it is at least reasonably possible that changes in management's assessment of other-than-temporary impairment will occur in the near term and that such changes could be material to the amounts reported in the Company's financial statements.\nGoodwill\nGoodwill arose in connection with the First Bank Acquisition on August 29, 2014 and the Liberty Acquisition on April 27, 2012. Goodwill is tested annually for impairment or more often if conditions indicate a possible impairment. For the purposes of goodwill impairment testing, determination of the fair value of a reporting unit involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions. Impairment would arise if the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value. At December 31, 2016, Company's management has completed the goodwill impairment analysis and determined goodwill was not impaired. Actual future test results may differ from the present evaluation of impairment due to changes in the conditions used in the current evaluation.\nIncome Statement Review\nThe following highlights a comparative discussion of the major components of net income and their impact for the last three years.\nAverage Balances and Interest Rates\nThe following two tables are used to calculate the Company's net interest margin. The first table includes the Company's average assets and the related income to determine the average yield on earning assets. The second table includes the average liabilities and related expense to determine the average rate paid on interest bearing liabilities. The net interest margin is equal to the interest income less the interest expense divided by average earning assets. Refer to the net interest income discussion following the tables for additional detail.\nASSETS\nTable 59: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td>

to yield/rate in proportion to the absolute value of the change in each. \nNet Interest Income\nThe Company's largest contributing component to net income is net interest income, which is the difference between interest earned on earning assets and interest paid on interest bearing liabilities. The volume of and yields earned on earning assets and the volume of and the rates paid on interest bearing liabilities determine net interest income. Refer to the tables preceding this paragraph for additional detail. Interest earned and interest paid is also affected by general economic conditions, particularly changes in market interest rates, by government policies and the action of regulatory authorities. Net interest income divided by average earning assets is referred to as net interest margin. For the years December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, the Company's net interest margin was 3.36%, 3.33% and 3.31%, respectively.\nNet interest income during 2016, 2015 and 2014 totaled $39,911,000, $38,965,000 and $36,417,000, respectively, representing a 2.4% increase in 2016 compared to 2015 and a 7.0% increase in 2015 from 2014. Net interest income increased in 2016 as compared to 2015 due primarily to increases in the average balance of real estate loans. Net interest income increased in 2015 as compared to 2014 due primarily to increases in the average balance of real estate loans.\nThe high level of competition in the local markets will continue to put downward pressure on the net interest margin of the Company. Currently, the Company's primary market in Ames, Iowa, has ten banks, six credit unions and several other financial investment companies. Multiple banks are also located in the Company's other market areas in central and north central Iowa creating similarly competitive environments.\nProvision for Loan Losses\nThe provision for loan losses reflects management's judgment of the expense to be recognized in order to maintain an adequate allowance for loan losses. The Company's provision for loan losses for the year ended December 31, 2016 was $524,000 compared to $1,099,000 for the previous year. The provision for loan losses in 2016 and 2015 were necessary to maintain an adequate allowance for loan loss on the outstanding loan portfolio, as net charge offs were not significant. The increase in the allowance for loan losses in 2016 was provided due to growth in the Company's loan portfolios and, to a lesser extent to provide for a specific reserve on impaired loans. The Company's provision for loan losses for the year ended December 31, 2015 was $1,099,000 compared to $429,000 for the previous year. The higher provision for loan losses in 2015 as compared to 2014 was due primarily to increases in the general allowance resulting from increased outstanding loans in the construction and commercial operating portfolios. Credit quality indicators such as classified assets and impaired loans have improved since 2014; while past due loans have risen slightly but remain at a favorable level as compared to peer banks. There was no significant change in the allowance for loan loss on impaired loans. Refer to the Asset Quality and Credit Risk Management\u201d discussion for additional details with regard to loan loss provision expense.\nManagement believes the allowance for loan losses is adequate to absorb probable losses in the current portfolio. This statement is based upon management's continuing evaluation of inherent risks in the current loan portfolio, current levels of classified assets and general economic factors. The Company will continue to monitor the allowance and make future adjustments to the allowance as conditions dictate. Due to potential changes in conditions, it is at least reasonably possible that change in estimates will occur in the near term and that such changes could be material to the amounts reported in the Company's financial statements.\nNoninterest Income and Expense\nTotal noninterest income is comprised primarily of fee-based revenues from wealth management and trust services, bank-related service charges on deposit activities, net securities gains, merchant and card fees related to electronic processing of merchant and cash transactions and gain on the sale of loans held for sale.\nNoninterest income during the years ended 2016, 2015 and 2014 totaled $8,088,000, $8,267,000 and $9,252,000, respectively. The lower noninterest income in 2016 as compared to 2015 related primarily to the lower security gains, offset in part by an increase in wealth management income. The increase in wealth management income is primarily due to increases in assets under management. The lower noninterest income in 2015 as compared to 2014 related primarily to the gain on the disposal of premises and equipment in 2014 and lower recognized securities gains, offset in part by higher gains on the sale of loans held for sale and merchant and card fees. The gain on the disposal of premises and equipment was due primarily to the sale of First National's University office in 2014 which resulted in a $1,257,000 gain. The increase in gain on sale of loans held for sale is due primarily to higher loan origination volume due to favorable economic conditions during 2015. The increase in merchant and card fees is due primarily to the First Bank Acquisition. Excluding securities gains, noninterest income increased 3.5% in 2016 as compared to 2015. Excluding securities gains and gain on disposal of premises and equipment in 2015 and 2014, noninterest income increased 7.0% in 2015 as compared to 2014.\nNoninterest expense for the Company consists of all operating expenses other than interest expense on deposits and other borrowed funds. Salaries and employee benefits are the largest component of the Company's operating expenses and comprise 63%, 60% and 58% of noninterest expense in 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively.\nNoninterest expense during the years ended 2016, 2015 and 2014 totaled $24,935,000, $25,312,000 and $24,373,000, respectively, representing a 1.5% decrease in 2016 compared to a 3.9% increase in 2015. The primary reason for the decrease in 2016 was lower other real estate owned expenses and FDIC insurance assessments, offset in part by increases in salaries and employee benefits and data processing costs. Other real estate owned expense declined primarily due to impairment losses in 2016 of $28,000 as compared to losses of $615,000 in 2015. To a lesser extent other real estate owned expense decreased due to gains on the sale of other real estate owned of $219,000 in 2016 as compared to gains of $100,000 in 2015. FDIC insurance assessment decreased primarily due to lower assessment rates in 2016 as compared to 2015. Salaries and employee benefits increased primarily due to normal salary increases and to a lesser extent normal increases in benefit costs. Data processing costs increased in 2016 primarily due to normal increases in our existing data processing contracts. The primary reason for the increase in noninterest expense in 2015 was higher salaries and employee benefit costs benefits and data processing costs, offset in part by a decrease in the other real estate owned expense. Salaries and employee benefits increased due primarily to additional payroll costs associated with the First Bank Acquisition and normal salary increases. Data processing costs increased due primarily to the First Bank Acquisition, equipping the West Ames Office and expenses related to the implementation of video banking services. Other real estate owned expenses decreased due to lower levels of impairment write-down in 2015 as compared to 2014. The percentage of noninterest expense to average assets was 1.87% in 2016, compared to 1.91% and 1.93% during 2015 and 2014, respectively.\nProvision for Income Taxes\nThe provision for income taxes for 2016, 2015 and 2014 was $6,805,000, $5,807,000 and $5,616,000, respectively. This amount represents an effective tax rate of 30%, 28% and 27% for 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. The Company's marginal federal income tax rate is currently 35%. The difference between the Company's effective and marginal tax rate is primarily related to investments made in tax exempt securities. The increase in the effective tax rate for 2016 is due primarily to an increase in income before income taxes; tax-exempt interest income decreasing as a percent of income before income taxes; and the recording of a $226,000 valuation allowance to fully reserve the deferred income tax asset associated with a state alternative minimum tax credit carryforward in 2016. The increase in the effective tax rate for 2015 is due primarily to tax-exempt interest income decreasing as a percent of income before income taxes.\nBalance Sheet Review\nThe Company's assets are comprised primarily of loans and investment securities. Average earning asset maturity or repricing dates are generally five years or less for the combined portfolios as the assets are funded for the most part by short term deposits with either immediate availability or less than one year average maturities. This exposes the Company to risk with regard to changes in interest rates that are more fully explained in", "item_7_text": "ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nOverview\nThe following discussion is provided for the consolidated operations of the Company and its Banks. The purpose of this discussion is to focus on significant factors affecting the Company's financial condition and results of operations.\nThe Company does not engage in any material business activities apart from its ownership of the Banks and the managing of its own loan portfolios. Products and services offered by the Banks are for commercial and consumer purposes, including loans, deposits and wealth management services. Some Banks also offer investment services through a third-party broker-dealer. The Company employs 14 individuals to assist with financial reporting, human resources, marketing, audit, compliance, technology systems, training and the coordination of management activities, in addition to 202 full-time equivalent individuals employed by the Banks.\nThe Company's primary competitive strategy is to utilize seasoned and competent Bank management and local decision-making authority to provide customers with prompt response times and flexibility in the products and services offered. This strategy is viewed as providing an opportunity to increase revenues through the creation of a competitive advantage over other financial institutions. The Company also strives to remain operationally efficient to improve profitability while enabling the Banks to offer more competitive loan and deposit rates.\nThe principal sources of Company revenues and cash flows are: (i) interest and fees earned on loans made or held by the Company and Banks; (ii) interest on investments, primarily on bonds, held by the Banks; (iii) fees on wealth management services; (iv) service charges on deposit accounts maintained at the Banks; (v) merchant and card fees; (vi) gain on the sale of loans held for sale; and (vii) securities gains. The Company's principal expenses are: (i) interest expense on deposit accounts and other borrowings; (ii) salaries and employee benefits; (iii) data processing costs primarily associated with maintaining the Banks' loan and deposit functions; (iv) occupancy expenses for maintaining the Banks' facilities; (v) professional fees; (vi) business development; and (vii) other real estate owned expenses. The largest component contributing to the Company's net income is net interest income, which is the difference between interest earned on earning assets (primarily loans and investments) and interest paid on interest bearing liabilities (primarily deposit accounts and other borrowings). One of management's principal functions is to manage the spread between interest earned on earning assets and interest paid on interest bearing liabilities in an effort to maximize net interest income while maintaining an appropriate level of interest rate risk.\nThe Company reported net income of $15,735,000 for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to $15,015,000 and $15,251,000 reported for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. This represents an increase in net income of 4.8% when comparing 2016 with 2015 and a decrease in net income of 1.5% when comparing 2015 with 2014. The increase in net income in 2016 from 2015 was primarily the result of increased loan interest income, lower provision for loan losses and lower other real estate owned expenses, offset in part by decreased security interest income, decreased securities gains and increased salaries and benefits expense. The decrease in net income in 2015 from 2014 was primarily the result of a one-time gain of the disposal of premises and equipment in 2014 and an increase in salaries and benefits and provision for loan losses, offset in part by an increase in net interest income and a decrease in other real estate expenses. The gain on the disposal of premises and equipment in 2014 was primarily due to the sale of First National's University office. The First Bank Acquisition, described in Item 1 of this Annual Report, contributed to increases in net interest income, noninterest income and noninterest expense in 2015. Earnings per share for 2016 were $1.69 compared to $1.61 in 2015 and $1.64 in 2014. All five Banks demonstrated profitable operations during 2016.\nThe Company's return on average equity for 2016 was 9.38% compared to 9.44% and 10.09% in 2015 and 2014, respectively, and the return on average assets for 2016 was 1.18% compared to 1.13% in 2015 and 1.21% in 2014. The decrease in return on average equity when comparing 2016 to 2015 was primarily a result of increased average equity, more than offsetting the increase in net income. The increase in return on average assets when comparing 2016 to 2015 was primarily a result of increased net income. The decrease in return on average equity and assets when comparing 2015 to 2014 was primarily a result of increased average equity and average assets, without a corresponding increase in net income.\nThe following discussion will provide a summary review of important items relating to:\n \u25cf Challenges \n \u25cf Key Performance Indicators \n \u25cf Industry Results \n \u25cf Critical Accounting Policies \n \u25cf Income Statement Review \n \u25cf Balance Sheet Review \n \u25cf Asset Quality Review and Credit Risk Management \n \u25cf Liquidity and Capital Resources \n \u25cf Interest Rate Risk \n \u25cf Inflation \n \u25cf Forward-Looking Statements and Business Risks \nChallenges\nManagement has identified certain events or circumstances that have the potential to negatively impact the Company's financial condition and results of operations in the future and is attempting to position the Company to best respond to those challenges.\n \u25cf If interest rates increase significantly over a relatively short period of time due to improving national employment levels or higher inflationary numbers, the interest rate environment may present a challenge to the Company. Increases in interest rates may negatively impact the Company's net interest margin if interest expense increases more quickly than interest income, thus placing downward pressure on net interest income. The Company's earning assets (primarily its loan and investment portfolio) have longer maturities than its interest bearing liabilities (primarily deposits and other borrowings); therefore, in a rising interest rate environment, interest expense will tend to increase more quickly than interest income as the interest bearing liabilities reprice more quickly than earning assets. In response to this challenge, the Banks model quarterly the changes in income that would result from various changes in interest rates. Management believes Bank earning assets have the appropriate maturity and repricing characteristics to optimize earnings and the Banks' interest rate risk positions. \n \u25cf If market interest rates in the three to five year term remain at low levels as compared to the short term interest rates, the interest rate environment may present a challenge to the Company. The Company's earning assets (typically priced at market interest rates in the three to five year range) will reprice at lower interest rates, but the deposits will not reprice at significantly lower interest rates, therefore the net interest income may decrease. Management believes Bank earning assets have the appropriate maturity and repricing characteristics to optimize earnings and the Banks' interest rate risk positions. \n \u25cf The agricultural community is subject to commodity price fluctuations. Extended periods of low commodity prices, higher input costs or poor weather conditions could result in reduced profit margins, reducing demand for goods and services provided by agriculture-related businesses, which, in turn, could affect other businesses in the Company's market area. Any combination of these factors could produce losses within the Company's agricultural loan portfolios. \nKey Performance Indicators\nCertain key performance indicators for the Company and the industry are presented in the following chart. The industry figures are compiled by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) and are derived from 5,913 commercial banks and savings institutions insured by the FDIC. Management reviews these indicators on a quarterly basis for purposes of comparing the Company's performance from quarter to quarter against the industry as a whole.\nSelected Indicators for the Company and the Industry\n\nKey performance indicators include:\n \u25cf Return on Assets \nThis ratio is calculated by dividing net income by average assets. It is used to measure how effectively the assets of the Company are being utilized in generating income. The Company's return on assets ratio is higher than that of the industry, primarily as a result of the Company's net interest margin and noninterest expense relative to the industry.\n \u25cf Return on Equity \nThis ratio is calculated by dividing net income by average equity. It is used to measure the net income or return the Company generated for the shareholders' equity investment in the Company. The Company's return on equity ratio is higher than the industry primarily as a result of the Company's net interest margin and noninterest expense relative to the industry, offset in part by a higher capital ratio.\n \u25cf Net Interest Margin \nThis ratio is calculated by dividing net interest income by average earning assets. Earning assets consist primarily of loans and investments that earn interest. This ratio is used to measure how well the Company is able to maintain interest rates on earning assets above those of interest-bearing liabilities, which is the interest expense paid on deposit accounts and other borrowings. The Company's net interest margin is slightly higher than the industry, due primarily to a higher yields on earning assets at the Company as compared to the industry.\n \u25cf Efficiency Ratio \nThis ratio is calculated by dividing noninterest expense by net interest income and noninterest income. The ratio is a measure of the Company's ability to manage noninterest expenses. The Company's efficiency ratio is lower than the industry average, primarily as a result of the Company's lower noninterest expense.\n \u25cf Capital Ratio \nThe capital ratio is calculated by dividing average total equity capital by average total assets. It measures the level of average assets that are funded by shareholders' equity. Given an equal level of risk in the financial condition of two companies, the higher the capital ratio, generally the more financially sound the company. The Company's capital ratio is significantly higher than the industry average.\nIndustry Results\nThe FDIC Quarterly Banking Profile reported the following results for the fourth quarter of 2016\nIncome Is $43.7 Billion in Fourth Quarter\nInsured institutions reported net income of $43.7 billion for the quarter, an increase of $3.1 billion (7.7%) compared with the year before. Almost 60% of all banks reported year-over-year increases in quarterly earnings. Only 8.1% of banks were unprofitable for the quarter, down from 9.6% the previous year. The average return on assets (ROA) rose slightly to 1.04%, from 1.02% in fourth quarter 2015.\nFull-Year 2016 Earnings Rise to $171.3 Billion\nThe industry reported $171.3 billion in net income for full-year 2016, $7.9 billion (4.9%) more than the industry earned in 2015. Almost two out of every three banks-65.2%-reported higher earnings in 2016 than in 2015. Only 4.2% of all banks had negative full-year net income. This is the lowest percentage of unprofitable banks for any year since 1995. Net operating revenue was $29 billion (4.2%) higher than in 2015, as net interest income increased by $29.8 billion (6.9%) and total noninterest income declined by $779 million (0.3%). The average net interest margin (NIM) rose to 3.13% from 3.07% in 2015. Total noninterest expenses were only $5.1 billion (1.2%) higher than a year earlier, as itemized litigation charges at a few large banks were $2.95 billion lower than in 2015. Loan-loss provisions totaled $47.8 billion, an increase of $10.7 billion (28.8%) from 2015. The average return on assets for 2016 was 1.04%, unchanged from the full-year average for 2015.\nNet Interest Income Growth Lifts Operating Revenues\nNet operating revenue totaled $181.8 billion in the fourth quarter, up $7.9 billion (4.6%) from the year before. Net interest income was $8.4 billion (7.6%) higher, while noninterest income declined by $480 million (0.8%). The increase in net interest income was attributable to growth in interest-bearing assets (up 5.2% over the past 12 months) and improvement in the industry's aggregate NIM, which rose to 3.16%, from 3.12% in fourth quarter 2015. The NIM improvement was not broad-based. A majority of banks-54.3%-reported lower NIMs than the year earlier. The decline in noninterest income was driven by a $950 million drop in income from changes in fair values of financial instruments and a $432 million decline in interchange fees. Both trading income and servicing income rose $1.7 billion (39.8% and 51.4%, respectively) from fourth quarter 2015.\nNoninterest Expenses Up 2.6% From a Year Before\nTotal noninterest expenses were $2.7 billion (2.6%) higher than the year before. Salary and employee benefit expenses rose $1.7 billion (3.4%), while goodwill impairment charges were $675 million higher. Expenses for premises and fixed assets were only $9 million (0.1%) higher than the year earlier.\nQuarterly Loss Provisions Decline From a Year Ago\nLoan-loss provisions totaled $12.2 billion in the fourth quarter, $3 million less than banks set aside a year earlier. This marks the first time since second quarter 2014 that quarterly provision expenses have not posted a year-over-year increase. For the industry, fourth-quarter provisions represented 6.7% of the quarter's net operating revenue, down from 7% in fourth quarter 2015.\nQuarterly Charge-Offs Rise for a Fifth Consecutive Quarter\nNet loan losses totaled $12.2 billion, up $1.5 billion (13.5%) from a year earlier. This is the fifth quarter in a row that net charge-offs have posted a year-over-year increase. Credit card charge-offs were $1.4 billion (24.8%) higher, while net charge-offs of loans to commercial and industrial (C&I) borrowers rose $666 million (37.9%). Charge-offs of residential mortgage loans were $576 million (75.1%) lower than in fourth quarter 2015. The average net charge-off rate rose to 0.53%, from 0.49% the year before. This is well below the high of 3.00% recorded in fourth quarter 2009.\nNoncurrent Loan Rate at Lowest Level Since 2007\nNoncurrent loans and leases-those 90 days or more past-due or in nonaccrual status-declined for the 26th time in the last 27 quarters, falling by $2.4 billion (1.8%) during the three months ended December 31. During the quarter, noncurrent C&I loans declined for the first time in eight quarters, falling by $1.4 billion (5.3%). Noncurrent residential mortgage loan balances fell by $2 billion (3%), while noncurrent home equity loans declined by $170 million (1.6%), and noncurrent nonfarm nonresidential real estate loans fell by $192 million (2%). These improvements exceeded the $1.1 billion (12.7%) increase in noncurrent credit card balances. The average noncurrent loan rate fell from 1.45% to 1.41%, the lowest level since year-end 2007.\nLoan-Loss Reserves Decline for the First Time in Five Quarters\nBanks reduced their reserves for loan and lease losses during the fourth quarter, as slightly lower loan-loss provisions were offset by higher net charge-offs. Loss reserves fell by $649 million (0.5%). At banks that itemize their reserves, which represent more than 90% of total industry reserves, the decline was driven by reductions in reserves for residential real estate loan losses, which fell by $1.2 billion (6.5%), and in reserves for commercial loan losses, which declined by $639 million (1.8%). Itemized reserves for losses on credit cards increased by $677 million (2.3%). Despite the small reduction in industry reserves, the larger decline in noncurrent loan balances caused the coverage ratio of reserves to noncurrent loans to rise from 91.1% to 92.3% in the quarter, the highest level since third quarter 2007.\nEquity Capital Posts a Quarterly Decline as the Market Value of Available-For-Sale Securities Falls\nTotal equity capital declined by $16.8 billion (0.9%) in fourth quarter 2016, as higher interest rates caused the market values of available-for-sale securities at banks to fall. Accumulated other comprehensive income declined by $39.5 billion in the quarter, mostly as a result of the drop in securities values. Retained earnings contributed $15.1 billion to equity growth, $1.8 billion (13.5%) more than a year earlier. Banks declared $28.6 billion in dividends, a $1.3 billion (4.8%) increase over fourth quarter 2015. The average equity-to-assets ratio for the industry declined from 11.22% to 11.11%. At the end of the quarter, 99.7% of all banks, representing 99.9% of industry assets, met or exceeded the requirements for the highest regulatory capital category as defined for Prompt Corrective Action purposes.\nLoan Balances Increase $72.3 Billion in the Fourth Quarter\nTotal assets rose by $13.7 billion (0.1%) during the fourth quarter. Total loan and lease balances increased by $72.3 billion (0.8%). Growth in loan balances was led by credit cards (up $38.2 billion, 5%), loans secured by nonfarm nonresidential real estate properties (up $22.8 billion, 1.7%), and real estate construction and development loans (up $10.1 billion, 3.3%). C&I loan balances fell for the first time in 26 quarters, declining $7.7 billion (0.4%). Investment securities portfolios rose by $52 billion (1.5%) during the quarter despite a $52.4 billion decline in the market values of securities available for sale. Assets in trading accounts declined by $27.3 billion (4.6%). Banks reduced their balances at Federal Reserve banks by $116.4 billion (9.6%).\nTotal Loan Balances Rise 5.3% During 2016\nFor full-year 2016, total assets increased $812.6 billion (5.1%). Total loans and leases increased by $466 billion (5.3%), as C&I loans rose by $94.2 billion (5.1%), loans secured by nonfarm nonresidential real estate were up by $92.6 billion (7.5%), and residential mortgages increased by $91.1 billion (4.8%). All major loan categories grew in 2016. Banks increased their investment securities by $205.9 billion (6.1%) in 2016, with mortgage-backed securities up $133.3 billion (7.1%) and U.S. Treasury securities up $97 billion (23%).\nDeposits Rise by $96 Billion\nDomestic deposit growth was relatively strong in the fourth quarter. Total deposits rose by $95.9 billion (0.7%), as deposits in domestic offices increased by $186.5 billion (1.6%), while foreign office deposits declined by $90.6 billion (6.8%). Balances in domestic interest-bearing accounts rose by $178.7 billion (2.1%), and balances in noninterest-bearing accounts grew by $7.7 billion (0.2%). Balances in consumer-oriented accounts increased by $120.5 billion (3%), while all other domestic office deposits rose by $62 billion (1%). Banks reduced their nondeposit liabilities by $65.4 billion (3.1%), as securities sold under repurchase agreements declined by $25.1 billion (10.9%), and trading account liabilities fell by $13 billion (5.1%).\nProblem Bank List\u201d Continues to Improve\nThe number of FDIC-insured commercial banks and savings institutions reporting quarterly financial results fell to 5,913 in the fourth quarter, from 5,980 in the third quarter of 2016. There were 65 mergers of insured institutions during the quarter, while no insured banks failed. No new charters were added during the quarter. Banks reported 2,052,504 full-time equivalent employees, an increase of 18,777 from fourth quarter 2015. The number of insured institutions on the FDIC's Problem Bank List\u201d declined from 132 to 123, as total assets of problem banks rose from $24.9 billion to $27.6 billion. For all of 2016, the number of insured institutions reporting declined by 269. Mergers absorbed 251 institutions, and 5 insured institutions failed. This is the smallest number of bank failures in a year since three FDIC-insured institutions failed in 2007. In 2015, there were eight failures.\nCritical Accounting Policies\nThe discussion contained in this Item 7 and other disclosures included within this Annual Report are based on the Company's audited consolidated financial statements which appear in Item 8 of this Annual Report. These statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The financial information contained in these statements is, for the most part, based on the financial effects of transactions and events that have already occurred. However, the preparation of these statements requires management to make certain estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses.\nThe Company's significant accounting policies are described in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\u201d accompanying the Company's audited financial statements. Based on its consideration of accounting policies that involve the most complex and subjective estimates and judgments, management has identified the allowance for loan losses, the assessment of other-than-temporary impairment for investment securities and the assessment of goodwill to be the Company's most critical accounting policies.\nAllowance for Loan Losses\nThe allowance for loan losses is established through a provision for loan losses that is treated as an expense and charged against earnings. Loans are charged against the allowance for loan losses when management believes that collectability of the principal is unlikely. The Company has policies and procedures for evaluating the overall credit quality of its loan portfolio, including timely identification of potential problem loans. On a quarterly basis, management reviews the appropriate level for the allowance for loan losses, incorporating a variety of risk considerations, both quantitative and qualitative. Quantitative factors include the Company's historical loss experience, delinquency and charge-off trends, collateral values, known information about individual loans and other factors. Qualitative factors include various considerations regarding the general economic environment in the Company's market area. To the extent actual results differ from forecasts and management's judgment, the allowance for loan losses may be greater or lesser than future charge-offs. Due to potential changes in conditions, it is at least reasonably possible that changes in estimates will occur in the near term and that such changes could be material to the amounts reported in the Company's financial statements.\nFor further discussion concerning the allowance for loan losses and the process of establishing specific reserves, see the section of this Annual Report entitled Asset Quality Review and Credit Risk Management\u201d and Analysis of the Allowance for Loan Losses\u201d.\nFair Value and Other-Than-Temporary Impairment of Investment Securities\nThe Company's securities available-for-sale portfolio is carried at fair value with fair value\u201d being defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants. A fair value measurement assumes that the transaction to sell the asset or transfer the liability occurs in the principal market for the asset or liability or, in the absence of a principal market, the most advantageous market for the asset or liability. The price in the principal (or most advantageous) market used to measure the fair value of the asset or liability is not adjusted for transaction costs. An orderly transaction is a transaction that assumes exposure to the market for a period prior to the measurement date to allow for marketing activities that are usual and customary for transactions involving such assets and liabilities; it is not a forced transaction. Market participants are buyers and sellers in the principal market that are (i) independent, (ii) knowledgeable, (iii) able to transact, and (iv) willing to transact.\nDeclines in the fair value of available-for-sale securities below their cost that are deemed to be other-than-temporary are reflected in earnings as realized losses. In estimating other-than-temporary impairment losses, management considers (1) the intent to sell the investment securities and the more likely than not requirement that the Company will be required to sell the investment securities prior to recovery (2) the length of time and the extent to which the fair value has been less than cost and (3) the financial condition and near-term prospects of the issuer. Due to potential changes in conditions, it is at least reasonably possible that changes in management's assessment of other-than-temporary impairment will occur in the near term and that such changes could be material to the amounts reported in the Company's financial statements.\nGoodwill\nGoodwill arose in connection with the First Bank Acquisition on August 29, 2014 and the Liberty Acquisition on April 27, 2012. Goodwill is tested annually for impairment or more often if conditions indicate a possible impairment. For the purposes of goodwill impairment testing, determination of the fair value of a reporting unit involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions. Impairment would arise if the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value. At December 31, 2016, Company's management has completed the goodwill impairment analysis and determined goodwill was not impaired. Actual future test results may differ from the present evaluation of impairment due to changes in the conditions used in the current evaluation.\nIncome Statement Review\nThe following highlights a comparative discussion of the major components of net income and their impact for the last three years.\nAverage Balances and Interest Rates\nThe following two tables are used to calculate the Company's net interest margin. The first table includes the Company's average assets and the related income to determine the average yield on earning assets. The second table includes the average liabilities and related expense to determine the average rate paid on interest bearing liabilities. The net interest margin is equal to the interest income less the interest expense divided by average earning assets. Refer to the net interest income discussion following the tables for additional detail.\nASSETS\n\n (1) Average loan balance includes nonaccrual loans, if any. Interest income collected on nonaccrual loans has been included. \n (2) Tax-exempt income has been adjusted to a tax-equivalent basis using an incremental tax rate of 35%. \nAverage Balances and Interest Rates (continued)\n\nRate and Volume Analysis\nThe rate and volume analysis is used to determine how much of the change in interest income or expense is the result of a change in volume or a change in interest rate. For example, real estate loan interest income increased $1,917,000 in 2016 compared to 2015. Increased volume of real estate loans increased interest income in 2016 by $2,362,000 and lower interest rates decreased interest income in 2016 by $445,000.\nThe following table sets forth, on a tax-equivalent basis, a summary of the changes in net interest income resulting from changes in volume and rates.\n\n (1) The change in interest due to both volume and yield/rate has been allocated to change due to volume and change due to yield/rate in proportion to the absolute value of the change in each. \nNet Interest Income\nThe Company's largest contributing component to net income is net interest income, which is the difference between interest earned on earning assets and interest paid on interest bearing liabilities. The volume of and yields earned on earning assets and the volume of and the rates paid on interest bearing liabilities determine net interest income. Refer to the tables preceding this paragraph for additional detail. Interest earned and interest paid is also affected by general economic conditions, particularly changes in market interest rates, by government policies and the action of regulatory authorities. Net interest income divided by average earning assets is referred to as net interest margin. For the years December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, the Company's net interest margin was 3.36%, 3.33% and 3.31%, respectively.\nNet interest income during 2016, 2015 and 2014 totaled $39,911,000, $38,965,000 and $36,417,000, respectively, representing a 2.4% increase in 2016 compared to 2015 and a 7.0% increase in 2015 from 2014. Net interest income increased in 2016 as compared to 2015 due primarily to increases in the average balance of real estate loans. Net interest income increased in 2015 as compared to 2014 due primarily to increases in the average balance of real estate loans.\nThe high level of competition in the local markets will continue to put downward pressure on the net interest margin of the Company. Currently, the Company's primary market in Ames, Iowa, has ten banks, six credit unions and several other financial investment companies. Multiple banks are also located in the Company's other market areas in central and north central Iowa creating similarly competitive environments.\nProvision for Loan Losses\nThe provision for loan losses reflects management's judgment of the expense to be recognized in order to maintain an adequate allowance for loan losses. The Company's provision for loan losses for the year ended December 31, 2016 was $524,000 compared to $1,099,000 for the previous year. The provision for loan losses in 2016 and 2015 were necessary to maintain an adequate allowance for loan loss on the outstanding loan portfolio, as net charge offs were not significant. The increase in the allowance for loan losses in 2016 was provided due to growth in the Company's loan portfolios and, to a lesser extent to provide for a specific reserve on impaired loans. The Company's provision for loan losses for the year ended December 31, 2015 was $1,099,000 compared to $429,000 for the previous year. The higher provision for loan losses in 2015 as compared to 2014 was due primarily to increases in the general allowance resulting from increased outstanding loans in the construction and commercial operating portfolios. Credit quality indicators such as classified assets and impaired loans have improved since 2014; while past due loans have risen slightly but remain at a favorable level as compared to peer banks. There was no significant change in the allowance for loan loss on impaired loans. Refer to the Asset Quality and Credit Risk Management\u201d discussion for additional details with regard to loan loss provision expense.\nManagement believes the allowance for loan losses is adequate to absorb probable losses in the current portfolio. This statement is based upon management's continuing evaluation of inherent risks in the current loan portfolio, current levels of classified assets and general economic factors. The Company will continue to monitor the allowance and make future adjustments to the allowance as conditions dictate. Due to potential changes in conditions, it is at least reasonably possible that change in estimates will occur in the near term and that such changes could be material to the amounts reported in the Company's financial statements.\nNoninterest Income and Expense\nTotal noninterest income is comprised primarily of fee-based revenues from wealth management and trust services, bank-related service charges on deposit activities, net securities gains, merchant and card fees related to electronic processing of merchant and cash transactions and gain on the sale of loans held for sale.\nNoninterest income during the years ended 2016, 2015 and 2014 totaled $8,088,000, $8,267,000 and $9,252,000, respectively. The lower noninterest income in 2016 as compared to 2015 related primarily to the lower security gains, offset in part by an increase in wealth management income. The increase in wealth management income is primarily due to increases in assets under management. The lower noninterest income in 2015 as compared to 2014 related primarily to the gain on the disposal of premises and equipment in 2014 and lower recognized securities gains, offset in part by higher gains on the sale of loans held for sale and merchant and card fees. The gain on the disposal of premises and equipment was due primarily to the sale of First National's University office in 2014 which resulted in a $1,257,000 gain. The increase in gain on sale of loans held for sale is due primarily to higher loan origination volume due to favorable economic conditions during 2015. The increase in merchant and card fees is due primarily to the First Bank Acquisition. Excluding securities gains, noninterest income increased 3.5% in 2016 as compared to 2015. Excluding securities gains and gain on disposal of premises and equipment in 2015 and 2014, noninterest income increased 7.0% in 2015 as compared to 2014.\nNoninterest expense for the Company consists of all operating expenses other than interest expense on deposits and other borrowed funds. Salaries and employee benefits are the largest component of the Company's operating expenses and comprise 63%, 60% and 58% of noninterest expense in 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively.\nNoninterest expense during the years ended 2016, 2015 and 2014 totaled $24,935,000, $25,312,000 and $24,373,000, respectively, representing a 1.5% decrease in 2016 compared to a 3.9% increase in 2015. The primary reason for the decrease in 2016 was lower other real estate owned expenses and FDIC insurance assessments, offset in part by increases in salaries and employee benefits and data processing costs. Other real estate owned expense declined primarily due to impairment losses in 2016 of $28,000 as compared to losses of $615,000 in 2015. To a lesser extent other real estate owned expense decreased due to gains on the sale of other real estate owned of $219,000 in 2016 as compared to gains of $100,000 in 2015. FDIC insurance assessment decreased primarily due to lower assessment rates in 2016 as compared to 2015. Salaries and employee benefits increased primarily due to normal salary increases and to a lesser extent normal increases in benefit costs. Data processing costs increased in 2016 primarily due to normal increases in our existing data processing contracts. The primary reason for the increase in noninterest expense in 2015 was higher salaries and employee benefit costs benefits and data processing costs, offset in part by a decrease in the other real estate owned expense. Salaries and employee benefits increased due primarily to additional payroll costs associated with the First Bank Acquisition and normal salary increases. Data processing costs increased due primarily to the First Bank Acquisition, equipping the West Ames Office and expenses related to the implementation of video banking services. Other real estate owned expenses decreased due to lower levels of impairment write-down in 2015 as compared to 2014. The percentage of noninterest expense to average assets was 1.87% in 2016, compared to 1.91% and 1.93% during 2015 and 2014, respectively.\nProvision for Income Taxes\nThe provision for income taxes for 2016, 2015 and 2014 was $6,805,000, $5,807,000 and $5,616,000, respectively. This amount represents an effective tax rate of 30%, 28% and 27% for 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. The Company's marginal federal income tax rate is currently 35%. The difference between the Company's effective and marginal tax rate is primarily related to investments made in tax exempt securities. The increase in the effective tax rate for 2016 is due primarily to an increase in income before income taxes; tax-exempt interest income decreasing as a percent of income before income taxes; and the recording of a $226,000 valuation allowance to fully reserve the deferred income tax asset associated with a state alternative minimum tax credit carryforward in 2016. The increase in the effective tax rate for 2015 is due primarily to tax-exempt interest income decreasing as a percent of income before income taxes.\nBalance Sheet Review\nThe Company's assets are comprised primarily of loans and investment securities. Average earning asset maturity or repricing dates are generally five years or less for the combined portfolios as the assets are funded for the most part by short term deposits with either immediate availability or less than one year average maturities. This exposes the Company to risk with regard to changes in interest rates that are more fully explained in", "item_7_tables": "Table 53: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Years Ended December

the MD&A report:\n\n- The report covers the consolidated operations and financial performance of the company and its banks. The company's main sources of revenue are interest income on loans and investments, and fee income from services like wealth management. \n\n- Net income was $15.7 million in 2016, up from $15 million in 2015 but down from $15.3 million in 2014. Return on equity and assets decreased from 2014 to 2015 but increased slightly from 2015 to 2016. \n\n- Key performance indicators like return on assets, return on equity, net interest margin and efficiency ratio are favorable compared to industry averages. The company has a strong capital position.\n\n- Challenges include responding to interest rate changes, low commodity prices impacting agriculture businesses, and competitive local banking markets. \n\n- Net interest income is the largest contributor to net income. It increased in 2016 and 2015 due to loan growth.
