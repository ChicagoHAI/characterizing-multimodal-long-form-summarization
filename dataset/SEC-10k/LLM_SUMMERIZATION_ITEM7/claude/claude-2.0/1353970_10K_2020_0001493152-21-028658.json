MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the section titled Selected Consolidated Financial and Other Data\u201d and the consolidated financial statements and related notes thereto included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. This discussion contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include those identified below and those discussed in the section titled Risk Factors\u201d and other parts of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Our historical results are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for any period in the future.\nGeneral\nChina XD is one of the leading specialty chemical companies engaged in the research, development, manufacture and sale of modified plastics primarily for automotive applications in China, and to a lesser extent, in Dubai, UAE. Through our wholly-owned operating subsidiaries in China and UAE, we develop modified plastics using our proprietary technology, manufacture and sell our products primarily for use in the fabrication of automobile parts and components. We have 688 certifications from manufacturers in the automobile industry as of December 31, 2020. We are the only company certified as a National Enterprise Technology Center in modified plastics industry in Heilongjiang province. Our Research and Development (the R&D\u201d) team consists of 127 professionals and 7 consultants. As a result of the integration of our academic and technological expertise, we have a portfolio of 647 patents, 63 of which we have obtained the patent rights and the remaining 584 of which we have applications pending in China as of December 31, 2020.\nOur products include twelve categories: Modified Polypropylene (PP), Modified Acrylonitrile Butadiene Styrene (ABS), Modified Polyamide 66 (PA66), Modified Polyamide 6 (PA6), Modified Polyoxymethylenes (POM), Modified Polyphenylene Oxide (PPO), Plastic Alloy, Modified Polyphenylene Sulfide (PPS), Modified Polyimide (PI), Modified Polylactic acid (PLA), Poly Ether Ether Ketone (PEEK), and Polyethylene (PE).\nThe Company's products are primarily used in the production of exterior and interior trim and functional components of 29 automobile brands and 111 automobile models manufactured in China, including Audi, Mercedes Benz, BMW, Toyota, Buick, Chevrolet, Mazda, Volvo, Ford, Citroen, Jinbei, VW Passat, Golf, Jetta, etc. Our research center is dedicated to the research and development of modified plastics, and benefits from its cooperation with well-known scientists from prestigious universities in China. We operate three manufacturing plants in Harbin, Heilongjiang in the PRC. Prior to December 2012, we had approximately 255,000 metric tons of annual production capacity across 58 automatic production lines utilizing German twin-screw extruding systems, automatic weighing systems and Taiwan conveyer systems. In December 2012, we further expanded our third production base in Harbin with additional 135,000 metric tons of annual production capacity, bringing total installed production capacity in our three production bases to 390,000 metric tons with additional 30 new production lines. In July 2017, our Harbin campus launched a new industrial project for upgrading existing equipment for 100,000 metric tons of engineering plastics. As a result, our production capacity in Harbin, Heilongjiang was downgraded to 290,000 MT. In 2019, our Harbin campus started two equipment projects in Qinling Road Factory ( Qinling Road Project\u201d) and Jiangnan Road Factory ( Jiangnan Road Project\u201d) for equipment upgrade and overhaul progress, which further downgraded our production capacity to 135,000 MT. The industrial project for upgrading existing equipment for 100,000 metric tons of engineering plastics was expected to be completed by the end of 2020, Qinling Road Project and Jiangnan Road Project was expected to be completed by the end of 2020, thus bringing the production capacity in Harbin Campus back to 390,000 MT. Also, in July 2017, HLJ Xinda Group started an industrial project for 300,000 metric tons of biological composite materials, an industrial project for a 3D printing intelligent manufacture demonstration factory and a 3D printing display and experience cloud factory. This project with four workshops was formally broken ground in December 2019. The Company expects the gradual trial out by the end of 2022 and put into production by the end of 2023.\nTable 236: <table><tr><td>91 </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 237: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nIn December 2013, we broke ground on the construction of our fourth production plant in Nanchong City, Sichuan Province, with additional 300,000 metric tons of annual production capacity, which we expect will bring total domestic installed production capacity to 590,000 metric tons with the addition of 70 new production lines upon the completion of the construction of our fourth production plant. Sichuan Xinda has been supplying to its customers since 2013. We installed 50 production lines in the second half of 2016 in our Sichuan plant with production capacity of 216,000 metric tons during the year of 2017 and an additional 10 production lines in July 2018, bringing the total capacity to 259,200 metric tons. As of December 31, 2020, there is still construction ongoing on the site of our Sichuan plant which is expected to be completed by the end of the third quarter of 2022 .\nIn order to develop potential overseas markets, Dubai Xinda obtained one leased property and two purchased properties, approximately 52,530 square meters in total, including one leased 10,000 square meters, and two purchased 20,206 and 22,324 square meters on January 25, 2015, June 28, 2016 and September 21, 2016, respectively, from Jebel Ali Free Zone Authority ( JAFZA\u201d) in Dubai, UAE, with constructed building comprising warehouses, offices and service blocks. In addition to the earlier 10 trial production lines in Dubai Xinda, the Company completed installing 45 production lines with 11,250 metric tons of annual production capacity by the end of November 2018, and an additional 30 production lines with 7,500 metric tons of annual production capacity. The Company previously estimated 22 production lines to be put into production in the fourth quarter of 2021, and 8 production lines in the second quarter of 2022. Due to the negative impact of COVID-19, this project was suspended and the Company plans to resume the installation process by the first half of 2022 . The new completion timeline is estimated by the end of 2022, thus bringing total installed production capacity in Dubai Xinda to 21,250 metric tons, targeting high-end products for the overseas market.\nDue to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Company's manufacturing facilities in Harbin and Sichuan was temporarily shut down from early February 2020 to early March 2020 while our Dubai facilities was suspended operation from early February 2020 till current in accordance with the requirement of the local governments. The Company's business was negatively impacted and generated lower revenue and net income during the period from February to April 2020. The extent of the impact of COVID-19 on the Company's results of operations and financial condition will depend on the virus' future developments, including the duration and spread of the outbreak and the impact on the Company's customers, which are still uncertain and cannot be reasonably estimated at this point of time.\nCritical Accounting Policies\nWe prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP, which requires us to make judgments, estimates and assumptions that affect (1) the reported amounts of our assets and liabilities; (2) the disclosure of our contingent assets and liabilities at the end of each reporting period; and (3) the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during each reporting period. We continually evaluate these judgments, estimates and assumptions based on our own historical experience, knowledge and assessment of current business and other conditions and our expectations regarding the future based on available information which together form our basis for making judgments about matters that are not readily apparent from other sources. Since the use of estimates is an integral component of the financial reporting process, our actual results could differ from those estimates. Some of our accounting policies require a higher degree of judgment than others in their application.\nTable 238: <table><tr><td>92 </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 239: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nWhen reading our consolidated financial statements, you should consider our selection of critical accounting policies, the judgment and other uncertainties affecting the application of such policies, and the sensitivity of reported results to changes in conditions and assumptions. We believe the following accounting policies involve the most significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements.\nLong-Lived Assets\nOur long-lived assets include property, plant and equipment and land use rights.\nWe depreciate and amortize our property, plant and equipment and land use rights, using the straight-line method of accounting over the estimated useful lives of the assets. We make estimates of the useful lives of property, plant and equipment, including the salvage values, and land use rights in order to determine the amount of depreciation and amortization expense to be recorded during each reporting period. The estimated useful life is the period over which the long-lived assets are expected to contribute directly or indirectly to the future cash flows of the Company.\nWe evaluate long-lived assets, including property, plant and equipment, and land use rights for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable. We assess recoverability by comparing carrying amount of a long-lived asset or asset group to estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset or asset group. If the carrying amount of an asset or asset group exceeds its estimated undiscounted future cash flows, we recognize an impairment charge based on the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the estimated fair value of the asset or asset group. We estimate the fair value of the asset or asset group through various valuation techniques, including discounted cash flow models, quoted market values and third-party independent appraisals, as considered necessary. Assets to be disposed are reported at the lower of carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell, and are no longer depreciated.\nImpairment charges of US$165.3 million was recognized for long-lived assets during the year ended December 31, 2020 (See Note 26 to Consolidated Financial Statements).\nAllowance for Doubtful Accounts\nWe maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments. In establishing the required allowance, we consider historical losses adjusted to take into account current market conditions, the amount of receivables in dispute, and the current receivables aging and current payment patterns. Account balances are charged off against the allowance after all means of collection have been exhausted and the potential for recovery is considered remote. We do not have any off-balance-sheet credit exposure related to our customers.\nTable 240: <table><tr><td>93 </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 241: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe extend unsecured credit to customers with good credit history. We review our accounts receivable on a regular basis to determine if the bad debt allowance is adequate at each year-end.\nValuation of Inventories\nOur inventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value (NRV). We routinely evaluate quantities and value of our inventories in light of current market conditions and market trends, and record a write-down against the cost of inventories for net realizable value below cost. Expected demand and anticipated sales price are the key factors affecting our inventory valuation analysis. For purposes of our inventory valuation analysis, we develop expected demand and anticipated sales prices primarily based on sales orders as well as industry trends and individual customer analysis. We also consider sales and sales orders after each reporting period-end but before the issuance of our financial statements to assess the accuracy of our inventory valuation estimates. Historically, actual demand and sales price have generally been consistent with or greater than expected demand and anticipated sales price used for purposes of our inventory valuation analysis. The evaluation also takes into consideration new product development schedules, the effect that new products might have on the sale of existing products, product obsolescence, customer concentrations, product merchantability and other factors. Market conditions are subject to change and actual consumption of inventories could differ from forecasted demand. Our products have a long life cycle and obsolescence has not historically been a significant factor in the valuation of inventories. We have not experienced any material inventory write-downs before.\nIncome Tax Uncertainties and Realization of Deferred Income Tax Assets\nOur income tax provision, deferred income tax assets and deferred income tax liabilities are recognized and measured primarily based on actual and expected future income, PRC statutory income tax rates, PRC tax regulations and tax planning strategies.\nSignificant judgment is required in interpreting tax regulations in the PRC, evaluating uncertain tax positions, and assessing the realizability of deferred income tax assets. Actual results could differ materially from those judgments, and changes in judgments could materially affect our consolidated financial statements. As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, we had total gross deferred income tax assets of US$33,524,819 and US$14,313,575, respectively. We record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred income tax assets if, based on the weight of available evidence, we believe expected future taxable income is not likely to support the use of a deduction or credit in that jurisdiction. We evaluate the level of our valuation allowances quarterly, and more frequently if actual operating results differ significantly from forecasted results. As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, our valuation allowance against deferred income tax assets was US$33,524,819 and US$14,313,575, respectively.\nWe recognize the impact of a tax position if we determine the position is more likely than not to be sustained upon examination, including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes, based solely on the technical merits of the position. In evaluating whether a tax position has met the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold, it is presumed that the position will be examined by the appropriate tax authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information. In addition, a tax position that meets the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold is measured to determine the amount of benefit to recognize in the financial statements. The tax position is measured at the largest amount of benefit that is greater than fifty percent (50%) likely of being realized upon settlement. The tax positions are regularly re-evaluated based on the results of the examination of income tax filings, statute of limitations expirations and changes in tax law that would either increase or decrease the technical merits of a position relative to the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold. In the normal course of business, we are regularly audited by the PRC tax authorities. The settlement of any particular issue with the applicable tax authority could have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.\nTable 242: <table><tr><td>94 </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 243: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nStock Based Compensation\nWe measure the cost of employee services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments based on the grant date fair value of the award and recognize the cost over the period the employee is required to provide service in exchange for the award, which generally is the vesting period. We have elected to recognize the compensation cost for an award with only service conditions and a graded vesting schedule on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period for the entire award. However, the cumulative amount of compensation cost recognized at any date equals at least the portion of the grant date value of such award that is vested at that date.\nWe estimated the fair value of our share options using the Black-Scholes Option Pricing model. The model incorporates subjective assumptions. The expected volatility was based on implied volatilities from traded options and historical volatility of the Company's common stock. The risk-free interest rate assumption is determined using the Federal Reserve nominal rates for U.S. Treasury zero-coupon bonds with maturities similar to those of the expected term of the award being valued. There is no expected dividend yield, as the Company has not paid dividend and does not anticipate paying dividend over the term of the grants.\nRecent Development\nOn November 5, 2020, the Company held a special meeting of stockholders, at which the Company's stockholders voted, among other things, in favor of the proposal to adopt the previously announced agreement and plan of merger (the Merger Agreement\u201d), dated as of June 15, 2020, by and among the Company, Faith Dawn Limited, an exempted company with limited liability incorporated under the laws of the Cayman Islands ( Parent\u201d), and Faith Horizon Inc., a Nevada corporation and wholly owned subsidiary of Parent ( Merger Sub\u201d), providing for the merger of the Merger Sub with and into the Company, with the Company continuing as the surviving corporation and as a wholly-owned subsidiary of Parent (the Merger\u201d).\nOn December 13, 2020, the Company entered into an amendment No.1 (the Amendment\u201d) to that certain Agreement and Plan of Merger dated June 15, 2020 (as so amended, the Merger Agreement\u201d) by and among the Company, Faith Dawn Limited ( Parent\u201d), and Faith Horizon Inc. ( Merger Sub\u201d), a Nevada corporation and a wholly-owned subsidiary of Parent. The Amendment extends the Termination Date (as defined in the Merger Agreement) to February 7, 2021. The special committee of the board of directors of the Company and the board of directors of the Company both approved the Amendment to permit additional time for the parties to the Merger Agreement to complete the merger. The parties to the Merger Agreement are currently working on the logistics to complete the Merger. Other than as described herein, the Amendment does not amend any other provision of the Merger Agreement.\nOn February 7, 2021, the Company entered into an amendment No.2 (the Second Amendment\u201d) to that certain Agreement and Plan of Merger dated June 15, 2020, as amended on December 13, 2020 (as so amended, the Merger Agreement\u201d) by and among the Company, Faith Dawn Limited ( Parent\u201d), and Faith Horizon Inc. ( Merger Sub\u201d), a Nevada corporation and a wholly-owned subsidiary of Parent. The Second Amendment extends the Termination Date (as defined in the Merger Agreement) to May 10, 2021.The special committee of the board of directors of the Company and the board of directors of the Company both approved the Second Amendment to permit additional time for the parties to the Merger Agreement to complete the merger. The parties to the Merger Agreement are currently working on the logistics to complete the Merger. Other than as described herein, the Second Amendment does not amend any other provision of the Merger Agreement.\nTable 244: <table><tr><td>95 </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 245: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nOn May 8, 2021, the Company issued a notice of termination to Parent (the Notice of Termination\u201d) notifying Parent that the Company terminated the merger agreement pursuant to Section 9.1(c)(i) of the merger agreement, based on Parent and Merger Sub's breaches of the merger agreement, which have given rise to the failure of several conditions set forth in Section 8.1 and Section 8.3 of the merger agreement. These breaches are not capable of being cured prior to the termination date of the merger agreement. Pursuant to the Notice of Termination, as a result of such termination, the Parent Termination Fee becomes due and payable to the Company by Parent. On May 12, 2021, Parent sent a response letter, dated May 11, 2021 (the Response Letter\u201d), to the Company that while it disagrees with the allegations made in the Notice of Termination, Parent acknowledges that the Company may terminate the merger agreement pursuant to Section 9.1(c)(iii) of the merger agreement and thus agrees to pay the Parent Termination Fee pursuant to Section 9.3(b) of the merger agreement under that basis. As a result of the termination of the merger agreement, the merger will not be completed.\nThe following table sets forth statements of comprehensive income (loss) data for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 in millions of US$:\nTable 246: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>For the Years Ended December 31, </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Change </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Amount </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Amount </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(US$ in millions, except the percentage) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Revenues </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,311.9 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>100 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(9.4 </td> <td>)% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,448.2 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>100 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Cost of revenues </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(1,168.2 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(89.0 </td> <td>)% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(4.9 </td> <td>)% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(1,228.8 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(84.9 </td> <td>)% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Gross profit </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>143.7 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>11.0 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(34.5 </td> <td>)% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>219.4 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>15.1 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Impairment of long-lived assets </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(165.3\n</td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(12.6\n</td> <td>)% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>N/A\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Total operating expenses </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(245.8 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(18.7 </td> <td>)% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(63.9 </td> <td>)% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(150.0 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(10.4 </td> <td>)% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Operating income (loss) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(102.0 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(7.8 </td> <td>)% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(247.0 </td> <td>)% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>69.4 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4.8 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Income (loss) before income taxes </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(175.9 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(13.4 </td> <td>)% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(1,128.6 </td> <td>)% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>17.1 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1.2 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Income tax expense </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(5.8 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(0.4 </td> <td>)% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(58.6 </td> <td>)% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(14.0 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(1.0 </td> <td>)% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Net income (loss) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(181.7 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(13.8 </td> <td>)% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(5,961.3 </td> <td>)% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3.1 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.2 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table>\nRevenues\nRevenues decreased by 9.4%, or US$136.3 million, in 2020 as compared to 2019. This was due to a decrease of 7.8% in sales volume, and a decrease of 1.6% in the average RMB selling price of our products, as compared with those of the same period of last year.\n(1) Domestic market\nFor the year ended December 31, 2020, revenue from domestic market decreased by 5.5% or US$75.6 million, as a result of a decrease of 6.4% in sales volume, and partially offset by an increase of 1.0% in the average RMB selling price of our products, as compared with those of the same period of last year.\nTable 247: <table><tr><td>96 </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 248: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nAccording to the China Association of Automobile Manufacturers, automobile production and sales in China decreased by 2.0% and 1.9 %, respectively, for twelve months of 2020 as compared to the same period of 2019. The weakening in macroeconomic conditions since the outbreak of COVID-19 pandemic in January 2020 continued to exacerbate auto business environment throughout year of 2020. The Company's business was negatively impacted and has generated lower revenue during the period from February to April 2020. Thanks to our positive efforts to expand our customer bases and to meet their new requirements, including producing raw materials for PPE such as goggles and masks, to help alleviate the pandemic to our communities and mitigate the negative impact of world pandemic on Chinese auto industry, the Company has begun to recover slowly after May 2020. We achieved sales increase by 75.7% in Southwest China, 35.3% in East China and 7.5% in South China, although our sales decreased by 62.1% in Northeast China, 21.9% in Central China and 15.2% in North China, for the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to the same period of 2019.\nAs for the RMB selling price, the increase of 1.0% was mainly due to increased sales of new categories of higher-end products of PA66 and PA6 produced with high-priced raw materials with higher selling price in domestic markets during the year ended December 31, 2020.\n(2) Overseas market\nOverseas sales were nil for the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to US$61.2 million in prior year.\nThe Dubai facility was temporarily shut down since late February and has not resumed its operation till the current period, which has negatively impacted operations in Dubai facility.\nWe have experienced a delay in cash collection from a major customer in UAE. As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, we provided an allowance of US$64.8million and US$62.8 million, respectively, for the overdue accounts receivable from the major customer in UAE, as the customer failed to make payments under the agreed extended repayment plan.\nThe following table summarizes the breakdown of revenues by categories for the periods indicated.\nTable 249: <table> <tr> <td> </td>

and Sichuan Xinda.\nOur PRC and Dubai subsidiaries had US$183.4 million of cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash as of December 31, 2020, which are planned to be indefinitely reinvested in PRC. The distributions from our PRC subsidiaries are subject to the U.S. federal income tax at 21%, less any applicable foreign tax credits.

equity as of December 31, 2020 decreased by 8.3% as compared to that of December 31, 2019 primarily due to the increase of impairment loss of US$165.3 million for Dubai Xinda, offset by the increase of US$50.0 million noncontrolling interests and the decrease of US$37.9 million accumulated other comprehensive loss. Cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash decreased by 19.7% or US$45.1 million primarily due to the increase of US$45.1 million operating activity cash outflows. The aggregate short-term and long-term bank loans increased by 53.4% due to using the line of credits to support operating and investing activities in HLJ Xinda Group and Sichuan Xinda. We define the manageable debt level as the sum of aggregate short-term and long-term loans over total assets.\nTable 271: <table><tr><td>102 </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 272: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\nHistorically, our primary uses of cash have been to finance working capital needs and capital expenditures for new production lines. We have financed these requirements primarily from cash generated from operations, bank borrowings and the issuance of our convertible preferred stocks and debt financings. As of December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, we had US$183.3 million and US$228.4 million, respectively, in the total amount of cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash, which were primarily deposited with banks in China (including Hong Kong and Macau SAR), UAE and U.S. As of December 31, 2020, we had US$643.6 million outstanding short-term bank loans (including the current portion of long-term bank loans), including US$481.0 million unsecured loan, US$36.5 million guaranteed loan, US$15.3 million loans secured by restricted cash, US$12.3 million loans secured by inventories, and US$98.5 million long-term bank loans that due in one year. We also had US$727.3 million long-term loans (excluding the current portion), including US$585.9 million loans secured by an undated security cheque, and US$239.9 million unsecured loans. Short-term and long-term bank loans in total bear a weighted average interest rate of 5.6% per annum and do not contain any renewal terms. We have historically been able to make repayments when due.\nHowever, as disclosed in Note 3 in the Company's financial statements, for the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company had a significant loss of US$181.7 million primarily due to an impairment of long-lived assets of US$165.3 million for Dubai Xinda and had recurring operating cash outflows of US$3.0 million. These conditions raised substantial doubts about the Company's ability to continue as a going concern.\nA summary of lines of credit and the remaining line of credit as of December 31, 2020 is as below:\nTable 273: <table> <tr> <td>(in millions) </td> <td> </td> <td>December 31, 2020 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Lines of Credit, Obtained </td> <td> </td> <td>Remaining\nAvailable\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Name of Financial Institution </td> <td> </td> <td>Date of Approval </td> <td> </td> <td>RMB </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>USD </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>USD </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>China Construction Bank </td> <td> </td> <td>January 20, 2020 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>714.1 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>109.4 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>89.8 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Longjiang Bank </td> <td> </td> <td>February 28, 2020 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,250.0 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>191.6 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Industrial and Commercial Bank of China </td> <td> </td> <td>May 9, 2020 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,335.0 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>204.6 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Agricultural Bank of China </td> <td> </td> <td>February 24, 2020 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>250.0 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>38.3 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Postal Savings Bank of China </td> <td> </td> <td>April 30, 2020 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>100.0 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>15.3 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Sichuan Tianfu Bank </td> <td> </td> <td>March 12, 2020 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>522.0 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>80.0 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Nanchong Rural Commercial Bank </td> <td> </td> <td>July 17, 2020 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>238.4 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>36.5 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1.8 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Bank of Harbin </td> <td> </td> <td>August 10, 2020 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>70.0 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>10.7 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Harbin Rural Commercial Bank </td> <td> </td> <td>April 30, 2020 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>330.0 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>50.6 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Jianxin Financial Asset Investment Co., Ltd. </td> <td> </td> <td>November 21, 2019 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>390.0 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>59.8 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Subtotal (credit term<=1 year) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5,199.5 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>796.8 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>91.6 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Agricultural Bank of China </td> <td> </td> <td>December 7, 2020 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>400.0 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>61.3 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Longjiang Bank </td> <td> </td> <td>June 17, 2019 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4,172.2 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>639.4 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>National Bank of Umm Al Qaiwain </td> <td> </td> <td>December 26, 2018 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>14.2 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2.2 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Industrial and Commercial Bank of China </td> <td> </td> <td>February 17, 2020 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,029.8 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>157.8 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>15.4 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Nanchong Shuntou Development Group Co., Ltd </td> <td> </td> <td>January 6, 2017 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>350.0 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>53.6 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Subtotal (credit term>1 year) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5,966.2 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>914.3 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>15.4 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Total </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>11,165.7 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,711.1 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>107.0 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nAs of December 31, 2020, we have contractual obligations to pay (i) lease commitments in the amount of US$26.3 million, including US$1.4 million due in one year;

If these sources are insufficient to satisfy our cash requirements, we may seek to sell additional equity or debt securities or obtain a credit facility.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the section titled Selected Consolidated Financial and Other Data\u201d and the consolidated financial statements and related notes thereto included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. This discussion contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include those identified below and those discussed in the section titled Risk Factors\u201d and other parts of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Our historical results are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for any period in the future.\nGeneral\nChina XD is one of the leading specialty chemical companies engaged in the research, development, manufacture and sale of modified plastics primarily for automotive applications in China, and to a lesser extent, in Dubai, UAE. Through our wholly-owned operating subsidiaries in China and UAE, we develop modified plastics using our proprietary technology, manufacture and sell our products primarily for use in the fabrication of automobile parts and components. We have 688 certifications from manufacturers in the automobile industry as of December 31, 2020. We are the only company certified as a National Enterprise Technology Center in modified plastics industry in Heilongjiang province. Our Research and Development (the R&D\u201d) team consists of 127 professionals and 7 consultants. As a result of the integration of our academic and technological expertise, we have a portfolio of 647 patents, 63 of which we have obtained the patent rights and the remaining 584 of which we have applications pending in China as of December 31, 2020.\nOur products include twelve categories: Modified Polypropylene (PP), Modified Acrylonitrile Butadiene Styrene (ABS), Modified Polyamide 66 (PA66), Modified Polyamide 6 (PA6), Modified Polyoxymethylenes (POM), Modified Polyphenylene Oxide (PPO), Plastic Alloy, Modified Polyphenylene Sulfide (PPS), Modified Polyimide (PI), Modified Polylactic acid (PLA), Poly Ether Ether Ketone (PEEK), and Polyethylene (PE).\nThe Company's products are primarily used in the production of exterior and interior trim and functional components of 29 automobile brands and 111 automobile models manufactured in China, including Audi, Mercedes Benz, BMW, Toyota, Buick, Chevrolet, Mazda, Volvo, Ford, Citroen, Jinbei, VW Passat, Golf, Jetta, etc. Our research center is dedicated to the research and development of modified plastics, and benefits from its cooperation with well-known scientists from prestigious universities in China. We operate three manufacturing plants in Harbin, Heilongjiang in the PRC. Prior to December 2012, we had approximately 255,000 metric tons of annual production capacity across 58 automatic production lines utilizing German twin-screw extruding systems, automatic weighing systems and Taiwan conveyer systems. In December 2012, we further expanded our third production base in Harbin with additional 135,000 metric tons of annual production capacity, bringing total installed production capacity in our three production bases to 390,000 metric tons with additional 30 new production lines. In July 2017, our Harbin campus launched a new industrial project for upgrading existing equipment for 100,000 metric tons of engineering plastics. As a result, our production capacity in Harbin, Heilongjiang was downgraded to 290,000 MT. In 2019, our Harbin campus started two equipment projects in Qinling Road Factory ( Qinling Road Project\u201d) and Jiangnan Road Factory ( Jiangnan Road Project\u201d) for equipment upgrade and overhaul progress, which further downgraded our production capacity to 135,000 MT. The industrial project for upgrading existing equipment for 100,000 metric tons of engineering plastics was expected to be completed by the end of 2020, Qinling Road Project and Jiangnan Road Project was expected to be completed by the end of 2020, thus bringing the production capacity in Harbin Campus back to 390,000 MT. Also, in July 2017, HLJ Xinda Group started an industrial project for 300,000 metric tons of biological composite materials, an industrial project for a 3D printing intelligent manufacture demonstration factory and a 3D printing display and experience cloud factory. This project with four workshops was formally broken ground in December 2019. The Company expects the gradual trial out by the end of 2022 and put into production by the end of 2023.\n 91 \n \nIn December 2013, we broke ground on the construction of our fourth production plant in Nanchong City, Sichuan Province, with additional 300,000 metric tons of annual production capacity, which we expect will bring total domestic installed production capacity to 590,000 metric tons with the addition of 70 new production lines upon the completion of the construction of our fourth production plant. Sichuan Xinda has been supplying to its customers since 2013. We installed 50 production lines in the second half of 2016 in our Sichuan plant with production capacity of 216,000 metric tons during the year of 2017 and an additional 10 production lines in July 2018, bringing the total capacity to 259,200 metric tons. As of December 31, 2020, there is still construction ongoing on the site of our Sichuan plant which is expected to be completed by the end of the third quarter of 2022.\nIn order to develop potential overseas markets, Dubai Xinda obtained one leased property and two purchased properties, approximately 52,530 square meters in total, including one leased 10,000 square meters, and two purchased 20,206 and 22,324 square meters on January 25, 2015, June 28, 2016 and September 21, 2016, respectively, from Jebel Ali Free Zone Authority ( JAFZA\u201d) in Dubai, UAE, with constructed building comprising warehouses, offices and service blocks. In addition to the earlier 10 trial production lines in Dubai Xinda, the Company completed installing 45 production lines with 11,250 metric tons of annual production capacity by the end of November 2018, and an additional 30 production lines with 7,500 metric tons of annual production capacity. The Company previously estimated 22 production lines to be put into production in the fourth quarter of 2021, and 8 production lines in the second quarter of 2022. Due to the negative impact of COVID-19, this project was suspended and the Company plans to resume the installation process by the first half of 2022. The new completion timeline is estimated by the end of 2022, thus bringing total installed production capacity in Dubai Xinda to 21,250 metric tons, targeting high-end products for the overseas market.\nDue to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Company's manufacturing facilities in Harbin and Sichuan was temporarily shut down from early February 2020 to early March 2020 while our Dubai facilities was suspended operation from early February 2020 till current in accordance with the requirement of the local governments. The Company's business was negatively impacted and generated lower revenue and net income during the period from February to April 2020. The extent of the impact of COVID-19 on the Company's results of operations and financial condition will depend on the virus' future developments, including the duration and spread of the outbreak and the impact on the Company's customers, which are still uncertain and cannot be reasonably estimated at this point of time.\nCritical Accounting Policies\nWe prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP, which requires us to make judgments, estimates and assumptions that affect (1) the reported amounts of our assets and liabilities; (2) the disclosure of our contingent assets and liabilities at the end of each reporting period; and (3) the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during each reporting period. We continually evaluate these judgments, estimates and assumptions based on our own historical experience, knowledge and assessment of current business and other conditions and our expectations regarding the future based on available information which together form our basis for making judgments about matters that are not readily apparent from other sources. Since the use of estimates is an integral component of the financial reporting process, our actual results could differ from those estimates. Some of our accounting policies require a higher degree of judgment than others in their application.\n 92 \n \nWhen reading our consolidated financial statements, you should consider our selection of critical accounting policies, the judgment and other uncertainties affecting the application of such policies, and the sensitivity of reported results to changes in conditions and assumptions. We believe the following accounting policies involve the most significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements.\nLong-Lived Assets\nOur long-lived assets include property, plant and equipment and land use rights.\nWe depreciate and amortize our property, plant and equipment and land use rights, using the straight-line method of accounting over the estimated useful lives of the assets. We make estimates of the useful lives of property, plant and equipment, including the salvage values, and land use rights in order to determine the amount of depreciation and amortization expense to be recorded during each reporting period. The estimated useful life is the period over which the long-lived assets are expected to contribute directly or indirectly to the future cash flows of the Company.\nWe evaluate long-lived assets, including property, plant and equipment, and land use rights for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable. We assess recoverability by comparing carrying amount of a long-lived asset or asset group to estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset or asset group. If the carrying amount of an asset or asset group exceeds its estimated undiscounted future cash flows, we recognize an impairment charge based on the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the estimated fair value of the asset or asset group. We estimate the fair value of the asset or asset group through various valuation techniques, including discounted cash flow models, quoted market values and third-party independent appraisals, as considered necessary. Assets to be disposed are reported at the lower of carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell, and are no longer depreciated.\nImpairment charges of US$165.3 million was recognized for long-lived assets during the year ended December 31, 2020 (See Note 26 to Consolidated Financial Statements).\nAllowance for Doubtful Accounts\nWe maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments. In establishing the required allowance, we consider historical losses adjusted to take into account current market conditions, the amount of receivables in dispute, and the current receivables aging and current payment patterns. Account balances are charged off against the allowance after all means of collection have been exhausted and the potential for recovery is considered remote. We do not have any off-balance-sheet credit exposure related to our customers.\n 93 \n \nWe extend unsecured credit to customers with good credit history. We review our accounts receivable on a regular basis to determine if the bad debt allowance is adequate at each year-end.\nValuation of Inventories\nOur inventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value (NRV). We routinely evaluate quantities and value of our inventories in light of current market conditions and market trends, and record a write-down against the cost of inventories for net realizable value below cost. Expected demand and anticipated sales price are the key factors affecting our inventory valuation analysis. For purposes of our inventory valuation analysis, we develop expected demand and anticipated sales prices primarily based on sales orders as well as industry trends and individual customer analysis. We also consider sales and sales orders after each reporting period-end but before the issuance of our financial statements to assess the accuracy of our inventory valuation estimates. Historically, actual demand and sales price have generally been consistent with or greater than expected demand and anticipated sales price used for purposes of our inventory valuation analysis. The evaluation also takes into consideration new product development schedules, the effect that new products might have on the sale of existing products, product obsolescence, customer concentrations, product merchantability and other factors. Market conditions are subject to change and actual consumption of inventories could differ from forecasted demand. Our products have a long life cycle and obsolescence has not historically been a significant factor in the valuation of inventories. We have not experienced any material inventory write-downs before.\nIncome Tax Uncertainties and Realization of Deferred Income Tax Assets\nOur income tax provision, deferred income tax assets and deferred income tax liabilities are recognized and measured primarily based on actual and expected future income, PRC statutory income tax rates, PRC tax regulations and tax planning strategies.\nSignificant judgment is required in interpreting tax regulations in the PRC, evaluating uncertain tax positions, and assessing the realizability of deferred income tax assets. Actual results could differ materially from those judgments, and changes in judgments could materially affect our consolidated financial statements. As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, we had total gross deferred income tax assets of US$33,524,819 and US$14,313,575, respectively. We record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred income tax assets if, based on the weight of available evidence, we believe expected future taxable income is not likely to support the use of a deduction or credit in that jurisdiction. We evaluate the level of our valuation allowances quarterly, and more frequently if actual operating results differ significantly from forecasted results. As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, our valuation allowance against deferred income tax assets was US$33,524,819 and US$14,313,575, respectively.\nWe recognize the impact of a tax position if we determine the position is more likely than not to be sustained upon examination, including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes, based solely on the technical merits of the position. In evaluating whether a tax position has met the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold, it is presumed that the position will be examined by the appropriate tax authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information. In addition, a tax position that meets the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold is measured to determine the amount of benefit to recognize in the financial statements. The tax position is measured at the largest amount of benefit that is greater than fifty percent (50%) likely of being realized upon settlement. The tax positions are regularly re-evaluated based on the results of the examination of income tax filings, statute of limitations expirations and changes in tax law that would either increase or decrease the technical merits of a position relative to the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold. In the normal course of business, we are regularly audited by the PRC tax authorities. The settlement of any particular issue with the applicable tax authority could have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.\n 94 \n \nStock Based Compensation\nWe measure the cost of employee services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments based on the grant date fair value of the award and recognize the cost over the period the employee is required to provide service in exchange for the award, which generally is the vesting period. We have elected to recognize the compensation cost for an award with only service conditions and a graded vesting schedule on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period for the entire award. However, the cumulative amount of compensation cost recognized at any date equals at least the portion of the grant date value of such award that is vested at that date.\nWe estimated the fair value of our share options using the Black-Scholes Option Pricing model. The model incorporates subjective assumptions. The expected volatility was based on implied volatilities from traded options and historical volatility of the Company's common stock. The risk-free interest rate assumption is determined using the Federal Reserve nominal rates for U.S. Treasury zero-coupon bonds with maturities similar to those of the expected term of the award being valued. There is no expected dividend yield, as the Company has not paid dividend and does not anticipate paying dividend over the term of the grants.\nRecent Development\nOn November 5, 2020, the Company held a special meeting of stockholders, at which the Company's stockholders voted, among other things, in favor of the proposal to adopt the previously announced agreement and plan of merger (the Merger Agreement\u201d), dated as of June 15, 2020, by and among the Company, Faith Dawn Limited, an exempted company with limited liability incorporated under the laws of the Cayman Islands ( Parent\u201d), and Faith Horizon Inc., a Nevada corporation and wholly owned subsidiary of Parent ( Merger Sub\u201d), providing for the merger of the Merger Sub with and into the Company, with the Company continuing as the surviving corporation and as a wholly-owned subsidiary of Parent (the Merger\u201d).\nOn December 13, 2020, the Company entered into an amendment No.1 (the Amendment\u201d) to that certain Agreement and Plan of Merger dated June 15, 2020 (as so amended, the Merger Agreement\u201d) by and among the Company, Faith Dawn Limited ( Parent\u201d), and Faith Horizon Inc. ( Merger Sub\u201d), a Nevada corporation and a wholly-owned subsidiary of Parent. The Amendment extends the Termination Date (as defined in the Merger Agreement) to February 7, 2021. The special committee of the board of directors of the Company and the board of directors of the Company both approved the Amendment to permit additional time for the parties to the Merger Agreement to complete the merger. The parties to the Merger Agreement are currently working on the logistics to complete the Merger. Other than as described herein, the Amendment does not amend any other provision of the Merger Agreement.\nOn February 7, 2021, the Company entered into an amendment No.2 (the Second Amendment\u201d) to that certain Agreement and Plan of Merger dated June 15, 2020, as amended on December 13, 2020 (as so amended, the Merger Agreement\u201d) by and among the Company, Faith Dawn Limited ( Parent\u201d), and Faith Horizon Inc. ( Merger Sub\u201d), a Nevada corporation and a wholly-owned subsidiary of Parent. The Second Amendment extends the Termination Date (as defined in the Merger Agreement) to May 10, 2021.The special committee of the board of directors of the Company and the board of directors of the Company both approved the Second Amendment to permit additional time for the parties to the Merger Agreement to complete the merger. The parties to the Merger Agreement are currently working on the logistics to complete the Merger. Other than as described herein, the Second Amendment does not amend any other provision of the Merger Agreement.\n 95 \n \nOn May 8, 2021, the Company issued a notice of termination to Parent (the Notice of Termination\u201d) notifying Parent that the Company terminated the merger agreement pursuant to Section 9.1(c)(i) of the merger agreement, based on Parent and Merger Sub's breaches of the merger agreement, which have given rise to the failure of several conditions set forth in Section 8.1 and Section 8.3 of the merger agreement. These breaches are not capable of being cured prior to the termination date of the merger agreement.

This was due to a decrease of 7.8% in sales volume, and a decrease of 1.6% in the average RMB selling price of our products, as compared with those of the same period of last year.\n(1) Domestic market\nFor the year ended December 31, 2020, revenue from domestic market decreased by 5.5% or US$75.6 million, as a result of a decrease of 6.4% in sales volume, and partially offset by an increase of 1.0% in the average RMB selling price of our products, as compared with those of the same period of last year.\n 96 \n \nAccording to the China Association of Automobile Manufacturers, automobile production and sales in China decreased by 2.0% and 1.9 %, respectively, for twelve months of 2020 as compared to the same period of 2019. The weakening in macroeconomic conditions since the outbreak of COVID-19 pandemic in January 2020 continued to exacerbate auto business environment throughout year of 2020. The Company's business was negatively impacted and has generated lower revenue during the period from February to April 2020. Thanks to our positive efforts to expand our customer bases and to meet their new requirements, including producing raw materials for PPE such as goggles and masks, to help alleviate the pandemic to our communities and mitigate the negative impact of world pandemic on Chinese auto industry, the Company has begun to recover slowly after May 2020. We achieved sales increase by 75.7% in Southwest China, 35.3% in East China and 7.5% in South China, although our sales decreased by 62.1% in Northeast China, 21.9% in Central China and 15.2% in North China, for the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to the same period of 2019.\nAs for the RMB selling price, the increase of 1.0% was mainly due to increased sales of new categories of higher-end products of PA66 and PA6 produced with high-priced raw materials with higher selling price in domestic markets during the year ended December 31, 2020.\n(2) Overseas market\nOverseas sales were nil for the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to US$61.2 million in prior year.\nThe Dubai facility was temporarily shut down since late February and has not resumed its operation till the current period, which has negatively impacted operations in Dubai facility.\nWe have experienced a delay in cash collection from a major customer in UAE. As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, we provided an allowance of US$64.8million and US$62.8 million, respectively, for the overdue accounts receivable from the major customer in UAE, as the customer failed to make payments under the agreed extended repayment plan.\nThe following table summarizes the breakdown of revenues by categories for the periods indicated.\nTable 249: <table> <tr> <td> </td>

other comprehensive loss. Cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash decreased by 19.7% or US$45.1 million primarily due to the increase of US$45.1 million operating activity cash outflows. The aggregate short-term and long-term bank loans increased by 53.4% due to using the line of credits to support operating and investing activities in HLJ Xinda Group and Sichuan Xinda. We define the manageable debt level as the sum of aggregate short-term and long-term loans over total assets.\n 102 \n \nLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\nHistorically, our primary uses of cash have been to finance working capital needs and capital expenditures for new production lines. We have financed these requirements primarily from cash generated from operations, bank borrowings and the issuance of our convertible preferred stocks and debt financings. As of December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, we had US$183.3 million and US$228.4 million, respectively, in the total amount of cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash, which were primarily deposited with banks in China (including Hong Kong and Macau SAR), UAE and U.S. As of December 31, 2020, we had US$643.6 million outstanding short-term bank loans (including the current portion of long-term bank loans), including US$481.0 million unsecured loan, US$36.5 million guaranteed loan, US$15.3 million loans secured by restricted cash, US$12.3 million loans secured by inventories, and US$98.5 million long-term bank loans that due in one year. We also had US$727.3 million long-term loans (excluding the current portion), including US$585.9 million loans secured by an undated security cheque, and US$239.9 million unsecured loans. Short-term and long-term bank loans in total bear a weighted average interest rate of 5.6% per annum and do not contain any renewal terms. We have historically been able to make repayments when due.\nHowever, as disclosed in Note 3 in the Company's financial statements, for the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company had a significant loss of US$181.7 million primarily due to an impairment of long-lived assets of US$165.3 million for Dubai Xinda and had recurring operating cash outflows of US$3.0 million. These conditions raised substantial doubts about the Company's ability to continue as a going concern.\nA summary of lines of credit and the remaining line of credit as of December 31, 2020 is as below:\nTable 273: <table> <tr> <td>(in millions) </td> <td> </td> <td>December 31, 2020 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Lines of Credit, Obtained </td> <td> </td> <td>Remaining\nAvailable\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Name of Financial Institution </td> <td> </td> <td>Date of Approval </td> <td> </td> <td>RMB </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>USD </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>USD </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>China Construction Bank </td> <td> </td> <td>January 20, 2020 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>714.1 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>109.4 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>89.8 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Longjiang Bank </td> <td> </td> <td>February 28, 2020 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,250.0 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>191.6 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Industrial and Commercial Bank of China </td> <td> </td> <td>May 9, 2020 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,335.0 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>204.6 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Agricultural Bank of China </td> <td> </td> <td>February 24, 2020 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>250.0 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>38.3 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Postal Savings Bank of China </td> <td> </td> <td>April 30, 2020 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>100.0 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>15.3 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Sichuan Tianfu Bank </td> <td> </td> <td>March 12, 2020 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>522.0 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>80.0 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Nanchong Rural Commercial Bank </td> <td> </td> <td>July 17, 2020 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>238.4 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>36.5 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1.8 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Bank of Harbin </td> <td> </td> <td>August 10, 2020 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>70.0 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>10.7 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Harbin Rural Commercial Bank </td> <td> </td> <td>April 30, 2020 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>330.0 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>50.6 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Jianxin Financial Asset Investment Co., Ltd. </td> <td> </td> <td>November 21, 2019 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>390.0 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>59.8 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Subtotal (credit term<=1 year) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5,199.5 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>796.8 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>91.6 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Agricultural Bank of China </td> <td> </td> <td>December 7, 2020 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>400.0 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>61.3 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Longjiang Bank </td> <td> </td> <td>June 17, 2019 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4,172.2 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>639.4 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>National Bank of Umm Al Qaiwain </td> <td> </td> <td>December 26, 2018 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>14.2 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2.2 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Industrial and Commercial Bank of China </td> <td> </td> <td>February 17, 2020 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,029.8 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>157.8 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>15.4 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Nanchong Shuntou Development Group Co., Ltd </td> <td> </td> <td>January 6, 2017 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>350.0 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>53.6 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Subtotal (credit term>1 year) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5,966.2 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>914.3 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>15.4 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Total </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>11,165.7 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,711.1 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>107.0 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nAs of December 31, 2020, we have contractual obligations to pay (i) lease commitments in the amount of US$26.3 million, including US$1.4 million due in one year;

If these sources are insufficient to satisfy our cash requirements, we may seek to sell additional equity or debt securities or obtain a credit facility. The sale of additional equity or equity-linked securities could result in additional dilution to stockholders.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the section titled Selected Consolidated Financial and Other Data\u201d and the consolidated financial statements and related notes thereto included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. This discussion contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include those identified below and those discussed in the section titled Risk Factors\u201d and other parts of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Our historical results are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for any period in the future.\nGeneral\nChina XD is one of the leading specialty chemical companies engaged in the research, development, manufacture and sale of modified plastics primarily for automotive applications in China, and to a lesser extent, in Dubai, UAE. Through our wholly-owned operating subsidiaries in China and UAE, we develop modified plastics using our proprietary technology, manufacture and sell our products primarily for use in the fabrication of automobile parts and components. We have 688 certifications from manufacturers in the automobile industry as of December 31, 2020. We are the only company certified as a National Enterprise Technology Center in modified plastics industry in Heilongjiang province. Our Research and Development (the R&D\u201d) team consists of 127 professionals and 7 consultants. As a result of the integration of our academic and technological expertise, we have a portfolio of 647 patents, 63 of which we have obtained the patent rights and the remaining 584 of which we have applications pending in China as of December 31, 2020.\nOur products include twelve categories: Modified Polypropylene (PP), Modified Acrylonitrile Butadiene Styrene (ABS), Modified Polyamide 66 (PA66), Modified Polyamide 6 (PA6), Modified Polyoxymethylenes (POM), Modified Polyphenylene Oxide (PPO), Plastic Alloy, Modified Polyphenylene Sulfide (PPS), Modified Polyimide (PI), Modified Polylactic acid (PLA), Poly Ether Ether Ketone (PEEK), and Polyethylene (PE).\nThe Company's products are primarily used in the production of exterior and interior trim and functional components of 29 automobile brands and 111 automobile models manufactured in China, including Audi, Mercedes Benz, BMW, Toyota, Buick, Chevrolet, Mazda, Volvo, Ford, Citroen, Jinbei, VW Passat, Golf, Jetta, etc. Our research center is dedicated to the research and development of modified plastics, and benefits from its cooperation with well-known scientists from prestigious universities in China. We operate three manufacturing plants in Harbin, Heilongjiang in the PRC. Prior to December 2012, we had approximately 255,000 metric tons of annual production capacity across 58 automatic production lines utilizing German twin-screw extruding systems, automatic weighing systems and Taiwan conveyer systems. In December 2012, we further expanded our third production base in Harbin with additional 135,000 metric tons of annual production capacity, bringing total installed production capacity in our three production bases to 390,000 metric tons with additional 30 new production lines. In July 2017, our Harbin campus launched a new industrial project for upgrading existing equipment for 100,000 metric tons of engineering plastics. As a result, our production capacity in Harbin, Heilongjiang was downgraded to 290,000 MT. In 2019, our Harbin campus started two equipment projects in Qinling Road Factory ( Qinling Road Project\u201d) and Jiangnan Road Factory ( Jiangnan Road Project\u201d) for equipment upgrade and overhaul progress, which further downgraded our production capacity to 135,000 MT. The industrial project for upgrading existing equipment for 100,000 metric tons of engineering plastics was expected to be completed by the end of 2020, Qinling Road Project and Jiangnan Road Project was expected to be completed by the end of 2020, thus bringing the production capacity in Harbin Campus back to 390,000 MT. Also, in July 2017, HLJ Xinda Group started an industrial project for 300,000 metric tons of biological composite materials, an industrial project for a 3D printing intelligent manufacture demonstration factory and a 3D printing display and experience cloud factory. This project with four workshops was formally broken ground in December 2019. The Company expects the gradual trial out by the end of 2022 and put into production by the end of 2023.\n 91 \n \nIn December 2013, we broke ground on the construction of our fourth production plant in Nanchong City, Sichuan Province, with additional 300,000 metric tons of annual production capacity, which we expect will bring total domestic installed production capacity to 590,000 metric tons with the addition of 70 new production lines upon the completion of the construction of our fourth production plant. Sichuan Xinda has been supplying to its customers since 2013. We installed 50 production lines in the second half of 2016 in our Sichuan plant with production capacity of 216,000 metric tons during the year of 2017 and an additional 10 production lines in July 2018, bringing the total capacity to 259,200 metric tons. As of December 31, 2020, there is still construction ongoing on the site of our Sichuan plant which is expected to be completed by the end of the third quarter of 2022.\nIn order to develop potential overseas markets, Dubai Xinda obtained one leased property and two purchased properties, approximately 52,530 square meters in total, including one leased 10,000 square meters, and two purchased 20,206 and 22,324 square meters on January 25, 2015, June 28, 2016 and September 21, 2016, respectively, from Jebel Ali Free Zone Authority ( JAFZA\u201d) in Dubai, UAE, with constructed building comprising warehouses, offices and service blocks. In addition to the earlier 10 trial production lines in Dubai Xinda, the Company completed installing 45 production lines with 11,250 metric tons of annual production capacity by the end of November 2018, and an additional 30 production lines with 7,500 metric tons of annual production capacity. The Company previously estimated 22 production lines to be put into production in the fourth quarter of 2021, and 8 production lines in the second quarter of 2022. Due to the negative impact of COVID-19, this project was suspended and the Company plans to resume the installation process by the first half of 2022. The new completion timeline is estimated by the end of 2022, thus bringing total installed production capacity in Dubai Xinda to 21,250 metric tons, targeting high-end products for the overseas market.\nDue to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Company's manufacturing facilities in Harbin and Sichuan was temporarily shut down from early February 2020 to early March 2020 while our Dubai facilities was suspended operation from early February 2020 till current in accordance with the requirement of the local governments. The Company's business was negatively impacted and generated lower revenue and net income during the period from February to April 2020. The extent of the impact of COVID-19 on the Company's results of operations and financial condition will depend on the virus' future developments, including the duration and spread of the outbreak and the impact on the Company's customers, which are still uncertain and cannot be reasonably estimated at this point of time.\nCritical Accounting Policies\nWe prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP, which requires us to make judgments, estimates and assumptions that affect (1) the reported amounts of our assets and liabilities; (2) the disclosure of our contingent assets and liabilities at the end of each reporting period; and (3) the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during each reporting period. We continually evaluate these judgments, estimates and assumptions based on our own historical experience, knowledge and assessment of current business and other conditions and our expectations regarding the future based on available information which together form our basis for making judgments about matters that are not readily apparent from other sources. Since the use of estimates is an integral component of the financial reporting process, our actual results could differ from those estimates. Some of our accounting policies require a higher degree of judgment than others in their application.\n 92 \n \nWhen reading our consolidated financial statements, you should consider our selection of critical accounting policies, the judgment and other uncertainties affecting the application of such policies, and the sensitivity of reported results to changes in conditions and assumptions. We believe the following accounting policies involve the most significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements.\nLong-Lived Assets\nOur long-lived assets include property, plant and equipment and land use rights.\nWe depreciate and amortize our property, plant and equipment and land use rights, using the straight-line method of accounting over the estimated useful lives of the assets. We make estimates of the useful lives of property, plant and equipment, including the salvage values, and land use rights in order to determine the amount of depreciation and amortization expense to be recorded during each reporting period. The estimated useful life is the period over which the long-lived assets are expected to contribute directly or indirectly to the future cash flows of the Company.\nWe evaluate long-lived assets, including property, plant and equipment, and land use rights for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable. We assess recoverability by comparing carrying amount of a long-lived asset or asset group to estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset or asset group. If the carrying amount of an asset or asset group exceeds its estimated undiscounted future cash flows, we recognize an impairment charge based on the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the estimated fair value of the asset or asset group. We estimate the fair value of the asset or asset group through various valuation techniques, including discounted cash flow models, quoted market values and third-party independent appraisals, as considered necessary. Assets to be disposed are reported at the lower of carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell, and are no longer depreciated.\nImpairment charges of US$165.3 million was recognized for long-lived assets during the year ended December 31, 2020 (See Note 26 to Consolidated Financial Statements).\nAllowance for Doubtful Accounts\nWe maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments. In establishing the required allowance, we consider historical losses adjusted to take into account current market conditions, the amount of receivables in dispute, and the current receivables aging and current payment patterns. Account balances are charged off against the allowance after all means of collection have been exhausted and the potential for recovery is considered remote. We do not have any off-balance-sheet credit exposure related to our customers.\n 93 \n \nWe extend unsecured credit to customers with good credit history. We review our accounts receivable on a regular basis to determine if the bad debt allowance is adequate at each year-end.\nValuation of Inventories\nOur inventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value (NRV). We routinely evaluate quantities and value of our inventories in light of current market conditions and market trends, and record a write-down against the cost of inventories for net realizable value below cost. Expected demand and anticipated sales price are the key factors affecting our inventory valuation analysis. For purposes of our inventory valuation analysis, we develop expected demand and anticipated sales prices primarily based on sales orders as well as industry trends and individual customer analysis. We also consider sales and sales orders after each reporting period-end but before the issuance of our financial statements to assess the accuracy of our inventory valuation estimates. Historically, actual demand and sales price have generally been consistent with or greater than expected demand and anticipated sales price used for purposes of our inventory valuation analysis. The evaluation also takes into consideration new product development schedules, the effect that new products might have on the sale of existing products, product obsolescence, customer concentrations, product merchantability and other factors. Market conditions are subject to change and actual consumption of inventories could differ from forecasted demand. Our products have a long life cycle and obsolescence has not historically been a significant factor in the valuation of inventories. We have not experienced any material inventory write-downs before.\nIncome Tax Uncertainties and Realization of Deferred Income Tax Assets\nOur income tax provision, deferred income tax assets and deferred income tax liabilities are recognized and measured primarily based on actual and expected future income, PRC statutory income tax rates, PRC tax regulations and tax planning strategies.\nSignificant judgment is required in interpreting tax regulations in the PRC, evaluating uncertain tax positions, and assessing the realizability of deferred income tax assets. Actual results could differ materially from those judgments, and changes in judgments could materially affect our consolidated financial statements. As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, we had total gross deferred income tax assets of US$33,524,819 and US$14,313,575, respectively. We record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred income tax assets if, based on the weight of available evidence, we believe expected future taxable income is not likely to support the use of a deduction or credit in that jurisdiction. We evaluate the level of our valuation allowances quarterly, and more frequently if actual operating results differ significantly from forecasted results. As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, our valuation allowance against deferred income tax assets was US$33,524,819 and US$14,313,575, respectively.\nWe recognize the impact of a tax position if we determine the position is more likely than not to be sustained upon examination, including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes, based solely on the technical merits of the position. In evaluating whether a tax position has met the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold, it is presumed that the position will be examined by the appropriate tax authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information. In addition, a tax position that meets the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold is measured to determine the amount of benefit to recognize in the financial statements. The tax position is measured at the largest amount of benefit that is greater than fifty percent (50%) likely of being realized upon settlement. The tax positions are regularly re-evaluated based on the results of the examination of income tax filings, statute of limitations expirations and changes in tax law that would either increase or decrease the technical merits of a position relative to the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold. In the normal course of business, we are regularly audited by the PRC tax authorities. The settlement of any particular issue with the applicable tax authority could have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.\n 94 \n \nStock Based Compensation\nWe measure the cost of employee services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments based on the grant date fair value of the award and recognize the cost over the period the employee is required to provide service in exchange for the award, which generally is the vesting period. We have elected to recognize the compensation cost for an award with only service conditions and a graded vesting schedule on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period for the entire award. However, the cumulative amount of compensation cost recognized at any date equals at least the portion of the grant date value of such award that is vested at that date.\nWe estimated the fair value of our share options using the Black-Scholes Option Pricing model. The model incorporates subjective assumptions. The expected volatility was based on implied volatilities from traded options and historical volatility of the Company's common stock. The risk-free interest rate assumption is determined using the Federal Reserve nominal rates for U.S. Treasury zero-coupon bonds with maturities similar to those of the expected term of the award being valued. There is no expected dividend yield, as the Company has not paid dividend and does not anticipate paying dividend over the term of the grants.\nRecent Development\nOn November 5, 2020, the Company held a special meeting of stockholders, at which the Company's stockholders voted, among other things, in favor of the proposal to adopt the previously announced agreement and plan of merger (the Merger Agreement\u201d), dated as of June 15, 2020, by and among the Company, Faith Dawn Limited, an exempted company with limited liability incorporated under the laws of the Cayman Islands ( Parent\u201d), and Faith Horizon Inc., a Nevada corporation and wholly owned subsidiary of Parent ( Merger Sub\u201d), providing for the merger of the Merger Sub with and into the Company, with the Company continuing as the surviving corporation and as a wholly-owned subsidiary of Parent (the Merger\u201d).\nOn December 13, 2020, the Company entered into an amendment No.1 (the Amendment\u201d) to that certain Agreement and Plan of Merger dated June 15, 2020 (as so amended, the Merger Agreement\u201d) by and among the Company, Faith Dawn Limited ( Parent\u201d), and Faith Horizon Inc. ( Merger Sub\u201d), a Nevada corporation and a wholly-owned subsidiary of Parent. The Amendment extends the Termination Date (as defined in the Merger Agreement) to February 7, 2021. The special committee of the board of directors of the Company and the board of directors of the Company both approved the Amendment to permit additional time for the parties to the Merger Agreement to complete the merger. The parties to the Merger Agreement are currently working on the logistics to complete the Merger. Other than as described herein, the Amendment does not amend any other provision of the Merger Agreement.\nOn February 7, 2021, the Company entered into an amendment No.2 (the Second Amendment\u201d) to that certain Agreement and Plan of Merger dated June 15, 2020, as amended on December 13, 2020 (as so amended, the Merger Agreement\u201d) by and among the Company, Faith Dawn Limited ( Parent\u201d), and Faith Horizon Inc. ( Merger Sub\u201d), a Nevada corporation and a wholly-owned subsidiary of Parent. The Second Amendment extends the Termination Date (as defined in the Merger Agreement) to May 10, 2021.The special committee of the board of directors of the Company and the board of directors of the Company both approved the Second Amendment to permit additional time for the parties to the Merger Agreement to complete the merger. The parties to the Merger Agreement are currently working on the logistics to complete the Merger. Other than as described herein, the Second Amendment does not amend any other provision of the Merger Agreement.\n 95 \n \nOn May 8, 2021, the Company issued a notice of termination to Parent (the Notice of Termination\u201d) notifying Parent that the Company terminated the merger agreement pursuant to Section 9.1(c)(i) of the merger agreement, based on Parent and Merger Sub's breaches of the merger agreement, which have given rise to the failure of several conditions set forth in Section 8.1 and Section 8.3 of the merger agreement. These breaches are not capable of being cured prior to the termination date of the merger agreement. Pursuant to the Notice of Termination, as a result of such termination, the Parent Termination Fee becomes due and payable to the Company by Parent. On May 12, 2021, Parent sent a response letter, dated May 11, 2021 (the Response Letter\u201d), to the Company that while it disagrees with the allegations made in the Notice of Termination, Parent acknowledges that the Company may terminate the merger agreement pursuant to Section 9.1(c)(iii) of the merger agreement and thus agrees to pay the Parent Termination Fee pursuant to Section 9.3(b) of the merger agreement under that basis. As a result of the termination of the merger agreement, the merger will not be completed.\nThe following table sets forth statements of comprehensive income (loss) data for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 in millions of US$:\n\nRevenues\nRevenues decreased by 9.4%, or US$136.3 million, in 2020 as compared to 2019. This was due to a decrease of 7.8% in sales volume, and a decrease of 1.6% in the average RMB selling price of our products, as compared with those of the same period of last year.\n(1) Domestic market\nFor the year ended December 31, 2020, revenue from domestic market decreased by 5.5% or US$75.6 million, as a result of a decrease of 6.4% in sales volume, and partially offset by an increase of 1.0% in the average RMB selling price of our products, as compared with those of the same period of last year.\n 96 \n \nAccording to the China Association of Automobile Manufacturers, automobile production and sales in China decreased by 2.0% and 1.9 %, respectively, for twelve months of 2020 as compared to the same period of 2019. The weakening in macroeconomic conditions since the outbreak of COVID-19 pandemic in January 2020 continued to exacerbate auto business environment throughout year of 2020. The Company's business was negatively impacted and has generated lower revenue during the period from February to April 2020. Thanks to our positive efforts to expand our customer bases and to meet their new requirements, including producing raw materials for PPE such as goggles and masks, to help alleviate the pandemic to our communities and mitigate the negative impact of world pandemic on Chinese auto industry, the Company has begun to recover slowly after May 2020. We achieved sales increase by 75.7% in Southwest China, 35.3% in East China and 7.5% in South China, although our sales decreased by 62.1% in Northeast China, 21.9% in Central China and 15.2% in North China, for the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to the same period of 2019.\nAs for the RMB selling price, the increase of 1.0% was mainly due to increased sales of new categories of higher-end products of PA66 and PA6 produced with high-priced raw materials with higher selling price in domestic markets during the year ended December 31, 2020.\n(2) Overseas market\nOverseas sales were nil for the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to US$61.2 million in prior year.\nThe Dubai facility was temporarily shut down since late February and has not resumed its operation till the current period, which has negatively impacted operations in Dubai facility.\nWe have experienced a delay in cash collection from a major customer in UAE. As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, we provided an allowance of US$64.8million and US$62.8 million, respectively, for the overdue accounts receivable from the major customer in UAE, as the customer failed to make payments under the agreed extended repayment plan.\nThe following table summarizes the breakdown of revenues by categories for the periods indicated.\n\n 97 \n \nThe following table summarizes the breakdown of metric tons (MT) by product mix for the periods indicated:\n\nThe Company continued to shift production mix from traditional lower-end products such as PP to higher-end products such as PA66, PA6, and PE, primarily due to (i) greater growth potential of advanced modified plastics in luxury automobile models in China, (ii) the stronger demand as a result of promotion by the Chinese government for clean energy vehicles and (iii) better quality demand from and consumer recognition of higher-end cars made by automotive manufacturers from Chinese and Germany joint ventures, Sino-U.S. and Sino-Japanese joint ventures, which manufacturers tend to use more and higher-end modified plastics in quantity per vehicle in China.\nGross Profit and Gross Margin\n\nGross profit was US$143.7 million in 2020, as compared to US$219.4 million in 2019. Our gross margin decreased to 11.0% during 2020 from 15.1% in 2019, primarily due to the increased cost for idle capacity as a result of shutdown.\n 98 \n \nGeneral and Administrative Expenses\n\nGeneral and administrative (G&A) expenses were US$32.5 million in 2020 compared to US$35.4 million in 2019, representing a decrease of US$2.9 million. The decrease was primarily due to our approach to optimize management structure and enhancing efficiency, and partially offset share based compensation cost recognized in the year of 2020.\nOn a percentage basis, G&A expenses in 2020 were flat at 2.4%, compared to that of the same period of 2019.\nProvision for Doubtful Accounts\n\nProvision for doubtful accounts was US$2.4 million in 2020 compared to 62.8 million in 2019.\nAs of December 31, 2020, accounts receivable of US$2.2 million from the Company's two customers in UAE and US$0.4 million from the Company's one customer in PRC were overdue for more than 12 months. Based on assessment of the collectability of the amounts due from the customers, the Company provided an allowance for doubtful accounts of US$2.4 million for the period ended December 31, 2020.\nAs of December 31, 2019, our main UAE customer had US$62.8 million of overdue accounts receivable and the customer failed to make payments under the agreed extended repayment plan. Based on its assessment of the collectability of the amounts due from the customer, the Company provided an allowance for doubtful accounts of US$62.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2019.\nImpairment of Long-Term Prepayments to Equipment and Construction Suppliers\n\nImpairment of Long-Term Prepayments to Equipment and Construction Suppliers was US$21.9 million during the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to nil in the same period of 2019. On October 20, 2016, Sichuan Xinda entered into an equipment purchase agreement purchase contract with Peaceful for a total consideration of RMB89.8 million (equivalent to US$13.0 million), and on May 31, 2019, Dubai Xinda entered into an equipment purchase contract with Peaceful for a total consideration of US$18.8 million to purchase production and testing equipment. As of December 31, 2020, Peaceful failed to deliver the equipments under the purchase agreements. Based on the assessment of the recoverability of the prepayments, the Company recognized an impairment charges of US$21.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2020.\n 99 \n \nImpairment of Long-Lived Assets\n\nImpairment loss was US$165.3 million during the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to nil in the same period of 2019. The Dubai facility was temporarily shut down since late February, 2020 and has not resumed its operation till the current period, which has negatively impacted operations in Dubai facility. The Company has assessed the situation of non operational and made an impairment charges of US$165.3 million, primarily related to workshops, machinery and construction in progress (See Note 26 to Consolidated Financial Statements).\nResearch and Development Expenses\n\nResearch and development expenses were US$22.5 million in 2020 compared with US$50.3 million in 2019, representing a decrease of US$27.8 million, or 55.3%. This decrease was due to (i) a decrease of US$14.9 million in raw materials consumption, (ii) a decrease of US$0.4 million in depreciation, and (iii) a decrease of US$0.2 million in salary and welfare for R&D personnel.\nAs of December 31, 2020, the number of ongoing research and development projects was 347. We expect to complete and commence to realize economic benefits from approximately 25% of the projects in the near term. The majority of the projects are in the field of modified plastics in automotive applications and the rest are in advanced fields such as ships, airplanes, high-speed rail, medical devices, etc.\nOperating Income (loss)\nTotal operating loss was US$102.0 million in 2020 compared to an operating income of US$69.4 million in 2019, representing a decrease of 250.6% or US$171.4 million. This decrease is primarily due to the lower gross profit, the impairment charges of US$165.3 million, and the higher operating expenses.\nInterest Income (Expenses)\n\n 100 \n \nNet interest expense was US$69.5 million in 2020, compared to net interest expense of US$65.8 million in 2019, representing an increase of 5.6% or US$3.7 million, primarily due to (i) the increase of average loan interest rate from 5.5% of the same period in 2019 to 5.6% for the year ended December 31, 2020 and (ii) the increase of average short-term and long-term loan balance in the amount of US$889.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to US$912.8 million of the same period in 2019, partially offset by the iii) increase of interest income resulting from the average interest rate decreased to 0.60% for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to 0.65% of the same period in 2020, and (iv) the increase of average deposit balance in the amount of US$222.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to US$ compared to US$223.0 million for the same period in 2020.\nForeign Currency Exchange Gains (losses)\n\nForeign currency exchange losses were US$12.6 million in 2020, compared to gains of US$2.9 million in 2019, which was due to the fluctuation of the exchange rate of RMB again US Dollar.\nIncome Taxes\n\nThe effective income tax rate in 2020 and 2019 was negative 3.3% and 82.1%, respectively.\nThe decrease of effective income tax rate in 2020 was primarily due to the increased loss before income taxes from Dubai Xinda, and decreased income before taxes from HLJ Xinda Group and Sichuan Xinda.\nOur PRC and Dubai subsidiaries had US$183.4 million of cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash as of December 31, 2020, which are planned to be indefinitely reinvested in PRC. The distributions from our PRC subsidiaries are subject to the U.S. federal income tax at 21%, less any applicable foreign tax credits. Due to our policy of indefinitely reinvesting our earnings in our PRC business, we have not provided for deferred income tax liabilities related to PRC withholding income tax on undistributed earnings of our PRC subsidiaries.\n 101 \n \nNet Income (loss)\nAs a result of the above factors, we had a net loss of US$181.7 million in 2020 as compared to net income of US$3.1 million in 2019.\nSelected Balance Sheet Data as of December 31, 2020 and 2019:\n\nStockholders' equity as of December 31, 2020 decreased by 8.3% as compared to that of December 31, 2019 primarily due to the increase of impairment loss of US$165.3 million for Dubai Xinda, offset by the increase of US$50.0 million noncontrolling interests and the decrease of US$37.9 million accumulated other comprehensive loss. Cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash decreased by 19.7% or US$45.1 million primarily due to the increase of US$45.1 million operating activity cash outflows. The aggregate short-term and long-term bank loans increased by 53.4% due to using the line of credits to support operating and investing activities in HLJ Xinda Group and Sichuan Xinda. We define the manageable debt level as the sum of aggregate short-term and long-term loans over total assets.\n 102 \n \nLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\nHistorically, our primary uses of cash have been to finance working capital needs and capital expenditures for new production lines. We have financed these requirements primarily from cash generated from operations, bank borrowings and the issuance of our convertible preferred stocks and debt financings. As of December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, we had US$183.3 million and US$228.4 million, respectively, in the total amount of cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash, which were primarily deposited with banks in China (including Hong Kong and Macau SAR), UAE and U.S. As of December 31, 2020, we had US$643.6 million outstanding short-term bank loans (including the current portion of long-term bank loans), including US$481.0 million unsecured loan, US$36.5 million guaranteed loan, US$15.3 million loans secured by restricted cash, US$12.3 million loans secured by inventories, and US$98.5 million long-term bank loans that due in one year. We also had US$727.3 million long-term loans (excluding the current portion), including US$585.9 million loans secured by an undated security cheque, and US$239.9 million unsecured loans. Short-term and long-term bank loans in total bear a weighted average interest rate of 5.6% per annum and do not contain any renewal terms. We have historically been able to make repayments when due.\nHowever, as disclosed in Note 3 in the Company's financial statements, for the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company had a significant loss of US$181.7 million primarily due to an impairment of long-lived assets of US$165.3 million for Dubai Xinda and had recurring operating cash outflows of US$3.0 million. These conditions raised substantial doubts about the Company's ability to continue as a going concern.\nA summary of lines of credit and the remaining line of credit as of December 31, 2020 is as below:\n\nAs of December 31, 2020, we have contractual obligations to pay (i) lease commitments in the amount of US$26.3 million, including US$1.4 million due in one year; (ii) equipment acquisition and facility construction in the amount of US$250.2 million; (iii) long-term bank loan in the amount of US$727.3 million (including principals and interests).\n 103 \n \nWe expect that we will be able to meet our needs to fund operations, capital expenditures and other commitments in the next 12 months primarily with our cash and cash equivalents, operating cash flows and bank borrowings and contribution from the principal shareholder.\nWe may, however, require additional cash resources due to changes in business conditions or other future developments. If these sources are insufficient to satisfy our cash requirements, we may seek to sell additional equity or debt securities or obtain a credit facility. The sale of additional equity or equity-linked securities could result in additional dilution to stockholders. The incurrence of indebtedness would result in increased debt service obligations and could result in operating and financial covenants that would restrict operations. Financing may not be available in amounts or on terms acceptable to us, or at all.\nThe following table sets forth a summary of our cash flows for years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019.\n\nOperating Activities\nNet cash used in operating activities was US$3.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, as compared to US$189.9 million used in operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2019, primarily due to (i) the decrease of approximately US$255.5 million in cash collected from our customers, (ii) the increase of US$6.5 million interest payments, partially offset by (vi) the decrease of approximately US$335.1 million in cash operating payments, including raw material purchases, rental and personnel costs, (v) the increase of US$9.1 million received from government grant, and (vi) the decrease of US$4.8 million in income tax payments, and (vii) the decrease of US$5.5 million interest payment.\n 104 \n \nInvesting Activities\nNet cash used in the investing activities was US$431.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to US$130.1 million for the same period of last year, mainly due to (i) the increase of US$51.3 million purchase of property, plant and equipment, (ii) the increase of US$231.2 million of loans to third parties, (iii) the decrease of US$7.3 million proceeds from sales of a subsidiary, (iv) the decrease of $15.7 million refund of prepayment for property and equipment purchase, and partially offset by (v) the increase of US$3.8 million Government grant related to the project construction and (vi) the increase of US$0.7 million proceeds from disposal of property, plant and equipment.\nFinancing Activities\nNet cash provided by financing activities was US$387.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, as compared to US$185.9 million for the same period of last year, primarily as a result of the decrease of (i) the proceeds of US$1,033.8 million from bank borrowings, (ii) the increase of US$47.2 million capital injection from noncontrolling interests, (iii) the decrease of US$64.7 million repayment of interest-free advances from related parties, (iv) the decrease of US$4.4 million payments of issuance cost of bank borrowings, (v) the decrease of US$0.1 million payments of issuance costs for syndicated loans, partially offset by (vi) the decrease of US$1,038.6 million proceeds from bank borrowings, (vii) the decrease of US$77.2 million proceeds of interest-free advances from related parties and (viii) the increase of US$0.1 million payments of issuance costs for syndicated loans.\nAs of December 31, 2020, our cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash balance was US$183.3 million, compared to US$228.4 million at December 31, 2019.\nDays Sales Outstanding ( DSO\u201d) has increased from 72 days for the year ended December 31, 2019 to 89 days for the year ended December 31, 2020 as a result of cash collection of overdue accounts receivable from customers in 2020.\nIt takes shorter to collect from our customers. We believe that our DSO is still below industry average. Industry Standard Customer and Supplier Payment Terms (days) as below:\n\nInventory turnover days increased from 185 days for the year ended December 31, 2019 to 188 days for the year ended December 31, 2020.\nTurnover days of payables have decreased from 21 days for the year ended December 31, 2019 to 20 days for the year ended December 31, 2020.\nBased on past performance and current expectations, we believe that our current cash and cash equivalents and anticipated cash flows from operating activities will satisfy our working capital needs, capital expenditures and other liquidity requirements associated with our operations for at least the next 12 months.\nThe majority of the Company's revenues and expenses were denominated primarily in Renminbi ( RMB\u201d), the currency of the People's Republic of China. There is no assurance that exchange rates between the RMB and the U.S. Dollar will remain stable. Inflation has not had a material impact on the Company's business.\n 105 \n \nCOMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES\nContractual Obligations\nOur contractual obligations as of December 31, 2020 are as follows:\n\n(1) Sichuan plant construction and equipment purchase\nIn September 2016, Sichuan Xinda Enterprise Group Co., Ltd. ( Sichuan Xinda\u201d) entered into equipment purchase contracts with Harbin Hailezi Science and Technology Co., Ltd. ( Hailezi\u201d) for a consideration of RMB17.0 million (equivalent to US$2.6 million) to purchase storage facility and testing equipment. Afterward, Sichuan Xinda cancelled two contracts with Hailezi for a consideration of RMB1.6 million (equivalent to US$0.2 million). As of December 31, 2020, Sichuan Xinda has a remaining commitment of RMB3.0 million (equivalent to US$0.5 million).\nOn October 20, 2016, Sichuan Xinda entered into an equipment purchase agreement purchase contract with Peaceful Treasure Limited ( Peaceful\u201d) for a total consideration of RMB89.5 million (equivalent to US$13.7 million) to purchase certain production and testing equipment.

2019, mainly for purchase of property, plant and equipment.\n\n- The company had short-term and long-term debt totaling $1.37 billion as of December 31, 2020 to support operations and investing activities. \n\n- The COVID-19 pandemic negatively impacted operations, especially at the Dubai facility which shut down in early 2020. This led to the $165.3 million impairment charge.\n\nIn summary, the company experienced declining revenues, lower profitability, and significant losses in 2020 largely due to the effects of COVID-19. Cash flow remained constrained due to high capital spending and debt load. The Dubai facility impairment indicates challenges in the company's overseas expansion strategy."}
